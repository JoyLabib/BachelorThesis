0,8 Little Things That Make Remote Work More Efficient for Everyone,"Apr 23, 2024",Artis Rozentals,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/8-ways-to-make-remote-work-more-efficient-for-everyone/472694,"
For the first time since we were all forcefully thrown into remote work in 2020, it finally feels like the debate surrounding it is settling down.Companies that wanted their teams back in the office have enacted relevant policies. Meanwhile, employees enamored with remote work have lots of options, with vacancies offering just that. Also, many workplaces have adopted hybrid ways of working to get the best of both worlds, with studies reporting more than half of working Americans having the opportunity to work remotely at least once a week.That means that for a majority of employees, remote work remains a core part of their day-to-day life because, even when you work fully in-person if you have a colleague joining from home, you inevitably get sucked into a remote work dynamic. For many, this continues to be a challenge — remote work has its own specifics regarding communication, collaboration and general etiquette, which don't come naturally to everyone.



So here are eight little things anyone can do to improve their remote work experience and that of their colleagues.Related: I Live in Hotels Full Time. It Works Out Cheaper Than Renting and I Haven't Changed My Sheets in 3 Years.


1. Make your availability knownAre you out for lunch? Picking up kids from school? Do you have irregular working hours? While remote work's flexibility is one of its best features, ensure your team is informed about when you'll be in work mode to avoid misunderstandings, missed messages and schedule clashes.For instance, if you start work later, it may be wise to indicate that somewhere so early birds know not to expect your input in the initial hours of the morning. This can be as simple as a relevant emoji on your Slack profile or a quick update at a weekly meeting.2. Document processesSince much remote work collaboration is asynchronous, try to document processes, decisions, and strategies so that anyone in the team can find their footing at any time. If you don't, there's a risk of confusion and repetition — teammates might miss updates, and managers might grow tired of explaining the same things to everyone individually to get people on the same page.If you haven't yet, one good practice to adopt is to send out meeting summaries and make a habit of it for other informal important discussions, too.


3. Don't forget about timezonesAmericans may be accustomed to time differences between coasts, but with the rise of remote work, your team may have added some international talent. Emilia from Finland won't be available for your afternoon catch-up because her day ended hours ago — and unless it's been previously agreed upon, you shouldn't expect her to be.Related: The Most Common Work From Home Problems -- Solved!4. Use the same software and tools as your colleaguesTo avoid constantly converting documents, downloading new software, or getting into protracted arguments about which tool is best, you must agree on a single set of tools that will be used company-wide. Larger enterprises typically already have an established tech stack, and smaller companies should follow suit.Remote work and communication necessitate a variety of technologies for collaboration, work, and management. If everyone starts using whatever they like, it'll sow frustration, impair cybersecurity and leave information scattered.


5. Don't browse social media during meetingsThat's it — that's the whole tip. You know it's counterproductive and affects the overall quality of the meeting and your information retention capacity. Will you stop doing it after reading this? Let's be real — probably not.So here's a pro tip and a fun read: to avoid getting into hot water, take off your glasses when you scroll social media during a conference meeting.6. Avoid common video conferencing issuesMute your microphone when you're not talking, test your connection and tech beforehand, show up on time, turn on your camera, be presentable and ensure your background is as well. By now, we all know these video conferencing best practices, but very few people take the time to practice them. As a result, it's extremely common for calls to get disrupted by basic tech issues, sowing frustration and impeding communication.7. Respect different working stylesEveryone has their own ways of working that suit them best. Some people are gifted multi-taskers who want to know everything that's going on and be constantly in the loop. Others thrive in deep work, and a single distraction can reduce their productivity.


Accordingly, while the former will be happy to receive a Slack message and engage in discussion, the latter may find it irritating and disruptive. Some people will be happy to jump into a quick meeting to get on the same page, whereas others would prefer an email.Respecting how others operate can maximize each individual's productivity. To do so, all you need to do is discuss it with colleagues.Related: How to Navigate Generational Differences and Hybrid Challenges in the Workplace8. Regularly celebrate winsIt's no secret that remote workers struggle with loneliness. One of the chief arguments against remote and hybrid work is that it hampers team bonding and the development of a healthy company culture.


But this isn't an inherent problem with remote work. Rather, fostering camaraderie and a healthy work environment demands more active effort in a remote setting than an in-person one. By putting in the effort, you can overcome the challenges of feeling and experiencing the realities of isolation.A great place to start is celebrating wins — develop a shared virtual ritual that involves the entire team and helps people connect.These eight tips will significantly boost your team's efficiency. But remember that for them to be effective, they need to become foundational to your operation. It's not a one-and-done kind of thing but rather an ongoing collective effort to improve everyone's working environment.

1,Successful Businesses Have This One Thing in Common,"Apr 23, 2024",Wiljeana Glover,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/successful-businesses-have-this-one-thing-in-common/472059,"
High-performing startups often feature strong founding teams that combine business-minded generalists and technical-expert specialists. The mythic founder who does it all is rare for good reason. The skill set that makes someone a top-notch developer or scientist isn't the same skill set it takes to raise capital and coordinate business operations.The best partnerships pave the way for innovation and success. But partnerships can go wrong if business promises outstrip technical realities. Think of Theranos, the fraudulent blood-testing startup where claims to the public and investors never aligned with what the product could actually do.As the founding faculty director of the Kerry Murphy Healey Center for Health Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Babson College, I often assist healthcare experts looking for business partners to push new ideas to market. Research I've done with Babson colleagues Candida Brush and Alia Crocker suggests interdisciplinary teams are most likely to have the knowledge required for a successful venture.



Here are three strategies to build and scale successful partnerships and companies.Related: Want to Grow Your Business? Here's Why You Need Strategic Partnerships to Succeed.


Find the right person by setting clear expectationsInnovators looking to launch a product and business professionals looking for their next startup don't always share the same aims. When you meet a prospective co-founder, be upfront about your economic and mission-driven motivations and ask them to do the same. Check that you're on the same timeline. How fast do each of you want to move? If one person is eager to go to market and the other wants to slow down, you'll encounter serious problems.Verify whether you share the same ethical approach about not cutting corners to make the next milestone, and make sure to discuss roles. In healthcare startups, for example, some scientists prefer to be silent partners rather than a prominent part of the business. So ask your potential co-founder: How involved do you want to be in the company?Partnerships require compatibility, even as they flourish because each person brings different strengths to the relationship. Don't feel pressured to immediately settle down. If your prospective partner doesn't share your expectations, keep searching. Being up front early can save you and your team from disappointment and financial losses down the road.You have options. Co-founder matching platforms such as Y-Combinator, Co-Founders Lab and others offer ways to connect. There are also specialist matching programs for particular industries. MassVX, founded by Vinit Nijhawan, serial entrepreneur and managing director of MassVentures, connects doctors and other scientific experts with entrepreneurs who have experience raising capital and running a business.


Related: What to Look For — And Watch Out For — When Selecting Partners to Fuel Your Brand's SuccessCreate a common languageEven before vetting partners, business-oriented entrepreneurs should become conversant in the field they're exploring. You don't have to be as knowledgeable as the technical expert on the innovation itself; that's why you're teaming up. But you should know the field well enough to discuss its potential. You can't position your company to succeed if you don't understand what your product does and why it's better than existing solutions.If you're entering the healthcare industry, for example, you might attend relevant medical conferences and follow scientific discoveries. If you're wading into the gaming industry, you might attend gaming events, read industry reports and listen to leading podcasts. In 2024, every technical field features a wide range of accessible options to learn more.At the same time, you'll want to find a technical partner who is open to understanding the business side. Before teaming up, you should offer a baseline explanation of your anticipated revenue model, customer base and market size. Are you a B2B company pitching a few large clients? Or a B2C organization that relies on individual consumer buy-in?


Once you find an expert who shares your language, keep the conversation going throughout the partnership. Reserve time for regular updates on how the product is progressing. Genuine curiosity from entrepreneurs makes technical experts feel understood, and helps you better do your job. You won't be tempted to fluff over the details when pitching to investors — a tactic that could eventually catch up with you.Don't let these meetings become one-sided. You should keep your partner apprised of business progress. Teams only succeed when partners understand and build off each other's expertise in the pursuit of a common mission.Related: Most Business Partnerships Fail — 5 Hacks to Make Sure Yours Stays IntactDevelop shared measures of successYou and your co-founder should track progress together. That initial agreement on expectations will be your North Star when setting product and financial milestones.


As an entrepreneur, you're responsible for making sure that fundraising doesn't outstrip results. If you go to series B and C and you're not keeping track of product development, eventually that omission comes to a head. For example, a 2022 study led by researchers at investment firm Rock Health and Johns Hopkins University found that 44% of digital health startups had no clinical trials or regulatory filings to stand on.You should also help technical experts understand financial measures of success like revenue and customer win rate. Sometimes an engineer or scientist might feel like the businessperson is pushing the timeline too fast. Listen to those concerns. If you disagree, explain how your approach contributes to your organization's goals.Profit and purpose can go together when entrepreneurs and technical experts are on the same page. That isn't always easy. Making these relationships work is an art. By setting expectations up front, communicating clearly and working toward shared measures of success, your partnership will reap rewards both for you and your business.

2,They Designed One Simple Product With a 'Focus on Human Health' — and Made $40 Million Last Year,"Apr 18, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/simple-health-focused-product-led-to-40m-in-revenue-in-2023/472859,"
Branch Basics founders Marilee Nelson, Allison Evans and Kelly Love ""never set out to sell soap,"" let alone launch a cleaning brand that would generate tens of millions in annual sales.But the company's ""mission to create healthy homes"" while keeping cleaning routines simple continues to resonate with customers — 50% of whom are returning, according to the brand. Among other select accessories, Branch Basics offers a comprehensive ""starter kit,"" which features a fragrance-free, ""plant- and mineral-based"" cleaning concentrate along with various glass bottles that can be filled with different combinations of the solution and water to meet specific needs: from wiping down a bathroom counter to doing a load of laundry.Image Credit: Courtesy of Branch Basics. Marilee Nelson, left; Allison Evans, center; Kelly Love, right.



The story of how the company came to be begins with Nelson, who, after battling chronic illness, was told that she'd never have kids and needed to go on dialysis. Nelson wasn't sold on the prognosis and turned to another doctor who used ""food as medicine"" — a leap of faith that ""literally changed her life,"" eradicating those health issues and even inspiring her to become a medicinal cook. Later, after her 10-year-old son was exposed to pesticides and suffered brain and immune system damage, she took another hard look at environmental factors that might contribute to healing.""His immune system had been so damaged that he could not detoxify the things we're all exposed to every day,"" Nelson says, ""and he would have extreme reactions. I took one box and thought, Oh, I'll keep my favorite perfumes in here, favorite skincare products and things, in the closet, and when he gets better, I will bring them back out."" However, according to Nelson, the box's removal made such a significant difference that it showed her ""how important it is to [recognize] how powerful these chemicals are."" Nelson's son started to heal, and when word of mouth spread, she developed a course to help other people better understand the products in their homes.


Related: How This Pediatrician-Turned-Entrepreneur Transformed a Health Policy into a Consumer Product for Kids""Of course, the type of fuel we put in our bodies matters for how we feel.""Nelson's niece, Allison, had a similar experience. Diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, Evans was told by doctors that ""no lifestyle change"" could help her heal and to take birth control indefinitely; in college, she faced a range of symptoms — muscle aches, loss of motor skills and more — and says she was prescribed numerous medications to no avail. At the time, Evans and her aunt Marilee weren't particularly close, but she consulted with her and realized that some simple lifestyle changes just might help her feel better.According to Evans, removing certain products with synthetic ingredients and eating whole foods did help her condition improve, and as graduation neared, she decided to spend eight weeks with Nelson in the Texas Hill Country, where she'd learn more about healthy living from her aunt. Her friend Kelly joined her, and despite being in good health, also noticed a transformation — ""My dry itchy eyes, headaches, muscle aches are all gone,"" Love recalls, adding, ""the more I learned about all this, it just made sense to me: Of course, the type of fuel we put in our bodies matters for how we feel, how we think, how we act.""

This Startup Has a Solution.So, in 2012, the three women teamed up to launch Branch Basics, the cult-favorite cleaning brand known for its multipurpose concentrate.Image Credit: Courtesy of Branch BasicsAlthough Cleveland Clinic reports that most household cleaning products on the market ""are reasonably safe when used as directed,"" many cleaning supplies or household products can ""irritate the eyes or throat, or cause headaches and other health problems,"" particularly if they release volatile compounds (VOCs), which vaporize at room temperature, per the American Lung Association. The organization also notes that even naturally occurring fragrances, such as citrus, ""can react to produce dangerous pollutants indoors.""


""Nontoxic"" labels on products aren't the be-all and end-all either, Nelson notes. After all, ""it's the dose that makes the poison,"" as the Swiss physician and chemist Paracelsus said nearly 500 years ago. According to Nelson, looking at the ingredients themselves is key. The founders want people to feel empowered to examine any product — from Branch Basics or another company — and understand the ingredients being used. To that end, they offer a $99 ""Toss the Toxins"" course to ""walk you through a step-by-step process to remove products that pollute your home and body.""Related: Go Green Or Go Home: 3 Ways Industrial Facilities Can Clean Up Their Acts""Our 32-ounce liquid concentrate cleans your windows, cleans your baby's bottom, cleans your produce.""Branch Basics' ""minimalist"" product line is meant to make the whole process easier — and save time. ""We chose to use our products as a vehicle for our mission,"" Nelson says, ""so we came out with a concentrate that can replace literally every laundry [and] cleaning product in the house. It's so safe it can be used on the skin.""


""Our 32-ounce liquid concentrate cleans your windows, cleans your baby's bottom, cleans your produce, takes off your eye makeup, cleans your countertops [or] your hardwood floors — whatever depending on the the ratio,"" Evans adds.The approach is resonating with customers, the company reports. Gross sales grew around 42% year over year from 2022 to 2023, with revenue hitting $40 million last year. The company currently has more than 50,000 product subscribers, 600,000 email subscribers and 10,000 five-star reviews on its concentrate and Oxygen Boost, which amplifies the power of the concentrate ""for tough cleaning jobs.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Branch Basics""We know that human health is our priority... [that] keeps everything aligned.""The company's laser-focused commitment to its customers — it reportedly responds to every single customer question on Instagram and TikTok — no doubt fosters a lot of that brand loyalty. What's more, Branch Basics boasts a 6% referral rate compared to the industry's 2% average.""We approach everything [by asking] What do we want?"" Love says. ""What's missing in the market? What do we, as people who are moms, as people who are health-conscious, need and want? Because, most likely, other people would need and want those things, too. We know that human health is our priority, so when we formulate products or make our marketing plans, [that] keeps everything aligned.""This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

3,The Simple Thing That the Owners of This Pizza Spot Do Every Day That Put Them on Yelp's Top 100 List Three Years in a Row,"Apr 18, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-secret-sauce-of-this-pizza-spots-success/472903,"
When the Farrugio family opened il Canale in Washington, D.C. in 2010, their goal was to make the best pizza in the world.Giuseppe Farrugio, who's known as Joe, immigrated to the United States in the 1970s and has been working in the pizza business ever since. Having owned and worked at several Italian-American spots, he saw il Canale as his opportunity to provide a more authentic, Neapolitan-style experience to D.C. diners while working alongside his son, Alessandro. Listen to the Behind the Review episode below to hear directly from Alessandro and Sydney and learn their recipe for success.The Secret SauceThe Farrugio family knew a key part of achieving their goal was sourcing quality ingredients. Il Canale's flour, tomato sauce, and mozzarella are all organic and imported directly from Italy.



Beyond good food, the restaurant offers a warm environment and quick service, making for a high-quality dining experience. Despite serving thousands of people each week, the Farrugio family and their staff make sure to personally greet and check in on their diners throughout the meal. This is part of what makes the il Canale experience so special for Yelp Elite and Community Manager Sydney G.""There's always a member of the family to greet you,"" she said. ""I've been for dinner, lunch, and happy hour, so I feel like I've gotten a really good experience across the board of the different service options. They do a great job of walking you through the menu.""


Related: The Little Coffee Shop That Asks Customers Not to Be QuietManaging a team of hundreds of employees isn't easy. Co-owner and general manager Alessandro has found success by focusing on thorough training, thoughtful hiring, and achieving work-life balance. He makes sure to not only support his staff with key resources while they're on the clock but also to hire enough people to give both himself and his team the time off they need to recharge.""We just try to [be] a family. We try to be supportive. The biggest challenge is having such a large team and having every single person follow your vision, follow your path, follow the requests that you make. But it's just [about] providing the tools, providing the resources.""Related: How This California Hot Spot Grew From Delivery-Only to Pop-Up Shop to Storefront


Another one of Alessandro's strengths as a business owner is that he's always willing to try new things. When he noticed some diners weren't just looking for a pizza place but for a full-service Italian restaurant, he added new items, including gluten-free pastas and premium Italian wines, to the menu. This has allowed the restaurant to attract a wider clientele that includes locals and tourists alike.""It's nice when you have a big table. A few guests are gluten free, a few guests are not, maybe [some are] vegetarian or vegan, and everybody looks on their menu and they find something that they like,"" he said.Il Canale is also not afraid to find new ways of connecting with customers. Sydney admires the restaurant's eagerness to use a variety of marketing tools, including Yelp products and resources, social media campaigns, and conversations with as many guests as they can.""One of the ways you stay successful is to just never stop innovating and trying new things,"" Sydney said. ""If it doesn't work, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't try something else, because you never know what is going to reach somebody.""


Along with using paid features like Yelp Connect to share custom posts and photos with his customers, Alessandro uses Yelp reviews to keep a pulse on his business. With the Yelp for Business app on his phone, he receives a stream of notifications that alert him to any issues and give him a confidence boost when he gets positive feedback.Reviews paint the most accurate and current picture of a business, helping both owners and future customers make informed decisions. Even when you're visiting a restaurant like il Canale, which has thousands of reviews, adding your voice to the conversation is a valuable way to contribute to the Yelp community.""Things change over the years,"" Sydney said. ""Businesses evolve, menu items change, service turns over, especially how things work pre-pandemic to now. So you really want to make sure that you're giving people the most up-to-date information based on your experience.""Although Alessandro enjoys getting an overview of his restaurant's performance through reviews, he also makes an effort to check in with diners during their experience to make sure everything is to their liking.


For the customer's part, Sydney recommends diners speak up while they're in the restaurant so staff can address issues right away. Mix-ups are not uncommon in the restaurant world, and providing in-the-moment feedback can be incredibly rewarding for both the diner and the restaurant. For example, Sydney mentioned in her review that she received the wrong dessert. While she didn't bring this up to il Canale staff because it didn't have a huge impact on her experience, she wishes she had.""They take service so seriously. I know they would have rectified it and made it right with us. I kind of robbed them of that opportunity by not saying something. People are human and there [are] plenty of ways to bring it up without being rude and give them the opportunity to fix it so that everybody walks away having a positive experience.""Related: The Owners of This Texas Farmers Market Took a Big Gamble. Here's How It Paid Off Bigger Than They Dreamed.By focusing on quality food, service, and marketing, il Canale has earned a spot on three Yelp Top 100 lists over the last three years. Most recently, the restaurant achieved #14 on the Top Pizza Spots list, which is voted on by Yelp Elites. These accolades encourage Alessandro to keep thinking about how he can elevate his offerings.


""It sets our bar higher because we know the next year we need to do something better. Il Canale five years ago, six years ago, seven years ago is not the il Canale today. We're continuously evolving, continuously getting better, continuously increasing our standards.""In addition to investing in quality food and service, il Canale believes in:Staying on top of customer trends and requests. Modifying your offerings based on guests' needs and desires is key to growing your customer base.Engaging with customers online. Whether you're using specific marketing features like Yelp Connect or responding to reviews, the internet is a great place to find your target audience and encourage repeat visits.Maintaining a work-life balance. When you and your staff have enough time off to stay healthy and recharge, you can avoid burnout and achieve top-tier service on a regular basis.Subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.

4,Successful Brands Use These 4 Radical Practices to Attract Loyal Customers,"Apr 17, 2024",Adam Kroener,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-successful-brands-should-embrace-radical-transparency/472395,"
In today's marketplace, consumer trust has become paramount for businesses seeking lasting success. A study by Edelman found that 81% of buyers cite brand trust as a deciding factor in their loyalties and purchasing behaviors. With the proliferation of information sources, companies can no longer maintain opaque practices obscuring key details. They must operate in full transparency to earn customer confidence and allegiance.As the CEO of Carbliss, an alcoholic beverage brand, I've witnessed firsthand how radical transparency around all production and business operations drives powerful consumer loyalty and business growth. From our earliest days, we committed to an unwavering open-book approach that has helped cement valuable, long-lasting relationships with our customer base. Below are the four criteria and best practices we prioritize to maintain transparency and customer loyalty.1. Hands-on customer dialogueToday's empowered consumers can easily see right through that disingenuous smokescreen. What they crave from the brands they embrace is true candor about every key aspect, including the ingredients, sourcing practices, pricing rationale, regulatory challenges, and more underpinning the products they consume.



One key way I nurture this culture of authenticity is by being directly involved with a huge volume of customer inquiries myself. This past year alone, I answered around 8,000 emails from Carbliss distributors, retailers, consumers and fans.Ongoing candid dialogue is critical for comprehensively understanding how customers perceive our brand identity, product qualities, and customer service experiences in an unfiltered way.


Through raw, unapologetic honesty in these interactions, even when the facts may be unfavorable or unpleasant for the customer to accept, we actively cultivate invaluable trust. The simple truth is that you cannot build enduring customer loyalty through automated and impersonal responses or convoluted corporate jargon.Related: Don't Talk to Another Customer Until You Learn This Simple Customer Service Secret2. Shining light on complexitiesEmbracing this level of radical transparency means being prepared sometimes to face intense scrutiny from confused, perhaps deflated customers seeking simpler truths. We've found that the payoff is an extraordinarily powerful brand reputation anchored in truth that ultimately breeds sacred trust and loyalty.At my company, we willingly spotlight the very details that other brands may conceal or try to downplay, like our need to use ""artificially colored"" labels on cans despite the colors being derived from natural sources, like the brilliant blue of butterfly pea flowers.


We take every opportunity to explain the nuances of regulatory complexities that result in obligatory technical labeling jargon. We balance that by reaffirming our core principles of prioritizing high-quality ingredients that we legitimately consume ourselves and provide to friends and family without hesitation.3. A culture of authenticityAs you grow and scale, it's important to maintain transparency throughout your team. This can be in the form of understanding the intricacies of the product, the runway to profitability, or the purpose of their unique role in the overall strategy. Our employees, regardless of role, deeply understand the ingredients, sourcing, and production methods behind our products so they can convey that knowledge accurately and credibly in their customer-interactions activities.Our detailed FAQ content clarifies common misconceptions, from our avoidance of artificial colors to our premium pricing rationale based on operational costs and premium product positioning. While some buyers may be dismayed at certain realities we present, we insist on honesty because we've learned it's the only path to fostering long-term customer understanding, respect and allegiance.Related: How to Lead With Authenticity and Build a Thriving Workplace


4. Transparent best practicesFor companies in any industry aspiring to foster powerful brand loyalty by operating in total transparency, below are my personal principles:Be unconditionally open about all business practices by prioritizing clear, forthright communication with customers at every opportunityHave customer-interaction teams be prepared to personally respond to every inquiry with unvarnished candor, excluding no unpleasant truthsThoroughly educate and train all employees on the paramount importance of authenticity in all their customer-interaction words and actions.Embrace both positive and negative customer feedback as a welcome opportunity to demonstrate a real commitment to constant improvement.Ensure all marketing content and messaging accurately reflects the true nature of your products, services, and practices without ambiguity.Be unafraid to openly discuss your company's genuine challenges, as this humanizes the brand relationship.Related: 5 Examples of Companies Succeeding Through TransparencyWeathering backlash to cultivate loyaltyCertainly, this radical embrace of transparency sometimes means facing backlash from those who are displeased with newly revealed information that clashes with their expectations. Cultivated ironclad trust and loyalty far outweigh any short-term friction. When you deal truthfully and withhold nothing from your customers, you attract buyers aligned with your values who appreciate your courage and unwavering integrity.If you're ready to foster true customer loyalty and propel sustainable growth, it's time to embrace radical transparency across your organization. Don't complicate realities; shine a light on every aspect of your products, operations, and business practices. Deal in truth relentlessly, even when facing scrutiny. Your authentic soul and unwavering integrity will attract devoted brand advocates aligned with your values.

6,"When Customers Balked at High Prices, This Bubble Tea Maker Educated Them About Quality Ingredients. Now His Flea Market Stand Has Turned Into 3 Permanent Locations.","Apr 15, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-his-company-grew-from-a-flea-market-stand-to-3-locations/472688,"
Mathew Wong, owner of Tea and Milk, initially struggled to meet high costs and customer demand when building his New York City bubble tea business. But by educating his customers and providing quality products, he transformed a single shop into a well-known, values-based brand.The shop's original 10-by-10-foot space at the Long Island Flea Market has given way to three permanent locations across New York City, including storefronts in Chelsea Market, Brooklyn, and Astoria. In the process, Mathew built out a centralized kitchen for sandwich making, an event catering service, and a huge community of boba lovers.Related: The Counter Service at Yo' Mama's Is Just As Unique As Its Name. Here's Why People Come Back for the Experience as Much as the Food.



One of the biggest keys to success for Tea and Milk is their focus on integrity. Mathew and his business partners travel to Asia to source and learn more about their ingredients, visiting tea farms to learn about everything from the tea-making and manufacturing process to the ceremonies that celebrate the cultural role of the ancient drink. Mathew then uses his travel experiences to educate his customers about the products so they feel good about their purchases.Even though Mathew and his team believe in the importance of well-sourced ingredients, the right tea leaves can be quite expensive, and they've had to learn to work around the rising cost of goods.


Mathew reads all of Tea and Milk's financial statements to keep up with margins. His background in accounting has taught him that even though it can be overwhelming to face discouraging numbers head-on, it's crucial to understand how your business is performing so you can make necessary adjustments.""[If] you're reading a [profit and loss statement] and it's scaring you, it's very likely because you're not doing something that you need to do, such as marketing, educating the customers, training your staff,"" Mathew said. ""You need to have standard operating procedures in order to push forward. There's no other way around it.""Related: The Little Coffee Shop That Asks Customers Not to Be QuietIn terms of educating customers, one of Tea and Milk's biggest obstacles is that customers often aren't used to the taste of premium ingredients, so the more they know about the product, the more likely they'll be satisfied with their purchase. This goes hand in hand with getting to know customers' preferences as well.


""We want [customers] to trust the brand,"" Mathew said. ""So [when you] order something that you didn't like, you get something else that you do like. Then you build trust with that person, and eventually, maybe [they'll] try it again.""Despite the challenges that using authentic ingredients has posed, Mathew sees his products as a worthwhile investment. He has situated his shops intentionally across the city to fill gaps in bubble tea offerings in several New York neighborhoods.""We go into neighborhoods that we believe are starving for a certain type of brand. We saw Bay Ridge (Brooklyn), we saw what it was lacking, and we wanted to go in there to be the brand that can offer something different.""He encourages customers to support the local businesses in their neighborhood however they can. If you're not able to spend money at a local spot you enjoy, writing a review or telling your friends to visit can have a lasting impact.


""If you want the business to stay, you have to help support in a way,"" Mathew said.Mathew is a big believer in the power of acknowledging and engaging with customer feedback. While critical reviews can sting, he makes sure to respond to as many as he can to show that he cares about his customers, commenting back in a timely manner while giving himself room to cool off if he needs it.He also encourages business owners to lean on friends and partners for support. Having started Tea and Milk with two of his friends and now operating the business with a co-owner and general manager, Mathew finds it invaluable to have people to brainstorm with about new ideas and improvements. He has also built a network of other small business owners for conversations about business challenges and potential collaborations.Related: How This California Hot Spot Grew From Delivery-Only to Pop-Up Shop to Storefront


""There's always going to be times where people don't agree. But at the end of the day, you have to be very open to these conversations,"" Mathew said. ""The type of people who want to be in your ecosystem will always be there.""In addition to the importance of authentic ingredients and products, Tea and Milk believes in:Staying on top of your schedule and finances. While it can be stressful, looking at the bigger picture and being proactive can help you navigate your business through unexpected challenges.Leaning on fellow entrepreneurs for support. It's important to find and have the right people in your corner when thinking about how to expand and improve.Keeping your eye on the prize.

7,Everyone Talks About Mentors. But What About Sponsors? Here's How They Differ — and Why You Need Both,"Apr 11, 2024",Summit Ghimire,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/everyone-talks-about-mentors-but-what-about-sponsors/471455,"
Mentorship can be a buzzword in the business world, but it is not always carried out effectively. Too often, mentorship turns into glorified networking or infrequent meetings for a quick coffee. Recently, the idea of sponsorship — intentionally advocating for one's mentees — has been added to the conversation to help businesses focus on developing and promoting employees to develop strong, diverse teams.Sponsorship and mentorship are different from one another, but they should not be carried out in isolation. Within a business, the only truly effective way to implement these processes is to see them as two parts of a cycle that should repeat continually. For this to happen, those in leadership roles must incorporate a deliberate approach that aims at continual development.Related: How Mentorship Programs Can Lift Underrepresented Employees In The Workplace



Mentorship that aims at sponsorshipTo mentor their employees effectively, mentors must develop specific goals for their employees' professional growth. To develop these goals, they need to be on the lookout for two key areas of development: strengths and gaps.Identify strengths: Identifying strengths in your mentees means working with them closely to discover their experience, abilities and passions. These strengths aren't limited to knowledge in their field but could include personality traits such as leadership skills, the ability to learn quickly or an interest in a particular role or area.Identify gaps: For mentorship to be a continuous, effective process, consider what your mentees still need to learn to move forward. They may have knowledge gaps that require further training, or perhaps they have the knowledge for new roles but lack the skills to lead a team or communicate effectively with clients. Consider how you can assign stretch projects that provide an environment for them to ask questions, discover new abilities and feel supported in a new setting.What it is not: Mentorship is not just networking or turning an employee into an assistant. Effective mentorship looks forward to sponsorship, equipping employees to grow within your company.Related: How Mentorship Programs Can Create A Culture Of Continuous Learning In The Workplace


Strategic sponsorshipSponsoring employees internally means deliberately drawing on the knowledge gained through the mentorship process to put employees forward for new roles and responsibilities. This requires flexibility and willingness to repeat the cycle continuously.Flexibility: As a mentee's knowledge and abilities grow, so should their role and recognition. Being willing to change or develop someone's role within the company allows you to place employees in roles where they will contribute most effectively to your business and gain the most satisfaction.Continual mentoring: Employees should never be promoted and then left to figure it out alone. Once a mentee has been sponsored for a new role, they will have new strengths and gaps that require development and training. This may even mean equipping them to be mentors in turn.What it is not: Sponsorship is not adding more responsibility to an employee's plate without the proper promotion or redefinition of their role. To create a healthy team atmosphere, employees who have grown enough to take on new roles must feel that their growth is being formally recognized and celebrated.Repeating the cycleWhile mentorship and sponsorship may sound like one-on-one experiences, when combined, these processes can propel the growth of a whole team simultaneously. We've seen this growth at Outpace regularly. A while ago, we hired a new SEO specialist; let's call him John. I soon identified two of John's key strengths: his ability to learn extremely quickly and his previous experience. I began mentoring him and training him on our internal processes, how we run our SEO meetings, and more. I brought his potential to the attention of our executives, and within six months, we promoted him to lead the SEO team. I continue to mentor him as a leader in his new position.Our process doesn't stop there. John quickly realized that Jane, a member of his SEO team, was contributing above and beyond her current role. He now mentors her to handle SEO quality assurance in a role that recognizes the full potential of her contributions at Outpace. These are just two examples of how mentorship and sponsorship can have a trickle-down effect and empower team leads to become mentors and sponsors themselves.Related: How Expert Mentoring Fuels Startup Success


Individual relationships: Team benefitsClearly, mentorship and sponsorship affect the whole workplace, not just individual employees. When employees see potential for their professional development at their current company, their job satisfaction increases. Rather than making employees feel overworked, this cycle provides them with opportunities and recognition. This helps to increase employee retention since employees don't have to look elsewhere to feel like they're making progress. One of the key benefits of mentoring and sponsoring employees is that they also become strong leaders and mentors. This allows the process to repeat itself with new employees. Over time, mentorship and sponsorship form strong businesses where interconnected teams continually grow and advocate for their colleagues.

8,How to Overtake Your Competition With Creative Brand Precision,"Apr 10, 2024",Bora Celik,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/disruption-through-design-how-brands-can-beat-out-their/471347,"
What do you do when every shelf and screen overflows with options? Your brand needs to do more than show up; it must shine. Exceptional design is a significant way to shine. It goes beyond colors and logos to become a story, a feeling, a memorable moment. More than aesthetics, it's about wielding design as a strategic tool to cut through the noise and as a deliberate strategy to disrupt the status quo.My first startup, Jukely, excelled in design. My co-founder was an incredible designer, one of the first designers at Kickstarter. Through his design vision, we kickstarted a movement by innovating in a stale space and created the world's first concert subscription service. Our product was featured as one of the best apps multiple times in Apple's app store, which gave us credibility.At the core of this exploration is a belief in the power of design to alter perceptions. In this article, I explore how challenger brands can stand out through striking design and how they draw a clear line between them and the incumbents.



Related: 4 Ways Brands Can Educate Their Customers and Win HeartsStanding out: The real dealNavigating the crowded marketplace today is like finding your voice in a roaring concert. Every brand is vying for attention, hoping to leave a lasting impression. This challenge requires more than just traditional advertising or a flashy logo. It demands a strategic approach to design — a method that intertwines aesthetics with function, creating an experience that resonates deeply with consumers.


The essence of standing out lies in the ability to merge visual appeal with storytelling, ensuring that every interaction with the brand is not just seen but felt. This approach transforms casual browsers into loyal customers, encouraging them to choose your brand amidst a sea of options. Design, in this context, acts as the silent ambassador of your brand, speaking volumes without uttering a single word.Keep it simpleToday's consumer is bombarded with choices, making the decision-making process increasingly complex. In this chaos, simplicity becomes a beacon of clarity and assurance. Brands that master the art of distilling their message into clean, innovative design capture attention and earn trust.Ritual demonstrates this beautifully by stripping away the unnecessary and focusing on what matters. By introducing a clear, minimalist bottle that showcases its equally transparent capsules, Ritual invites consumers into a visual and physical experience of openness and honesty. Their minimalist packaging is a testament to their philosophy, highlighting the quality and thoughtfulness of what's inside. It's a bold statement in an industry often cluttered with claims and counterclaims, providing a clear, unambiguous message about the brand's values and commitment to transparency. This simplicity extends to the user experience, making the journey from discovery to purchase seamless and straightforward.Related: Why Brands are Simplifying Their Logos and Visual Identity


Connecting on a deeper levelThe power of design transcends mere aesthetics; it has the potential to evoke feelings and forge emotional connections. When a product transcends its utility and becomes a part of the consumer's identity, it has achieved something remarkable. Brightland's approach to olive oil packaging illustrates this perfectly.By engaging artists to create visually stunning labels, they turn each bottle into a collector's item, a token of beauty that stands out in the monotony of kitchen staples. Each bottle becomes a conversation piece, a medium through which consumers share their tastes and values. I've seen numerous reviews where the reviewer was attracted to the brand based on how the bottles would look in their kitchen. This deeper connection is what transforms first-time buyers into brand evangelists, creating a community of users who don't just use the product but love and advocate for it.Related: How to Design an Eye-Catching Website That Truly Captures Your AudienceStorytime through designA well-crafted design does more than please the eye; it serves as a window into the soul of the brand, inviting consumers into a narrative that captivates and enchants. Onyx Coffee's award-winning packaging is a masterclass in this art of storytelling. Each bag is meticulously designed to hint at the unique story of its origin, processing method, and flavor profile. This narrative approach transforms the act of purchasing coffee into an exploratory adventure, inviting consumers to experience the journey from farm to cup. The packaging serves as a prelude to the product itself, setting expectations and building anticipation.


This level of engagement ensures that Onyx doesn't just sell coffee; it offers an immersive experience that begins at the point of sale and continues to the last sip. It's a testament to how thoughtful design can elevate a brand, turning everyday transactions into meaningful interactions.The lesson here? When brands get bold with design, they lay out their ethos for the world to see. And in a market crowded with choices, this courage to be different paints the future of how we connect with what we buy. Looking ahead, it's the brands that embrace this blend of innovation and authenticity that will lead the pack, turning everyday choices into gateways of discovery.

9,You Need a Community With Shared Values to Find Long-Term Success — Here's How to Cultivate It.,"Apr 6, 2024",Megan Thudium,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/everyone-wants-long-term-success-heres-how-to-find-it/470976,"
Don't underestimate the possibilities of growing a purpose-led community. It's one of the most influential tools in the entrepreneur's toolkit to help guide your business toward longevity and long-term happiness.Because let's be honest — no one wants to be unhappy in their business. In this article, you will learn the importance of building a community of shared purpose and how it impacts the continued success of your business.Entrepreneurial success sits at the heart of purposeI would like to see more purpose-led businesses being built in the world.



Purpose-led businesses are run by entrepreneurs who lead from the heart and with the conviction that their business is doing good in the world. The business solves an important problem — maybe one that is societal or environmental. Purpose-led businesses aren't driven solely by profit but by the change the entrepreneur wants to see in the world.Surprisingly, my entrepreneurial journey didn't start with purpose. It began with the idea of starting a marketing agency and solving complex marketing problems. But as my business grew, I became less driven by profit and success. Over time, my main driver became purpose, or the value that I want to bring to the world. It doesn't matter where you are on your business journey. You can take the alternative path and refocus your business on purpose.


Building a community of shared purpose-driven entrepreneurs helped me forge this path of success. It was their inspiration, advice, and support in tough times that got me to five years in business. Remember, 2 in 10 businesses fail in the first year of operating. If you're past this point, you're thriving!When you forge a community of shared interests, you see more business projects aligned with your values, better collaboration opportunities and new service verticals emerging. Don't underestimate the power of collaboration and aligning with other business leaders on purpose. Nurturing this community is a successful ingredient to business growth — equally compared to organizational, marketing and sales tactics.Related: Why a Purpose-Driven Business Is the Real Key to SuccessIdentify your communityWho will you build your purpose-led community with? That question is answered by identifying your values and purpose as an entrepreneur.


Start the process by identifying the purpose of your business. It took me hours of reflection to narrow down my purpose and values, which then fed decisively into my business. Personally, my purpose is to forge meaningful connections, lead by example and support marketers and creatives on their path to climate work — and become an ecomarketer, someone who puts people and the planet at the center focus of all their marketing campaigns.Understanding my purpose has equipped me to identify a community of like-minded entrepreneurs interested in sustainability. It also helped me to connect with them on a deeper level. When you have a shared purpose, community connections go deeper, from transactional to building a world collaboratively for the better.Once you've identified your purpose, find your community. The LinkedIn community is a great platform to connect with entrepreneurs and to identify those who might share the same values as you. It's truly the largest business networking social media platform in the world with 1 billion members. You can use the search function to identify members sharing and talking about similar topics to yours.But being engaged actively in the community will help you identify those with common values. These individuals are pure gold and will help your business grow. They champion your ideas, connect you to opportunities and push your industry forward. Remember, identifying the group is only the beginning. As mentioned, your long-term success comes from fostering relationships with those having a shared purpose.


Related: 3 Reasons Why Purpose-Driven Businesses Can Help You Find Better Hires, Mentors and InvestorsHow to build a community of shared purposeOnce you've built the bridge, you can follow these three pathways to building a community of shared-purpose entrepreneurs.Change of mindset: Long-term — To build a community, you must have the right mindset. First, put personal gain aside and focus on the community. You will be surprised to see that the community-first mindset leads to more authentic connections that build long-term business growth. It also focuses your sights on the future, building connections that last years and don't stop at the end of a transaction.Step up: Contribute — Contributing is another important step toward building a community of purpose-driven entrepreneurs. You can't ask for value from others if you're not willing to step up and give the value yourself. Meaningful connections are made by giving a helping hand, passing along business opportunities to your community and offering collaboration opportunities. To build a community of shared purpose, you must embody your values and practice them openly.Pass the torch: Champion other entrepreneurs — Long-term entrepreneurial success comes from taking you out of the equation. Your growth goals, objectives and business strategy aren't the most important things in the entrepreneurial circle. Champion others' work, give referrals and forge meaningful connections.Find entrepreneurs with the same values and a similar journey as yours. Then, work on forging a community of shared purpose with those entrepreneurs. It's this one business tactic that will bring you longevity and long-term business success.

10,There's No Secret Formula to Being Good at Networking — But There Is One Thing You Need,"Apr 5, 2024",Ivan Misner,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/is-there-a-mathematical-formula-to-successful-networking/468775,"
Decades ago, I went to a breakout session at a BNI conference that was called ""The Mathematical Formula for Networking Success."" Well, as the founder of the organization, I absolutely had to see this presentation to learn the working formula for successful business networking.The speaker began his presentation by writing a formula on the flip chart. He talked about ""D"" representing Dunbar's average number of relationships and ""M"" representing Metcalf's law (also known as the Squared Connection Effect). He continued with a very convoluted and confusing formula doing the square root of one thing and multiplying it by something that seemed totally irrelevant to me.He hesitated as he spoke to us. He put his fingertips to his lips and hemmed and hawed in his presentation. It was uncomfortably clear to all of us that he was confused and bewildered by his own formula. Not only that, but we were also very confused and bewildered by his formula as well. We all sat there feeling pretty embarrassed for him.

11,The Philly Cheesesteak Was Invented At This Spot in 1930. Here's Why Fans Can't Stay Away 90 Years Later.,"Apr 2, 2024",Shawn P. Walchef,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/heres-where-the-philly-cheesesteak-was-invented/471584,"
At the heart of Philadelphia's culinary legacy stands Pat's King of Steaks, a landmark synonymous with the iconic Philly cheesesteak.Frank Olivieri, the executive chef and owner, traces the origins of this beloved sandwich to a serendipitous moment when his Uncle Pat grew weary of the daily hot dog fare and improvised with ribeye trimmings.""One day my uncle Pat got so tired of eating hot dogs he said to my grandfather, go down to the butcher and see what trimmings he has from the ribeye and bring it back, and we'll make that sandwich that we always like to make,"" Olivieri told host Shawn Walchef of Cali BBQ Media. That sandwich, cooked on the same open flat top as the hot dogs, became what we know now as the Philly cheesesteak.



Related: Chef Says This Is the No. 1 Thing That Makes a Restaurant Successful or NotFor Frank Olivieri, building connections and fostering hospitality is a family tradition deeply ingrained in Pat's King of Steaks. Inspired by his uncle's outgoing nature, Frank emulates Pat's approach of rubbing elbows with Philadelphia's elite and Hollywood stars — all while promoting the business. Olivieri explains, ""What I did was I found a way to let the business work for me rather than me work for the business.""


Philadelphia's legendary hospitality is evident in the enduring legacy of Pat's King of Steaks. Despite the city's infamous weather, loyal patrons brave the elements to savor the iconic cheesesteaks.

12,How An Unmarked Dive Bar in Vegas Became One of America's Must-See Destinations — Within 3 Years of Opening,"Apr 2, 2024",Kristen Bayrakdarian,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-an-unmarked-dive-bar-in-vegas-became-one-of-americas/471448,"
You might not guess that in Las Vegas — a place known for luxury resorts, opulent casinos, and just about any amenity imaginable — one of the city's most beloved establishments is in a single-story building a six-minute drive from the Strip.There's a sole neon sign in the window that says, simply, ""Open."" But inside is a bit of magic: a bar, called The Silver Stamp, that makes just about everyone feel like they're back home, no matter where they're from. And in a city like Las Vegas, that's a high-wire act. ""It's a transient city,"" says Andrew Smith, one of The Silver Stamp's co-owners. ""We have so many different people coming here."" And not just locals. Tourists seek the bar out in almost equal measure.The Silver Stamp has become so beloved that when Entrepreneur held a vote to select America's favorite mom-and-pop shop™ (out of 150 of the most popular small businesses in the country, selected in partnership with Yelp), the divef bar won first place.



Related: These Are America's Favorite 150 Mom & Pop Shops™, According to Yelp and EntrepreneurThis is all the more impressive given that Smith and his co-owner and life partner, Rose Signor, only opened the business three years ago, in February 2021. In that short time, they've paid off their two small investors, the business has averaged 23% revenue growth year over year, and by popular demand, extended their hours from 1 p.m. to 1 a.m.So what is the Silver Stamp getting right?""A lot of people say, 'I don't know what it is, but I just feel so comfortable in your space,'"" Signor says.Comfort — it's no small thing. It's possibly the most important feeling a mom-and-pop shop can evoke. But it's also mysterious. You can't simply buy comfort. You can't follow a checklist to create it. You have to understand, deeply, what it means to you.


Image Credit: Mike BellemeSignor and Smith met in 2017, when she hired him to work at Atomic Liquors, the oldest freestanding bar in Las Vegas. ""It was an instant connection,"" Smith says. They'd both been in the service industry for years — Smith had managed a nearby bar before coming to Atomic Liquors — and they both shared an interest in the craft beer industry. Smith had planned to move to the Northwest at some point, but when he met Signor, he had a good reason to stay. And Signor had actually moved from Las Vegas to Seattle back in 2011 — only to move back a year later. She missed Las Vegas and the desert, and was inspired to infuse Sin City with some of the wholesome beer culture she loved.But Signor and Smith's connection went deeper than a love of pilsners and IPAs. They'd grown up in small towns on opposite sides of the country — Peru, New York, and Yuma, Arizona, respectively — that instilled in them a strong sense of community and, perhaps more importantly, empathy. ""I remember seeing situations [growing up] where I felt truly bad for people getting treated poorly and embarrassed because they didn't have enough money,"" says Signor.Related: A Small Business Owner's Guide to Managing Funds and InvestmentsWhen Signor and Smith discovered that they had both, individually, been saving to open their own bars, joining forces was a no-brainer. ""We knew we wanted to do something together,"" Smith says. They started dreaming about the bar they'd open, and even collecting decorations. A vintage clock here, a disco ball there. A wooden toucan to hang from the ceiling, sock monkeys to dress in funny, seasonal outfits. Their nostalgic, oddball, something-for- everyone aesthetic was representative of their mission for the business. ""We'd been to so many establishments that have not made us feel welcome, or have made us and others feel like outcasts,"" Signor says. ""We wanted everyone to feel included.""In May 2018, they took the leap. They quit their jobs together and backpacked for nine months through Europe and the U.S. to learn more about the history of beer. When their former boss at Atomic Liquors, Lance Johns, reached out and told them he had bought a few buildings in the downtown area, and he would lease one to them, the couple jumped at the chance. They had a vision, and they were ready.  Image Credit: Mike BellemeConstruction on the Silver Stamp began at the end of 2019. A few months later, we all know what happened: The pandemic hit.Smith and Signor had planned to hold other jobs as they built out the space, but the shock to the service industry left them unemployed. They had already sunk $60K of their savings into gutting the space, buying materials and paying contractors, so they pressed ahead. But there were mistakes and setbacks during construction, and the funds dried up way before the bar was finished.


Related: Would You Turn Your Small Business Into a Franchise? Here's Why Everyone From Hardware Stores to Hot Dog Shops Are Doing It.""We were beside ourselves,"" Signor recalls. ""I remember stepping outside and thinking, We don't really have any money left.""At some point, the couple assessed their situation. Nothing was going to plan, sure, and the money was gone. But they had their own two hands, and a community of friends who were willing to help.They began spending long nights repurposing old, torn-out wood, running electrical lines, and laying plumbing themselves, to cut costs. They sought out any help they could get. ""One of the biggest things I learned during this process,"" Signor says, ""and this is even after we've opened — is to not be afraid to ask as many questions and to reach out to as many people as you can. Sometimes you think you're bothering people, but in that dire moment, I remember panicking and hitting everybody up, asking for suggestions, and looking to people that have a little bit more experience with the situation. There were some really surprising people that came forward to help us just by mentioning what our situation was."" People coached them through different processes, gave them a discount on their services, or lent them materials and machinery. They turned to others for counsel or attempted to replicate, through trial and error, what seemed to have worked for other successful establishments.One person they leaned on a lot was Lance Johns, who knew how hard they worked from when he was their boss. ""Lance is somebody that will give back to people who give to him,"" says Signor. ""Having a mentor saved us a lot of time not having to second-guess ourselves.""One thing they never doubted was how they wanted their bar to feel: inclusive and, of course, comforting.Related: Experts Say This Is the Key to Marketing a Mom and Pop BusinessThey poured those values into every detail and decision. Christmas lights strung across the ceiling help keep the ambience neither too dark nor too bright. Bar stools are repurposed gaming chairs, designed for people to sit in one place for an extended period of time. The collection of cozy nooks and small seating areas encourages intimate conversations, and the music is kept at a low enough decibel that you can hear your neighbor talk. There are only two screens, an anomaly in otherwise tech-saturated Las Vegas. And this low-tech ethos extends to printing physical menus, even though the bar has served over 1,700 different beers in three years — averaging out to nearly two new beers a day. Finally, there's the diversity of decorations and memorabilia — a bubbling lava lamp, vintage beer posters, kooky seasonal decorations, scavenged beer-can art installations — that Signor and Smith had collected over two years before the bar's opening. They're now strewn across the wood-panel walls and, really, everywhere, so that customers have something fun and different to look at in each corner. Customers have even begun adding their own contributions to the decor.


""We have been to enough bars in our life to know what makes us feel comfortable,"" Signor says, ""So how we created the bar was based on our own preferences."" By trusting their own well-defined feelings, they built something universally relatable.Image Credit: Mike BellemeBut creating an environment that is comfortable and relatable is about more than just creative decisions. It's also about financial decisions, and from the start, Signor and Smith were determined to keep costs down. ""We have low overhead because our decisions weren't fueled by [trying to make] money,"" Signor says. ""We intentionally made choices like a cheaper building off the beaten path and being our own managers and cutting out that salary.""Being intimately involved in the day-to-day operations of the space has also helped them foster the spirit of the bar and its employees. ""Our definition of a bartender isn't someone just serving drinks,"" says Signor. ""It's about building a relationship with these guests. When we're hiring, we look for people who genuinely appreciate other people, treat them with respect and kindness, and create a really safe space that people want to come back to."" Their ideal hire is someone who has positive energy, is able to leave their personal life at the door, can laugh and joke with people, and is humble (which they define as ""not intimidating and able to put people at ease"").Related: 50 Amazing Grants, Accelerators, and Free Resources Being Offered to Entrepreneurs by Champions of Small BusinessIt's painful to let people go when they don't live up to those standards, Signor says. But it's also essential. ""When prioritizing what to do next, I always think of the guest sitting in that barstool,"" she explains. ""We tell the staff to pretend we're the guests on the other side. What are they seeing? Really envision it from their perspective.""But, while Signor and Smith want their employees to put themselves in their customers' shoes (or, rather, stools), they also believe that employees have to be happy for customers to enjoy themselves. They offer health benefits — something they say is mostly unheard of in their industry, but something they wanted when they were employed by others. They are also transparent with their employees about finances and business decisions, sharing numbers and providing reasoning for changes. They take their workers' thoughts into consideration, whether it be opinions on events or on shifts in workflow. And they don't ask employees to do anything they wouldn't want to do. (The pair continue to work bar shifts alongside their staff — including cleanup duty.)""Don't be afraid to get feedback,"" says Signor. ""Our staff is so important to us and really we wouldn't be the bar that we are without them. So we lean on them, and they lean on us.""


The same way she encourages her employees to look at things through the customer's eyes, she makes a habit of looking at a situation from the viewpoint of her employees. ""I've learned to always try to put myself in the mindset of the other person,"" she says. ""I roleplay with myself in my head: If I say this to them, what do I think their response will yield? And could I say it differently? I just really try to understand where they're coming from before we approach the situation."" She adds, ""And then if we're frustrated, we sleep on it. That was something that my mentor told me: 'Always take a couple of days to reflect.'""These days, when Smith and Signor reflect on their business journey, it's notable that, in a city known for its fabulous attractions, The Silver Stamp has become its own must-see destination. ""We've become a bar people bring their families to when they're in town because they have to show their parents, their uncle,"" Smith says.Signor adds, ""We've had grown people cry when they first come in here. The space touches them immediately.""People are always looking for comfort, and the Silver Stamp shows that if you devote yourself and your business to that quality above all, people will feel it — and deeply appreciate it. You just need a vision, and a willingness to get your hands dirty. ""Every single aspect of this bar we've had our hands in,"" says Smith. He and Signor think it's funny that one of the bar's quirks that locals and tourists love — the fact that they don't have signage outside their building, giving the bar that local, in-the-know vibe — came about because they couldn't afford the sign they had designed.That's the kind of thing you never could have planned for. So, while Smith and Signor have received offers to franchise the bar, they don't think what they've created can be replicated. They do have other plans in the works. But The Silver Stamp will remain dependably unique — news that is its own kind of comfort.Related: Here's the Secret to Growing Your Small Business, According to Execs at UPS, Airbnb, Mastercard, and Other Big Brands

Ryan Walther, co-founder of prank gift box and gag gift company Prank-O, has had a passion for comedy from a young age. ""It goes back to when I was in third grade, and I saw David Letterman do Velcro Man,"" he tells Entrepreneur. ""Right then, I said, 'I want to do that.'"" Walther didn't ""become the next king of late night,"" but he did work at the satirical news outlet The Onion for more than 20 years.It was there that Walther met his co-founder Arik Nordby. Nordby would bring fake gift boxes to The Onion store, which always sold out fast. Walther saw potential in the product, and when a little bit of research revealed the plethora of gift-giving occasions in the U.S. — and that no company was the go-to brand for comedic gifting — the wheels continued to turn.Image Credit: Courtesy of Prank-O. Arik Nordby, left; Ryan Walther, right. 



""I felt that gifting had become obligatory and mundane,"" Walther says. ""Aren't parties supposed to be full of laughter? So at that moment, I sought to develop a brand that brought great comedy to gifting occasions and parties.""Related: 'Don't Follow Your Passion': Mark Cuban Shares the 'Worst Piece' of Business Advice He's Ever Received — And How Changing That Mindset Can Lead to Success


""[With] everything that we do, we want to make sure people are laughing.""Walther and Nordby launched Prank-O — ""a 21st-century gift company that delivers laughter and experience"" — in July 2013. The first set of boxes included the Crib Dribbler, ""kind of like a gerbil feeder [for] a crib""; the Wake & Bake Dream Griddle Alarm Clock; the Family Blankeez that covers up to eight people and even an SUV; and the Sizzl Bacon Scented Dryer Sheets.""[With] everything that we do, we want to make sure people are laughing,"" Walther says. Essentially, Prank-O gives consumers ""the keys to the car,"" he adds: Whoever shows up to the party with one of the comedic boxes in tow ""[is] going to be the hero, where they deliver the prank pack, and the whole room erupts with laughter and passes it around, and it's a ton of fun.""One of the business's earliest hurdles was explaining to potential retailers that there wasn't actually a product in the box. But once they were in on the joke, the ""light bulb"" went off — and ""they absolutely loved it,"" Walther says. Prank-O landed Urban Outfitters as its first account during the 2013 holiday season; Target, Kohl's, Walmart and numerous others followed.

Walther initially shot the idea down, much to his co-founder's — and the producer's — surprise. When the producer called back to ask why he'd declined, Walther said he ""wasn't interested in selling the company in seven minutes."" The producer explained that there's a due diligence period wherein either party can back out of a deal without penalty, and Walther was on board, as long as Prank-O was able to stay ""on brand"" — and prank the Sharks.The producers loved the idea. ""We came up with a skit where our company was RynArik Technologies, technology solutions for tomorrow, today,"" Walther recalls. ""So we came out in our RynArik uniforms and presented different prank packs that were positioned as RynArik products. I was wearing a prank pack we brought to life: a magnetic plate that stuck to your head so your kids could eat a meal while they sat on your shoulders.""

When the duo revealed themselves as the co-founders of Prank-O, the company behind empty gift boxes, Mark Cuban was impressed. Prank-O had done $10 million in sales since 2013 and was on track for nearly $3 million in 2018. Although Walther and Nordby initially asked for $640,000 for an 8% stake, Cuban negotiated $640,000 for a 25% stake. The deal didn't close after the due diligence period.Related: Humor Can Make You (and Your Employees) More Influential — If You Do It Right""The studio is underwater — nobody can really know that — with sharks circling above you,"" Walther quips.

""I'm an empty box baron. Not many people in this world sell empty boxes.""The Onion is a social commentary on news, and Prank-O is a social commentary on consumers, Walther says. To stay current and relevant, Prank-O is constantly innovating to keep up with ""the ever-changing times of products and technology."" It's about layering ""fresh"" parody on what's new in the marketplace, he adds.Image Credit: Courtesy of Prank-OThese days, Prank-O boasts a nearly six-figure email list with an open rate that can reach 60%. Still, marketing and distribution remain two of the company's most significant challenges. Many people simply aren't aware of the product, Walther says, and distribution in the gift space can be tough with Hallmark's and American Greetings' hold on the market. Selling through Amazon in addition to brick-and-mortar stores has been helpful, he notes.


Looking ahead, Prank-O has plans to ""bring the Prank-O-verse and its characters and inventors"" to life with a not yet disclosed media project, and next year, the company will launch Prank-O Labs, ""which will essentially bring brands to life on and around April Fool's Day"" — ""a great day to spread laughter.""Related: 5 Corny Jokes Will Get You Past Cold-Calling Gatekeepers""I'm an empty box baron,"" Walther says.

14,4 Ways the Labor Market Is Changing Right Now,"Mar 29, 2024",Daniel Altman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-ways-the-labor-market-is-changing-right-now/471109,"
The worker shortages of the Covid-19 pandemic may be a thing of the past, but that doesn't mean the labor market looks just like it did in 2019. Some trends have accelerated, and new ones have been set in motion. Here's what to look out for as you plan for your staffing needs.Remote work is leveling outAccording to the latest data from the Census, 30% of Americans ages 18 and older spend some time working from home. Among those aged 25 to 54 — the prime working years — the number rises to 38%. About half of these people work from home five days a week.These numbers were much higher during the pandemic, but they are largely stable now. And though the data include people who are self-employed and others who may have worked from home before the pandemic, they still represent a huge increase. In 2019, the share of Americans working from home was only around 6%.



With so many people expecting remote and hybrid working arrangements, companies will have to rely more on flexible schedules, fractional positions and job-sharing to fill their payrolls and meet their targets. Also, training workers to perform multiple roles will become more valuable, so that production can continue no matter who is in the office or on the factory floor.Related: Where Will the Economy Go Next? What to Watch For in 2024


Churn is finally slowing downIn 2020, the median tenure of American workers — the time they'd spent in their current jobs — fell to 4.1 years, the lowest number since 2008. Both of those years included recessions, where more people were losing their jobs. But the recent low persisted until 2022, thanks to people switching jobs and raising their pay in a tight labor market.All of that is changing now. In January, the share of workers quitting their jobs dropped to 2.1%, the lowest rate since 2018, after peaking at 3.0% most recently in April 2022. The hiring rate has also plunged back to 2018 levels. The sum of these rates tends to peak around 6% in a normal economic cycle, as it did in 2005 and 2019. Both employers and employees are showing more caution now.Indeed, less churn — fewer hires, fewer quits — signifies uncertainty. And despite the economy's strong fundamentals, an outsider might see a couple of causes for concern: a divisive presidential election coming up later this year and a stock market that looks overvalued by historical standards. Even with a low unemployment rate, workers are no longer as eager to move.From a corporate perspective, this is a great time to invest in existing employees. With workers less likely to leave, the returns to training are more likely to stay inside the company. It's also a good time to launch projects that require a team to work together for the long term. Increasingly, companies are even bringing in flexible workers for long-term assignments rather than one-off shifts. On the Instawork platform, where I work, the share of shift bookings for long-term assignments has doubled over the past six months.


Related: These 5 Economic Trends Will Drive Consumer Spending in 2024Pay rates are stabilizingEven though the unemployment rate has only risen half a percentage point off its lows, job openings have come down by roughly 25%. The labor market is gradually loosening up, and increases in pay are starting to ebb. These increases peaked at about 7% on an annual basis in July 2022, but now they're down around 5% — just a couple of percentage points above inflation.Wages usually rise a little faster than inflation because of workers' growing productivity. In fact, we may see unusual productivity gains in the near future as artificial intelligence spreads across the economy; the same thing happened when the internet, mobile telephony and fiber optic cabling arrived on every worker's desk. So pressure on wages could return soon, though for different reasons.With inflation roughly under control and pay increases moderating for now, forward-looking companies will be thinking about locking in their labor costs for the next few years. Companies with union labor can do this via contract negotiations, and other companies can do it by setting pay scales and planning cost-of-living adjustments.


Older people are leaving the workforce againIn November 2023, the share of people ages 55 to 64 who were working reached an all-time high of over 66%. For several decades, rising life expectancies had led people to extend their careers to stay active and fund their retirements. The trend was reversed during the pandemic, thanks to health concerns and the rising stock market, among other factors. But then higher costs stemming from inflation and interest rates drove older people back into the workforce.And now, the trend may be turning around once again. In December, this rate dropped by more than half a percentage point, the biggest decrease outside of the pandemic since 2010. With the stock market again hitting record highs, inflation coming down and interest rates poised to follow, there is less pressure on people to delay retirement (or to come back out of it).Related: The 12 Best Jobs for Retirees and SeniorsMoreover, a significant share of the older people who stay in the workforce are choosing flexible work rather than full-time jobs. The average age of Pros working shifts on the Instawork platform in February was 38.5 years, with 8.4% of the shifts being completed by Pros aged 55 or older. This percentage is back where it was five years ago, before the pandemic.


This is an important insight for recruiters. The most experienced talent in the labor market hasn't gone missing; it just has to be accessed in a different way. By offering flexible schedules and temporary positions, companies can still bring in older workers to guide and mentor their younger staff. The labor market is still pretty tight, and tapping every possible source of talent is paramount.

15,These Are the Five Attributes of Highly Successful and Happy People,"Mar 29, 2024",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/these-are-the-five-attributes-of-highly-successful-and/470701,"
During my 21 years in corporate America, I spent thousands of hours observing others. Now, as a coach and consultant, I often get asked what attributes I value most in people — and these five stand out. If you're looking to achieve new levels of happiness of success this year, consider how well you embody the following five attributes. Not only do they drive success in leadership, but they drive success in life.1. VisionHumans have a gift that no other living organism has: the power of imagination. Successful, happy people use this gift. They imagine a compelling and different future than the present, and they believe in their ability to create and shape it. They don't reactively accept the status quo or things they don't like. Instead, they work hard to improve the world around them.They recognize that they have agency and can proactively alter their surroundings and environment. They never say things like: ""That's just the way it is"" or ""We've always done it that way."" Instead, they imagine their desired or ideal state and then compare that vision to their actual state. If they identify a gap, they immediately begin devising possible solutions that will close that gap. Then, they get to work in employing and experimenting with those. People like this show us that anything is possible, and they're fun to be around because they tend to inspire us to do the same.



Related: There Are 6 Types of Great Leaders — Which One Do You Fall Into?2. PassionWe all have unique gifts and talents that excite us tremendously. Time flies when we use them. We tend to be better at them than our counterparts. They come more naturally and easily to us than others. Thus, we're able to hone and improve our skills at a rate faster than our peers. Doing these things feels more like play than work, and we can hardly believe that someone pays us to do them.


Life is too short not to invest in yourself. We're most successful and happy when we identify what unique gifts and talents we have, and take the time to practice them. Not only does this help us feel fulfillment and joy, it allows us to best serve society. Many individuals experience burnout, anxiety and depression because they spend 40 hours or more a week not doing what they love. When we engage in activities that energize us (instead of things that drain us of energy), we're not only happier, but we're healthier.I've had a few jobs I didn't like and my life suffered while I had them. I felt drained of energy when I arrived home. I struggled to find the motivation to exercise and pursue personal hobbies. I gained weight and lost touch with friends. When I got back to a job I loved, all this changed. I became a marathon runner, reconnected with friends and pursued personal hobbies like photography, scrapbooking and writing. Focusing on what we're passionate about is incredibly important.3. CourageFear is a powerful motivator. Research shows that our brains all have a subconscious component that works to protect us and keep us safe. Many of us hold back and live life with the brakes on because we're afraid of change and trying new things. We have a fear of being uncomfortable, making mistakes, failing or facing judgment from others. Courage sets us free.As Franklin Roosevelt said, ""Courage is not an absence of fear, but rather the assessment that something else is more important than fear."" Courage allows us to speak our minds in the board room, express our true opinions, suggest unconventional courses of action and go against the status quo. This is what allows us to progress, develop and innovate.


It can be scary to speak up. But, it's important. The right people will value your bravery; not squash it. Having the courage to be vulnerable, authentic and transparent gives other people permission to do the same thing. Going against the grain and inciting real, honest dialogues when others can't or won't usually doesn't hold you back, but helps you progress, especially if you're in the right environment.Related: Why Successful People Never Second-Guess Themselves — and 5 Strategies to Help You Get Rid of Indecision4. CompassionWhen we empathetically hold space for others, we free them from their own fears and worries. Compassion allows us to create a safe space for others to be themselves, and that's when people are most able to contribute in a meaningful way. Our spouses, families, and friends aren't the only ones who appreciate compassion. Our employees do, too. When others feel valued, appreciated and seen, they give us their all. They do their best work and deliver their best ideas, which is what helps us move forward.Over the years, numerous employees have thanked me for being so kind and understanding. They've told me how enjoyable it is to come to work when they have a boss or colleague who truly cares about them. Sadly, compassionate leaders are somewhat rare. If you're one of them, you stand out and this breeds a tremendous amount of loyalty and respect. When people respect you, they're more willing to push through challenges and find solutions for you, which means you'll get better results.


5. AccountabilityIt's amazing how much traction you create in life when you keep your word. The most successful people I know always do the things they said they'd do. They regularly keep their commitments, including the ones they make to themselves. Over time, people notice. This breeds a great deal of trust. When you take responsibility for both your behaviors and the results, you'll work harder to find solutions in the toughest of circumstances. When the buck stops with you, and you don't blame others for your problems, you save a tremendous amount of time.Most people spend an inordinate amount of time finding scapegoats and assigning fault to anyone but themselves. This behavior prevents us from getting better. People who are truly accountable stay focused on their circle of control, not their circle of concern. Therein, lies all the difference. Whether you're leading others or just leading yourself, accountability is what makes progress possible.Related: The Super Successful Have These 5 AttributesPractice these five attributes and your life is bound to improve. If you haven't been doing one or more of these things and start now, you'll be shocked at how quickly others around will notice and appreciate the changes. This holds true for your personal and professional relationships.

In 2022, Elenor Mak, now founder of doll company Jilly Bing, was busy balancing her business development role at a healthcare company and raising her 2-year-old and 4-year-old children. Back then, she ""was definitely not looking to start"" a side hustle. She'd founded an ecommerce fashion company in the past and knew what it took to get a business up and running. But that changed when her young daughter Jillian began playing with stuffed animals and dolls.Image Credit: Courtesy of Jilly Bing. Elenor Mak.""It reminded me of my own childhood,"" Mak tells Entrepreneur. ""You're playing with dolls; you're trying to make sense of the world. She was bossing her dolls around, like, 'Eat your dinner. Wash your hands.' Acting like a mom. Not in those words, but at age two, sort of using those words, simpler versions of those words.""



Related: How to Go From Side Hustle to 7-Figure Business and Beyond, According to 3 Women Who Did ItOne day, Mak's mother gave her granddaughter a ""beautiful blonde, blue-eyed doll."" When Mak asked her why she'd chosen that doll instead of one that looked like her daughter, her mother said, ""It was the prettiest one on the shelf."" Despite knowing her mother meant well, Mak found those words ""so heavy,"" a reminder of her own experience with lack of representation as a child.


""They gave them an Asian name, like Ling, or like a bad haircut. It was so shocking and disappointing.""Mak decided to buy her daughter a doll that looked like her and figured it would be a straightforward process: Because I live in San Francisco, and it's 2022. But it wasn't. Her local toy store didn't have one. Neither did the second she visited. Or the third. The toy aisles at major retailers like Target and Toys""R""Us seemed as though they ""had not evolved"" since Mak was a kid, nearly four decades before.""There were just rows and rows of Caucasian dolls, brunettes, and then at the very end of the aisle, you would have these dolls that I think were intended to be Asian because they were holding a panda bear,"" Mak recalls. ""They gave them an Asian name, like Ling, or like a bad haircut. It was so shocking and disappointing.""Mak looked to Asia for more options, but asking her relatives what they could find only turned up ""Eurasian-looking dolls,"" she says, adding that ""dolls largely represent what society thinks is beautiful, and in Asia, what's beautiful is still the Caucasian sort of features."" Mak remembered wishing she were beautiful like the dolls she had growing up, and ""her mommy bear instincts"" kicked in — she was determined to get her daughter a doll that looked like her, even if she had to make it herself.

Although she admits the creative component wasn't where she excelled (""My 6-year-old son is a better artist than me,"" she quips), she had a clear vision when it came to the business side and the potential for major demand: ""The Asian American population is one of the fastest-growing — we're 7% of the country's population.""And how hard could it be to make a doll in an age where we're churning out Teslas and developing AI? She recalls thinking. As it turns out, ""it's really hard — really hard — to make a good doll,"" Mak says. Fortunately, her business background helped her develop an essential ""superpower"": ""finding really good people."" Mak did cold outreaches to Asian designers at large toy brands and leveraged her own extensive network to connect with professionals who could bring the dream to life.


Image Credit: Courtesy of Jilly Bing. Elenor Mak and her daughter Jillian with the Jilly doll.By June 2022, they had their team of four. Mak conducted a lot of research over the next several months, speaking with Asian families and looking at photographs of kids and dolls to really try to understand what parents wanted. ""It's not just about saying, 'Oh, this doll's Asian,'"" Mak says. ""But what mattered to them? What were the features? What were the backstories?"" In December of that year, the prototype for Jilly Bing, named for Mak's daughter Jillian and the Chinese word for cookie, ""bing gan"" (Jillian's first word), was ready to share with the world.Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a Month""Adult women would write in and be like, 'Oh my gosh, it's like healing for my inner child.'""Jilly Bing started shipping dolls in August 2023 — and sold out of its stock of 2,000 within six weeks. Greta Gerwig's blockbuster hit Barbie had also put the spotlight on dolls that summer, ""opening up the national conversation"" and presenting ""an opportunity for us to change the narrative for not just our Asian children, but all children,"" Mak says. At that point, Mak realized the ""high-risk, high-effort"" passion project she'd worked on as a side hustle for the past couple of years — taking late-night business calls after her kids were asleep and balancing it all with her full-time day job — would benefit from her undivided attention.Jilly Bing also appeared on the Today show around that time, and the positive response was ""overwhelming."" ""Adult women would write in and be like, 'Oh my gosh, it's like healing for my inner child. Life would have been so different if I had a doll that looked like me growing up,'"" Mak says. ""Even non-Asian parents writing [in to say], 'Oh my gosh, I think my kids should have dolls that look like their friends.'""By early this year, Jilly Bing was on shelves at Macy's; the retailer reached out after the Today segment. ""It's a company I grew up with,"" Mak says, ""so it was just really wonderful that they saw the value of Jilly Bing so early on."" Jilly Bing is also part of Macy's Mission Every One initiative, which has committed $5 billion of spending through 2025 to its people, partners, products and programs ""to create a more equitable and sustainable future.""Related: How This Doctor-Turned-Entrepreneur Is Trying to Change the World Through Play

""And hearing the stories [from them] — and my own daughter — saying, 'She looks like me. She has black hair like me.' [And] little Asian boys saying, 'She's beautiful like my mama.'

Mak had to ""trust her gut"" to start the side hustle turned full-fledged business that's leaving its mark on the toy industry and beyond, and she looks forward to building the brand out in the years to come.""I am most excited about being able to create characters,"" Mak says. ""We started to branch into comics because it's a doll, but we're starting to create the stories. I've got a vision of a whole cast of Asian American characters that actually reflect what Asian America looks like today. We have mixed Asian children, you have boys, you have Southeast Asian.

17,5 Ways to Get on the Media's Good Side (and Stay There),"Mar 28, 2024",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-get-on-the-medias-good-side/470500,"
In this on-screen world we all share, the surest way to get your business noticed is through all the various media channels people see on their devices, whether that's inclusion in newsfeeds, articles in online news outlets, featured segments on TV shows, appearances on podcasts, video clips on YouTube or, of course, promotional bits across all the other ubiquitous social media platforms.And how do you get on those channels? Through media people themselves — all the journalists, reporters, influencers, and publication writers and editors who receive your pitches, read your press releases, view your videos and decide who will get a chance to appear onstage … and who will linger in the wings.But anyone and everyone is vying for the media's attention. You can significantly increase your odds of getting some by establishing friendly relations with your contact people and outlets of choice. As a 20-year public relations veteran, here are some of my tips and tricks of the trade for forming viable and valuable connections with the media.



Let's start off by emphasizing that the goal here isn't just to get on the media's good side; even more importantly, you want to stay away from their bad side by refraining from annoying habits and intrusions. Follow these guidelines, and you'll have friends in the sandbox with you in no time!Habit #1: Be (a little) patientRome wasn't built in a day, nor will your company's empire. As you're trying to grow your reputation and industry standing, you can't expect immediate responses from media people, who get thousands — literally thousands — of inquiries a week. If you haven't heard back for a while, you can follow up the same week you initially reached out, but never the same day or even the next day.


Some news is timely, yes, like your Fourth of July promotion or your Christmas Wish List idea, so it's understandable you'd get antsy waiting for a response. But it's on you, not the media contact, to make sure your pitches are submitted in time to get them in front of the right eyes. For items that aren't time-sensitive, patience will get you further than prodding. I'm not saying to just wait around and hope for the best; I'm saying to wait a respectful amount of time for the individual to field and research your message, which shows respect for their role and the pressures they're under.Related: 8 Etiquette Tips to Stay on the Good Side of the MediaHabit #2: Reinforce instead of repeatWhen it is appropriate to nudge a little? Don't just send the exact same message, duplicating the original content. Rather, add something new of value to your message — something that makes your pitch even stronger or more appealing.Say you're trying to get coverage for a new wellness supplement; you can remind the media person that you sent them an email on so-and-so date, but then explain that they might also like to know that your product comes in at a 20% lower price point than its closest competitor and include a testimonial from a satisfied customer. Now they have more information to lure them, not just the same information you previously sent.


Habit #3: Communicate, don't just contactReaching out to the media should entail more than just ""making contact."" What you want to make is impact. You do that by crafting your submissions into meaningful communication as opposed to just a dry inquiry of interest. Embed links the reader can follow to get more detail. Include a really well-selected image or two to add visual interest. Invite the media person to engage with the content somehow.Example: My firm recently submitted a pitch for National Margarita Day for one of my restaurant clients. We incorporated a captivating image of a frothy marg in a stunning glass next to a plate of mouthwatering nachos. We promised the TV producer that if they booked a demo segment with our client's master bartender, they'd get to sample the drinks and eats afterward.Habit #4: Get personalThe more you ""send out"" to the media, the more you'll ""take in"" about particular contacts and relationships you're forging. For instance, you might hear back from someone who apologizes for not getting back to you sooner because they were out on maternity leave. Or a reply might mention that they'll follow up with you when they return from vacation.When and if you acquire personal intel like this, file it away and use it! Make sure your next message congratulates them on their new parenthood or asks how their vacation went. You can even add a line about your own parenting experience or recall a great restaurant you tried when you went to Barbados too. There's so much formality and form-letter-type communications in media relations that when something comes over with a bit of sincerity and warmth, it'll stand out more.


Related: 3 Ways to Attract Media CoverageHabit #5: Practice perseveranceYou know that mom you see at the soccer games who seems really cool and interesting? That guy you see in the cafeteria whose fashion style you admire? You asked her to lunch, but she couldn't go that day. You approached him to introduce yourself, and he said he was sorry, but he had to answer his ringing phone. If you genuinely hope to make a connection with this person, you gotta keep extending your hand, extending the invitation, extending effort.The same applies to connecting with the media. If a pitch doesn't get picked up, don't take it personally, just pitch again another day, another way. Instead of making your outreach about ""Look at me, publish me, promote me!"" make it about how what you're pitching will benefit the media person's audience, readership or followership.Stay in touch. Be assertive but not aggressive, persistent but not pesky. Show your personality in your outreach, which will allow the recipients of your efforts to show a little of theirs in kind.


All these tips might not land you what you're looking for right of the gate.

19,Up to 90% of Startups Fail — But Innovation Accelerators Can Help Yours Succeed. Here's How.,"Mar 28, 2024",Jacobo Weizenblut,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-innovation-accelerators-are-shaping-the-future-of/470288,"
The globalized digital economy creates constant opportunities and requirements for startups. Unfortunately, the business environment that encourages the birth of startups immediately subjects them to a ruthless evolutionary process. Depending on who you ask, up to 90% of startups fail. Only 1% will make it to the big league to compete with unicorns like Uber, Zoom and other financial success case studies.Most startups that achieve initial seeding fail to raise a second round of capital. One solution to dramatically increase your chances of success is to enter an innovation accelerator and forge a strategic partnership with a major corporation.Innovation accelerators exist on a quid pro quo basis. In exchange for a small percentage of equity, they provide startup founders with a safe harbor in which to develop their new business. Innovation accelerators are structured programs, usually specializing in a particular field or sector. Entrepreneurs receive mentorship, resources and help from a powerful partner who has a direct interest in seeing them succeed. Innovation accelerators definitely work, but there can be drawbacks. You might be signing over a share of your business, and you'll be expected to play by the innovation accelerator's rules — and the initial admission process could be exhaustive and time-consuming.

Major companies (at least the smart ones) recognize the potential of new startups and are keen to either integrate their new technologies into their own operations or to profit from them as investors.


Since 2005, we've seen a growing enthusiasm for corporate innovation accelerators that can simultaneously nurture and supercharge new startups. Founders can bring their new businesses into accelerator programs, either at a concept level or close to market, and benefit from the resources, expertise and professional networks that programs have access to. This may also include actual cash investments. Most founders are mature and experienced enough to welcome the professional assistance — and increased peace of mind — that accelerators deliver.Innovation accelerators subject applicants to some fairly rigorous and detailed scrutiny, but the best programs are open to unconventional ideas and disruptive concepts. Every startup is essentially a business experiment. Accelerator programs try to create laboratory conditions that will allow stakeholders to adapt the experiment, explore new directions and reinforce success — before the product goes to market. For viable products, time to market and development and marketing costs can be substantially reduced.3 leading innovation acceleratorsThere are about over 8,000 accelerator programs worldwide, more than half of which were founded between 2014 and 2020. The programs are competing to identify profitable startups and gain privileged access to technological innovations or products that can deliver shortcuts to market dominance. Even niche technologies that adapt or optimize existing processes can deliver a worthwhile return on investment.Companies and organizations across the entire financial and industrial spectrum are investing in their own programs and enabling thousands of new businesses annually. Three fascinating innovation accelerators in 2024 are featured here. They're not necessarily the biggest programs, but they offer valuable insights into what makes an accelerator punch above its weight.

The Microsoft Hub is highly egalitarian and focuses on initial accessibility. Anybody can apply to the Hub via an online form and expect a fast response.From then on, the platform is meritocratic and startups can progress through its stages, acquiring packages of the latest Microsoft technologies and development tools, including access to AI services, Azure credits and 1:1 mentorship with Microsoft experts. The Microsoft Hub represents an almost democratic approach to entrepreneurship and can be ideal for low-budget — or even no-budget — ventures.

Google for Startups


Google for Startups targets an entirely different segment of the new business spectrum. The program is focused on top growth-stage startups and offers a range of accelerators that specialize in overcoming specific technical challenges. The accelerators give founders access to Google's vast technological resources and expertise.Each Google accelerator accommodates between 10-15 startups and connects them to mentors and advisors, both from Google itself and from industry. Google's entry criteria are demanding and the program requires a commitment for ongoing technical engagement at a high level.Related: Everything You Need to Know Before Working With Accelerator ProgramsAccelerators shape corporate cultureThe skill and experience of each accelerator team and other stakeholders, the scale of their professional networks and the depth of their resources have a direct influence on the future structure of any startup that they mentor and nurture.

      Key Takeaways    



        The business world is in step with a 5-day workweek, so any change will be sure to come with challenges. 
      


        After my experience with a 35-hour workweek, I can definitely see it working.
      












    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

4-day workweeks — it's the trend every worker is quietly rooting for. The concept is simple: one less day of work a week without any changes to remuneration, benefits or workload. Yes, workload. That means doing 100% of the work in 80% of the time. That's if you want to keep 100% of the pay.Proponents of four-day workweeks say that this should be possible thanks to transformative technologies such as artificial intelligence, better management techniques (e.g., not everything needs a Zoom meeting) and boosted personal productivity that stems from a better work-life balance.These proponents are also amassing a substantial body of evidence that not only proves the feasibility of the four-day workweek but also shows workers to become more satisfied and loyal. That's a powerful benefit to companies in a time when rampant worker burnout and disengagement may be costing the economy nearly $2 trillion in lost productivity.



One recent four-day workweek pilot program featuring 41 US and Canadian companies saw both worker satisfaction and business revenue go up. None of the participating companies had a desire to return to a 5-day workweek.A larger trial in the UK saw virtually identical results, with 92% of participating companies opting to continue with the four-day model post-pilot for the same reasons as above – greater worker satisfaction and a 35% average increase in revenue. A similar story goes for Spain and South Africa. Plus, Portugal, Brazil, Germany and other countries that are running trials right now are likely to corroborate these findings further.


Related: Want a 4-Day Workweek? This Scheduling Strategy is the First StepToo radical of a change?For some businesses, however, letting a fifth of their working week go may be too hard a pill to swallow. And there's no denying it — it's a radical shift.The business world is in step with a 5-day workweek, and whether it's customer expectations or communication with partners, operations can get messy if you find yourself out of tune. Moreover, startups and other high-growth companies that already expect 120% from their employees on a regular day risk completely overwhelming their people by shortening the week.This is to say nothing of shift workers or entire industries that simply don't currently have the flexibility to adapt. Nearly a third of UK businesses find a four-day workweek infeasible, with the manufacturing, human resources, and travel sectors being the most pessimistic.


It's not all or nothingLet's be real — nobody has any illusions about businesses suddenly adopting a four-day workweek en masse in the coming years, no matter how many positive test runs make the headlines. Rather, the message that should be gleaned from all these studies is that there's an overwhelmingly positive response to shortened workweeks that typically translates to improved business performance.Many businesses are taking an incremental approach to tapping into these benefits without undermining daily operations. Instead of going from a standard 40-hour week to a 32-hour one, they're taking the middle road, opting for 35 — or 36-hour workweeks.These can come in various forms:7-hour work days. 7 hours a day, five days a week. This is how we do it at DeskTime, and the practice has been received positively by the team.Summer Fridays. Fridays are half-days. This is a popular policy during the summer months, hence the name.Staggered Fridays. Nine work days a fortnight, or taking every second Friday off. Allows for alternating shifts, e.g., in customer support.Working four fewer hours a week sounds less radical than eliminating an entire day. For most white-collar workers, that's equivalent to cutting out two meetings, which is not only doable but maybe dearly welcomed.


Indeed, many companies looking to adopt four-day or even 4.5-day workweeks set their crosshairs on reducing and optimizing meetings. Simply following meeting best practices — no time overruns, everyone arriving prepared, and clear processes — can help reclaim a sizable chunk of wasted hours. The promise that it's their own free time that they're reclaiming is a good incentive for workers to take these best practices seriously.Every company I've talked to that has attempted shortened workweeks in one form or another immediately references a notable drop in employee turnover. Hiring also becomes easier, and the employees are happier. And others have had similar positive experiences, too.Related: That 9-to-5 Job You Hate Isn't As Safe As You ThinkA step closer to 4-day workweeksAs a CEO, I was skeptical when I heard that four-day workweeks were trending. Now, after my experience with a 35-hour workweek, I can definitely see it working. I still hear and understand the counterarguments of other business leaders, but I've learned that they're not insurmountable obstacles. It takes work, adaptation, and patience.


Shifting to a shortened workweek cannot be a snap decision. Even in the various national trials, the shift is typically preceded by a transitional period guided by experts who prepare the company and workers regarding expectations and practicalities. Get it wrong, and your transition to a four-day workweek may have the opposite effect — an overworked team struggling and failing to cram everything into four days, leading to heightened stress levels that fast-track burnout.But get it right – and you'll see it in your business results.

21,Empower Your Customers and Exceed Expectations With These 3 Customer Service Strategies,"Mar 26, 2024",Cheri Beranek,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-ways-to-exceed-expectations-in-customer-service/471321,"
Giving people what they want drives the bottom line. Statistics consistently show that consumers are more likely to buy, purchase again or recommend a company to a friend based on the quality of their customer service. Until recently, competitive businesses knew the equation to meet those expectations and stay ahead: Listen well enough to understand what customers wanted and provide it, but one step better.Today, customer needs have changed. In a 2023 Salesforce survey of 14,300 global consumers and business buyers, 80% said the buying experience is now just as important as the products or services a company offers. Seventy-three percent expect greater personalization alongside advancing technology. Competitive companies now need to ""win hearts and wallets"" by proving their ability to consider the customers' best interests.This year, rather than New Year's resolutions, our company made reaffirmations to the core institutional practices that have driven its success, including efforts to exceed customer expectations. Knowing those expectations have fundamentally changed and may continue to do so, here are our three main customer service strategies:



Related: 5 Reasons Setting Customer Expectations Goes a Long Way1. What they want, and…In the past, our approach to exceeding our customers' service expectations was simple: focus on product and network training so we could provide the best quote and turnaround with the least amount of lead time. Now, our customers still want quality, price and lead time, but to provide that one step better, we need to help them navigate new purchasing problems and find new ways to make them happy.


Our post-pandemic path of high demand and supply chain challenges has left many industries in a position of over-inventory. As a fiber-optics connectivity supplier, exceeding our customers' expectations has meant helping them make better decisions with what they have and, in the face of rising inflation and interest rates, more cost-effectively.To do this, we take the word ""no"" out of our vocabulary. Saying ""no"" to a customer request would not exceed their expectations. Instead, we find a way to give them a ""Yes, and…."" If a customer comes asking, ""Can you take my inventory back?"" on a non-returnable item, I can say, ""Yes, I understand your inventory challenge, and I can reach out to some customers who might need what you have to help resolve it."" If they want a specific product unavailable at our company, I can say, ""Yes, we have an equivalent product, and I think it could fulfill your requirements equally or better.""Never lie if something is not possible. Rather, empower people to offer ""Yes, and…"" honestly. The truth opens the door for a future opportunity to work together, but getting caught in a lie can keep someone from ever returning for more business. Empower individual contributors with a clear understanding of what is possible and alternative options so they can apply their ""Yes, and…"" response most effectively.Related: How to Keep Up With Customer Expectations


2. ListenSometimes, to arrive at a successful ""Yes, and…,"" we need to listen. Suppose a customer wants ten items delivered within eight days, and I know we can only turn around an item per day. In that case, asking for more information might help me respond with a suitable ""Yes, and…"" Customers are not always aware of what they truly need when it comes to technology components, and listening to how they intend to use the products might empower me to say, ""Yes, I can get you eight of the items you need in eight days, and still achieve the same solution.""The best customer service salespeople talk only 30% of the time because the other 70%, they spend listening. Listening to customers keeps them sticky. When a significant potential customer came to us looking for a new fiber optic cabinet supplier, we listened and heard them describing a desire to do more with fewer resources. So, we conducted field studies to assure them that our cabinets could allow twice as many connections. We also provided free field training so they could conduct the study and see the results for themselves. That customer stuck with us even after they passed through their economic difficulties because, by listening, we were able to go above and beyond what they needed.Related: 8 Ways Customer Service Affects Your Business's Bottom Line3. Reset and alignExceeding customer expectations is an opportunity to reset — a reintroduction to your customers and their needs. We were previously focused on drawing the early majority in the technology product adopter lifecycle: more adept and in need of constant change. Now, our biggest customers are in the late majority, who are less confident, require more support, and are more convinced by lower prices. Our job is to strike the right balance.


So, to replace the requirement of having a sales engineer present the first time installing a product, we invested in building a technology platform. Using the same application that could explain how to assemble a newly purchased grill, customers can now learn our technology in bite-sized chunks over their phones. Exceeding the expectations of the late majority meant providing more accessible support and requiring less effort.After a reset, we need to break down silos to ensure organizational alignment. Nearly eight out of ten of Salesforce's 2023 survey respondents said they expected consistent service interactions across a company, but more than half felt like they were communicating with isolated departments. Under pressure to make a sale, a product manager might offer to meet a price that undermines gross margins, while among leadership, we find that greater customer awareness of market prices tends to diminish such expectations. Especially after a customer reset, breaking down silos ensures alignment around best practices when meeting customer needs. The pandemic allowed me some time to work on my business, but now, we need to work in it. Our leadership teams are getting more hands-on, and we are working to empower our people to say, ""I'll get right back to you."" Whenever they find themselves without a ""Yes, and…,"" they can turn to their manager or leader for more insight. Our examples and experiences help team members navigate their customer challenges and discover new ways to exceed expectations.

Creating our show The CEO Series has allowed me to sit down with some of the most innovative and inspiring business leaders in the world to get their insights on what it takes to launch, grow and sustain a meaningful business.This episode took us to Ozinga, the concrete and building material powerhouse. They're based in Chicago and if you're in the area, you're surely familiar with their iconic red and white trucks. They have approximately 2,500 employees and I got to have an amazing chat with the guy who oversees it all, Marty Ozinga, the fourth-generation CEO of this 95-year-old company.Below are some highlights of that conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity. Watch the full video above.



His approach to leadership""It's not the people are working for you, they're working with you. That's the way I was mentored and taught. We all need each other. We all have different roles and responsibilities, but we're working with each other.""Related: Why Notre Dame's Football Coach Tells His Team to ""Choose Hard""


Ozinga's 95-year history""Our family came from the Netherlands in 1893, the year of the World's Fair here in Chicago. The family was always in the delivery business. Then in 1928, my great-grandfather was working with the Cook County Sheriff's Department during Prohibition and dealing with the hazards of Al Capone and all of that. He had five kids at home and decided, ""You know what? I don't want to fight Al Capone anymore."" So he started a coal delivery business. And then around 1950, ready mix concrete became the era's disruptive technology. Ready mixed means that it is batched for delivery from a central plant instead of being mixed on the job site. And so Ozinga became one of the first ready mix providers in the region.""Related: This Entrepreneur Started Making Short Videos to Share Her Passion for Cooking. Now Her Food Company Is a Global Powerhouse.On their iconic trucks""We've supplied concrete to iconic Chicago landmarks like Soldier Field and Wrigley Field, so it's fun to be connected to places like that. And we're really proud of our trucks' red and white stripes. I think it was a combination of this keen sense of marketing, but also of national pride. But there's also some joke that they were Dutch and very frugal and those were the two paint buckets in the garage. So I like both those stories.""The power of peacefulness""Our dispatch office is the nerve center of the business. It's where all the orders come in from our customers, and then where we dispatch the trucks. It is intentionally very quiet inside. We've tried to get it as quiet and peaceful as possible because historically the dispatch office is a very intense, chaotic, loud and crazy place.""


Building and sustaining a legacy""There's an emotional connection for my family and this company. We've been really fortunate that we get to embed ourselves in communities throughout the Midwest. We're committed to our employees and our customers — we want to be here for the next hundred years and longer. That's our intention. And while change is necessary so you don't get disrupted and die and go out of business, there are certain things that you shouldn't meddle with. Our core principles are the foundation for who we are and why we do what we do — that should never change.""Related: How Personal Passions Fuel Business Success for the CEO of Vivid SeatsCheck out more profiles of innovative and impactful leaders by visiting The CEO Series archives.

23,Want to Get Your Product into the Hands of Celebrities and Secure Endorsements? Here's an Effective Strategy You Need to Try.,"Mar 21, 2024",Danielle Sabrina,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/use-this-effective-strategy-to-secure-celebrity-endorsements/471113,"
Brands can catapult their visibility and appeal by placing their products in the hands of celebrities; think about how quickly a product goes viral after someone like Kim Kardashian posts about it. However, securing celebrity endorsements can be challenging and costly without the right connections. From my experience running an agency, even when you have access to celebrities and brands, success hinges on seizing the right moment with an unforgettable presentation.One of the most effective strategies I use at my agency to get products into the hands of celebrities is through celebrity gifting suites at high-profile events like the Oscars, Grammys and Super Bowl. Gifting suites are exclusive spaces where companies can showcase their products to A-listers in a more intimate setting.Unlike traditional trade show environments, where products might simply be displayed, gifting suites require you to captivate attendees with engaging presentations and charm them with your personal charisma. Most celebrities are always sent free products, which, more often than not, are passed on to family and friends. Gifting suites, however, offer a distinct advantage by facilitating a more personal and direct way to place your product into celebrities' hands.



I recently attended the GBK Celebrity Gifting Suite for Oscar weekend at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills. The event was filled with A-list celebrities like Viola Davis, who were walking around getting introduced to a range of products from new stem cell-infused skincare to high-end ski accessories.The primary benefit of participating in gifting suites is the opportunity for extensive media coverage. The moment a celebrity is seen with your product or gives it a nod on social media, it acts as an unofficial stamp of approval for your brand. This kind of endorsement can significantly boost your brand's image and drive sales. These events offer a rare chance for brands to interact personally with celebrities, creating an intimate product experience that can lead to real interest and a strong connection.


Related: How Your Business Can Harness the Power of Celebrity Endorsements to Skyrocket Your Online Growth and Brand AwarenessUnderstanding the costsParticipation in celebrity gifting suites does come with a price tag. Depending on the prominence of the event and the suite's exclusivity, costs can range from a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars. This fee usually covers the space within the suite, inclusion in promotional materials and, sometimes, the opportunity to interact personally with the attending celebrities. For many brands, this investment is justified by the potential return in terms of publicity and the chance to align with the star power of the attendees.Presentation is keyWhen it comes to presenting your product in a gifting suite, the key is to stand out. Remember, celebrities and their entourages will be browsing many products, so making a memorable impression is crucial. High-quality, visually appealing packaging is a must. Additionally, consider offering a unique, hands-on experience with your product. Personalize the experience or the product itself to make it more memorable. For instance, engraving a celebrity's name on the product or offering a bespoke version can significantly increase its appeal.One brand that stood out to me at GBK's Gifting Suite was Jane Foodie, a woman-owned flash frozen food company based in Yonkers, NY. Her display caught my eye, easily the best one at the event. The canned foods reminded me of vintage Campbell cans; I could smell how delicious they smelled from across the venue as Jane prepared her favorites to share with the crowd. The take-home product was a cute brown paper bag-inspired insulated lunch box with samples of her food and a $300 gift certificate inside a sealed aluminum soup can.


Related: 10 Ways to Get a Celebrity to Use Your ProductFollowing up effectivelyThe work doesn't end once the event is over. Effective follow-up is crucial to capitalize on the initial engagement. Shortly after the event, send personalized thank-you notes to the celebrities who showed interest in your product, reminding them of your encounter. If applicable, include any photographs of them with your product you were able to capture during the event.Following up with the press is equally important. Prepare press releases that highlight your product's presence at the event and, if possible, any celebrity interactions. Be proactive in reaching out to industry publications, blogs and social media influencers who might be interested in your story.Moreover, keep an eye on social media for any mentions or photographs from celebrities who received your product. Engaging with these posts — whether through likes, comments or shares — can further amplify your product's visibility.


The bigger pictureWhile celebrity gifting suites offer a unique opportunity for brand exposure, they are just one part of a broader marketing strategy. Success in these venues requires careful planning, from selecting the right event to participate in to effectively presenting your product and following up afterward. The costs associated with these events can be significant, so it's vital to weigh them against the potential benefits for your brand.In conclusion, celebrity gifting suites around major events like the Oscars, Grammys and Golden Globe Awards present an enticing avenue for brands to gain visibility and endorsement. By understanding the benefits, costs and strategies for effective presentation and follow-up, brands can leverage these opportunities to catapult their products into the spotlight. As with any marketing endeavor, success in celebrity gifting suites demands creativity, preparation and a keen understanding of your audience. For those brands that navigate these waters successfully, the rewards can be as dazzling as the events themselves.Related: Celebrity Placements are the ""Holy Grail"" of Marketing.

24,Do You Own or Manage Your Business With Family Members? Here Are 3 Essential Tips to Create Value Together.,"Mar 20, 2024",Lauri Union,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/essential-tips-for-family-business-success/470689,"
Family businesses drive a substantial amount of economic activity. A recent Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report found that across 48 economies, ""75% of entrepreneurs and 81% of established business owners co-own and/or co-manage their businesses with family members.""I am the former president of my family's small company and the founding executive director of the Bertarelli Institute for Family Entrepreneurship at Babson College. The most important thing I stress to students is that I'm not trying to prepare them to join the family business. That may be the right option for some, but it's not the only option.Instead, I try to prepare students to create value across generations by drawing on their family's strengths, a perspective I call family entrepreneurship. The choice isn't a binary between ""Do things exactly how my family has been doing them,"" and ""Leave the family business entirely.""



From launching a startup in an adjacent industry to revamping the existing business, families fare best when each member taps into their interests and talents.Related: 7 Best Practices to Running a Healthy Family Business


Tip 1: Don't necessarily follow in your family's footstepsWhen I was 27, I succeeded my mom as president of our family's small business manufacturing steel building products. We were losing money. Our sales were down. My mom and I worked to transform our commodity product business into one that sold those products but differentiated ourselves with innovative and valuable customer service.Ultimately, we grew 12x over 14 years and eventually sold the company. Our legacy as a family wasn't this business. It is the entrepreneurial spirit we bring to everything we do. I learned that the best way to advance my family's goals wasn't necessarily to keep doing the same thing.A few years ago, a former student whose father co-founded a global family apparel manufacturing company spoke of the pressure he felt to live up to that legacy. ""How can I follow in your footsteps?"" the student asked his dad. The dad replied: ""I don't want you to. I want you to find your own shoes.""A family's source of strength — like the instinct to preserve a way of doing things that has worked for generations — can become a liability when it overreaches into a rejection of new paths or when a well-intentioned effort to pass along a business becomes an imposition young people want to escape. This dad's advice reveals a better path.


""Find your own shoes"" should be the motto for every family business navigating the delicate task of intergenerational continuity. No one benefits from a stale business where family employees feel like they must work there. Everyone benefits when people can explore their interests, whether they do so within the existing family business, outside of it, or something in between.Tip 2: Take advantage of individual and collective strengthsFamilies should stop asking, ""How do I preserve the success of my existing business?"" and instead ask, ""How can we draw on our individual and collective strengths to create value across multiple domains?""One of the biggest assets a family business has is a close connection to the next generation, who have a finger on the pulse of where the world is heading. Combining this intuition about change with the older generation's existing knowledge can be powerful — something I saw firsthand when my mom and I transformed our legacy steel business and boosted our family's entrepreneurial activities.A case study I co-wrote followed Diunsa, a Honduran family-run department store chain. When the pandemic began and stores closed, Diunsa had no online sales infrastructure. The Faraj siblings, all in their 20s, stepped up. The older generation followed their lead, and the siblings launched a website, pick and pack operation, and customer service support within three weeks.


Outside the business, a shift to a family entrepreneurship framework recognizes that a family member's success contributes to the family's legacy, no matter where or how it's achieved — and that it's easier to attain this success when every person pursues opportunities aligned with their interests and talents.Many forms of family entrepreneurship fall between working within the business and outside of it. Some family members may leave to work in another industry or company and return to the family business later, armed with a wealth of insights. Other family members may launch a startup in an adjacent industry.Brothers Jack and Max Barber started a food truck business while Jack was in college and Max was in high school. Their mom came from a bakery business. Their dad was the successor to the Barber Foods stuffed-chicken breast empire founded by Grandfather Gus. Jack and Max's company, Mainely Burgers, grew to operate several food trucks and restaurants. Research by Dr. Larissa Leitner indicates that the strength of existing family connections can help new ventures to succeed.Related: How to Sustain a Family Business Across Generations


Tip 3: Start with understanding and communicationFamily ties can be the engine of economic growth. They also pose challenges when relationships don't function well, which can happen often in families.Understanding and communication are especially important for families. It's impossible for different generations to work together if the older generation feels like their hard-earned wisdom isn't being heard and the younger generation feels like their elders don't get it. It's difficult to forge your own path if you're made to feel like you're abandoning your family.So, if you're one of the many people who runs or is part of a family business, start by having conversations with your family.

      Key Takeaways    



        Sarah Michelle Boes followed her passion for teaching into nursing school. 
      


        After passing her nurse practitioner's exam proved easier than expected, she wanted to instill confidence in others. 
      


        She put together her first course within a week of that exam — and became a millionaire within the year. 
      












This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sarah Michelle Boes, the founder of Sarah Michelle NP Reviews (SMNP), which was acquired by Blueprint Test Prep in 2022. Boes currently serves as the chief nursing officer for Blueprint Test Prep and hosts the podcast Becoming A Stress-Free Nurse Practitioner. She earned her BSN from the University of Kentucky, her MSN in Nursing Education from Western Governors University and her post-MSN-FNP from Eastern Kentucky University. The piece has been edited and condensed for clarity. Image Credit: Courtesy of Sarah Michelle BoesI grew up in rural Eastern Kentucky, and I always had this passion for being a teacher. I had my heart set on it. But my parents are teachers, and they're like, ""Absolutely not. You can't do that."" There are a lot of politics and bureaucracy within teaching. It's a lot more than just being an educator. Then, when I was a teenager, my grandmother was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. Without great access to premium healthcare in our area, we had to travel two hours to Lexington to get that diagnosis and receive a care plan that she could take back home. That was over the summer, so I went with her, and that was my first introduction to nursing at the Markey Cancer Center.



Those nurses were incredible. I feel like oncology nurses, in general, are kind of angels. Not only did they take care of her, but they also took care of me. It was just a great experience. So, knowing that I wasn't going to be able to be a teacher, I was like, Well, nursing — I feel like I could get something done. And there would be a teaching aspect because there's a lot of patient education, but I'd also get a human connection with people, which I thrive off of. So it was a no-brainer, and I attended the University of Kentucky, which guaranteed me admission to their program — and that's a really big deal.Related: This Nurse Turned $500 in Savings Into $100 Million in Sales After Sharing Her Hair Care Routine on YouTube. Now She's Revealing Her Secrets to Success.


I grappled with anxiety during nursing school. A class was notorious for weeding out people, and everyone dreaded taking it. I had a ton of anxiety in that class in particular, so much so that my instructor was like, ""I don't think nursing is for you. You're too anxious to be a safe nurse."" I had to choose to stay. The grading scale in nursing is also very different: In most programs, anything less than a 76 means you fail — and on the first exam in that class, I got a 74. I literally failed the first exam by one question. So I had to figure out how to contend with my anxiety, to think about the tools I could use.So, I started to figure out how to manage that class and my anxiety. Then, I began tutoring, ultimately quitting my full-time job as a manager to help students full-time. I taught them the skills that had helped me tackle that challenging class in a different way, and my anxiety didn't pick up again until I was a nurse practitioner — because it had been a long time since I'd taken a high-stakes exam. There was no one to turn to get perspective because I was the first nurse in my family, and I didn't know many people who were nurse practitioners.What's more, I took my nurse practitioner exam in the prime of Covid, May 2020. So it was chaos. Testing centers were down, and some places would let you take it online at home, but others wouldn't. By the time I took the exam in the middle of May, it had been canceled five times, three of which I'd already arrived at the testing center. So, there was a lot of anxiety involved. I was like, Am I ever going to take this test? My job is riding on this.Related: Nurse Makes $2 Million In One Year With Side Hustle Selling Class Notes Online


I was so stressed that I ended up breaking a tooth in my sleep because I was grinding them so hard. I was going to have to get a dental implant to the tune of $7,000; my hair was also falling out. But I finished the 175-question exam in less than an hour, and I passed. I was like, I can't believe I was stressing over this thing. This was so much easier than my nursing exam. All I needed was confidence in myself because I'd spent years in schools and hundreds of hours in clinical preparing. None of my reviews had given me that confidence.That realization — and the fact that I still had to pay for a $7,000 dental implant — motivated me to put together my first review course. I started my business because I was like, I can't afford this $7,000 implant. I figured if I put together a little review course and even just earned $500, that would help pay for it. And I started to think about how it could be done differently — how it could be less like someone lecturing you and more like studying with a friend. So, I came up with a Q&A approach, which I'd used as a tutor in nursing school and when I taught nursing students at the collegiate level.Within a week of passing the exam, I made my first three-hour course. I actually gave it out to all of my classmates for free. There were 30 of us, and I was like, ""Hey guys, I'll give you this course for free if you invite someone else into the group when I give it to you."" I gave the course to the first 100 people who came into the group. Then, not even a couple of days later, someone who had taken the course went on to pass, and it kind of exploded through word of mouth. It got wild really quickly. The first person I tried to sell it to for $25 got mad because her friend had gotten it for free, so she haggled me down to $15. Still, I made $1,000 on the first day I started selling, and I didn't even make $1,000 in a week as a nurse. I was like, What if I made $1,000 a day, every day? What would life look like?Related: Her 'Crude Prototype' and $50 Craigslist Purchase Launched a Side Hustle That Hit $1 Million in Sales — Now the Business Generates Up to $20 Million a Year


By the end of June and July, I'd surpassed what I used to make annually as a nurse. I told my nurse practitioner job I wouldn't be coming. I wanted to see how far I could take the business, but being reasonable and never having run a business before, I kept my full-time teaching job, just in case. But every spare hour I had, every weekend, was all about the business. Because I was so anxious about it being a startup, fragile and new, I waited to quit my teaching job until I made $1 million. We hit seven figures in seven months.About a year and a half in, I was still using third-party software to host my courses — nothing was in-house or really in unison. It got to the point where my students were literally breaking the software; I needed my own. We actually spent $100,000 trying to build an app that ended up completely falling apart. That was really hard, but we just kept running up against technology, and I realized I was the bottleneck to this thing. The business wanted to grow, so I started looking into other options.We considered a sale and put out some teasers, hoping to get constructive feedback. As it turned out, the test prep provider Blueprint had some internal meetings about the prospect before I even sent out the teaser. They had medical stuff, and they had LSAT stuff, but they didn't have any nursing material at the time. And I wanted to take some pressure off myself because a week into sending out the teasers, I found out I was pregnant. I never want people to think I sold because I was pregnant; it just coincided with the timing.Related: I Turned My Side Hustle Into a Passive Income Stream That's Earned More Than $1 Million — But Making Money Isn't Even the Best Part


We loved the Blueprint team, but the deal just wasn't right at first. My husband and I had decided on a number before we had a single conversation, and I'd recommend any entrepreneur do the same. Otherwise, it can be hard to navigate a deal when emotions are running high. So the first deal wasn't our number, and we walked away. Then they came back with our number, and we ended up selling around the two-year mark. That money has been life-changing.At 36 weeks pregnant, we found out that my daughter was going to have a congenital heart defect. We had no idea. So everything kind of flipped on its head really quickly. When I gave birth, the money gave us the flexibility and ability to be with our daughter when she needed it the very most. She had six surgeries in her first five months of life, two of which were open-heart surgeries. So, very crazy, chaotic times, and what a blessing to be able to have not only a maternity leave, but also a medical leave, and to be able to be fully present for that — and not only me but also my husband. We could be there together and support one another.Now, my daughter is 19 months old, and for the past year, we've been working to do a legacy gift to our local children's hospital, where they literally saved her life. Hopefully, next month, fingers crossed, everything's going to be finished, and they're actually going to dedicate the Norton Children's Heart Institute to my daughter. They are trying to build out a premier heart program there, and you have to have the funds to be able to do that. So the money gives us a lot of freedom and flexibility — my husband's also starting up his own business — but our work with the children's hospital is the most meaningful and impactful accomplishment.This article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of being a Young Entrepreneur®.

26,4 Tips for Growing Your Women-Owned Small Business in 2024,"Mar 19, 2024",Veronica Fernandez,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-ways-to-grow-your-woman-owned-business-in-2024/470624,"
Every day, women across America are turning their dreams into reality, starting businesses with a simple spark of an idea and a persistent drive to succeed. If you're a woman who owns a small or medium-sized business (SMB), you have contributed to the transformative force shaping our economy. Not only have women-owned businesses significantly boosted the U.S. GDP, but you've also created nearly half of all new businesses for the past three years straight. However, your entrepreneurial journey goes beyond the numbers. To be a woman in business is a testament to resilience, courage and an unwavering spirit of self-advocacy.Despite your contribution to the economy, overall, women entrepreneurs are still plagued with challenges, even more than their male counterparts. The National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO) found that women entrepreneurs – especially women of color – often face challenges accessing funding, building a support network, balancing business and family life, cultural biases and owning their accomplishments.As we celebrate International Women's Month, it's essential to recognize how far you've come as a business owner and the resilience you hold to turn obstacles into opportunities. To continue your momentum, here are four powerful strategies to propel your business forward.



Related: 3 Ways Women Empower Other Women (and 3 Ways They Don't)1. Prioritize building your networkYou don't need to attend a networking event to make solid connections. Often, building a meaningful network for your business can happen in unexpected places. You never know who you may meet in an elevator, at a coffee shop, or on a plane. So, having a quick and concise elevator pitch of your product or service will be crucial as you move through the world. These conversations don't have to feel forced. Effective networking doesn't always center around what you can gain for your business; it's about building lasting relationships, sharing knowledge and offering value.


These interactions can foster a powerful sense of solidarity, particularly for women in business. Connecting with other women entrepreneurs and customers can offer a fresh perspective on your business or provide new opportunities to create a supportive ecosystem within your community. By embracing this spirit of collective success, you can enhance inclusivity in your network and champion success for everyone involved.Related: Networking: The Most Important Thing Women Should Do for Their Careers -- But Aren't2. Establish your business identityEstablishing what your business is about goes beyond identifying a logo or tagline; it's about defining what makes you unique and leveraging that in every interaction. If you haven't already, do some research and recollection. Consider your business' strengths and what sets it apart from everything else. Research is essential to establishing your brand, and you may need to continually invest in your own knowledge as you run and grow your business.Having a clear mission is also important as you build your brand. While this doesn't come overnight, it can be a guiding compass for yourself and your commitment to your customers. Setting goals and identifying your core values will help propel your business forward. Always remember to embrace mistakes as opportunities for growth and learning.


3. Leverage financial resourcesEqual access to capital has been a long-documented barrier for women entrepreneurs, hindering their ability to start and scale their businesses to their full potential. Times are changing, but not fast enough. Of the 42,000 small business loan applications approved by the SBA in 2023, only 21% represented women-owned businesses. Furthermore, the approved loans for women-owned businesses accounted for only 16% of the total $20 billion allocated funds.In light of these setbacks, there are resources out there dedicated to supporting your success. Set some free time aside to research organizations that offer free resources and educational tools to help boost your business. Grant programs like Fundica's recent collaboration with Visa offer underserved small business communities access to additional sources of working capital, which can be a game-changer in overcoming financial hurdles. There are also VC firms specifically focused on scaling female-founded startups – for example, Anthemis' Female Innovators Lab Fund helps design, source, and grow female-founded embedded finance startups.As a woman in business, your entrepreneurial journey won't always resemble a linear trajectory to success. While it may feel like you have to take some steps back, the lessons you gain in between foster the resilience and resourcefulness needed to take strides forward.Related: 5 Ways to Support Women-Owned Businesses


4. Don't be afraid to make changesWhen you analyze your business metrics over time, you're bound to spot areas where you can improve. Keeping a pulse on the evolving needs of your customers will help you get ahead of most of these improvements, turning challenges into opportunities for innovation. What once worked for your business in the past may not work for new generations of customers. That's why it's vital to treat every customer interaction as a learning experience and take their feedback in stride.For example, Visa's recent Global Shopping Index found that 76% of U.S. shoppers would not complete a sale if they didn't have access to the digital features they wanted, like preferred payments. Adapting by implementing digital payment tools can help streamline your customers' payment experience and may even give you the ability to reach more customers in other regions.Start by taking a test-and-learn approach when you implement a new change, whether that's with your marketing, product/ service offerings or your business operations. Don't be afraid to experiment with AI-enhanced technology, either. These tools can enhance and automate customer care for your business and provide personalized product or service recommendations based on your customer's behaviors and preferences. And remember that you are the unique ingredient in your business, but you are not in it alone. There are all sorts of resources available to help you start, run and grow your business. In addition, there is a community of other women business owners facing similar challenges and joys who can help propel you to success. Now is the perfect time to shape the future of your business.

27,How to Avoid These Common Communication Blunders in the Workplace,"Mar 19, 2024",Cynthia Kay,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-fix-poor-communication-in-the-workplace/470928,"
As the owner of a media production and communications consulting company, I see terrible communication firsthand. I want to share a few real stories illustrating three common communication problems, and then provide several ways to improve communication within a company.InconsistencyMany are jumping on the bandwagon of employee storytelling to make people feel like they are a part of the organization. A large furniture manufacturer decided to showcase employees' good work in a monthly video communication that my company produced. The manufacturer reached out to employees to have them submit their story or the story of a colleague. The senior vice president thought it would be fun to interview those selected in a talk show format. We produced a few but stopped because the leader could not find time to do the show.Communication programs that start and then fizzle out leave employees frustrated and skeptical. (Note: I warned the company against using this format. It's great if a leader has the time and is committed to this program. I did not feel it would work here. It did not.)



Another client decided to do customer webinars. They started with two a month but soon discovered that gathering the content was time-consuming and quickly fell behind. After making a big splash about the effort, they suspended the effort. They then started again with a scaled-back offering of once a month. While it did not have a disastrous effect on their reputation, it would have been better to start slowly, build an audience and then expand.Related: Correcting Leadership Communication Mishaps


Poor content and messagingGetting the messaging right is critical for communication to be successful. That means getting input from the right people at the right time. For example, one of my customers had to delay a product launch. The product was ready. However, the team working on the various communication assets failed to include key experts early on. When the marketing tools were submitted for approval, they discovered that the messaging was not on target. Print and videos had to be reworked, which increased costs and caused delays in the launch.Communication that fails to exciteSeveral years ago, a friend of mine worked at a major accounting firm. He had been lobbying to have me come in and work with some of their teams to improve their presentations. He was not successful until this happened:An audit team went in to present to a client and renew the contract for the next year. They were informed after the meeting that the business would go to a competitor. When pressed to understand what happened, the client reported that the audit team's presentation was boring. That's right, boring.I know what you are thinking: ""Audits, albeit necessary, are not really exciting to most people."" That's not the point. The client wanted to be engaged, perhaps even wowed. The team failed to communicate their excitement and desire to work with this client, and they lost the business.


Communication barriersOrganizations have great discipline when it comes to areas such as production or finance, but not when it comes to communication. Some don't recognize or prioritize the need for communication programs. They assume that it will happen naturally. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Over the years, many organizations have become siloed. Everyone has an initiative, but departments have no tools to collaborate and share information.Reliance on voicemail, email, and social media increases miscommunication because people are not talking to each other. Instead of helping us, technology becomes a reason not to communicate. While virtual meetings have exploded, few know how to be effective, whether they are leading or participating. People have gotten sloppy about preparation and presentation.These barriers can cause communication to get sidetracked and negatively impact business results, as my examples demonstrate. Much of the answer to overcoming communication barriers starts with senior executives and others in positions of influence who make it a priority.Related: How to Harness the Power of Communication When Facing Challenges


Three steps to get communication on trackThe first step to improving communication is to put a purposeful communication plan in place. One that is clear, consistent and achievable. Remember my storytelling example above? The plan does not need to be complicated. It does need to consider the entire organization — from those on the plant floor or front lines to those in the field and behind the scenes. What do people need to know? What are the best ways to communicate information so everyone can access it? What is the frequency of communication?The second step is to build an organization of good communicators. Numerous studies report that 86% of employees and executives cite ineffective communication and collaboration as the main cause of workplace failures. Communication is not simply the job of human resources, the communication, or the marketing department. Everyone needs to be engaged. Some people are naturally good at this, but most need help. There are learning opportunities that can be accessed from various sources, but be sure that the level and content are appropriate for the team.The third step is to use the right tools to share communication. This can be an internal portal, system of e-blasts, live meetings or live stream events. There are so many tools that it can be overwhelming. A communication consultant can help you navigate them, but the best advice is to use the simplest technology to get the job done. Finally, the results of the communication plan should be monitored. This can be something as simple as a communication survey.Related: How Effective Employee Communication Boosts Productivity

29,3 Ways Founders Can Connect With Their Customers to Drive Sales,"Mar 18, 2024",Thomas Strider,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-effective-ways-to-connect-with-your-customers/470871,"
In today's market, the bond between founders and customers is more than a transaction; it's the cornerstone of sustainable growth and brand loyalty. Modern consumers want authenticity more than ever. They find it difficult to connect with faceless entities and want to follow people rather than businesses.This shift towards personal connection in marketing stems from a saturated market where consumers are bombarded with choices and advertisements daily. Personal stories and authentic interactions cut through the noise in this crowded space, creating a memorable impression. Consumers crave realness and transparency at a time when these qualities are scarce in the world of business.So, how do you go about deepening your connection with your target audience? Here are three strategies that can turn your customer interactions into a powerful engine for sales growth.



1. Personalize your approach with behind-the-scenes storytellingIt's one thing to sell a product. It's another to tell a story and share fascinating details that resonate.Imagine a founder sharing their journey, the highs and lows, through a series of behind-the-scenes content. This narrative isn't about humanizing the brand; it's about creating a shared experience. When customers see the sweat and tears behind a product, they're not just buying an item; they're investing in a piece of your process and founder's story.


So, how do you start?Weekly emails or social media posts that peel back the curtain on your process make customers feel like they're part of your journey. To do this effectively, begin by mapping out key milestones in your company's history or product development process. For each milestone, identify a story or challenge you faced and how you overcame it. These stories form the basis of your content.Next, use visuals like photos, videos, or even simple sketches to bring these stories to life. Visual content not only increases engagement but also helps to humanize your brand further.In your communication, be transparent about the obstacles you've encountered and how you've addressed them. This transparency fosters trust and relatability. Moreover, invite your audience to contribute their thoughts or similar experiences through comments or direct messages, turning your storytelling into a two-way conversation.


Publicly tell people the ""why"" behind your products, services, and company by integrating customer testimonials or user-generated content that aligns with your narrative. This validates your claims and amplifies your community's voice, making your brand's story part of their own stories.Like successful pitch decks showcase the story behind your brand, so should your content marketing and advertisements. Bringing the ""real"" to your business breeds authenticity, and that authentic connection will drive your business's growth. Remember, the goal is to broadcast and engage in meaningful conversations that build long-term relationships.Related: 8 Effective Ways to Connect With Your Customers2. Leverage technology for personal connectionsAI tools are booming, so personal connection using automation seems like an oxymoron. Yet, technology can be the very tool that brings you closer to your ICP.


Consider implementing AI chatbots that do more than answer queries. Work with tools, consultants, and language model professionals to custom-tailor AI to chat with your customers.Implement these chatbots on your company website and train them to initiate conversations based on customer behavior. Offer personalized recommendations or even simply check in with website visitors. Sometimes, a simple ""How are things going?"" goes a long way, and this part of your customer experience can be automated.This approach won't replace human interaction, of course, but it will enhance it by making your brand present and proactive in your customer's lives.The key? Ensure these AI communications feel personal and specific, not just like another automated message in their inbox or as a popup. This takes a bit more effort to implement, but the investment is worth it for the long-term growth of your brand and business.


Related: 6 Ways Connections Create a Sense of Belonging Anywhere With Any Workplace3. Create exclusive communitiesImagine a space where your customers can gather to discuss your product and share their stories, challenges and triumphs.There's a particular company on the rise called Skool, which enables businesses and personal brands alike to do just this. Other great platform choices, such as Circle, Mighty Networks or Kajabi, enable seamless community building. These platforms allow you to make posts and help your customers, but they also give users the flexibility to post and communicate with each other.An exclusive community for customer discussion could take many other forms as well: a Facebook group, a Slack channel or a dedicated forum on your website.


The goal for your community is to foster a sense of belonging and mutual support, turning your customer base into a tight-knit community. Offer insider access, sneak peeks, and the opportunity for feedback. The more valued and listened that customers feel, the more likely they are to advocate for your brand organically.Over the long term, these communities become a word-of-mouth marketing machine.

I tell them all the time: I'm a teammate. I might be the captain, but I'm a teammate. I understand the things you're going through. I'm in this fight with you. And I think they respect that and they understand that. Walking out that door is a moment I'll never forget and one I'll cherish forever.""


The meaning of his mantra ""Choose Hard""""It all started a couple of years ago when I was in the Notre Dame weight room and was working out as our players were being pushed hard. And I remember thinking that you can choose to go through the motions or you can choose to go as hard as you can. And that's when I came up with this thought of 'Choose Hard.' We put up a sign you see when you walk into this building that says 'Choose Hard.' Because when you walk into Notre Dame football, you've got to have that mindset. We're going to choose hard today in practice, choose hard today in meetings, choose hard today in the weight room. And for the players, you're going to be challenged in the classroom, right? You're going to be in class with some of the most intelligent people in this world. And it's difficult, but ultimately you've chosen to come here so choose hard, accept it, and know that the rewards from choosing hard every single day can't be found anywhere else.""Related: He Built a Personal Finance App That Manages $8 Billion for Half a Million Customers.

I spend a lot of time evaluating everything we were doing. Why aren't we playing better? What are we doing schematically? Is there something our players don't understand? Losses happen and it's a part of life. But they hurt. As a leader, you don't want to have too many.

Now if they can go somewhere else and make a lot more money, no matter what type of company you're running, they're going to probably leave. So we have to make sure that our players can maximize the opportunities of name, image and likeness. That's important, but what else keeps them at Notre Dame? What else attracts them here? And you've got to believe it's your culture. You've got to believe it's the way they're treated. Do they enjoy being part of your program? That's so important. And that's a message for myself and our other coaches. Let's make sure that as hard as we push them, as demanding as we are, we are not demeaning.

31,3 Ways to Make Sure Every Aspect of Your Business Ties Back to Your Purpose,"Mar 15, 2024",Nancy Solari,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-ways-to-build-a-company-culture-based-on-your-purpose/470280,"
In the flow of a workday, it's easy to spend your time putting out fires — we've all been there. This reactionary brand of management results in a disconnected, chaotic feeling for everyone from the workforce to the customers. Focusing on your original vision for your company can create a synergy that connects your staff, your clients and the community you serve.It's possible to create a culture of purpose in your workforce and keep a positive, engaging reputation in the marketplace, but this will require that your executive team stays true to the original motivation you had in your mind and heart when you began your journey in business.Related: Embrace Your Purpose As a Path to Success



1. Capture standout employees in the interviewLeadership and staff can work together to discover common ground and agree on goals, but this process begins in the interview. One of the best predictors of loyalty is a candidate's desire to focus on meaningful work.I run my company as a blind CEO. When I interview a candidate, I mostly want to learn why they want to work for me. I'm always shocked when job seekers reveal they have never been to the website as opposed to those who are excited to share why they feel connected to our mission. When I interview a candidate, it's often the vulnerability in their answers that speaks to me. Sometimes the person I'm interviewing tells me of a personal disability or limitation, which to me is an act of openness and transparency. I love to hear people say they are passionate about working in an inspirational environment. When our conversation begins, I'm listening for a story.


What many candidates don't know is the interviewer is waiting for them to have their breakout moment. This departure from the usual Q&A often reveals their passion for the work or vulnerability.It's important to make sure your interview questions allow you to see a prospective employee's connection to your mission. You can start by asking candidates what measurable impact they would like to make in the position offered. You can also find out how they envision their work life five years from now.2. Create a culture of engagementDoing purposeful work means the executive team must create educational opportunities for staff as well as clients, extending engagement with the company beyond ""business hours."" This is a chance to show your team and your customers that their needs matter beyond the job description or the product or service you offer.Having a corporate reputation as a company that births new leaders and supports hard work and ambition will go a long way toward retaining good team members with the savvy to innovate, create and energize your workforce. Whether it is a group meeting or a corporate retreat, it's important to mix staff together, allowing employees from across departments and positions to collaborate, exchange ideas, rise as leaders and support each other.


This kind of shift can start by simply reassigning tasks or creating challenges that give employees a chance to spread their wings. You can take some projects off the administrative assistant's plate or reassign some items on the to-do list to a staff member who has shown initiative. A team member could send out invitations to meetings or reminders to committee members taken from a list of goals. A staffer could also create a committee to help plan a corporate event and see it through.Keep a watchful eye on employees who stand out and give them the opportunity to be seen as experts. Let some be advisors, coaches or provide support to other team members. This will make the staff feel recognized and encourage others to rise to that purposeful level. This kind of support will give you a ""pool"" of potential leaders, helping your team members feel that their contributions are noticed and rewarded.Related: 3 Reasons Why a Strong Purpose Is a Good Business Idea3. Build a positive online reputation for your businessAlthough you can never eliminate negative reviews, the best approach to a positive corporate reputation is actively implementing a variety of ways to get reviews from employees and customers alike. While it's estimated that 99% of customers read reviews from time to time, only 13% would choose a product or service from a company with a two-star rating.


There are several proven ways to generate positive reviews. The process can be as simple as using comment cards. You can also ask for an email address from the customer. Some businesses have a physical ""register;"" others have an email link where people can sign in and provide this information. From there, it's easy to follow up and ask for a rating or comment. Other stores offer rewards in exchange for reviews. This offer is usually seen on banners or signs within the physical store, on the receipt (physical or via email) or on the company's homepage. Some businesses use a QR code leading directly to the online review spot; you have likely seen a kiosk within the store allowing immediate feedback.Another way to generate rave reviews is to get endorsements or recommendations from businesses you have partnered with over the years. These allies can speak of important attributes of your company that go beyond a rating system or short comment and may attract traffic to your website and new clients responding to the positive vibes.The mantra ""If you don't ask, you don't get"" works well here. There are more ways to get positive feedback for your business than ever before thanks to evolving technology. Rather than running from a corporate fear of bad reviews, make it your business to seek and obtain the best reviews by engaging the community in the process.You can direct your company's reputation by finding new ways to engage your workforce and the people you serve. By promoting outstanding employees, offering training and opportunities for leadership and by making positive feedback a priority, your company can stop putting out fires and start basking in the culture of purpose you always intended.

32,The Counter Service at Yo' Mama's Is Just As Unique As Its Name. Here's Why People Come Back for the Experience as Much as the Food.,"Mar 15, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-customer-experience-at-yo-mamas-is-just-as-unique-as/471207,"
The environment at Yo' Mama's, a comfort food restaurant in Birmingham, Alabama, is just what it sounds like: a warm space that makes customers feel at home. Owned and operated by Crystal Peterson and her family, the establishment wins over customers through its quick and engaging counter service.Crystal and her mom got their start selling food at jazz festivals in Florida back in 2011. When they moved into a brick-and-mortar in 2014, Crystal developed her unique business model through market research.""I actually [ate] at every single restaurant I could think of that could be comparable to [mine] and [looked] at what was missing,"" she revealed. ""Was it the customer service aspect? Was it the portion size? Was it the flavor?""



What she found was that counter service is a win for both the owner and the customer. When guests aren't waiting thirty minutes to order their food, Crystal doesn't have to stress about turning tables and can provide the quality customer service that is so crucial to success.It's also important to understand your customer base. Crystal's restaurant tends to draw in travelers and workers looking for a bite to eat during their mid-day break. Because of this, she aims to create a ""getaway"" space where customers can relax in the middle of a busy day and enjoy a delicious meal without worrying about long wait times.


Yo' Mama's regulars, like Yelp Elite Delia S., love the way Crystal and her staff approach customer service, greeting customers at the counter and walking them through the menu.""I remember the interpersonal contact that this restaurant does on a consistent basis,"" Delia said. ""The vibe I got was, 'We're excited you're here. We appreciate your business, and we also want to make this an establishment where you will continue to visit and tell other people about it.'""Key to Yo' Mama's top-tier service is Crystal's involvement in the business's day-to-day operations. She knows that morale starts from the top and makes an effort to be at the restaurant as often as she can, engaging with her staff and customers.""What I've known is that workers work better when the owner's in the building,"" she said. ""You get a better product, so the customer is more satisfied.""


Crystal has also made her business a hit by focusing on a niche. Her gluten-free menu attracts people who can't satisfy their dietary needs at just any restaurant, and it also creates an element of surprise and delight for customers who don't come in looking for gluten-free food and still enjoy their meal.This focus on accommodating dietary restrictions has helped Yo' Mama's create a strong community where every diner feels included.""I've literally had customers that have come in and cried because their kid has never been able to eat in a restaurant because they are gluten intolerant. And they [can] actually sit there and enjoy a meal with them instead of having to bring a snack in for them to eat or get[ting] food from another restaurant [to] bring to them.""Building this kind of welcoming and accessible space for the local community aids Crystal's ultimate goal as a business owner to support the local economy. She emphasized that if you and your neighbors don't spend your money where you live, nobody else will, especially if everyone commutes to larger cities or towns.


""You have to be a citizen, and [being] a citizen equates to using your money right by your house instead of going to the other side of town,"" she said.Spending money at Black-owned businesses, who are often hindered by stereotypes, is especially important. Delia makes an effort not only to visit local Black-owned businesses but shout them out on Yelp whenever she can, letting people know that these spots are for everyone to visit and enjoy.""Oftentimes in restaurants, I don't think the playing field is fair. As a Yelp Elite, I am more drawn to trying as many of the smaller, often Black-owned restaurants that our city has to offer because there's such a large Black community—but that doesn't mean that only Black people are eating Black food. Restaurants are spaces that have the ability to traverse across class, race, region. You go into Yo' Mama's, and you see a diversity of people there gathering around this comfort food.""Delia also makes sure all her reviews are thoughtful, filling gaps on Yelp Pages by uploading missing photos of dishes and menus and choosing not to post about negative experiences unless she has valuable tips for owners or other guests.


Crystal brings this same level of intentionality to her review responses as an owner. She has found that some consumers only review a business when they want to express frustration or have expectations that Crystal can't satisfy, like an issue with her pricing. She chooses not to let these customers bring down her energy or service-focused mindset. By managing her emotions in the face of backlash, Crystal is able to engage with customers in a more productive way.""Some [customers] are coming in looking to lose. Some of the problems that people have don't even include me. So if I can control my emotions to change your emotions, then maybe we can win this and you can actually enjoy the experience.""In addition to an inviting restaurant atmosphere, Yo' Mama's believes in:Understanding your customers and your role in the business community. Gain an edge by researching your competitors and thinking about how you can fill gaps in their offerings.Restaurants as a space for diverse, inclusive community. Accommodating the needs of all your customers, including those with dietary restrictions, can help everyone who enters your space feel seen and welcome.Being flexible in the face of chaos. Navigate unexpected business obstacles by keeping the well-being of your customers and staff at the forefront.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Crystal and Delia, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.

33,She Started a Side Hustle While Working 2 Jobs as a Line Cook for $22 an Hour Combined — Now It's an 8-Figure Brand You've Probably Seen on TV,"Mar 13, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/an-apron-side-hustle-turned-into-a-multimillion-dollar-brand/470978,"
For Ellen Bennett, founder of kitchenware brand Hedley & Bennett, food has been a life-long love. ""I'm half-Mexican and half-English, and so I grew up with this very unusual combination of eating tamales and caldo de pollo, and things that are very Mexican, alongside shepherd's pie and tea with my English grandpa,"" she tells Entrepreneur.But before Bennett built the apron business named for her English and Mexican families, she attended culinary school in Mexico City, where it was more affordable than in the U.S. She took modeling jobs and translation gigs to support herself there, then moved back to Los Angeles, where she was raised, to work at some of the city's best restaurants.Image Credit: Shayan Asgharnia. Ellen Bennett.



""I've always put one foot in front of the other towards the thing that I want to do, never stop and don't stare too long because then you'll get scared and won't do it,"" Bennett says. ""So I keep myself moving always and forever. And I feel like that has been one of the successful traits for me: I don't analyze — I just do.""In 2012, at 24, Bennett was doing a whole lot: She worked as a line cook at Providence, which boasts a two-star Michelin rating, and at Bäco Mercat, pulling in $22 an hour between the two jobs. In the mornings, she also worked as a personal chef for a family. ""It was around the clock,"" she recalls, adding that 14-hour days within the industry were par for the course.


Related: She Used $10,000 in Savings to Turn Her Side Hustle Into an 8-Figure Brand You've Probably Seen""If I can make the [equivalent] uniform piece of dignity [and] roll [that] into this world of cooking, maybe I change this whole industry.""Despite the ""hustle"" of her day-to-day, Bennett had a big idea, one that served as a ""funny through line"" from her life as a ""hardcore line cook"" to the ""other life"" she led — in Mexico City she'd often donned suits for work events, and as an avid runner with marathons under her belt, she knew a thing or two about athletic attire that could stand up to the rigors of the sport.""So I combined the two in my head,"" Bennett says, ""and I thought, Man, if I can make the [equivalent] uniform piece of dignity [and] roll [that] into this world of cooking, maybe I change this whole industry. Because we're getting our asses handed to us. We work so hard, [and] everybody looks like shit.""


A few weeks later, a chef at one of the restaurants where Bennett worked presented her with the perfect opportunity to start her side hustle. He said he was going to order aprons for everybody, and Bennett, who'd been thinking nonstop about chef coats and various aspects of the uniform, ""blurted out in Ellen Bennett fashion"" that she had an apron company.Image Credit: Courtesy of Hedley & Bennett. Related: At 23, She Started a Side Hustle for 'Quick Money.' Now the Business Brings in More Than $1 Million a Month — and Boasts Celebrity Fans.Of course, Bennett didn't have a business at that point, but she said she'd been working on an idea — ""and by working, I meant it was in my head,"" she admits. Still, she managed to convince the chef to place an order for 40 aprons, and with ""absolutely nothing other than willpower and chutzpah,"" she ""started the whole damn thing."" Bennett showed up anywhere she could find chefs who might be interested in her aprons — from farmers' markets to Eater LA events.


""I would walk up to people and just be like, 'Hey, I'm a cook at Providence. I work there, and I have an apron company. Can I show you what I'm working on?'"" Bennett says. ""So it was very much from a place of humility, but I also was shameless about talking to anyone. And I never hid behind a computer waiting for people to email me. I just stood in front of you, and if you had ears, I was going to talk to you.""""'Oh my god, Japanese denim? That's cool. American canvas? Hell yeah.'""Bennett didn't have a sewing background, but she'd always loved design, so her process in those early days ""was truly scrappy."" She'd sit down with chefs and listen to their pain points (which she knew all too well as an industry professional), drilling down on the finer yet crucial details that so often went ignored in the apron game — like durable fabric.Image Credit: Courtesy of Hedley & Bennett.


Quickly, Bennett leaned into ""elevating the core materials,"" much like how a Michelin-starred restaurant raises the bar for food. ""We're still just selling food,"" Bennett explains, ""but it's the best fish you've ever had in the world because we sourced it from the best place. So I applied that same logic."" And Bennett's aprons were an instant hit.Related: For Years, This Black Founder Learned an Uncommon But Essential Craft on the Side. Now His Creations Are Beloved By Celebrity Chefs — and Can Sell for More Than $1,000.""These chefs got really nerdy about it,"" Bennett says. ""They're like, 'Oh my god, Japanese denim? That's cool. American canvas? Hell yeah'. And then, instead of using plastic hardware, I'd be like, 'What if we use brass hardware?' And they'd be like, 'Yes, I love that.' So I essentially just collaborated and listened.""Now, Hedley & Bennett is an eight-figure brand, and if you've tuned in to any cooking show or show about cooking, you've no doubt seen it in action: 70% of chefs on the Food Network wear Hedley & Bennett aprons, and nearly every chef who appears on Top Chef and The Bear is donning one too, according to data provided by the brand. Hedley & Bennett also boasts partnerships with The Beatles, NASA and Crocs, among others, and has since expanded into general kitchenware, including knives, potholders and more.


""Even if you go out and raise $50 million, you still have to build community to get customers.""Although Bennett's apron idea resonated with other chefs immediately and has seen enormous growth in the past decade-plus, she stresses that Hedley & Bennett was far from an overnight success — and that, realistically, there's no such thing.The brand didn't have any outside investment. Instead, she grew Hedley & Bennett ""the old-school way,"" reinvesting every penny back into the business as she built ""brick by brick,"" ""street by street"" and ""customer by customer,"" securing that essential brand loyalty along the way. And the people she sold her aprons to in the beginning remain customers, Bennett notes: ""There's a love that exists that you can't buy from an Instagram ad.""""Even if you go out and raise $50 million, you still have to build community to get customers,"" Bennett says. ""You just happen to have more money in the bank. Are you willing to show up and talk to people? Are you willing to listen, pivot, adapt your product to them and what they actually need? Everyone goes through the same struggles. It's just how many resources you can throw at it. And because I had limited resources, I got a lot more creative than I would have if I had all the money in the world.""


Related: Using Social Media Alone to Build Your Brand's Online Community Means You Risk Losing It All. Here's Why.What's more, Hedley & Bennett's initial business-to-business (B2B) model meant a ""slow and steady"" approach that benefited from ""brutally honest chefs"" who didn't mince words when it came to letting Bennett know what was and wasn't working. The feedback was invaluable, but despite an influx of requests for additional products, Hedley & Bennett remained ""hyper-focused"" on putting out the perfect customizable apron — until the pandemic hit. We need to actually create a systemized streamlined menu of how we outfit these restaurants in a way that we can scale it, Bennett realized.So Hedley & Bennett incorporated a direct-to-consumer approach. Within one month, the brand went from shipping everything internally to shipping with third-party logistics (3PL). ""It was not clean or smooth or anything like that,"" Bennett says. ""It was just the right thing for the business, and the whole world couldn't meet in person. So it was like, 'How do we get it online as fast as possible?'""From there, Bennett considered all of the feedback they'd received — and which products it made sense to tackle next. ""We're like, 'Okay, well, what's the natural extension from aprons that's an essential, because we don't like making tchotchkes.'"" Bennett recalls. ""We're all about longevity, quality on things you need, not just like a lemon squeezer, which is fine, but you can squeeze a lemon with your hands, too."" That led the brand to knives.


Image Credit: Shelby Moore.""There's nothing wrong with taking longer to build something great.""Hedley & Bennett's journey has been lengthy and full of ""little peaks and valleys"" trending upward overall, but because she's ""such an action-oriented person,"" Bennett says she rarely dwells on what she didn't do along the way.Still, in the beginning, Bennett does wish she'd taken a step back to value herself and her contributions the way that other people did. ""I don't mean that in an ego-driven way,"" she says. ""It's not about being like I'm the coolest, I'm the best, but it's simply respecting yourself for the work that you did and saying, 'Not only did I build the table — I built the chair that I got to sit in at the table. I made this.'""

34,6 Reasons Why You Need to Attend Marketing Conferences,"Mar 12, 2024",Ross Kernez,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-importance-of-attending-marketing-conferences/470558,"
Attending a marketing conference could be one of the most profitable investments of your time and money to bolster your brand and increase your marketing know-how. Marketing conferences are the hotspot for learning the latest trends in the marketing industry, developing your self-confidence in the world of marketing and building your network.There are a myriad of marketing conferences worldwide that instruct professionals on how to foster effective marketing techniques and teach them new skill sets that can be the catalyst for business growth. Ultimately, marketing conferences can help business owners, marketing teams, and interested individuals understand how to generate more revenue through marketing. The reasons why you need to attend a marketing conference are endless, but some of the most important are as follows:1. Networking opportunitiesNetworking is one of the most crucial facets of building any business and creating strong partnerships. Bonds created during marketing conferences can lead to new opportunities and new ideas for your marketing campaigns. There are sure to be people who have a similar vision and are looking to find other professionals in the same boat and those who can share their successes and pitfalls.

35,Top Ways I've Learned to Keep Motivation High in an Asynchronous Workplace,"Mar 12, 2024",Tom Medema,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-keep-motivation-high-in-an-asynchronous-workplace/470472,"
The asynchronous work environment was largely forced upon us in recent years, with professionals worldwide having little say in the matter. However, the continued commonality of this geographically extended workplace means we have to make sure that by cutting certain corners of traditional work, we aren't depriving ourselves of personal working life hacks and skills, such as motivation, that should be ever-present in workplaces.From my experience, intrapersonal-type skills tend to be cast aside and devalued in an async environment. Our focus for today is motivation, which is one of them. If we just stop for a second to think about prior conversations regarding our levels of motivation, I believe that most of our memories will jump to a time when a pitfall in motivation brought about the conversation, and thus, occurs at a time when it is almost impossible to successfully maneuver ourselves out of this rut, and onto an inspired, powerful, and motivated path once again.This mustn't be the case, and as a pioneer of async communication and workplaces myself through my role as CEO of Bubbles, I want to make sure we are continuously mindful and self-aware, but that we also collaborate to structure our working environments in such a way that we give each other the highest chance of success and omnipresent motivation. Let me show you how.



Related: Has Technology Killed Face-To-Face Communication? How to Navigate the Nuances of Digital Age CommunicationUnderstanding asynchronous workTo understand optimizing asynchronous motivation, we should first boost our understanding of this newfound technique. I say newfound, but in reality, async communication has been around for donkey's years (relatively speaking), with email and fax, for example, but these processes were never enough alone to fully run businesses from. This is why, with the recent influx of revolutionary async communication methods and tools, such as Bubbles, and the increasing popularity of tools like Slack, we are witnessing a new asynchronous generation and phenomenon among professionals. However, not everyone is keeping up.


In 2022, Buffer's State of Remote Work report revealed that only 38% of companies had an async-first policy, despite 52% of employees desiring an async set-up. Moving and evolving with the times is something critical in my view of a successful business, and trying to always align with what our employees want is something that should go without saying. If we ignore these lighthouse signals, we are likely to witness, ironically, things like a lack of motivation in our teams. Nevertheless, I want to focus on the instances where async has been chosen and help as best as I can, starting with some soft-skills and intrapersonal skills.Related: How to Create an Asynchronous Work CultureFlexibility and employee preferencesThe allure of remote work largely stems from its flexibility. Buffer's report highlighted that 67% of remote workers valued flexibility in time management, while 62% appreciated the choice of work location. This flexibility, however, must be balanced with strategies to keep remote workers motivated and engaged.Empathy and recognition in asynchronous workEmpathy is naturally intertwined with asynchronous working. Providing our employees with vast flexibility and choice of working locations cannot be discredited in terms of a caring approach to each individual, to the extent that these two remote benefits came at the top of an importance list in the same Buffer report. I want to note here, though, that this is not just about 'being nice' to our staff, because the reality is that we will gain masses in return for this thoughtfulness, through boosts in motivation, productivity and desire to impress. This claim that I make is not plucked out of thin air, and in fact, according to Businessolver, a staggering 70% of employees and HR professionals agree that empathetic organizations lead to higher employee motivation. Moreover, 68% of HR professionals believe employee recognition and feedback positively impact retention (SHRM). In an asynchronous setting, where face-to-face interactions are limited, recognizing employees' efforts becomes even more vital to maintaining motivation.


Here are five more strategies for maintaining motivation.1. Establish clear communication channelsClear and efficient communication is imperative for your team to thrive in an asynchronous environment. I am not just referring to the technology here, as although that is the umbrella above this, it is equally important to set expectations for response times and time-based performance.Related: Open Your Digital Doors: Communication and Remote Work2. Build this culture of recognitionRecognition excites people and boosts motivation. Professionals are aware of this to some degree, with Reward Gateway proving that 60% of employees want to see managers or leaders praising their colleagues' work more often. When feedback like this arises from a group who are looking to become a more prosperous and motivated team, we can be sure that regular recognition, whether in one-on-one sessions or daily stand-up, is something to focus on.


3. Promote work-life balanceOne of remote work's main and most widely covered struggles is unplugging after work hours. Again, encouraging a healthy work-life balance and being empathetic with after-hours communication can prevent burnout and maintain motivation.Related: Having A Work-Life Balance is Nonsense. To Reach Your Goals, Follow Another Approach4. Provide opportunities for professional growthEmployees want and need growth and development opportunities even in an asynchronous environment. Keep the conversations going about career paths, and make sure to mentor wherever you can.5. Implement flexible work policiesFlexible work policies are a key motivator, and a highly valued aspect of async, as established earlier. A PR NewsWire report also indicates that 81% of employers see improving talent retention as a motivation for adopting flexible work policies, as well as boosting the pool from which they can hire. Allowing employees to choose their working hours can increase job satisfaction and motivation, meaning you get more from less.So, I hope by now you have clocked on to the importance of not neglecting key aspects of our work lives, such as motivation. This is a lesson that is aimed at helping you and your teammates, so I hope you can go away from this motivation to instill some new values in your asynchronous workplace!

37,6 Ways I've Achieved a Healthy Work-Life Balance as a Business Owner,"Mar 11, 2024",Kartik Jobanputra,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-master-work-life-harmony-with-these-simple-steps/469893,"
Collaboration is a powerful tool that has become increasingly essential in the modern business world. Working together with others can help drive growth, innovation, and success. My journey with collaboration caused me to discover some hacks that have improved my work-life balance.This article will explore the importance of these hacks and provide some tips for re-prioritizing your work-life relationship and using it to achieve your goals.Related: Why Strong Collaborations Will Change Your Business



1. Set clear boundariesThe first step to finding balance is to set clear boundaries between your professional and personal life. When you're working, focus solely on business tasks without letting any outside influences distract you.Similarly, when you're out of the office, ensure that work doesn't infringe upon your other activities or relationships. You must understand what lines must not be crossed for both sides of your life to remain healthy and balanced.


2. Prioritize your timeWhen managing your time as an entrepreneur, it's important to prioritize the most important tasks first. This means taking some extra time during the day or week to plan what needs to be done ahead of time so that nothing is left undone or forgotten about. Doing this will help keep task-related stress at bay and give you more freedom in determining how best to divide up the rest of your day or week into a manageable schedule.Additionally, don't forget to add some non-work-related activities into your schedule, such as exercise or leisurely activities — these can help provide much-needed respite from your otherwise hectic workloads.Related: 15 of the Best Time Management and Productivity Books of All Time3. Take regular breaksIt's easy for entrepreneurs to get caught up in their work and forget about taking regular breaks throughout their day. But breaks are essential for maintaining both physical and mental health — they can help reduce stress levels while providing an opportunity for creativity, too.


Try setting reminders on your phone or computer so that you take regular breaks throughout the day – this could mean stepping away from the desk for 10 minutes every hour or even going for a walk during lunchtime, if possible! Taking regular breaks will refresh your mind and body alike, helping you stay productive yet balanced over time.Related: How to Achieve A CEO Level of Focus by Breaking Habits and Taking Breaks4. Learn to say noAs an entrepreneur, it can be easy to overextend yourself by saying yes too often when asked for favors or projects outside of work hours — but learning when (and how) to say no can ultimately save considerable amounts of unnecessary stress in the long run.Don't feel guilty if you need to turn down certain requests; just politely explain why it's not possible at this particular time, perhaps offering alternative solutions depending on what may be suitable instead. By knowing when (and how) to say no without feeling guilty, entrepreneurs can find greater peace of mind while still being able to give back where needed most.


5. Schedule regular 'me time'Making sure that there is adequate 'me time' built into each week is essential – regardless if it's reading a book in silence, going out with friends, or simply enjoying a warm bath after work hours — whatever activity works best for giving yourself some much-needed rest. Having this type of downtime allows entrepreneurs ample opportunity to recharge their batteries before returning to business mode — allowing them to manage better stress levels associated with being constantly busy with numerous tasks at hand.6. Don't neglect your health and well-beingLastly - one key area that entrepreneurs needn't forget about balancing is their health & well-being; don't neglect to eat nutritious food regularly during working hours nor avoid exercise altogether either — these are paramount needs necessary for keeping one's energy levels high while reducing any risks associated from sitting down all day — thus ensuring both physical & mental well-being remains balanced over longer periods.ConclusionManaging a successful career and a satisfying lifestyle outside of work can be difficult but achievable, no matter what stage in business development one might find themselves at now.The key lies in understanding where our limits lie and setting clear boundaries between our personal life and professional obligations accordingly—along with scheduling sufficient 'me' time each week where necessary. Following such guidelines helps ensure balance remains intact over extended periods while promoting productivity and achieving success simultaneously, too.

38,The Little Coffee Shop That Asks Customers Not to Be Quiet,"Mar 8, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-little-coffee-shop-that-asks-customers-not-to-be-quiet/470902,"
Nirvana Soul in San Jose, California is not a place you go to bury yourself in a book or work quietly on your computer. Colorful artwork lines the walls, and upbeat music fills the air. You're bound to meet someone new during your visit as the conversational baristas and owners float around tables to chat with customers.Sisters Jeronica Macey and Be'Anka Ashaolu started the coffee shop in 2018 to create a space for belonging. They wanted people to have a space where they could experience community or come to make a friend. From day one, they've poured their efforts into curating an energizing and welcoming environment at the shop.Related: How This California Hot Spot Grew From Delivery-Only to Pop-Up Shop to Storefront



Nirvana Soul's tight-knit community feel is a huge appeal for customers, including Yelp Elite and Community Intern Camy T. A local college student, Camy frequents Nirvana Soul to study, work on art, and hang out with friends. ""Downtown coffee shops were missing that community aspect,"" she said. ""But when Nirvana Soul came into town, things shifted in my perspective. It became a hub for many college students for studying, creating art, showcasing their talent at open mic night, and meeting new people, especially creatives.""Be'Anka and Jeronica's team laid the foundation for the shop's accessible and inviting feel. Their friendly staff is eager to answer questions and make an effort to ""table tap,"" walking up to every customer to ask how they're doing and offer them water. ""We just try to put in little joyful moments, so [people] have great coffee and a great experience at the same time,"" Be'Anka said.


The owners acknowledge that their departure from the coffee shop's traditional head-down work environment can lead to misunderstanding and sometimes critical feedback. They've had to learn how to respond when critiques come from someone who might not be in their target audience.""Change is hard, right?"" Be'Anka asked. ""So sometimes, it's almost like a culture shock. We've had reviews where people say, 'This is not what a coffee shop is supposed to be.' And we're like, 'Okay, I hear you, but maybe it's just different than what you're used to and we can be a little more open-minded.'""Related: The Owners of This Texas Farmers Market Took a Big Gamble. Here's How It Paid Off Bigger Than They Dreamed.Reviews like these can actually be a useful way to set expectations for future customers about the shop experience. By clearly communicating how your business operates, future patrons will have a better sense of what to expect and can decide if it's a right fit for their needs. In her time running Nirvana Soul, Be'Anka has learned the value of all feedback, both positive and critical, in helping her optimize the customer experience.


Be'Anka also stressed the importance of sharing your feedback in the moment. While Camy loves the environment and food at Nirvana Soul, she mentioned in her 4-star review that the sweet flavors in her drink were overpowering. Critiques like these are easy fixes that Nirvana Soul's baristas are happy to accommodate in the moment.""We'd so much rather [hear in person] than read about it later because now you're out there in the world with a drink that you hate. We could have gotten you something better, and you're already gone,"" Be'Anka said.As a consumer, Camy feels a responsibility to provide thoughtful feedback, always striving to help businesses improve.""I think people get a bit into the realm of people-pleasing,"" she said. ""You want to make people feel good, but you're also sacrificing your own needs as a consumer by not letting a business know if something could be changed. We're in an era of improvement, of growth, and I think it's important to critique every now and again.""


As a business, in addition to being responsive to feedback, creating touchpoints with your customers on social media is an important way to make them feel like a valued part of your community. As Be'Anka builds up Nirvana Soul's social media presence, she makes an effort to reshare posts from customers whenever she can. These expressions of appreciation go a long way with regulars like Camy.Related: This Mom and Pop Ice Cream Shop's Success Comes Down to This Simple Phrase""I think it's really beautiful to exchange that back-and-forth with a business,"" Camy said. ""I come here frequently. You recognize that, you appreciate me as your customer, and I'm dedicated to your business.""Be'Anka also emphasizes the importance of being consistent and active on social media. If you find social media intimidating, start small. It's better to post one simple photo every day than to let the need for a ""perfect"" feed hold you back from posting.


""I just snap pictures of anything. It doesn't matter what it is. It could be a drink, it could be artwork, it could be a scene in the shop. You don't have to say much. You can describe what's in the photo. You can say 'good morning.' It doesn't even matter because tomorrow's another day and you should probably just post the next picture.""Above all, Nirvana Soul is a space for community, a key part of which is representation. During their six years in business, Be'Anka and Jeronica have featured the work of over 65 artists, including female artists and artists of color, with the intention of creating a space where diverse voices are seen and uplifted.While the shop celebrates its role as one of a handful of Black- and woman-owned businesses in San Jose, Be'Anka recognizes that the quality of the Nirvana Soul experience is what shines through to customers at the end of the day.""We know there's going to be people who find us because we're Black-owned,"" Be'Anka said. ""We also know that it's not going to be a one-and-done with them because they're going to come in, love the experience so much, and know that this is a Black-created experience. And then they'll come back and bring more people—because after a certain point, it's just awesome coffee and a great experience.""


In addition to staying true to your mission and vision, Nirvana Soul believes in:Engaging customers during their visit to your business. Create a space where they feel comfortable chatting, asking questions, and raising any concerns they may have.Maintaining an active social media presence. Consistent posts and reposts welcome customers into your online community and show your appreciation for their support.Using online reviews to understand, optimize, and set expectations for the customer experience. Learn when to implement critical feedback and when to accept that you can't provide what a certain customer is looking for.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Be'Anka and Camy, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.Available on: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Pandora and Soundcloud.Editorial contributions by Callie Morgan and Kristi Lindahl

39,How to Prepare for a Podcast Appearance,"Mar 8, 2024",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/3-ways-to-get-the-most-out-of-a-podcast-guest-appearance/470073,"
Do you know when you've ""arrived"" these days? When you're on a podcast, either as the host or a guest! I may be exaggerating just a little, but a good barometer of success in the current marketplace is being deemed worthy of a guest appearance on a podcast. It means you've attracted interest. It means you have the power to generate an audience. It means someone believes you have something important to say and to share.So when you get the chance, you'll want to be prepared. As head of my own PR firm, part of my role is prepping and grooming clients for podcast appearances. Here are the coaching tips I pass on to my clients so they can take the best advantage of participating in America's newest favorite media channel.Related: Go Beyond Swapping Business Cards and Small Talk — Here's How to Forge Meaningful Relationships.



Best practices for podcast appearancesAs ubiquitous as podcasts have become, it's still exciting when you receive an invitation to be featured on one. Very exciting. But excitement can also lead to nervousness, intimidation or even stage fright, which can leave you tongue-tied and result in a missed opportunity to make the most of your moment.You can take steps before and during your appearance to facilitate the most favorable outcome, and I break these steps into three stages.Related: Effective Strategies for Entrepreneurs to Grow Their PodcastStage #1: Prepping the week before your interviewDo not wait until the last minute to ready yourself for your appearance. I don't care how busy you are, how bare your cupboards are or how many party favors you have to assemble for your kid's birthday on Saturday; do not be an eleventh-hour podcast guest.At least a week out, schedule the following tasks:Listen to as many episodes of the podcast as you can. As you do so, get a feel for the host's style — are they easy-breezy, or do they throw hardballs? Do they talk more, or do their guests talk more? Is the tone casual and conversational, or quite formal, educational and informational? To be a good fit for this show, you'll want to be familiar with the show's personality and craft your content to it.Research the podcast's format. How long will you be on? Will there be breaks so you can regroup and reset between segments? Will you be expected to field listeners' questions, or will you be in control of your ""script""? Knowing what to expect before taping begins paves the way for fulfilled expectations.Draft your pitch. Now's the time to start writing down what you most want to communicate during your appearance. Whether it's encapsulating the mission of your business, positioning yourself as a thought leader or driving traffic to your enterprise, you should be clear on what you want to pitch and how you're going to do so. List talking points. Make note cards. Record voice memos to assess how you're coming across and tweak your angle to address weak spots.Related: If You're Going to Be a Guest on a Podcast, Don't Make These 4 Mistakes — They Could Cost You Leads.


Stage #2: Setting the scene for the interviewAlmost all of my clients' podcast interviews are done remotely, with my client in their location and the podcast host calling from their location. Very often, the interviews are videotaped as well as audiotaped, which adds another layer of interaction with the audience.Assuming you're going to be seen and heard, take the time to ensure that your environment will be most conducive to a crisp and clear listening experience and a visually appealing presentation.Equip your interview area with proper lighting. You want your image to appear bright and professional, not dark and shadowy, which can be accomplished by a ring light or natural light coming through a window in front of you. (Note: You don't want a window behind you, which can create an annoying glare.)Stage an attractive background. There is no need to redecorate or clutter your office, but a well-placed plant, a knickknack or a thoughtful collection of books on a shelf behind you can create a pleasing backdrop. Use a preset background from a videoconferencing platform only if it's high quality and will appear solid and steady behind you.Plan to wear earbuds and set up a microphone, which can diminish background noise and improve sound quality on both ends.Before interview day, check that all your equipment is working so you won't encounter any last-minute technology glitches.Stage #3: Showing up for the interviewIt's time to get yourself camera-ready and your space podcast-ready!First, let's rewind to the night before. Get a good night's sleep so you feel your best.Then, leave ample time to dress and primp the morning of so you look your best.Next, about two hours before go time, do another quick tech check to ensure everything's operational. If not, you'll need time to troubleshoot.Take control of everything around you — turning off all noise sources, silencing your phone and nearby devices and isolating yourself from everyone and everything in your vicinity (including your kids and your pet!) for the duration of the podcast segment.Have a glass of water off to the side and soundlessly sip throughout the interview to keep your mouth hydrated.As the countdown begins, take several deep breaths to calm and center yourself, becoming fully grounded in the present moment.When the interview starts, sit up straight, don a welcoming smile, incorporate true-to-life gestures and facial expressions and, most importantly, listen closely and deeply to the host. You'll be tempted to divert your thoughts to your next turn to speak, but if you do that, you could miss what the host is saying to you or asking you.Trust your natural instincts and trust your expertise. You were asked to appear on the podcast for a reason — go show 'em why you deserve the invite!Related: 5 Ways to Prepare for Your Podcast Interview 


Leave a lasting impressionMore than anything, podcasts are meant to be engaging and entertaining. So it's fine to have fun; you're encouraged to have fun. The more genuine you are, the more listeners will get a sense of you as an individual instead of a talking head, and the more they'll trust that what you're saying is coming from a place of authenticity.To make the most effective use of your time in the spotlight, remember that podcasts are primarily an auditory experience, where voice, cadence and clarity take center stage. So enunciate a little more than you usually do and slow the pace of your speech just a little more than you normally would. You don't want your listeners to miss a single word. And don't be afraid to add humor wherever and however you can — no matter how serious the conversation or earnest your message, you can never go wrong making your audience laugh.Podcasts are, at the core, a promotional vehicle. When it's your turn to ride in one, don't be shy about promoting yourself, your brand or your purpose. It's a fabulous opportunity to shine; just make sure you embrace the host and the listeners in the limelight too. By the end of the episode, you might earn a slew of new followers!

With people spending so much time on social media and the internet, consumers see more brands than ever, which means they also have a more finely tuned awareness of aesthetics and brand idententies. In a 2023 survey, market research firm Hanover found that 75% percent of companies have overhauled their visual identities since 2020, and Lucidpress found that 45% of customers ""expect great design across marketing and sales collateral."" In other words, an outdated aesethetic costs you money.

41,Employee Morale Is More Than Pep Talks and High Fives — Here's How You Can Really Capture the Power of Team Spirit.,"Mar 8, 2024",Lissele Pratt,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/heres-how-you-can-really-capture-the-power-of-team-spirit/469967,"
As the founder of a growing company, I've seen firsthand just how crucial team spirit is. In those early days of building our business, we faced all sorts of challenges. But one particular moment sticks out in my mind. We were up against an extremely tight deadline, and it seemed like every obstacle imaginable was getting in our way. Instead of giving up, though, my brilliant team banded together.That experience really drove home the importance of team spirit for me. It's about more than just getting along — it's about truly believing in each other's abilities and lifting each other up when things get tough. Without that kind of teamwork, I honestly don't think we'd be where we are today.So, how can you ensure that your team, regardless of its size, harnesses the transformative power of team spirit? Let's explore.Related: Life's Too Short to Work With Incompatible People — Follow These 3 Secrets To Building High-Performing TeamsWhat is team spirit in an organization?Team spirit isn't just reserved for sports teams. No, it's just as crucial in business settings. Essentially, it's about fostering unity, trust and a shared purpose among your employees. It's creating an environment where everyone feels valued and supported, where their viewpoints and opinions matter. And, when you have a strong and united team, it leads to a whole host of benefits for your company, including:



Improved communicationIncreased collaborationBetter job satisfactionActive problem-solvingHow to create a good team spirit at your companyBuilding team spirit requires deliberate effort and nurturing. When the bonds among your team members are weak, it's time to roll up your sleeves and get to work on strengthening them. Here are some key steps to fostering team spirit within an organization:Encourage collaboration and teamworkThink of your team as a well-oiled machine — each person has their own role and responsibilities, but together, they're unstoppable. To foster collaboration, consider implementing the following actionable strategies:Establish clear team goals: Make sure everyone knows what they're working towards and how their piece fits into the bigger picture. When everyone's on the same page, it's easier to work together towards a common goal.Host brainstorming sessions: Schedule regular brainstorming sessions where everyone can share ideas and challenges and explore new possibilities. No idea is too big or too small and you should encourage everyone to contribute their thoughts.Invest in team-building activities: Make some time to get to know your team outside of work. Whether it's a team-building workshop, an offsite retreat or just grabbing lunch together, building those personal connections can go a long way.Related: This Four-Part Formula Can Help You Build Great TeamsClear communication is keyYou've probably heard the phrase ""communication is key"" more times than you can count, but let me tell you, there's a reason it's such a timeless mantra. When your team can communicate well with each other, they can better bond with each other. Here's how you can make sure everyone's voice is heard loud and clear:


Create a culture of transparency: Nobody likes feeling left in the dark. Make transparency a top priority by keeping everyone in the loop about important decisions, changes and updates. When everyone knows what's happening, it builds trust and prevents rumors from swirling.Embrace two-way communication: Communication is not just about talking but about listening. Make sure you're not just broadcasting information, but actively listening to what your team has to say. Whether it's through one-on-one check-ins, open-door policies or mentoring. At Capitalixe, we hold monthly mentoring sessions to get to know our team and their dreams and aspirations.Lead by example: As the leader, your actions speak louder than words. Be proactive about sharing information and soliciting feedback, be your team's biggest cheerleaders and be open to new ideas.Recognize your team's winsIt may seem like a simple gesture, but employee recognition goes a long way in boosting morale and keeping everyone motivated. Here's how you can make sure your team feels appreciated and valued for their hard work:Celebrate wins, big and small: Maybe your team has hit a major milestone or landed a new client. Or, maybe an individual is experiencing a personal win like an engagement. Celebrate their success. Host a team lunch, throw a work party or even just give a heartfelt shout-out during a team meeting. Celebrating wins together can do wonders in boosting team spirit.Create a culture of recognition: Make recognition and appreciation a regular part of your team culture. Encourage team members to recognize and celebrate each other's successes through peer-to-peer shoutouts, kudos boards and other recognition programs.Reward achievements: As well as verbal recognition and praise, consider offering actual rewards for team successes. This could be an annual bonus, extra paid time off or other incentives that praise your team for their hard work and dedication. When team members see that their efforts are being rewarded, it motivates them to continue giving their best.Related: Why Acknowledging Your Team Members Is Critical to Your SuccessFinal thoughtsSo there you have it. We've unpacked how team spirit can make or break an organization's performance. From my own journey, I've learned firsthand that the results speak for themselves when the team's spirit is strong.Team spirit isn't just about high-fives and pep talks — it's about creating a vibe where everyone's rowing in the same direction. To get there, it's all about encouraging teamwork and collaboration. You want your team to feel like they're part of something bigger like they're all in the same boat and paddling together towards a common goal. Communication is also key. So keep those lines open and make sure everyone's voice is heard, and don't forget to sprinkle in some recognition and celebration along the way.


So, let's keep the energy high, the communication flowing and the good work rolling. With the right team spirit, there's no limit to what you can achieve together.

      Key Takeaways    



        Every business has a strategy because strategy involves making choices. However, the effectiveness of a strategy lies in whether these choices actively contribute to the business's goals and the delivery of value.
      


        This article outlines seven common but ineffective strategies that businesses may have unintentionally adopted and advice on how to make better choices.
      












    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

""One of the biggest problems with strategy is that the business doesn't have one."" It's common to read this phrase in articles that aim to identify why a business strategy isn't working.And yet, every business has a strategy because strategy is about choices — and the team makes choices every day. The issue is that the choices they make do not advance the business.Effective teams make deliberate choices so every action the business takes drives toward delivering the value the business exists to deliver.Related: 7 Strategies Businesses Can Use to Be Profitable and SustainableSeven common but ineffective business strategiesWhether you're consciously aware of it or not, you make choices based on something. That something and your choices serve as your strategy. Here are seven common but ineffective strategies you may have inadvertently adopted:



1. You're reactiveWhether it's a new idea, a raging fire or the ping in your inbox, you choose to act based on what hits you at that moment. I've made the mistake of saying this type of team isn't strategic when I meant to say they aren't deliberate. You're likely pedaling at full steam but not going anywhere.2. You do what you want to doYou build what you want to build. The quintessential example is a robotics company that wanted to build X even though all the input they received from their customers told them they needed Y. The company continued to build X because that's what they wanted to build. Now, they don't exist anymore. If you're the only one reaping value, you have a hobby, not a business.3. You do what you've always doneYou know the approach works. You're comfortable doing it. And you definitely don't want the stress of changing it. So you keep on keepin' on. Alas, too many businesses no longer exist because they failed to evolve. You must adapt what you do and how you do it because the world changes all the time.4. You chase the new cool thingEvery day brings new priorities that start with emails like, ""Check out how cool this is. We should do it."" Sometimes, you start a new thing because you enjoy creating. Sometimes, you do it because the new thing is simply more exciting than doing the hard work you actually need to do. Much like a reactive strategy, your team finds it hard to gain any traction or soothe their spinning heads.


5. You spend as little money as possibleYou scrutinize every investment looking for the cheapest option, including what could be done for free. Slowly, sometimes glacially, no one wants to work on your team, and your business loses all the resources required to do, well, anything.6. You go after the moneyYou see a way to get a lot of cash in the near term, so you immediately apply effort in that direction. Never mind what you were doing before. Never mind that you (somehow) want team members to keep doing that stuff, too. If you can put a check in the bank today, you'll worry about tomorrow later. Unfortunately, you may not have a business tomorrow.7. You pursue moreWhen someone asks for your strategy, you answer, ""To be the biggest company in the world!"" You pursue more markets, more users and more followers. When asked why, you say, ""Because we need to be the biggest!"" Your team has a tough time making choices and a high likelihood of running an unprofitable business.Related: 5 Common Growth Strategy Mistakes and How You Can Fix Them


How to make better choicesIt's not that the companies making choices in any of these seven ways don't have a strategy; they don't have a particularly good strategy. They may even operate using a few of these strategies at once, which only compounds the negative effects.New businesses launch every day. We can create products and services faster than ever before. And soon, production will come at pennies on the dollar. The only way to thrive is to focus on delivering meaningful value.Define the value you deliver by engaging the people you serve. Then make choices so everything you do as a business drives toward delivering that value. To succeed, you'll need to assess how your choices work — i.e., how effectively they deliver value — and adjust accordingly.Routinely gather input from the people you serve, your team and the external environment, so you're positioned to evolve your business as value shifts, your team grows and the world changes.


You and your team make choices every day. You choose to hold this meeting, adopt this software or launch this product. You need to make deliberate choices that advance your ability to effectively deliver value. The choices you make — and what you base them on — define your strategy. And like so many things, some strategies work better than others.Related: How to Recover From a Failed Strategy

44,4 Ways Brands Can Educate Their Customers and Win Hearts,"Mar 4, 2024",Bora Celik,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-ways-brands-can-educate-their-customers-and-win-hearts/469937,"
Standing out is a challenge for direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands. But they have a secret weapon in their arsenal: Education.It's about going beyond just selling products and actually teaching customers about the value and benefits of what they're buying. This strategy changes the shopping experience. It turns transactions into relationships.From engaging quizzes to live Q&A sessions, personalized advice, and stories from the founders themselves, these innovative approaches are changing the game. They make every interaction an opportunity for a deeper bond between the brand and the customer.



Let's explore why embracing these educational tactics is becoming essential for DTC brands looking to make a real impact.1. Use quizzes for engaging online contentAdding quizzes to a DTC brand's website grabs customer attention uniquely and interactively. It turns shopping into a fun learning journey. Quizzes engage customers by asking questions to pinpoint their likes, needs, and hurdles. This teaches customers about the right products for them and gives brands insights into consumer habits.


Brands can then fine-tune their products and messages. Quizzes also make the website more engaging and fun, keeping visitors around longer. This can help improve the site's SEO and might even lift sales.By making recommendations more tailored and relevant, quizzes foster trust. They encourage customers to come back. This approach simplifies finding the right product, benefiting both the customer and the brand.Related: Educating vs. Selling — This Unique Marketing Style Will Help You Grow Your Business2. Meet customers through live Q&A sessionsDirect interaction with customers through live Q&A sessions can significantly enhance customer education and trust.


Mary Ruth's Organics demonstrates this by leveraging the knowledge and accessibility of its founder, MaryRuth Ghiyam. Despite the brand's growth, Ghiyam remains actively engaged with her community, answering Instagram messages personally and hosting monthly fireside chats via Zoom.A quick look at their Instagram shows thousands of people attend these chats. These sessions allow customers to ask questions in real-time, providing a platform for direct communication and personalized advice. This approach not only educates customers but also builds a deeper connection between the brand and its consumers.3. Personalize to enhance educationWhen customers get advice or product picks just for them, they tend to dive deeper into the content, remember what they learned, and act on the suggestions. Personalization makes them feel valued, building a closer bond with the brand. People are bombarded with endless options and information. Personalization is a surefire way to stand out.When exploring products, people often sift through loads of information and research. Brands can make a real impact by tailoring their customer education to meet these personal quests for knowledge.


4. Utilize founder tutorialsBrands have increasingly connected with their customers through tutorials led by their founders. This strategy brings a human touch to the brand, highlighting the passion and knowledge behind it. Founders sharing their expertise and stories draw customers in. It builds trust and credibility. These tutorials aren't just product lessons; they're windows into the brand's heart. They show what it stands for.This kind of direct interaction creates a community feeling. These tutorials are gold mines of information for customers, offering insights and tips for smarter choices. In a time when authenticity and openness are highly valued, founder-led tutorials are a smart move for brands aiming to improve their customer experience.For example, Shani Darden, founder of Shani Darden Skin Care, utilizes her Shani's Skin Tips as a platform for founder tutorials, directly engaging with her audience by sharing expert advice and personalized skincare tips. This approach educates customers on effective skincare practices. It also builds a personal connection between the founder and the audience, enhancing trust in her products.Brands can emulate Darden's playbook by leveraging their expertise through similar educational content, providing valuable information that addresses their customers' needs and interests. This strategy positions the brand as an authority in its field and fosters a community of informed and loyal customers.


Through examples like the ones above, it's clear that these education strategies are transforming brand-customer interactions. Whether offering personalized advice or sharing the heartbeat of the brand via founder content, these methods are gold mines for engagement. They educate and help create a vibrant, informed community around the brand.

46,He Built a Personal Finance App That Manages $8 Billion for Half a Million Customers. Here Is the CEO of M1's Hard-Earned Advice for Future Founders.,"Mar 4, 2024",William Salvi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/m1-ceo-brian-barnes-on-creating-a-fintech-platform-built-to/470390,"
We've been visiting the headquarters of some of the most innovative and imaginative leaders in business for The CEO Series, learning what it takes to launch and grow a thriving brand. For this episode, our crew went to the office of M1, a fintech platform that bills itself as ""the finance super app."" The powerful online investing and banking platform has raised $315 million at a valuation of about $1.5 billion and manages about $8 billion for half a million customers. I sat down with founder and CEO Brian Barnes to learn all about the platform, how it was created, and his advice to founders on running a company built to last.Below are some highlights of our conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity. You can watch the full video above.The thrill of investing""M1 is a personal finance platform. We started the company about eight and a half years ago. We now manage about $8 billion on the platform for half a million customers. And we are really just trying to create the best possible way for someone to manage their finances. And we do that with a lot of personalization, customization, and automation. I was fortunate to be introduced to finance at a pretty young age and I was immediately hooked. I love the idea of investing, of trying to find out what a company's worth and how it's operating in a complex world. As an investor, you're making a high-conviction bet. If you're right, you make money. If you're wrong, you lose money. And so, you know, some people like sports gambling. For me, it is what is a company going to be worth in the next five or ten years.""



Related: The CEO of Catholic Prayer and Meditation App Hallow Says Founders Need to Be Part of Something Bigger Than ThemselvesDoing business in good times and bad""We want to create a financial institution that lasts for decades. There are companies out there that have lasted for centuries. If you are around for that period of time, it's unquestionable that you're going to have these massive disruptions in the overall market. And so we have been trying to build the organization so that we can survive in any macro environment and not just be tailor-made for one.""


Calm in the storm""I try to stay calm — on the outside. [Laughs] The entrepreneurship quote I love is that the highs are high, the lows are low and they're ten minutes apart. There are times when you think you're taking over the world. And then there are times where you're like, What the hell am I doing? I took all this money, I convinced people to quit their jobs and join me, I'm competing against the Schwabs of the world. But stewing in all of that stress accomplishes nothing. I think maintaining my emotions and figuring out how I can allocate my time productively has been a good attribute that I've had as I've built the organization.""Related: How Personal Passions Fuel Business Success for the CEO of Vivid SeatsThe life of a founder""Being a founder of a tech company is more than just being a CEO. You're both the most senior and most junior person at the company. You get to set direction and strategy and things like that, but in any area where there is not someone dedicated to that role? It's on you to fill the gap. I would say I played CEO from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. And then I played junior analyst from 11 a.m. to midnight every night. You're just running around and trying to add value where you can. As you grow, you'd love to put things on pause while you figure out how to scale your team. But that's not how it works — you've got to scale your team and build a product and acquire customers at the same time. There's a little bit of chaos, but you have to sort of thrive in the chaos.""Related: Inside Potbelly's Recipe for Fast Casual Success


Legacy of leadership""My mom Brenda Barnes was CEO of PepsiCo and Sarah Lee. I mean, that's a great person to learn from. She was one of seven sisters. They all shared a bedroom. They were a Polish immigrant family in Chicago. Her father was a factory worker. And so, I think she always had an insanely healthy respect for people who did the actual work at her companies. The people who bottled the cola, who loaded the delivery trucks. As a CEO, you need to respect that they know their job better than you. And the leader's job is to set an example for what you want the values across the company to be. If you could write down all the positive attributes and values that you would want instilled throughout the company, then you better exhibit those things.""Check out more profiles of innovative and impactful leaders by visiting The CEO Series archives.

47,How This California Hot Spot Grew From Delivery-Only to Pop-Up Shop to Storefront,"Mar 1, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-miguels-artisan-recipes-grew-from-pop-up-shop-to/470493,"
Everyone always has a seat at the Segura family's dinner table. Miguel and Lisa Segura, owners of Miguel's Artisan Recipes in Clovis, California, have been making homemade Mexican recipes for their friends and neighbors for decades.But when the pandemic hit and both were furloughed from their jobs, they turned their passion into a business. Lisa created a label, and using Miguel's mother's recipes, they began delivering fresh meals to friends and family by car.When word spread, the Seguras were invited to serve their homestyle cuisine at pop-up events with Fresno Street Eats, a food truck and festival venue. The company's owner helped them get set up with a certified kitchen and pop-up tent. The next year, the tent turned into a food truck, which finally gave way to a storefront. In the corner of a neighborhood convenience store, the owners cook meals for catered events and sell their famous dishes and jarred salsas.



Fresh recipes and a tight-knit customer community earned the restaurant the #1 spot on Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat in the Central Valley - North list in 2023. This is how Nathen M., senior community director at Yelp and Elite reviewer, discovered—and came to adore—the Seguras' business.""Their food and jarred salsas are just fantastic and consistently delicious,"" his review reads. ""Their tacos are to die for, but recently I tried their tamales, and it's the perfect ratio of masa to tender pork. My Mexican mother-in-law, who is very, very picky with her tamales, gave these a double thumbs up.""


The restaurant's authenticity is a huge reason why Lisa and Miguel have seen exploding success. Taking advantage of the agricultural community in the Central Valley, they source fresh ingredients every week to honor their family's original recipes, which resonate with nostalgic customers.""Some people actually [say], 'You just took me back 20 years.' That's the biggest compliment in the world to me because you're having my mother's food,"" Miguel said.Though many of Lisa and Miguel's recipes have been in the family for generations, a key component of their success is their flexibility in the kitchen. Starting out with a short menu of staples, the owners have thoughtfully built out their offerings over the last few years as they've received customer feedback. With a background in sales, Miguel understands the importance of really listening to his customers.""I have cooks and chefs that are already in my kitchen now,"" he said. ""All we have to do is find out what food you like.""


""We have high expectations for ourselves, and we want other people to have good experiences when they're eating the food,"" Lisa added. ""So how can I be better? Continuously improving is part of our culture.""Not only are Miguel and Lisa receptive to feedback but they are proactive about making customer connections, eager to share their food with as many people as they can. In and out of their store, the Seguras always ask regulars how they're doing and invite new customers in to sample their salsas.One of the biggest ways they reach customers is through appearances on local TV channel Fox 26, where they visit the Great Day Kitchen and put on cooking demonstrations of their signature dishes. Beyond the screen, Miguel and Lisa are involved with several community projects, speaking at conferences and with nonprofits about their path to entrepreneurial success.""It's not just about us making food, it's about making a difference, giving to other people,"" Lisa said. ""We are all growing together. I feel so blessed to be giving part of myself, our cooking, and our family legacy to the community. I think that Miguel's mom would have said it best: 'Bring everybody to the house. Let them eat.'""


Miguel and Lisa's friendly customer service and community integration is what struck Nathen most about their business.""It's a lot of work to be out and about all the time and running a business, and they do it with grace,"" Nathen said. ""Every time I've met them in person, there's never a look of 'How do we do this?' It's just, 'How are you doing? We're excited to see you. Do you want some food?'""Having worked with both Yelp consumers and small business owners for nine years, Nathen believes these small interactions are the key to community success.""One thing [that] has never changed when it comes to pitching Yelp events is [that] your food will become secondary. If people can see you and identify with you and learn a little bit about you, they are going to fall in love with you, and they will want to support you. And how do they do that? By coming back to your restaurant and eating your delicious food.""


Nathen urges business owners to connect on a human level with customers, even on days when they're not feeling 100% or are dealing with a difficult person.""Don't look at a person who's going to potentially review you as your nemesis,"" he said. ""You don't know what they're walking in from. Maybe the best part of their day is enjoying your sandwich or your taco or your gym class.""Nathen brings this same level of empathy to his interactions as a reviewer. When he has a negative experience, he waits 24 hours before writing a review, pausing to think about the person on the other side of the counter, who may be stressed from trying to make ends meet. When he does provide critical feedback, he makes sure it's constructive and not destructive.""Try to put your best foot forward all the time,"" he said. ""If the consumer and the owner took a beat before immediately assuming something, there'd be a little less anger out there.""


In addition to community building, Miguel's Artisan Recipes believes in:Listening to feedback. Start with a small list of offerings and give yourself room to grow your menu based on what customers want to see.Engaging with customers whenever possible. Build long-term relationships with your customers by getting to know them on a personal level, both inside and outside of your store.Using fresh ingredients and authentic recipes. Invest in the quality of your products, and customer demand will follow.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Miguel, Lisa, and Nathen, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.Available on: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Pandora and Soundcloud.Editorial contributions by Callie Morgan and Kristi Lindahl

48,The Miley Cyrus Approach To Marketing — Why It's a Radically Different Method For Achieving Brand Impact,"Mar 1, 2024",Sunny Dublick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-miley-cyrus-taught-me-about-marketing/469675,"
Miley Cyrus took home her first Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance this year. Shocked and elated, she took the stage to accept the award from none other than Mariah Carey and shared a very heartfelt speech:""And so there's a story I wanna tell that sums up this moment, and I wasn't gonna tell it, but now Mariah's here. So there was a little boy that all he wanted for his birthday was a butterfly. And so his parents gave him a butterfly net, and he was so excited. He just went outside out in the sun and started swinging and swinging. But with no luck, he sat down on the ground, he finally let go, and he surrendered, and he was okay that he wasn't gonna capture this beautiful butterfly. And right when he did is when the butterfly came and landed right on the tip of his nose. And this song 'Flowers' is my butterfly.""So, what does it have to do with marketing? Everything.



Current marketing theory is centered around amplification: more ads, emails and automation. The idea is that the more times we can reach a customer with our message, the better. Push out social posts, text ads, and Spotify spots, and hit them at every path along the buyer journey until they're worn down enough to buy.I liken this to chasing a customer down the street screaming, ""BUY NOW!"" as they frantically run as far away as possible — only we're doing this through screens, so it feels tolerable. Is it really effective, though? Or are we just casting the widest net possible over and over again, hoping to scoop up more (proverbial) butterflies?


I want to advocate for a different way, one that feels far less cringe-worthy. I want brands to stop chasing down business and start attracting it. What does that look like?Related: 7 Marketing Strategies You Need to SucceedStart with your offering(s)You need to have something that is ultimately an attractive offer to your audience. I ask every client what are the brands they aspire to be like. Apple always comes up. The new iPhone comes out, and there is a line around the block. We all want that kind of brand loyalty, right? The real question is: are we willing to do the work to get there?Apple didn't become a brand giant by creating the same products as the rest of the industry. It pushed category conventions every chance it could get. It constantly innovated and became cool because it was always on the cutting edge of new technology. Buying an Apple product was like a promise that you had the new, shiny toy everyone wanted. Their marketing just lets you know it's available, and frankly, they barely need it.


Apple's customers do most of their marketing for them. Think about what it would be like for your business to have an offer that's so good you know there will be a waiting list. Push yourself out of the thinking that 'this is the way things have to be.' What would it look like if you created something so amazing that you didn't have to force the message to convince people to buy? That is how you become an attractive brand. That's how you get your butterflies.Related: How to Bring Connection, Creativity and Results Together in MarketingKeep it realOne of my biggest takeaways from the Grammy speech was the need for surrender. Accepting the reality of where you are right now. That level of honesty and authenticity is crucial in building a great brand. It's the opposite of giving up; rather, it is realizing you have control over certain things, but a lot is out of our hands as businesses.It's letting go of our vice grip on metrics and being fine with letting life and joy become part of our marketing practice. Marketers have become so trained that everything has to have a way to measure ROI — and while I am not advocating wasting money, I am advocating that we allow wiggle room in our budgets and hearts for authentic brand connection. Not the PR stories, not the influencer partnerships. I mean genuine ways to live out your brand's purpose for your customers and employees.


If you created a business, it wasn't only to make money. I am guessing it was created to help people. Sometimes, we get so far away from where we've been and our purpose that the best thing we can do is surrender. Remind ourselves why we started or why we were so excited to work for a company in the first place. How do we get back to being a great brand?Related: How to Create Authentic Relationships and Build Customer TrustBe a good stewardThink about the brands you admire — do they need to convince you to buy? To chase you down? No. What does the boy with the butterfly do once it lands on his nose? Does he hop right up and start chasing it again? Or does he know he doesn't have to? Will he continue to attract great things because he is a magnet for success? I want to encourage you to be this magnet as well, and how you do that is by being a good steward to your customers.That means protecting their data, their interests, and their privacy. That means treating them with the respect they deserve. So often, we treat customers like numbers on a balance sheet. Just bombarding them with information to get their sale. This is not the way to make a great brand. This is being that pushy car salesman that no one feels comfortable around. When in doubt, all you have to do is put yourself in their shoes. Is this how I would want to hear about a brand like mine? Or does it feel weird? Is there a better way? Let empathy towards your community inspire you to do better and become the magnet of great customers.


One thing I feel passionate about as a marketer is that we have to find a better way. What this industry has become is a never-ending spiral of advertising. In essence, marketing should be about connecting with the people you want to help. We're not connecting by shouting messages at them all day, every day — in short, we're not being great partners with our clients.I hope that I can inspire you to new ways of thinking about marketing in a way that lets you attract all of the businesses you can handle without ever having to chase a thing.

49,Why Empathy-Driven Leadership is the Cornerstone of Every Successful Startup,"Feb 27, 2024",Taha Elraaid,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-empathy-is-the-cornerstone-of-every-successful-startup/469622,"
Startups are fast-paced, innovative and disruptive — at least, the good ones are. As a founder, your role goes beyond generating big ideas or securing funding – in fact, it's mostly about hiring, working alongside, and leading your team to get your company where it needs to be.Everyone has their own leadership style – some are hands-off, and some are very in-depth. All have their pros and cons. My approach differs depending on the department and even staff members. The one thing that doesn't change is that I try to lead with empathy in every single situation.The empathy advantageEmpathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. When you're a leader at a startup, it means recognizing and resonating with your team members' experiences, challenges and aspirations.



It's obvious to say that working at a startup can be a bit of a leap of faith. Startup employees are placing trust in both the founder and the product, hoping that it will all work out. Their success (and income) relies on the company's success. The least you can do for the people trusting you so completely is be empathetic to their concerns.Empathy doesn't just keep your people happy; it fosters effective communication, collaboration, and trust, too. I've found the best way to hear people out is to do so literally. At my startup, we've implemented an open-door policy. Anyone can talk to me anytime – be it about problems, new concepts, or even non-work things like family struggles. Having these conversations has made my employees feel valued, heard, and even more creative than before.


Recently, a couple of team members came to me with an idea. We'd been experiencing a bit of a lull, and they were looking to explore new projects — they wanted to create an air quality index system. They'd done the research, reached out to a potential partner and were excited about the concept. Not only was the pitch brilliant, but it ended up being one of our more successful projects to date, opening up a world of new and exciting innovations for us to pursue.It sounds simple, but taking the time to listen to team members genuinely helps them feel included in the organization and encourages the dialogue needed for innovation to flourish.If I hadn't made a point of having these chats with my team, they'd never have felt comfortable being open and honest with me in return, let alone come up with lucrative new ideas for the organization to pursue.Related: Why Empathy is Crucial to Your Success in the Business World


Navigating challenges with emotional intelligenceComing from Libya, resilience isn't exactly foreign to me. I was born and raised in a country that has been devastated by civil wars and environmental catastrophes. I'm used to setbacks and uncertainty, to say the least. Running a startup isn't too big of a jump.Dealing with a crisis helps you understand how important empathy is. Whether nationwide or just at your organization, understanding the emotions of others (staff and customers, both) and managing your emotional responses is key to getting through the tough times.There was a major setback in a project recently. We'd been working for months on a digital archiving system. The team was struggling to turn the software into an app, and the project was beginning to drag – deadlines were approaching, and we weren't even close to reaching them. I could see that my team was starting to panic. When we had our check-ins, everyone seemed to be on edge. A few staff members even asked me if there would be layoffs due to the hold-ups.I knew it was time to have an all-hands meeting and discuss what was happening with the project. I started the conversation by telling the team there would be no layoffs. Instantly, I could see that everyone was relieved. With the tension alleviated, I got into the weeds with my team about what went wrong and where. After we figured out what had led us astray, we were able to come up with an action plan to get the project back on track. We weren't on our original timeline, but we were able to speed up the process.


By staying attuned to the emotional state of their team, founders can address concerns quickly and provide the support the team needs. You won't see solid output when your employees sweat over potentially losing their jobs. Because I was able to have transparent and authentic conversations through this rough patch, we fostered a culture of trust and resilience within the startup.Related: Cultivate Resilience and Mental Health Within YourselfThe bottom line: Empathy drives successIn the competitive world of startups, the pressure to succeed can be overwhelming. While leading with empathy may seem like a soft skill compared to the hard metrics of revenue and growth, it's clear that empathy is more than just a feel-good concept. Empathetic leaders benefit from a strategic advantage that drives sustainable success. The success that you can see is reflected back in hard metrics down the line.As the startup landscape continues to evolve, one thing remains constant – the human element. When you embrace empathy as a guiding principle, founders can build successful businesses as well as inclusive and resilient communities that stand the test of time. It's not just about the products or services a startup delivers; it's about the people who make it all possible.

50,The Waitlist for This Sushi Spot Numbers in the Hundreds. Here's the Secret Ingredient of Its Success.,"Feb 27, 2024",Shawn P. Walchef,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/inside-sushi-master-jesse-itos-omakase-room/470141,"
There's no fast path to becoming a master — it takes work.As a renowned sushi chef and owner of Royal Sushi & Izakaya in Philadelphia, Jesse Ito carries a legacy of culinary excellence and rich tradition. Jesse embarked on an apprenticeship at the tender age of 14 at his family's Japanese restaurant, before immersing himself in the intricate world of sushi.""You can read books and you can just watch YouTube and learn a lot, but the only way is to learn through a chef working with the product,"" Jesse says to Shawn Walchef of Cali BBQ Media.



In 1979, before Ito was born, his parents opened Fuji in New Jersey just a few years after moving to America.Related: Celebrity Chef Maneet Chauhan Shares Her Best Tip for Aspiring TV Chefs


Shaped by his early years working with his parents at their restaurant Fuji (his mom at the front of the house and his dad making food) Ito's culinary journey began with a hands-on apprenticeship. ""The best way to learn is through apprenticeship,"" he says. ""You have to apprentice and work at places, and work with the product.""Starting as a teenage dishwasher, he was soon thrust into the sushi bar, navigating the challenges of mastering the craft.Ito's father was instrumental in shaping the Japanese food culture in the tri-state area and became known among top chefs as a culinary authority. They sold the restaurant in 2015 to help their son fulfill his dream of opening Royal Sushi & Izakaya.Ito now has the honor of working alongside his dad at his own restaurant. ""He kind of built this foundation. He was part of building the Japanese culture food scene in this tri-state area. So it was big shoes to fill. And having him there is really great,"" says Ito.

That may sound like a heavy burden, but it's also very empowering and will push you to move mountains.""The Next Generation of OmakaseFrom behind a back curtain at Royal Sushi & Izakaya, Jesse Ito brings a unique vibe to the traditional omakase experience — blending contemporary Japanese aesthetics with modern comfort and fusion of cultures. (Omakase translates to ""I leave it up to you,"" meaning that the customer leaves it up to the chef to select seasonal specialties.)


There are only 8 seats available at a time for the 17-piece, hand-crafted, tasting experience. Hundreds have signed up for the waitlist online.In his omakase room, Ito orchestrates a unique ambiance, deviating from the traditional omakase setting.Drawing inspiration from old-school hip-hop, funk, and artists like David Bowie, Ito sets the stage for a relaxed and enjoyable culinary journey. He intentionally fosters an atmosphere where guests feel at ease, encouraging conversation and camaraderie.Related: How This Chef Navigated a $80,000 Turnaround for His Business


""My omakase room, which has a bit of a different vibe,"" expresses Ito. ""All my guests feel super comfortable talking to each other, talking to other guests, talking to me. It doesn't feel pretentious where you feel so stuffy, where you're like, okay, I can't just let loose and have fun here.""Though he hasn't scaled Royal Sushi & Izakaya or the omakase concept quite yet, he understands that taking the next steps, both internally and externally, is necessary.""I know inevitably that's something I'll have to come to terms with because it's part of the process.

51,How to Transform Your Car Into an Alternative Workspace,"Feb 23, 2024",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-transform-your-car-into-a-productive-office-space/468759,"
Now that my children are getting older, I find myself meeting their needs less at home and more outside the home — more specifically, instead of braiding their hair, helping them with their homework or making them a snack, they're now looking to me to drive them to their activities and chauffeur them and their friends around town. As much as I love being a full-time mom, this has created a bit of a conundrum for me as a full-time business owner: How can I remain as involved in my kids' lives as I've always been while still getting in my required daily allotment of work?Enter the newest trend in American professional culture: mobile work time. And by ""mobile,"" I mean literally taking some work on the road with me in my automobile.Granted, using your car as an alternate workspace isn't conducive to certain duties and functions. When you need to hunker down and attend to serious tasks that require serious attention, there's no replacement for the permanent office space where you keep all the many tools of your trade. But as for a lot of the ""filler tasks"" that fill your days? You might be surprised at just how many you can accomplish from your car!

Nor will I cover the spate of new products designed to keep us working efficiently wherever we are. There are numerous sources you can access that will point you to all the mobile equipment and technology you could ever need.Rather, for those of us who are still mostly office-bound, I'm just talking about squeezing more juice out of the fruits of our labors by taking advantage of the benefits of working on the go, including:It makes productive use of what would otherwise be dead time.It expands the boundaries of when, where and how you can be more efficient and time-effective.It gives you a break from the office, a change of scenery, without necessarily having to break from work.It provides time limits on tasks you want to limit (like phone calls you want to keep brief).Adobe agrees that certain tasks lend themselves particularly well to working out of your car: marketing and social media management, virtual assistance, writing and content creation, and sales and business development. No wonder I'm such a fan — as the CEO of my PR firm, that's what I do most of the time.Examples of prime opportunities to work out of your carHere are some recent instances when I was able to convert in-vehicle time to high-performance spans of work output.


Waiting in the cell phone lot at the airport. Over the holidays, I went to pick up family flying in. When their delay turned from 20 minutes to 40 to an hour, I happily found time to check and return all the phone messages that were awaiting me.Parked in the lot of an athletic field. One of my kids has an hour-long soccer practice two days a week. It hardly makes sense for me to drop her off and turn right around to pick her up, so I now stay parked beside the field, where I can not only keep an eye on her but also get a solid hour of uninterrupted work done. I now dedicate this ""wait time"" to going through my email box and paring it down. (I do the same thing when the kids want to hang out in the mall for a while.) It's made a significant difference in my inbox management.Breaking at highway rest stops. When you have to take longish drives, the breaks advised to stretch your legs and rest your back are an opportune time to multitask. Walking in circles around the lot, getting some steps in, I dictated half a dozen voice memos to myself on things to follow up on when I got back to the office, then several more to my staff, which I texted to them on the spot for timely implementation.Intentional turnoffs between client visits. On my last trip to Nashville to visit a handful of clients in person, I used the rental car as my ""think tank."" While driving to my different appointments, I turned off the radio, looked straight ahead and let my mind do its creative thing: PR campaign ideas, pitch themes, content creation. By the time I purposely pulled over before reaching my next meeting, I had several good brainstorming thoughts to jot down about my last meeting.Stealing away in the driveway or garage. Over winter break, the house just got too loud with all the kids home from school. I wanted to make a good first impression on a potential new client, so I grabbed my laptop, headed out to the garage and attached the portable organizer I store in my car for just such purposes to the back of my front seat. I conducted the call in peace, totally calm, without distractions, and landed the client. Granted, it was winter in upstate New York, so I warmed up the garage first with our space heater!Related: 21 Productive Things to Do on Your CommuteThe end of the roadLastly, a few tips I've learned from experience:For safety, I suggest backing into parking spaces so you can keep a better eye on your surroundings.Move to the passenger seat or back seat for room and comfort.Email yourself documents ahead of time that you know you'll need quick access to.Pre-plan to have a reliable hot spot where you're going to ""park it"" as well.Consider carrying along a collapsible file folder in your car to keep notes and paperwork organized per client when you're away from your desktop file system.You should never, ever attempt work duties that will distract you from driving when you're actually behind the wheel, motoring from point A to point B. Safety is obviously the paramount concern. But when you're not in transit, it's worth exploring how much you can get done on the road!

  This Black Founder Was Denied a Business Loan and Set Out to Prove the 'Gatekeepers' Wrong. He's Made More Than $500,000 So Far — But It's Just the Beginning.
  
    Rob Gooljar, founder of IRIS blossom, started an Instagram account to share his love of floral arrangements — then the requests started rolling in.

      Key Takeaways    



        Gooljar began arranging the flowers his roommate brought home from Trader Joe's in 2020.
      


        He grew the IRIS blossom Instagram account to more than 40,000 followers and has made over $500,000 in just a few years. 
      


        Gooljar is on a mission to keep growing and lift up other diverse creators along the way.
      












""I've always been an artist,"" Rob Gooljar, founder of IRIS blossom, says. ""I've always been a creative person. I've done a lot of mixed media, painting, drawing, music, photography, but my medium shifted to floral.""In 2020, Gooljar was struggling with depression while working toward his Ph.D. in urban, social and economic geography, and he credits his then-roommate Becca Whittier as ""the catalyst"" for his new creative outlet. Whittier would bring flowers home from Trader Joe's, and Gooljar would arrange them.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom



Arranging flowers became a passion, and Gooljar decided to start an Instagram to bring others along on his artistic journey, especially those who might feel excluded from an industry known for lacking diversity. The average florist in the U.S. is 47 years old, and most of them are women (77.2%) and white (77.3%), according to data from Zippia.With his social media platform, Gooljar put out the kind of representation he wanted to see: ""Hey, I'm a queer Black florist — kind of, not really. I'm just playing with flowers, but watch me, and let's see what happens.""


What happened was IRIS blossom, named for Gooljar's rescue pitbull Iris, turned into a successful business.Related: For Years, This Black Founder Learned an Uncommon But Essential Craft on the Side. Now His Creations Are Beloved By Celebrity Chefs — and Can Sell for More Than $1,000.People saw Gooljar's posts on the Instagram account, which grew from zero to more than 40,000 followers, and began asking to buy arrangements. In the past three-and-a-half years, the self-funded company has fulfilled thousands of orders and made more than $500,000 — but it's just the beginning.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossomGooljar is expanding IRIS blossom to South Florida, where he moved last year, while Whittier and two employees continue to helm the company's operations in Greater Charlotte. Meanwhile, he's working with another business partner, Jihann Hanchell, to get IRIS blossom's sister business, island IRIS, off the ground in Turks and Caicos. The idea there is to offer ""full-scale design"" for luxury events.""He was really kind, but looked at me and was like, 'Well, you're not going to get a business loan.'""Gooljar isn't entering into these floral ventures ""blindly,"" he notes. He also has a holding company and a consulting firm. Still, despite Gooljar's entrepreneurial savvy and IRIS's track record of success and growth, its journey hasn't been without some serious challenges. Two of the biggest barriers, according to Gooljar? Funding and space. And in the floral industry, those tend to go hand in hand.


""It's very hard for small businesses to exist in Charlotte without being pre-existing,"" Gooljar says. ""Pre-existing meaning that A, you come from money or B, you have somebody to help you. So we worked out of our two-bedroom apartment [when] we were doing events that were $15,000-$16,000, and we were doing it on our kitchen island that was six-and-a-half feet long. We had buckets all over the house.""IRIS blossom has been ""100% self-funded"" from the start and able to accomplish all it has thanks to its supportive clients, Gooljar says. The revenue earned goes back into the company's growth, a strategy that's helped it achieve its milestone of $500,000 in revenue in just a few years. But in the early days, Gooljar did try to secure a business loan — and was turned away.Related: This Black Founder Stayed True to His Triple 'Win' Strategy to Build a $1 Billion Business""I had a white banker in Charlotte, and he was really kind, but looked at me and was like, 'Well, you're not going to get a business loan because you have to be in business for a few years,'"" Gooljar recalls. ""And then I would ask, 'Well, how are people who are just starting a business getting a loan?' 'Oh, they probably have an online presence, or they probably just go into it with money, and then they can put up their own money.' That kind of quasi, not-really-plausible explanation about funding and gatekeeping funding.""


Affording space in Charlotte remained a significant obstacle. Eventually, Gooljar and Whittier moved into a three-bedroom apartment. But there still wasn't enough room for the rapidly growing business, and Gooljar didn't want to spend all the money they made on rent. At one point in their search for a reliable place to store their expensive, perishable materials, someone offered to rent them an Airstream travel trailer for thousands of dollars a month sans air conditioning or running water.Now, Gooljar lives and works out of a house in Florida.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom


""It's cool when people look at me, and they're wondering if my business is working out: All I can do is smile and say, 'You know, it is.'""Throughout his time building IRIS blossom, Gooljar says he's ""stepped on a few toes"" within the gatekept industry and has had to field some pointed questions: ""Well, who are you?"" ""Is your business going to last?"" ""How's your little business going?"" ""How's your flower thing going?""But none of that has deterred Gooljar, who comes from a ""very long line of people working hard.""""My grandma cut sugar cane for 40 years in Trinidad,"" Gooljar says. ""My parents came here with nothing and worked and tried their best. And I'm trying to change that tide. So yeah, it's cool when people look at me, and they're wondering if my business is working out: All I can do is smile and say, 'You know, it is, and I'm putting in the work for it.'""

Now She Has $25 Million in Funding — and Smart Advice for Fellow Black Women Founders.Gooljar admits that ""there's still a long way to go"" in transforming the industry into a more inclusive space, but he's happy to report that other diverse floral businesses popped up in Charlotte after his own — because ""there's room for everybody.""""I see some of the landscape changing, especially when I go into the floral cooler, and I see somebody else that's Black, or I go into the floral cooler, and I see somebody that's young, or I go in there, and I see somebody with pink hair or something,"" Gooljar says.""You have to face those obstacles and keep pushing because there's always going to be people who are preying on your downfall.""Next, Gooljar plans to implement a national subscription program for IRIS, a sort of ""color-by-numbers"" approach. He'll ship the flowers nationwide, and customers can follow along with his arrangements via video. ""I want people who don't feel creative in their current jobs or current lives to get that creative outlet just the same way that I needed that outlet,"" he says.In the long-term, Gooljar's goal is to collaborate with a tech company to make it possible for people to order IRIS flowers on an app ""like they do an Uber."" But even though Gooljar envisions IRIS as a wide-scale service allowing employees to run ""little mini IRIS blossoms out of their own homes,"" quality remains a top priority.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom

It's not always easy, and Gooljar admits there have been ""plenty of times"" he wanted to give up, but he's always kept going — never wavering in his belief that great things are on the other side.""You can ask anyone that I know, and they will tell you that they don't know anybody that grinds the way that I do,"" Gooljar says. ""And I'm not saying that you just have to throw yourself into everything all the time. But I think a big part of this is that you have to face those obstacles and keep pushing because there's always going to be people who are preying on your downfall. There are always going to be roadblocks. There are always going to be obstacles. There are always going to be things to climb, but you have to just keep going.""

53,The Owners of This Texas Farmers Market Took a Big Gamble. Here's How It Paid Off Bigger Than They Dreamed.,"Feb 22, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-this-texas-farmers-markets-gamble-paid-off-big/470139,"
Fall Creek Farmers Market in Humble, Texas, is not just a spot to stop by for your Sunday morning coffee and a fresh vegetable or two. Owners Jonathan and Andrea Haskin built this vibrant space with a vision to change their community's food shopping habits and educate their customers on the importance of buying fresh and local items.The couple came up with the idea for the market in 2015 when they started taking a longer look at what kind of food they had available to them and realized they had to travel far and wide just to source quality ingredients from local farmers. What would happen if they brought their community closer to the source?Related: Top Health and Wellness Franchises



To their delight, the Haskin's neighbors embraced the concept. Situated in the beautiful Fall Creek neighborhood, the market's outdoor setup is near a golf course and several walking trails, drawing tons of people and their pets into the space every Sunday morning.Jonathan and Andrea prioritize being present in their space and providing a personalized experience for every visitor. Getting set up two hours before the market opens and staying until the last group trickles out, the pair walk around to greet and share their story with customers. In the market's early days, their daughters sat at the entrance making bracelets for shoppers as they walked in.


This community feel is what drew in reviewer Forest B., now a regular visitor of Fall Creek Farmers Market. ""All of the vendors were so personable, willing to share advice and their specific stories,"" his review reads. ""I particularly enjoyed the cultural diversity. So much to learn at each booth.""With 20+ vendors spanning global cuisines, there is no limit to the kind of food you can sample at Fall Creek Farmers Market. On his first visit alone, Forest tried a Colombian coffee blend, two empanada flavors, Vietnamese egg rolls, and an Italian ice dessert. The cherry on top was getting to engage with the vendors themselves, learning firsthand about their products and journeys.Related: 4 Reasons Why You Should Enter the Health and Wellness Industry""One [vendor] that's not mentioned in my review is the Indian couple who serve prepared foods there,"" Forest said. ""They are a little bit older. That's completely different, say, from the couple who owns Frostbite, which is the Italian ice vendor. They're youngsters and [are] actually looking to you to provide them information on your journey here in the United States. So you just learn quite a bit about the people. Sometimes people are a little surprised to find out that you know a lot about topics in their areas, but the way you learn a lot is by talking to people and being open and receptive.""


Forest's experience is a perfect example of Jonathan and Andrea's educational ecosystem in action. First and foremost, the market aims to teach its visitors about the importance of fresh, quality food. The Haskins ensure their vendors share this passion and make an effort to educate every customer who visits their booth. 90% of Fall Creek's vendors farm and ranch full-time. Some even take agriculture classes at Texas A&M.""They live it as we do,"" Jonathan said. ""And it starts from the inside. We are really passionate about immersing ourselves into the market, and we are very selective with who we allow [to be] a part of our team.""Jonathan and Andrea's goal is to be the tipping point that pushes customers into the world of local food shopping, and they've found that preparation is key. They engage with customers online ahead of each sale to make sure they have all the information they need for a smooth visit. Because offerings shift each week to spice things up for shoppers and ensure seasonal produce stays front and center, Jonathan and Andrea provide a list of vendors and produce options in advance to help customers plan their meals and build out their grocery lists before arriving at the market.Related: How This Healthy Food App Scored a $200K Investment


The most faithful customers do around 80% of their food shopping at Falls Creek Farmers Market, which was the vision the owners had in mind when they set out to build a business.""It's not a craft show. It's not a bake sale. You can actually come and get your pastured eggs and real items,"" Jonathan said. ""Knowing where your food is from is a big deal. It's like getting a root canal or heart surgery. So it feels really good to be able to serve and to be able to give them access as we have it.""Not only is shopping locally good for your health, but it's good for the local economy. Forest stressed the importance of spending your money and time at small businesses.""Business owners typically are here from other countries. [They] come from backgrounds in which there was virtually no safety net, so they bring their knowledge to the United States. When I'm looking at these businesses, I'm looking at how I can learn more so I can help other people in the community continue to start these small businesses that make our economy run.""


Beyond making visits, reviewing is a powerful way customers can show support. Jonathan and Andrea take every review they receive to heart, always looking to expand the offerings and inclusivity of their space. They find it important to stay receptive to feedback, keeping the dialogue with customers open, genuine, and full of love.In addition to prioritizing customer education and building community, Falls Creek Farmers Market believes:Passion starts from the inside. Put love and care into what you do and it will trickle down to your partners and employees—and ultimately your customers.Preparation is key. Communicate online with your customers ahead of a sale so they know what to expect. Plus, make time to help out with any problems that come up.Supporting local is a great way to learn new things. Opening up your mind and heart to small businesses might just help you discover an important lifestyle change.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Jonathan, Andrea, and Forest, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.Available on: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Pandora and Soundcloud.Editorial contributions by Callie Morgan and Kristi Lindahl.

      Key Takeaways    



        Nelson's first massive beanbag took three weeks to make and quickly caught people's attention. 
      


        Nelson sold the first beanbags to fellow college students, then branched out to boat shows, trade shows and more. 
      


        Once Lovesac had about 40 store locations, Nelson appeared on Richard Branson's reality TV show and secured a $1 million investment. 
      


        Growing the company from that point was filled with more twists and turns, but Lovesac continues to see rapid growth today with an estimated $700 million in annual sales. 
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Shawn Nelson, founder and CEO of furniture manufacturer Lovesac. The company saw annual revenue over $650 million in the fiscal year ending January 29, 2023.Image Credit: Courtesy of LovesacWhen did you start Lovesac as a side hustle, and what inspired it?



It's 1995, and I'm 18, sitting on my parents' couch in Salt Lake City, Utah. One morning, I had an idea and thought, Wouldn't it be funny to make a giant beanbag chair — like the size of my entire living room floor? So, I got off the couch, drove down to the fabric store and bought enough fabric for something that massive. Then, I began sewing it together. It took three weeks to fill it up with soft stuff I cut up from around the house — but everywhere I took it, people loved it and begged me to make them one. Eventually, I did. It cost me $25 to register the name, and in October 1998, Lovesac officially began as a company.Related: The Side Hustle She Started in Her Princeton Dorm Room Led to a $510 Million Business: 'Don't Take No for an Answer'What were some of the first steps you took to get that side hustle off the ground?When I started college at the University of Utah, I lived in my parents' basement, which was the perfect place to roll out huge, long rolls of fabric. My buddies and I would make the Sacs in the basement and sell them at our college. We quickly became known as the ""Lovesac guys"" around campus, with even the frats and sororities buying a few Sacs for their houses. From there, we were a fixture at any event we could find — boat shows, home shows, car shows, Oktoberfest — and this is how we grew the company in those earliest days.Were there challenges that came with running the side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those?After two or three years of running Lovesac as a side hustle in college, it was apparent that it would not make any real money in its current form. In fact, it probably cost me money to keep it alive. Sure, we'd make a profit selling the product — but then the van would break. Or the foam shredder would break. Or the state would fine me and my buddies for some workplace violation. The bottom line is: Building a business is hard, and it can take a lot of money to make it to some kind of meaningful critical mass.


As we grew, I was working harder than ever. It was draining, but I couldn't help but give it one last shot at a trade show in Chicago, hoping to get to the next level. One of the biggest retailers in the U.S. placed an order for 12,000 Sacs, not knowing that it was just me and a buddy working out of a rundown building with a wood chipper as a foam shredder.Despite every inefficiency, we completed the order, but then we realized we had no other big customers to sell to. We went to the furniture stores, but they all laughed at us and said it was a stupid idea — so we decided to open our own store. The first Lovesac store opened on November 17, 2001.Image Credit: Courtesy of LovesacRelated: The 'Easy' Side Hustle He Started in College Hit More Than $1 Million in Revenue — and Taught Him 3 Business Lessons He Still Uses TodayWhen did you decide to take the business from side hustle to full-time venture?Our first store changed everything — this is when I pivoted the company to a full-time venture. Consumers were obsessed with Lovesac. They came in, bought Sacs, flopped down and hung out with friends. The product was the best sales pitch we could give. We were doing six figures in just the first few weeks, and I had never seen money like that. We promptly ran off to open the second store in Provo, Utah, then Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Southern California. Growth went ballistic.What were some of the biggest hurdles that came up over the years once you were running the business full-time? How did you overcome those?We had grown to 35-40 locations when I got recruited to be on Richard Branson's reality TV show, The Rebel Billionaire, in 2005. It was a national primetime show on Fox Network, and I won a $1 million investment! Of course, I was $2 million in debt, having built this growing retail chain, but what are you going to do? We took the winnings, paid off some debt and raised more money through venture capital. However, the venture capitalists wanted to bankrupt the company and start over cleanly through Chapter 11 reorganization. I was devastated. We had made it all this way, yet somehow, the only way forward was to begin again.


We moved the company to Stamford, Connecticut, downsized the staff to a skeleton crew and started over with just 12 locations and about 12 employees at our tiny new HQ on the East Coast. It was the right move in the long run. We learned, focused and built the company back up to 30, 40, then 50 locations. Some people might have coasted after that, but I got another wild idea. Ironically, this one happened because of a couch, too.In that first store, we had a couch in the corner to show the Sacs in a living room-type environment. We noticed that customers always asked to buy the couch, but it was too big to sell. So, the idea was, What if we could shrink down this couch the way we shrink down our Sacs? And that's how the concept of Sactionals was born.Related: This College Student Started a Side Hustle So He Didn't Have to Bartend Until 4 am. Now He's Earning $7,000 a Month — and Putting It to Good Use.In 2012, Lovesac was named the fastest-growing furniture company in the U.S. by Furniture Today — what made that rapid growth possible? How has the company approached scaling over the years?Around this time, I recognized that if we were going to really compete, we needed to pivot the business. With this in mind, I changed our focus to becoming a direct-to-consumer furniture brand with Sactionals as the primary driver. I took a risk and invested in local and then national TV advertising for the Sactionals, along with every emerging digital approach. Sactionals quickly became the fastest-selling couch solution in the United States. Lovesac expanded to nearly 80 locations, and then [we] took the company public in 2018 with $100 million in sales.After you go public, the sky's the limit. The company was worth $200-300 million overnight. It felt like a dream; I couldn't believe it. We grew to hundreds of locations by the 2020s. We have thousands of employees, and we've been named the fastest-growing furniture company in the U.S. numerous times. Our sales have multiplied and will likely grow to a billion dollars and beyond. The Sactionals gave us a new future. Their rapid adoption revealed that people love the idea of things being built to last a lifetime and designed to evolve with you throughout your life. We're proving that planned obsolescence was the wrong way to make a brand that lasts. We call this new approach to innovation Designed for Life, and it will inform everything we do from here on out.Image Credit: Courtesy of LovesacWhat is the company's current valuation? How much revenue does it bring in today?


Looking back at the past year, Lovesac's growth and performance results are a testament to the resilience of our brand and disruptive business model that has consistently delivered category outperformance and customer loyalty. Through a challenging year for our category, we've been able to maintain momentum with our commitment to product innovation, compelling marketing and a highly productive omnichannel footprint. These strategies continue to drive consumer demand and further distinguish our unique brand from a crowded market. Looking ahead, we believe that we are poised to continue investing in the future with an accelerated pace of expansion and innovation to further garner customer enthusiasm.Prior to reporting year-end results, Wall Street analysts estimate Lovesac's sales for the fiscal year that just ended to come in at around $700 million, with high single-digit adjusted EBITDA profitability. The company has fluctuated in multiples and market cap valuations over the past four years hovering in the $300-400 million range, peaking at over $1 billion in 2021 when the home category hit all-time highs during the pandemic.Related: The Side Hustle He Saw on YouTube Earned Him a Multi-Year Deal With Sony and Income Streams Generating Tens of ThousandsWhen you look to your company's future, what are you most excited about?At Lovesac, innovation is at the center of our design philosophy as we continue to prioritize developing breakthrough technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the furniture category.

If you can learn from my mistakes, however, then perhaps your ambitions, big or small, can be realized in less than the 25-plus years it has taken me to finally learn something and get somewhere with mine.Here are some of the biggest lessons I've learned:


1. Heed what the experts have to say, but on occasion, you need to trust your gut.2. There comes a point before any major change in your career, business or personal life where you can greatly improve your odds for good outcomes by making a bold decision to ditch the safety net and fully commit.3. Play along the way, taking the time you need to keep yourself relaxed and sharp.4. You're no good to anyone as a miserable, uptight workaholic.Related: He Started a Side Hustle in His Dorm Room With 'a Bunch of Ingredients From Amazon and a Crockpot' — Now It's a $56 Million Brand in Walmarts NationwideDo you have any advice for others interested in starting a side hustle or business of their own?The entrepreneurial journey I've faced over the past quarter-century has been full of triumphant victories and humbling defeats, born from sweat, tears and relentless determination. With my new podcast series and memoir, I look forward to creating and fostering a sense of community through these channels and shining a light on real, raw stories from industry trailblazers on the movements they have built to bring valuable insights and knowledge to those that seek it.Growing Lovesac into what it is has taken my entire adult life and is the hardest thing I've ever done. I have so many memories and have built so many lifelong friends throughout this journey that make all the stumbles, roadblocks, sleepless nights and unrelenting stress worth it. My advice for anyone considering starting down the road of being a founder would be this: Get off the couch! Trust your instincts, and just keep going. That life-changing moment could be right around the corner, and the last thing you want to do is turn back just before you arrive.Entrepreneurship is a never-ending pursuit, but the journey is the gift. With an open mind, an honest heart, some ambition, time, help and a little bit of luck, all things are possible.

""Be nice, be clean, and be present."" This is the mantra of Philip and Sibs Harrell, owners of Sundae Scoop, a mom-and-pop ice cream shop in Virginia Beach, Virginia.Customer service is the number one priority for these business owners. Whether chatting with customers or selecting and training staff, Philip and Sibs focus on creating an inviting community space for friends and families to gather.Related: 7 Essentials of Great Customer Service



""At the end of the day, being in the community is what an ice cream shop is about,"" Philip said. ""We represent every culture that's in our area. That's where the ube ice cream comes from, or the coquito, or rum raisin. Each one of those [flavors] is gonna respond or touch something in someone that they remember from their childhood.""Sundae Scoop's warm and engaging customer service has earned the business a 4.8-star Yelp rating with nearly 100 reviews (at the time of writing). Most reviewers discuss positive experiences they've had interacting with Philip and his friendly staff, including Yelp Elite Aneesa P.


Arriving right after the store had opened for the day, Aneesa chatted with Philip as she ordered her ice cream. He shared the story of the shop, helped her pick out the perfect gluten-free flavor, and even helped her snap the perfect photos and videos to accompany her review.""I felt like we really connected,"" Aneesa said. ""He wasn't just like 'Here's your ice cream. Go.' He was like, 'Hey, I want to let you know, behind the scenes, the story of how I came up with this idea.'""Philip and Sibs see positive reviews like Aneesa's as a key tool for boosting staff morale. When a scooper gets called out by name for contributing to a positive customer experience, Philip and Sibs are the first to let them know.""They're young kids. They're very self-conscious,"" Sibs said. ""So it feels really good when people give them their big-ups and name them.""


Philip and Sibs spend a lot of time not only encouraging existing staff but also hiring scoopers who will contribute to Sundae Scoop's hospitable culture. They ask all job candidates to thoroughly read the reviews and take note of what people love most about the shop. They want to make sure all new and potential hires are ready to deliver the peppy, friendly service Sundae Scoop promises.Related: How Chef JJ Started a Rice Bowl Revolution in HarlemAs a community-driven space, Sundae Scoop is active in the Virginia Beach area, partnering with local schools and businesses on events like ice cream socials. Philip and Sibs are also committed to mentoring fellow small business owners, connecting with other businesses through community groups and promoting them on the walls of their shop. In his three years running Sundae Scoop, Philip has helped three other businesses get off the ground.""They took the risk too. They took that leap of faith,"" he said. ""So if someone like myself or my wife can come along and help them on their journey, that's all the better because it's building a stronger community.""


Philip has found these relationships especially important to cultivate as a Black business owner. He speaks to the fear of the unknown that can surface in the Black business owner community when you don't know who to turn to or what resources are out there.Related: 3 Strategies This Vietnamese Noodle Shop Has Used to Thrive in Minnesota""I always encourage people just to join something,"" he said. ""You gotta find something bigger than yourself. You have to find people who look like you, and you have to find people who don't look like you. And you need to be able to use advice from all of them and put it together.""Supporting Black-owned businesses was part of Aneesa's motivation to visit Sundae Scoop. Being one of a handful of Black women in her field, she was able to connect with Philip over what it's like to be successful in a white-dominated space. Aneesa stressed the importance of writing reviews to ensure that great Black-owned businesses don't get closed down due to a lack of support.


""We all have to support each other, not bring each other down,"" she said. ""[It's] really important to me to be able to let everybody know, 'Hey, we can own all of these spaces and also be successful as well.'""Philip and Sibs remind themselves every day of their commitment to being groundbreakers in their community with a mural on the wall of Sundae Scoop. This reimagining of the famous painting ""Under the Wave off Kanagawa"" represents a line from artist and rapper Tobe Nwigwe's song ""EAT"" that reads: ""[We] don't just ride the wave, we create it.'""""[Sundae Scoop] is our way of creating our own waves, of making our own path and making sure that we're going to be okay,"" Philip said. ""At the end of the day, just be good, support each other, and help each other where you can, and I can almost promise you that it's going to come back your way.""In addition to the power of warm and engaging customer service, Sundae Scoop believes:Reviews are the roadmap to success. Positive feedback can be used to set key expectations for staff, and critical feedback can be used to make important changes to operations or processes that make the customer experience easier or more enjoyable.Friendly staff play an important role in creating positive customer experiences, and training them on your processes and values is a key part of your customer service strategy. Hire a diverse team of employees who are dedicated to delivering your business's mission.Minority-owned small businesses need to support each other. By guiding and mentoring others, business owners can pave the way for a flourishing Black-owned business community.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Philip, Sibs, and Aneesa, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.Available on: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Pandora, and Soundcloud.Editorial contributions by Callie Morgan and Kristi Lindahl

56,How This Mom-Daughter Team Drove More Than $7.5 Million In Sales In Their First Business Year,"Feb 6, 2024",Kim Kavin,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-this-mom-daughter-team-drove-more-than-75-million-in/469024,"
Lisa Odenweller remembers somebody telling her: You'll learn from your first company, and you'll make money on your second.That's exactly how it happened with Beaming (her first company) and Kroma (her second). But she wasn't the only one following this path. Her daughter, Lexi, turned 13 during the early days of Beaming — and learned a lot by working for her mom. Now they're driving millions of dollars of sales together.""I feel like I adopted a lot of her traits,"" says Lexi, who's 26 today, and says she'd rather work with her mom than start her own business. ""I see how much goes into it. It's not like, 'Oh, I'm a CEO, I could create my own schedule this and that.' She literally works 16 hours a day, seven days, eight days a week.""Lisa's entrepreneurial journey began in earnest back in 2011, when she founded Beaming as a ""healthy grab-and-go"" business. She grew it to 10 locations, mostly in Los Angeles. (Lexi was managing three of those stores as a teenager.) Lisa sold the company to Earthbar in 2018, making it a success story by any measure — but the experience taught her that if she wanted to make serious money, she needed a different concept.



Beaming was a retail store, which meant that growth could only happen through new locations. Lisa wanted her next company's products to travel further and faster — which is why she built the wellness company Kroma in 2020. It makes ""highly functional, superfood-rich products"" — things like broths, snacks, adaptogen lattes — that can be mailed or carried anywhere. It was a concept she thought investors would like even more than they'd liked Beaming — but because she launched during the pandemic, she also knew the normal fundraising tour wouldn't work.So she came up with a new strategy: She reached out to investors just to offer them Kroma's flagship product for free. It's an ""anti-cleanse cleanse"" program, as she calls it: A program of daily meals and beverages to reduce bloating and weight, improve sleep and concentration, and increase energy.


""We literally went to angel investors and said, 'Here, we're giving you this, try it. Tell us what you think,'"" she says.The strategy succeeded. She got 130 people to try it — with Lexi hand-making and packaging every order — and raised $4.5 million in the process. (The company has gone on to raise a total of $9 million.) Word of mouth spread. Friends of friends wanted in. By the time Kroma launched in July 2021, the media coverage included photos of Odenweller with Jessica Seinfeld, Gwyneth Paltrow and Amy Schumer.""I did not know any of these investors before I started the process,"" she says. ""People assumed that I had access to them. I just one by one by one got to people of influence that believed in the products.""By the end of its first year, Kroma had done more than $7.5 million in business with only $100,000 spent on paid media — with Odenweller as CEO, and Lexi as senior marketing manager.


The mom-daughter pair spend a lot of time together (and even lived together during the pandemic). Lisa says two of the big keys to keeping their relationship intact were, and are, smiling and compartmentalizing.""We laugh a lot. We really do. We crack up all the time and laugh at the simplest things, put on music, whatever it is to create an energy of joy,"" she says. ""Honestly, I would say we're really good about boundaries. When she and I go out to dinner or whatever we're doing, we're out to play. We don't sit at dinner and talk about business. When we're in play mode, we're in play mode.""Lisa says building Kroma with Lexi by her side has also helped to assuage her guilt about being a single working mom.""This was always a big whisper in the back of my head that weighed heavily. Was I there enough?"" she says. ""Lexi started working for me when she was 13. Having her by my side, witnessing her growth into an amazing businesswoman, has not only bridged that 'mom guilt' that we seemingly all carry no matter how present we are. It turned it into an incredible journey.""

      Key Takeaways    



        Paul and Cranston's Dos Hombres, which means ""two men'' in Spanish, launched in 2019. 
      


        The mezcal is crafted in Oaxaca by third-generation maestro mezcalero Gregorio Velasco. 
      


        The business partners use a leadership approach honed over years on the set of 'Breaking Bad.' 
      












""I saw a clear opening with mezcal,"" Aaron Paul, co-founder of Dos Hombres Mezcal with fellow actor Bryan Cranston, says. ""You ask anyone on the side of the road, 'Name your favorite mezcal,' [and] they're like, 'Oh, mezcal is…' But they can name a vodka, a tequila.""Cranston and Paul, who played Walter White and Jesse Pinkman on AMC's award-winning crime drama series Breaking Bad, became fast friends on set. So, when Paul suggested the duo start a mezcal brand of their own several years after the show wrapped, Cranston was all in.Image Credit: Paul Quitoriano for Dos Hombres Mezcal 



Dos Hombres, which means ""two men"" in Spanish, launched in 2019. The mezcal is crafted by third-generation maestro mezcalero Gregorio Velasco, who uses traditional production methods to blend Espadin agave hand-picked from the hillsides of the small village of San Luis del Rio in Oaxaca, Mexico. It boasts notes of apples, mango, local ""zapote"" fruits, wood and an ""almost imperceptible"" smoke on the finish.Constellation Brands announced a minority stake in Dos Hombres in 2021 through its venture capital group, though the company remains independently owned and continues to manage, market and produce its mezcal.

They're determined to make Dos Hombres the No. 1 mezcal, they say, and that means doing things a bit differently than some of the many other celebrity spirits brands.""Celebrities have an opportunity,"" Cranston says. ""They have the door open. You want to come in? It's up to you. And a lot of celebrities will come in — and then go away. You want me to go and work…?""""Wait, you're not just going to write me…a check?"" Paul quips.Related: How to Be Your Own Boss and Drink on the Job


Cranston notes that ""there are far more celebrity brands that have failed than have succeeded."" But, like their on-screen characters, the pair isn't afraid to get in the trenches and do what needs to be done. Until about six months ago, the co-founders ""were on emails constantly,"" and Paul ran the company's social media accounts.""I think actors, especially, we're used to stepping into something we don't know,"" Cranston says. ""Every time we take a job, 'I think it could be this, but I'm not sure.' I'm playing a podiatrist — 'Oh, I gotta go learn all about the feet.' So we're not daunted about stepping into something we don't know. We're like a dry sponge. So we go down to Oaxaca once a year and talk to our people.""Image Credit: Paul Quitoriano for Dos Hombres Mezcal ""We break bread with them. We talk to them, and we learn.""Dos Hombres has 50 employees in Mexico and 22 in the U.S., and Paul and Cranston have personally interviewed each person who was hired onto the team. They want to make sure that everyone understands the culture they've built: ""We work hard here, and then we go home,"" Cranston says. ""That's the greatest thing. Work hard, go home.""Paul and Cranston are ""very proud"" of the team members they've brought together — and seize every opportunity to learn from them.""We break bread with them,"" Cranston says. ""We talk to them, and we learn. Every time we're down there, it's like, 'Oh wait a minute, that's a new thing. Why are you doing this? Oh right. What happened there?' And then [we] learn about the mashing, the smoking, fermentation, the distillation, bottling.""Related: Comedy Legend Dan Aykroyd Doesn't Mess Around When It Comes to Vodka


Paul and Cranston's hands-on leadership approach to building their ideal company, team and culture is a straightforward but perhaps underrated one these days. And it carries over from their years on the set of Breaking Bad. Paul, who was 28 when the show debuted, says that Cranston taught him that ""when you're No. 1 on the call sheet, you set the tone.""""[Cranston is] the hardest worker in the room but also the most immature person you've ever met,"" Paul says. ""And I say that with love and respect because he does the job perfectly, but he has the best time doing it. He loves to pull pranks; [he] jokes.""Cranston says there were a couple of hundred people on set that they felt responsible for, and to help establish the kind of close-knit culture they envisioned, they started a bowling night with not just the crew but the crew's family, too. ""We'd take over the entire bowling alley and just play,"" he recalls.Image Credit: Paul Quitoriano for Dos Hombres Mezcal 


""Down in Mexico, they say, 'You kiss the spirit.'""The co-founders might not have anticipated going into business together during their early days on set. Cranston admits he had no idea Paul had such a ""business mind,"" though he was quickly impressed by his co-star's boundless ""energy"" and strong work ethic — and adds that ""he's not at all like Jesse Pinkman.""Needless to say, the real-life friends have a more functional business partnership than Jesse and Walt ever did. They also have a lot of fun with it: Just don't ask them to take any shots of mezcal if you run into them at the bar.""We go out a lot to all the bars and restaurants, and most of the younger kids go, 'Ah, let's do shots,'"" Cranston explains.""It's sacrilegious to do a shot of mezcal,"" Paul says. ""Down in Mexico, they say, 'You kiss the spirit.'""

58,How Chef JJ Started a Rice Bowl Revolution in Harlem,"Feb 1, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-chef-jj-started-a-rice-bowl-revolution-in-harlem/469038,"
When Chef JJ Johnson opened his first rice bowl restaurant, he set up shop in an area that doesn't see a lot of his kind of businesses. Where others saw that as a problem, he saw it as an opportunity to fill a clean eating gap in a working-class community that has traditionally lacked access to healthy, fast-casual restaurants. That first FIELDTRIP location in Harlem was the first of three storefronts he opened across New York City providing nutritious meals at quick speeds and affordable prices.""I think I'm a disruptor,"" Chef JJ said. ""Throughout my career, looking at communities of Black and brown folks and talking to developers and landlords in the search, [people were] always saying that these communities don't want this type of food. And that's not true.""Related: How to Open a Restaurant Step By Step



FIELDTRIP's bowls focus on one ingredient—rice—which Chef JJ calls the ""greatest connector in the world."" From Southeast Asia to West Africa to the Caribbean, the restaurant takes its customers on a trip around the globe with hearty and delicious blends of vegetables, proteins, and starches. The goal is to use ingredients that are familiar to FIELDTRIP's diverse customer base to create fresh and balanced meals.Despite some initial, external resistance to his business idea, Chef JJ's restaurant was a huge success and has since expanded to storefronts near Rockefeller Center and Columbia University. His fresh, flavorful bowls have drawn in many loyal customers, including Yelp reviewer Sonya H.


""The guy who welcomed us at the door was great,"" Sonya said, reflecting on her first time at the Harlem location. ""And all the workers were great. They were mixing up the food, and they gave me a sample of their tea. And I was like, 'Oh, this is a good sign.' Everything was perfect.""Even with a glowing review, Sonya's first ""field trip"" wasn't entirely smooth sailing. When she called to order to-go bowls for herself and her son, the staff wasn't able to take her order over the phone. But she didn't let that deter her, and upon arriving at the busy restaurant in person, she understood why no one was able to process her call right away.Related: Restaurant Owners Reveal Their Success SecretsThough Chef JJ recognizes that it might turn some customers away, not taking call-in orders is actually a strategic part of how he refines his business model. Instead of taking a customer's information over the phone, which can pose legal problems, the celebrity chef and his staff direct customers to order on FIELDTRIP's website or mobile app. The online system not only improves the accuracy and security of orders, but allows Chef JJ to track who his customers are, what menu items they like, and how often they're eating at FIELDTRIP.


""When you look at brands that are growing, you need that data,"" Chef JJ said. ""Who are your customers? What do they look like?""By observing what kinds of customers the restaurant appeals to, Chef JJ is better able to cater to his audience when making decisions about expansions and rewards programs. While he doesn't think FIELDTRIP has found its ""home run location"" yet, he is always thinking about how to move closer to his targets. As FIELDTRIP's location near Columbia University grows, the business's next step is to tailor offerings to undergraduate students.Chef JJ also tries to differentiate his business through top-tier customer service. When conducting market research for his Harlem location, he found that many fast-casual restaurants in the neighborhood were known for having unfriendly service. In response to this, FIELDTRIP makes a point of always greeting customers and calling out ""See you on your next trip!"" as they exit, earning staff their reputation for charm.Despite Sonya's initial frustration with not being able to call in her order, she gave FIELDTRIP five stars on Yelp after experiencing the restaurant's hospitality in person.


Chef JJ maintains that hospitality with online touch points as well, making an effort to respond to every review he receives. He often goes the extra mile, communicating with critical reviewers to invite them back for a better experience.Chef JJ is grateful for loyal customers like Sonya who support him and other Black business owners, who haven't always been given the resources they need to succeed. By identifying with business attributes on Yelp, FIELDTRIP's business page is able to attract diners who are eager to invest in the Black business owner community.""I'm happy to see other people of color promoting businesses that look like them for folks that don't know about them,"" JJ said. ""We have to come together just as much as we want everybody else to come together with us.""In addition to knowing your audience and engaging with your customers, FIELDTRIP believes in:


Breaking the mold. Locate business opportunities by thinking about what your community needs, not what it has already found success with.Making strategic operating decisions. Using and encouraging an online order system is a great way to acquire crucial data about your customers that can inform future business operations.Creating a sense of belonging. Small things like being greeted as soon as they walk in the door can have the power to reverse poor first impressions and keep customers coming back.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Chef JJ and Sonya, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.Available on: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Pandora, and Soundcloud.Editorial contributions by Callie Morgan and Kristi Lindahl.

59,3 Strategies This Vietnamese Noodle Shop Has Used to Thrive in Minnesota,"Jan 30, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-customer-service-is-creating-loyal-customers-at-this/468995,"
In Twin Cities, Minnesota, Justin Bui and his family serve up authentic Vietnamese cuisine at MT Noodles. A favorite amongst locals, this noodle shop is known for high-quality ingredients, incredible customer service, and a core mission of integrating heritage and family into everything it does.MT Noodles all started with recipes created by Justin's mom. ""My mom's the backbone of it all. It's her recipes. She's been in the restaurant industry for over 20 plus years. It's her life, and it was just another way to express herself — through food. For us, it's being able to share Vietnamese cuisine with the community,"" he says. ""We focus on really bringing those authentic dishes from her homeland to your table so that anyone can try it.""Related: Inside the Spa Where Calming Treatments Are Served Up With Craft Beer



Justin and his team prioritize using high-quality ingredients and harbor a genuine desire to share Vietnamese culture with customers. Staff routinely talk with guests to make sure they find exactly the right dish, especially if they've never had Vietnamese food before.""To see someone who's never seen it before be willing to try, it's really exciting. You get to try something that is truly authentic and something you might not be able to get anywhere else,"" Justin says. ""We want to help you navigate how to eat it. We try to tell all of our servers, 'Answer questions, educate customers,' because nowadays we get a lot of newer customers who maybe don't have a background in Vietnamese culture. And for us, as Vietnamese staff, how do we educate others to understand what this cuisine is about? No judgments at all. We're here to just help you navigate through it.""

Now She Has Ice Cream Shops All Across the Country — Including Disney.For Yelp reviewers like Robby W., Justin and his team's willingness to help him learn about the cuisine and the MT Noodles family was something that really stood out and made his experience memorable.""I think it's really important to go to small businesses that focus on cuisines that aren't really emphasized a lot in American culture. Pho is really popular and bahn mi's are really popular. But I think there's quite a few people who probably can't name another Vietnamese dish… There's a whole lot of flavor out there that we miss with the traditional American palette. But it's so different when it's family-run, and this lady comes out there and tells me how much this dish meant to her family and her life growing up, and really opened my eyes to what her childhood was like. That's something you don't get from anything but a family-owned restaurant,"" Robby said.Yet success at MT Noodles extends beyond the team's willingness to share their cuisine and heritage with customers. They're also incredibly united in all of their wins as well as their mistakes, something that has proven to be a key motivator as they expand their business and continue to grow.


""We're really out there on our feet a lot, constantly moving. Mistakes are going to happen. It's really about always making sure we think of a solution. We'll talk to the customer, but let's see what we can do better then,"" Just said. "" Customers have different preferences, and you got to make sure you don't take it too personally. We've been really blessed with having a great staff that's able to communicate with all of our customers and really understand our priorities.

Robby's engagement with the team after his meal made the experience even more special.


""They replied directly to my Yelp post, which is really nice, and they wished me a happy belated birthday, which was just so sweet.

60,4 Trends That Are Defining the New Era of PR,"Jan 29, 2024",Sarah Evans,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-trends-defining-the-new-era-of-pr/468643,"
The landscape of public relations is evolving at an unprecedented pace, driven by technological advancements and a shifting focus on what truly resonates with audiences. As we navigate this new era, several key trends are emerging that redefine the role and strategies of PR agencies. While the fundamentals of the practice remain relevant, the way the job is performed now teeters more on a balance of tech-powered and human-driven approaches.Related: 5 Innovative PR Strategies to Boost Your Brand in 20241. AI and predictive analysis: The new PR playbookInfusing artificial intelligence and predictive analytics into public relations is more than a trend; it's a revolution. Modern PR agencies leverage these technologies to foresee media trends, identify storylines and pinpoint the most effective reporters and outlets. This tech-driven approach ensures that the content reaches the right audience and engages them effectively, resulting in a consistent flow of impactful media placements.



Example strategy:AI-Powered Media Landscape Analysis: Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current media landscape, scanning thousands of articles, social media posts, and trending topics to identify emerging patterns, hot topics, and key influencers.Predictive Storyline Identification: Leverage predictive analytics to identify potential storylines gaining traction.Targeted Reporter and Outlet Matching: Analyze past articles and reports from various journalists and media outlets, creating a list of reporters and outlets most likely to be interested in targeted stories.Related: Five Ways To Ensure A Successful 2024 Public Relations Plan For Your Business


2. Depth of engagement over audience breadthGone are the days when the success of a PR campaign was measured solely by the size of the audience reached. Today, the quality of attention matters more. Engaging with niche markets, local news, and specialized channels like podcasts and newsletters has proven more effective. Focusing on the depth of engagement, this approach fosters stronger connections and more meaningful conversations with the audience. It reflects a shift towards building trust, awareness, credibility, and authority -- which are the foundational and fundamental building blocks of public relations.This depth-first approach involves creating content that resonates personally, sparking not just views but also conversations, shares, and a strong community presence. PR agencies are increasingly prioritizing metrics like time spent on content, the quality of discourse in comments, and the emotional resonance of the message. By doing so, they can foster a loyal audience base more likely to advocate for and stay engaged with the brand. This methodical focus on nurturing a dedicated following is especially crucial in an era where consumers value authenticity and personalization more than ever.Related: Artificial Intelligence is Revolutionizing Marketing. Here's What the Transformation Means for the Industry3. Strategic communications in tech PRThe tech industry presents unique challenges and opportunities in PR, especially in sub-verticals like cybersecurity, cloud and SaaS. Agencies specializing in tech PR excel in navigating these complex landscapes. Their strategic communications are tailored to resonate within the dynamic tech markets, often involving securing prestigious awards and coveted speaking engagements that amplify visibility and establish authority.


This involves a meticulous understanding of both the technological aspects and the market dynamics. By harnessing data analytics, market insights, and consumer behavior patterns, PR professionals are crafting campaigns that inform, educate, and engage diverse stakeholders. This approach is integral in demystifying complex tech concepts for the general public and positioning tech companies as thought leaders and innovators. Whether it's launching a new product, managing a crisis, or shaping brand perception, the strategic communication efforts in the tech sector are increasingly about creating a narrative that aligns with both business objectives and user expectations, fostering a powerful brand resonance in an ever-evolving digital landscape.4. Efficiency and productivity: Beyond billable hoursThe traditional model of billing by the hour is being challenged. Modern PR agencies focus more on productivity and results than just the number of hours worked. This trend is about doing more with less — leveraging technology and efficient strategies to deliver results without unnecessary overhead. It's a win-win for both agencies and clients, leading to more productive engagements and more impactful outcomes.These trends signify a transformative period in the world of public relations. Agencies that embrace these changes — employing advanced technology, focusing on meaningful engagement, specializing in strategic communications, and prioritizing efficiency — are leading the way in this new era. This comprehensive approach and deep expertise across various sectors exemplify this modern PR agency, one that is not just keeping up with the times but actively shaping the industry's future.

Every collaboration is different, but there are a few key steps to take.Identify potential collaboratorsBefore you can establish a partnership, you need to find potential partners. Attend networking events and conferences for ample opportunities to connect with like-minded professionals who offer valuable industry insights and knowledge of emerging trends. While there, focus on engaging in meaningful conversations, participating in workshops and attending relevant panel discussions to build strong relationships with peers.But don't limit your outreach to in-person events! There is power in cultivating networking relationships in online spaces. Online forums like industry-specific social media groups and collaboration platforms provide a virtual meeting ground where companies can exchange ideas and share expertise with other innovators across the globe.


Establish common goals and objectivesChoose partners with similar values to create a strong foundation for collaboration. While considering different perspectives drives growth, it's best to partner with companies with shared core principles. By aligning missions, businesses can identify a unified purpose that extends beyond individual interests.Build a solid foundation for collaboration where each partner sees tangible advantages, defines clear objectives and outlines specific, measurable goals to create a cohesive roadmap for assessing progress and success.Encourage open communication and transparencyWhat's at the core of all partnerships, professional or personal? Trust.Open and clear communication channels create a work environment where partners feel comfortable sharing ideas, concerns and updates. Regular meetings through video conferences, emails or project management platforms help maintain a steady flow of information and keep parties well-informed and on the same page.


Openly discuss each partner's contributions and commitments to build a foundation of trust and accountability. This transparency extends to timelines, budget considerations and any potential challenges that may arise. Transparency also empowers partners to openly address challenges.No collaboration is without its obstacles. So, acknowledge issues early on and work together to find solutions to strengthen the partnership.Fostering a culture with open dialogue makes way for proactive problem-solving and prevents small issues from escalating into larger ones. It also reduces the likelihood of burned bridges or soured relationships. By embracing open communication and transparency, businesses set the stage for a healthy collaborative relationship built on mutual understanding, trust and a shared commitment to success.Related: 5 Characteristics to Look for in a Great Strategic Partner

This adaptability creates an environment where partners feel empowered to contribute in ways that align with their strengths.

62,Avoid These 3 Key Mistakes for Team Success in 2024,"Jan 25, 2024",Tom Medema,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-key-mistakes-that-hurt-team-collaboration/468462,"
As the CEO of Bubbles, which is dedicated to enhancing collaborative efficiency throughout the myriad of modern workplaces, I know I face an uphill battle, but I recognize the challenges ahead. This is the rationale behind encouraging every member of a team to approach this challenge with clarity and the necessary knowledge and equipment to unlock their team's potential and begin to drive even better workplace results.Part of this process is centered around dodging common yet overlooked mistakes. Identifying such mistakes can often seem glaringly obvious to someone like me, as it is essentially an inherent focus. Still, I recognize that this is a unique perspective, and therefore, I want to embark on this journey of empowerment for other professionals.To begin, I want to highlight a fact uncovered within a recent Salesforce study that indicated that 86% of employees and executives identified ineffective collaboration and communication as a leading cause of business failure. This is a scarily high figure, but it proves the critical importance of soft skills within businesses. Possessing certain business-specific technical skills is one thing within a team environment, but without the aforementioned non-technical skills, team environments can often become stifling, and the likelihood of success diminishes.



The notion of soft skills being eroded in the current, highly digital age is something that I have previously explored and covered extensively. Still, as well as thinking that this is not a fully accurate hypothesis, I also believe that we can begin to set ourselves up better to thrive. By originally recognizing the importance and then focusing on eradicating everyday barriers and mistakes, we arrive at a possibility to improve, and this is what I want to establish here, with this leading me to the first mistake to sidestep.1. Underestimating the power of clear communicationThe previous paragraph has already emphasized how great communication is any team's lifeblood, so I will just reiterate briefly. Moving into 2024, where we see remote work and digital tools at the forefront, we must adapt more carefully than ever.


Being able to balance efficiency with the retention of critical soft skills is something that I believe will enhance workplaces as we move forward, but it is a tall order. This is why we must prioritize clarity and establish clear communication channels and methods; excessive reliance on digital communication in the instance that a team has not achieved the former goal risks misunderstandings and a decrease in productivity and, subsequently, morale. Excessive reliance on digital communication, when a team is not ready for this, can be dangerous for widespread reasons, leading me to the next mistake to eradicate.Related: Five Shortcuts For Maximizing Efficiency At Work2. Failing to adapt to new technologiesResistance or failure to adapt to and adopt new technology can severely handicap teams. It is clear that rapid developments in technology lead to higher expectations for output from workplace sectors that directly benefit from such advancements.For example, using a tool like Bubbles' AI notetaker to record, transcribe and summarize meetings into actions can streamline team collaboration and communication, ensuring clarity is retained post-meeting. The key point here, however, is that a company or team that fails to adopt technology like this will be stuck carrying out these automated actions themselves, losing time, disrupting timelines and likely increasing confusion throughout the team.


They are likely to witness their efficiency decrease relative to their more adaptable competitors, potentially losing customers. Although fictional, scenarios such as this have led reputable sources to notions such as ""innovate or die"" in relation to businesses evolving technologically. Although generally, this represents a critical mistake, it can also be transformed into a tip.I say so because, looking at Deloitte's global survey of managers and executives, we learn that 90% of respondents and companies agree that digital technologies and trends are disrupting their industries but that only 44% feel adequately prepared for these disruptions. An old school teacher once said they believe in ""good preparation"" over ""good luck,"" and I want to echo this notion here. I believe that by being prepared to face and embrace technological advancements, we can collaborate better and, in turn, shift the mistake of technological negligence into a seamless transition.Related: How High-Yield CEOs Build a Schedule to Maximize Efficiency3. Undervaluing regular feedback and employee well-beingFeedback is one of the most powerful tools for growth, especially collaboratively, and yet remains often underutilized in many workplaces. This would make sense to me if feedback represented an aspect of work that the majority of employees wanted to dodge, but the reality is quite the contrary. A study by PwC revealed that almost 60% of respondents claimed to want regular feedback on a daily or weekly basis. Everybody wants to improve and innovate to avoid the notion above of ""innovate or die"", and well-executed feedback is the key to unlocking improvement.


Make sure not to fall into the mistake of moving with the wind in collaborative efforts, as this can not only stunt growth but can lead to further issues and mistakes, such as groupthink. No one wants to be a member of a stagnant team or feel like they are not growing as a person and employee, and therefore, this links to the criticality of employee well-being. A happy team is a productive team, and being able to reduce workplace stress can positively impact a team's bottom line. Don't be worried if you feel that this is something your team has neglected; the reality is uncovered by The American Psychological Association, which found that 550 million workdays are lost every year due to workplace stress.Overall, don't be alarmed! The key is to recognize these mistakes and dangers now, and focus on eradicating them from your team while you can!

63,5 Practical Strategies for Instilling a Culture of Compliance in Your Team,"Jan 25, 2024",Pritom Das,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-practical-strategies-for-instilling-a-culture-of/467583,"
Organizational compliance is not just about checking boxes. It is an essential foundation for maintaining quality, ethics, safety, and customer trust in your business. However, instilling an authentic compliance mindset across your entire team can be challenging. Complacency, lack of investment and siloed thinking are common pitfalls.As a leader, you play a pivotal role in cultivating an ethical, compliant culture at both the surface and deeper levels. Here are five comprehensive strategies for driving compliance excellence across your organization:1. Ongoing, engaging compliance trainingCompliance training should not begin and end with a generic, once-a-year seminar. To genuinely transform mindsets, training must be regular, tailored and interactive. Break large groups into smaller sessions focused on specific policies, risks and regulations relevant to their roles.



Use real-world examples, scenarios and case studies to make the content relatable. Have learners practice applying concepts through discussions, simulations and decision-making exercises. End each session with a knowledge check or quiz to reinforce key learnings. Follow up with refresher microlearning modules throughout the year to maintain sharp compliance thinking.To maximize engagement, leverage training formats like gamification, social learning and friendly competition. Have subject matter experts co-create and facilitate portions of the training based on their specialized experience. Keep sessions conversational and participatory. Welcome constructive debates, different viewpoints and critical thinking. Maintain an open-door policy for employees to ask follow-up questions after training events. Your goal is to shift mindsets through positive, consistent reinforcement over time, not just imparting information.


Related: The 5-Step Guide to Navigating Legal and Regulatory Changes in Business2. Internal monitoring, controls and auditsOngoing training lays the foundation, while rigorous monitoring and controls convert compliance knowledge into daily habits and behaviors. Establish internal controls like multi-level approvals for high-risk transactions, data access restrictions, surveillance systems and automation triggers to catch issues proactively. Conduct frequent audits and spot checks on operational processes, work products, documentation, communication channels and customer-facing interactions. Randomly sample past transactions to uncover potential problems. Look for patterns of small inconsistencies that could indicate larger risks. Turn audit findings into action by reviewing the results with staff and implementing process enhancements.Move beyond pass/fail audit outcomes. Apply continuous improvement and quality assurance principles to compliance. Establish internal key performance indicators, maturity assessments and self-monitoring mechanisms across teams. Empower employees to identify potential compliance vulnerabilities without fear of blame or retaliation. Apply root cause analysis and change management tactics to understand where and how gaps occurred. Continuously refine controls and processes to minimize future risk.3. Visible prioritization and decision-makingWritten policies are meaningless if compliance is not prioritized in actual decisions and actions. Leaders must visibly and consistently demonstrate that ethics and compliance override competing interests like speed, cost savings and convenience. Model compliance diligence in your own work, decision-making and communications. Verbally reinforce compliance as a core value in team meetings, one-on-one coaching and public forums. Ask probing questions about compliance risks and implications as part of your standard decision-making process. Require thorough documentation of compliance-related decisions and diligence for visibility.


Publicly commend employees who flag potential issues or go above and beyond in exhibiting compliant behavior. Use stories and specific examples to illuminate the detrimental impacts of non-compliance on your customers, brand reputation and bottom line. For instance, a $550,000 settlement was paid out after a non-compliant long-term care facility failed to meet safety standards. Share lessons learned from past compliance failures and risks avoided thanks to diligence. Your visible conviction will cement compliance as an indispensable cultural pillar, not just a policy.4. Open dialogue, mentorship and oversightCompliance should be woven into the daily conversations and mentoring within your teams. Maintain an open-door policy for employees to voice concerns, ask questions, and discuss real-world ethical dilemmas without judgment. Set expectations for email etiquette, record-keeping, information security, conduct with partners and data-driven decision-making.Require ethics and compliance sign-offs for new process designs and high-risk initiatives pre-launch. Embed compliance staff into operational teams to provide ongoing guidance and oversight. Assign buddies or mentors to new hires to set proper compliance expectations from day one.Create mechanisms for confidential reporting of potential issues and transparency into case outcomes. Document all compliance instructions and disciplinary actions taken for consistency. Recognize those who self-report mistakes as an act of integrity. Conduct ""autopsy"" reviews of significant compliance failures to extract learnings for the future. By encouraging open dialogue and providing compliance oversight throughout the organization, you reinforce shared accountability.

Meaningful incentives and consequencesTo drive compliant behavior, ethics and compliance must be directly tied to meaningful incentives, rewards and consequences. Recognize individuals and teams that go above and beyond to meet or exceed compliance standards — not just once a year but on an ongoing basis. Highlight role models. Showcase compliance excellence in your organizational communications. On the flip side, consistently enforce proportionate consequences for violations large and small. Doing so shows that compliance is mandatory, not optional.However, discipline should focus on remediation and growth, not just punishment. Use setbacks as teaching moments to improve individual and organizational compliance maturity. Small offenses may merit coaching, training, and probation before harsher action. Major violations often warrant suspension, termination or legal action. But handle each case individually based on intent, risk, response and mitigating circumstances. By tying compliance to incentives and proportional consequences, you reinforce it as a non-negotiable expectation, not just an aspiration.

64,7 Tips for How To Get Along With Your Peers,"Jan 24, 2024",Roxanne Klein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/7-tips-for-how-to-get-along-with-your-peers/468317,"
There are many situations in workplace life where peers work together. It can be challenging in these instances since it is not an employer/employee relationship. In an employer/employee relationship, it is common for an employer to assign tasks to the employee and manage the assignment. However, when working with peers, it is important to figure out how to accomplish tasks without seeming commanding. This article is intended to offer suggestions for these situations.1. Don't be too directIn many instances, it's important to take the philosophy of asking and not telling. Remember to delegate responsibilities instead of assigning tasks. Let others decide on their own what tasks they want to assist with instead of being direct and giving orders. By allowing team members to take ownership of their responsibilities, you empower the team to contribute meaningfully. Please note that I said the team and not your team. It is very important to be cautious when using the term 'my team.' Some individuals may have issues using that phrase when the team includes one of my peers.Related: Here's Why Entrepreneurs Need to Build Good Relationships at Work



2. Let people do things their own wayMany people, myself included, have strong opinions on how certain tasks should be done. With these strong opinions, it is easy to want others on your team to perform tasks like you would. Embrace diversity and realize that you do not have all the answers. You need to show the team that you want to collaborate and that each team member may do things in their own way. By letting people do things their way, you provide a positive work environment and show others that you value their opinions and perspectives.3. Be careful of micromanagingNo one likes to micromanage, but it is easy to find yourself micromanaging without having the intention of micromanaging. Be open-minded and allow others to work at their own pace. It is ok to follow up with your teammates to check on progress, but you need to figure out how to do this appropriately. I like to put reminders on my calendars to check in and then stick to the dates I put on the calendar. Since I tend to be impatient, having the dates on my calendar of when to follow up is helpful.

This will help foster a team effort within the group. It is essential that if you do not agree to voice your opinion, it is also important the way that you express your thoughts. You want to be open-minded and provide a democratic decision-making process to help maintain a positive team focused on success.Related: Two Stanford Professors Explain How to Produce Hundreds of World-Changing Ideas In 1 Hour5. Dial it downIt is important not to overwhelm others. Remember to dial it down if you are being too assertive. You do not want to be intimidating and make others uncomfortable. Everyone has different hats, and everyone has their own set of responsibilities. Next time you think you might be coming on too strong, remember to stay calm and work on dialing your approach down. Solutions on how to dial it down can be as simple as how you phrase your comments. Using phrases such as ""Could we consider"" or ""I was thinking about"" helps in the process of not being controlling.


6. Be on the same pageIf everyone on the team does not have the same general goals and desire to complete a task, the task will suffer. If you feel that your team is not headed in the same direction, have a conversation to discuss. It might be as simple as resolving a misunderstanding to get you back on track. It is essential to establish clear communication channels as early on as possible. Doing so will make it easier for all of the team to be on the same page. When a team works to be on the same page, the team operates collectively, minimizing the chances of divergent efforts.Related: The 7 Benefits of CEO Peer Groups 7. Acknowledge contributions and celebrate winsRemember to be supportive and acknowledge when others' work assists the team's efforts. Make it a point to show gratitude for the contributions of individual team members. Celebrate wins no matter what their size is. These celebrations do not need to be huge; more importantly, they need to occur. Celebrations can be simple, like a delicious treat or a happy hour for the team to bond and enjoy their success.

65,Don't Be a Waiter — Be a Creator. 5 Ways to Create Opportunities for Yourself In 2024,"Jan 24, 2024",Maha Abouelenein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/5-ways-to-set-yourself-up-for-success-in-2024/468342,"
In life, you can either be a waiter or a creator. Waiters wait for others to bring them opportunities, prefer not to make decisions, and stick to what they know. They're afraid to take risks and stay in their comfort zones. On the other hand, creators go out and own their choices. They're brave enough to make tough decisions, even if it makes them nervous.Creators don't need permission to grow; they do it on their own. You can't just wait for good things to come to you; you must make them happen. Nobody will prioritize your success, so independence is key, especially in today's changing business world.Going from a waiter to a creator is doable and essential for success as an entrepreneur. From someone who's done it, here are five ways to create opportunities for yourself.



Related: Don't Wait for Your Luck to Change: Make It Work for You Today1. Be curiousBeing curious is a crucial trait that propels individuals into action. Curious people don't wait; instead, they actively learn new skills and explore interests they never knew they had.


Curious about playing the piano? Watch a YouTube tutorial, ask your network if they know how to play and can give you recommendations, or invest in lessons. This proactive approach puts you in a position to embrace new experiences and create opportunities. The more you learn about the world, the better equipped you become to generate innovative ideas.2. Know what you're good at and 10X your strengthsBoost your personal and professional growth by finding your ""secret sauce"" and focusing on what you're good at — your strengths.Consider the strategy of ""10Xing"" your strengths. Instead of dwelling on weaknesses, celebrate the positives. List everything you excel at and pay attention to what others appreciate about you. This positive shift helps you discover growth opportunities.For example, if people like your advice, consider coaching, or if you're good at learning new things, spend time exploring a topic you're curious about. By emphasizing and expanding your strengths, you can develop a more positive mindset and uncover unique qualities that benefit your personal and professional life.

Explore your optionsEmbracing exploration and stepping outside your comfort zone is essential for creating opportunities – and it's more rewarding when you create them yourself.Don't worry about the end result when you're trying something new. Whether crafting a proposal for a potential client without a specific request or taking on a project without guarantees while attracting new clients, focus on bringing value and leaving a lasting impression. Many entrepreneurs face this challenge, but it's worth the risk, time and investment because it presents an opportunity to acquire new knowledge and develop new skills, which is a win.4. Get an accountability partnerHaving an accountability partner is highly beneficial to creating your own opportunities. Sharing your goals with someone else helps you stay committed and provides a valuable support system to keep you on track and focused. Discussing your plans with another person creates a sense of responsibility, increasing the likelihood of following through on your intentions.


Are you aiming to run a 5k or making a career move? An accountability partner is a valuable resource, offering motivation and assistance in achieving and maintaining your objectives.Pro Tip: Create a personal board of directors who genuinely care about your progress. This enhances accountability, ensuring regular check-ins, honest discussions, and valuable feedback to keep you focused on your goals.Related: An Accountability Partner Makes You Vastly More Likely to Succeed5. Don't be afraid to dreamImagine big things for yourself, especially if you're an entrepreneur or aspire to be one. Dreams don't just happen independently; instead, try to dream big by thinking about your ideas, writing them down, and coming up with more thoughts about them. Let your imagination go wild as you explore what you could achieve.


Being a dreamer is essential because it helps you be creative and turn your ideas into tangible goals. This mindset is extra important for entrepreneurs because it sparks new ideas and keeps you excited as you face the ups and downs of running a business.Identify what you truly want to do, find the how, and start with small steps. By doing so, you can open up opportunities you never thought possible.Be a creator, not a waiter, in 2024.

66,Life's Too Short to Work With Incompatible People — Follow These 3 Secrets To Building High-Performing Teams,"Jan 12, 2024",Chris Savage,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-secrets-to-building-high-performing-teams/467297,"
Life is too short to work with people we don't vibe with.My co-founder Brendan and I have worked hard to build a team of creative thinkers that makes it easy to come to work and still have fun when we need to solve hard problems. Our investment in creating that community has paid off well — we're still in the game after 17 years.When a team gets along well, it has countless benefits. Innovative ideas flow more freely, people feel free to fail and improve quickly, and customers are happier. Positivity is contagious. When the morale is good, the product is better, and when the product is better, morale is better, too.



Establishing a world-class team that generates good things doesn't happen overnight. You can't hire this kind of team; you build it. Here are three principles we've used over nearly two decades to build teams that do amazing things.Related: 7 Ways to Build a High-Performing Team


1. Celebrate failure and learn to give feedbackWhen you embrace failure, you learn and course-correct more quickly. Failure is a sign you're doing something right. You're testing, learning, flexing your creative muscles and moving on efficiently after hitting a brick wall.You must build a team open to feedback to make the most of your failures for the company's good. Feedback is the mode by which we make positive changes out of failure.The challenge? Feedback makes most people cringe. We associate it with criticism as opposed to growth. To create a culture that sees feedback as an opportunity for growth, leaders need to model the way they want team members to:A. Receive feedbackB. Give feedbackWhen it comes to receiving, leaders should welcome employees to comment on how they should improve processes, culture and performance to improve the business. We love employee surveys at Wistia. They're effective and easy to conduct. We've found benefits in sending out simple Google forms to get a real-time pulse check from team members.When it comes to giving, the most impactful way we can create a culture that embraces feedback is by paying close attention to how we give it. People respond best to immediate, specific feedback and from people they believe care about them.A team that uses feedback as a valuable tool sets better expectations, aligns goals, squashes inefficiencies and strengthens collaboration across the organization.

Be an open bookClear communication may seem like an obvious necessity on high-performing teams, but it's something that's often taken for granted. Unclear communication can quickly tank a team's efforts. A team that has mastered precise communication, on the other hand, can achieve incredible outcomes quickly.We follow an ""open book"" mentality at Wistia. On all-hands calls, we share candid information about the state of the company – inclusive of the good and the bad – so everyone has the big picture. When everyone shares the same vision, they understand the desired destination and the obstacles we face, and they're empowered to solve customer problems creatively.Normalizing difficult conversations sets the tone for transparent communication on a team. Honesty begets transparency. When you avoid ""negative"" updates or conversations, you hinder progress when you could be solving hard problems faster.

Seek the curiousWhen hiring those who will join a high-performing team, a solid resume is a nice-to-have, but curiosity is a must.When you're curious, you're the kind of person who will ask ""why"" until you find a solution and a way forward. The curious-minded navigate change faster. They find solutions to problems more quickly. They always look for opportunities in a crisis with an eye on the competition and a mission to add the most value to customers.This intrinsic drive to challenge the status quo is one of the most valuable traits you can have to stay ahead of the game in today's fast-moving market.


Keep an eye out for talent who asks questions to better understand why something is working or not working. We often include a project as part of our interview process to understand how someone approaches a problem. We look for:What questions do they ask?How do they identify information gaps?How flexible are they in working toward a solution?This project-based interview gives insight into a candidate's curiosity and approach to work.The building blocks of building a world-class team begin at the hiring process but are created and cultivated over time. Committing to building a high-performing team requires patience, discipline, self-reflection and willingness to communicate hard things. Putting in that kind of work and time is a tall order for any leader, but it's the most invaluable investment you can make for your business if you're in it for the long haul.

67,Let Your Employees Be CEOs for a Day to Harness Their Hidden Power,"Jan 8, 2024",Daniel Todd,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/let-your-employees-be-ceos-for-a-day-to-harness-their/466395,"
We will soon be launching what is likely to become a multimillion-dollar-a-month new app. The impetus for the idea came from our user acquisition (UA) and sales team leaders after they had identified the potential for a new opportunity in the market that I, as CEO, could not see. They had an idea to expand our existing app to focus on a growing opportunity but after talking about it, we agreed it could grow faster and larger as a standalone app.This decision exemplifies the power of integrating diverse perspectives within the company to forge a superior strategic direction. It also shows how actively listening to and valuing employee ideas can be a driving force for innovation and growth.Making the most of this opportunity is a two-part process for leaders. Firstly, they have to prove they truly care about people's opinions. Secondly, they need to give employees enough information about how the business actually works from a strategic perspective so they are only bringing forward the best and most actionable ideas. If we do not get the second part right, people will be unhappy because they will feel their suggestions for improvement and growth are constantly being rejected.



Fortunately, we have tools to help them get into that strategic mindset and uncover their unique insights.Related: How Agility and Resiliency Help Small and Medium-Sized Businesses Succeed


Putting on the CEO hatGenerating bigger strategic ideas requires a deep understanding of the company's goals. Currently, everyone in our company is familiar with our monthly EBITDA target. While each company has its unique objectives, we have discovered that offering employees a perspective from the CEO's seat encourages them to consider the larger strategic elements at play.At our upcoming in-person conference in Las Vegas this January, we will engage various groups in a thought experiment: What would they prioritize if they were the CEO? We are already preparing folks across finance, product management and HR among others, prompting them to develop their best ideas for their respective groups. We are asking them what resources they lack and what they need to expand their teams. Our goal is to elicit unconstrained ideas, leading to discussions about how they contribute to the company's long-term growth goals. Once we have quantified their potential impact and cost, we can then estimate the long-term impact of these ideas.While we cannot implement every suggestion, determining the most feasible and impactful ideas is crucial. Keeping the door open for team leaders to present their ideas, coupled with a formal process for ideas submission like this one, is invaluable for leaders. However, educating employees on their role within the broader business context can help ensure these structures are truly effective.Establishing a foundation for innovationWe recently hired a new head of onboarding and employee education to guide people to understand our whole business model. It is too complicated to communicate in just a two-day training session, so instead we are creating videos and training content and posting them on our wiki. We also present them at our monthly online meetings to help our teams see why ""metrics matter."" These short videos lay out our entire business model one metric at a time and are entertaining enough and short enough that people will go back and watch them later when needed.


The other focus of the training is to give people a big, long roadmap of where we are heading. When ideas do come up, we can show people where they might fit in with the other initiatives we are working on. That way, our employees know they are not being ignored; it just might not be the best time to start on their idea. Being transparent about how we prioritize ideas shows we are serious about empowering our employees while tempering expectations.Related: You Have to Give Your Employees Freedom to See Excellence — Here's How to Do It.How leaders can prioritize ideasUnusable ideas are not usually bad, just impractical from a business standpoint. For instance, the HR department might ask for developers to build an automated solution for burdensome manual processes. As leaders, we might have to tell them they are paid to perform those actions because they are cheaper than having developers build a solution. Especially when building a company, an expensive solution that improves efficiency by 4% is not as valuable in the short run as a new growth project that could double the business at half the cost.At the same time, leaders cannot ignore teams. Our customer support team had been asking for efficiency tools for six years. As frustrations grew, I decided to direct investment into developing administrative tools. Purely from a growth perspective, this may not have been the best move, but I knew it was important for the team and became more than just a matter of cents.


We also strive to give people access to the right information so they can model their ideas and build projections on how they will impact the company before they even bring them to our attention. Conversations with innovative employees become so much easier when they see why we are going to prioritize a $20 million idea over their $50,000 idea. By establishing this transparency and a culture free from judgment, leaders help ensure people will keep generating and testing their ideas.Mutual trust — the key to good ideasWhen it comes to employee-driven innovation, the perfect balance is executive teams trusting their employees to come up with great ideas — and employees trusting leaders will take the time and effort to truly consider them. It is hard: People pitch an idea and might not hear back for months, which can disenfranchise them from doing it again. But if we educate people on how the company works and its larger objectives, they will have faith that the executive team is earnestly trying to move the organization forward. Then, as people see their best ideas get implemented, it creates a virtuous cycle: They will be motivated to continue to think more strategically and leaders will be able to harness their insights for the benefit of the whole company.

68,How Much Is Too Much Automation in the Workplace? How AI Could Be Hurting Your Employees,"Jan 8, 2024",Pierre Raymond,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-much-is-too-much-automation-in-the-workplace-how-ai/466332,"
Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking over the workplace, and employees are still not sure how their companies are using automation tools to boost their productivity or augment specific tasks of their jobs.The reality, however, is that many companies have given their all or nothing for artificial intelligence without considering the near and long-term impact these tools will have on employees' mental well-being. Now the results are in, and it's not looking very good.Several studies have found that employees are feeling more stressed or anxious since their companies have introduced several new AI-focused projects to assist with overall workplace productivity.



All of this for an extra boost in the quarterly bottom line.Related: How to Leverage AI to Supercharge Your Business


How artificial intelligence is impacting employees' well-beingWhat many thought would become the breakthrough moment of the century is now looking more and more taboo for some workers trying to avoid the topic of artificial intelligence in the workplace.One recent study published by the American Psychological Association (APA found that roughly 4 in 10 (38%) American workers are worried that artificial intelligence will partially or completely take over their job duties, leaving them obsolete.All of this tracking hasn't fared well with employees either. In the same APA report, around a third (32%) of employees that know their boss is tracking their activity reported their mental health being ""fair"" or ""poor.""In a different APA study, more than half of employees said they are aware that their boss or manager is using some form of AI to monitor their activity while on the clock.


This isn't to mention the countless number of employees feeling overwhelmed with all the new learning and training they have to undergo to effectively apply artificial intelligence in the workplace or their day-to-day activities. Fears of being replaced by machines, computers monitoring their activity and the absence of AI workplace policies are only adding more confusion to the office talk.Yet, despite all of this chatter going around, a survey by The Conference Board found that 1 in 10 employers are now using generative AI tools daily. However, only 23% said that their company had an AI policy in development and 26% said their organization already had something in place.A fear of becoming obsoleteAll over the world, employees are becoming more fearful of artificial intelligence taking their place in the office. In fact, a study by the Pew Research Center found that roughly 19% of U.S. workers were in jobs most exposed to the possibility of being automated by AI.While it's still unclear how many jobs might be slashed in the coming years, because it's cheaper and more effective to employ machines, some suggest that artificial intelligence has already contributed to roughly 4,000 layoffs in May this year.


While employees fear that they might be replaced in the coming years, or even more worrisome, in a couple of months at the rate at which artificial technology is developing, many are also concerned over whether they will find a good paying job elsewhere.Concerns regarding job fulfillment and work-life balance are all now being questioned as the workplace becomes increasingly automated and the labor market more competitive.Related: Don't Waste Money on AI. Unlock Its True Potential By Treating It Like a New Hire.Lack of privacy and securityIt's no secret that companies are leveraging artificial intelligence to track and monitor employee performance and their day-to-day activity while on the clock.


While some companies have used this technology to allow their teams to have more efficient and transparent workplace practices, allowing them increased exposure to project progress, and the ability to resolve inefficiencies more effectively — some employers have gone the other route, instead.Those employees who know their bosses and managers are tracking their activity have felt that they are often being inappropriately watched; in fact, 81% of employees felt this way.Employees are feeling that they are not being trusted by their employers or team members, leading to decreased morale and engagement. Additionally, this only adds to workers' personal distress and leaves a sour taste in their mouths realizing that their activity is closely being captured by their employers.On top of this lack of privacy, many employees often feel that a potential data breach could only further expose more of their personal information to bad actors. Weak cybersecurity infrastructure and a lack of proper security training are often known to be some of the biggest reasons for data breaches in the workplace.


A continuity of underlying workplace discriminationOther issues with automation and artificial intelligence tools in the office are the potential risks these tools pose for workplace diversity and inclusion practices. Hiring algorithms used to train AI models are often responsible for the design choices made during a company's hiring process and for selecting appropriate candidates for open positions.However, many people feel that these algorithms used in the hiring and candidate selection process can influence a company's wider diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) standards.Already, there have been multiple examples of artificial intelligence being host to cultural and gender bias, only selecting employees based on their race, gender, and age and not necessarily taking into consideration their qualifications or experience.Effectively training AI-hiring algorithms to de-bias itself and remove discriminatory actions takes time, often reversing the work employers have already done in recent years to create more equitable workplace policies.


What's more, these systems are only learning from the data companies can feed them. Let's say a company is predominantly male, the system will read that as ""Hey, we don't really hire women around here.""Not even companies such as Amazon couldn't de-bias its hiring algorithms back in 2018, despite having access to the necessary resources and skills.Related: AI Is Coming For Your Jobs — Anyone Who Says Otherwise Is In Denial. Here's How You Can Embrace AI to Avoid Being Left Behind.Where do employers draw the line?Well, that's exactly the question many are wondering about. Companies will continue to invest in artificial intelligence, and employees will have to deal with what comes afterward. Finding a balance would require employers to take more actionable steps to effectively integrate AI within the workplace, allowing employees to grow alongside it, instead of being fearful thereof.

69,The Unorthodox Communication Model That Can Better Align Your Company's Values,"Jan 5, 2024",Michael Quoc,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/thinking-in-circles-isnt-a-good-thing-except-in-this/466312,"
Growing a business in a way that nurtures alignment instead of stunting it persists as a famously difficult task. And it's only becoming more important. According to research by LSA Global, organizations that are ""highly aligned"" grow revenue 58% faster and are 72% more profitable than poorly aligned organizations.How can leaders rethink their businesses' organizational structures to make alignment possible? How does alignment translate from an aspirational buzzword to a resonant reality?Enter the concentric circle model of communication, an organizational structure that understands the importance of alignment in business and the need for collaboration, community and shared outcomes. The methodology needs not replace existing organizational structures but augment them.



Related: A Step-by-Step Guide to Achieving Organizational AlignmentThe concentric circle model and the future of organizational thinkingThe concentric circle model is an organizational way of thinking. It places the residents of your world in a ripple effect instead of in a tree or ladder-like structure. From partners (the strong core of the business and its mission) to employees, beta testers, community members and back again, the concentric model helps information flow freely across groups.


Imagine a startup aimed at developing sustainable technologies. In the concentric circle model, you'd see the following:Core: The founders and primary stakeholders setting the vision.Next circle: Employees bringing the vision to life.Following circle: Principal informants providing crucial feedback.Outer circle: The wider community interested in its mission.In a traditional hierarchical model, communication between different groups might be linear and restrictive, whereas the concentric circle model promotes a continuous exchange of ideas and feedback. This means that engineers can receive input from the community, which helps them understand their technologies' real-world impact and potential improvements. Additionally, the core team's vision and updates can not only reach employees but also target audiences and the broader community. This ensures everyone is aligned and fosters a shared sense of purpose.As the company evolves, each ripple in the concentric model contributes to a continual feedback loop that drives innovation, alignment and a strong communal bond toward achieving the mission of sustainable technology.The benefit of this mindset is that it is mutually collaborative. Values can be shared from group to group — no matter where that group sits in the circle. Because of that sharing, the business can become quickly aligned on economic outcomes and a sense of common purpose. In turn, group members can take bold action, knowing they're in unity with the whole circle.


At my company, this means pursuing a true everybody-wins culture from a financial perspective. When the product succeeds, shoppers save money, businesses make more sales and our company earns more money, which allows us to reward users. When the company revenue grows, our stakeholders also share in that growth.Related: Why Aligning Your Company Values is Crucial for Long-Term Success3 ways to make the concentric circle model work for your businessThe concentric circle model of communication might sound like a fabulous idea, but how can you put it into practice? Does it require a complete renovation of your business's organizational structure? Not necessarily. It's a way of thought, and practicing it well means keeping some key methods in mind:1. Identify your stakeholdersTo make the concentric circle model of communication successful, you need a holistic, working knowledge of your organization. What parties do you need to include in your vision? What are their roles? What are your organization's layers? One business might include beta testers and influencers; another might include a wide network of suppliers and volunteers.


Identify key stakeholders and assess the impact of their actions on your business or product to determine their positioning within the circle. For instance, those with higher impact are placed closer to the center. Those who are folded closer into the circle often have higher participation in decision-making. To bring outer echelons inward, involve more stakeholders. For example, Demand.io's SimplyCodes product not only asks for constant user feedback, but also identifies product champions to employ in an internal council of high-expectation users who earn a stipend for their valued input.2. Find agreement on shared goalsThe purpose of the concentric circle model is to create a collaborative way of working and making decisions based on a shared vision. Achieve this by establishing your business's core goals. Across the layers of the circle, you must design and tweak your aims to align with the community. Begin with the nucleus of partners and decision makers to form a set of core initial ambitions and then find unity in the wider circle by collaborating.Goals could be economic, or they could be product- or service-related. Maybe your goals are to grow your business into new territories; maybe it's to condense your impact and make your business more community-centric. No matter your ambitions, shared goals can lead to shared outcomes. The above research from LSA Global found that highly aligned companies outperform their peers in retaining and satisfying customers, engaging employees and leading effectively.Related: Your Public Messaging Strategy Starts With Your Inner Circle


3. Align your valuesIf you've followed the above steps, you've established a strong working knowledge of your organization, its various layers and how they function in your circle. You've also set goals you'll aim toward collectively. The final piece of the puzzle is values. Currently, your organizational values might be fragmented. Different groups may want different things and be guided by conflicting values, but the concentric circle model encourages you to zero in on the values shared across your community. Aligning these values will have a unifying effect on everything you do.In applying the concentric circle model, every major business decision should be held up to the model, and leaders should consider whether benefits ripple across the whole circle. To aid alignment, you need not necessarily agonize over perfect plans but discipline your vision and mission to be authentic and considerate of every layer of your circle. Driving business strategy toward shared outcomes encourages the team to ideate innovative and sustainable business flywheels instead of juggling adversarial relationships.The CEO of Chicken Salad Chick implemented a concentric circle model in the business. With a strong focus on community growth and awareness to pave the way for future expansions, the brand went from 32 restaurants in 2015 (when the CEO joined the company) to more than 220 today.The concentric circle model is an important tool for thinking differently about business value alignment. It may not replace hierarchical structures, but it does respond to the future of business leadership as the landscape evolves. By beginning with a strong core and radiating values outward through the various layers of the organization, the concentric circle model can forge deep, lasting, productive connections among stakeholders and communities.

70,How to Transform Your Workplace Culture with Cross-Pollination,"Jan 3, 2024",Scott Deming,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-i-use-cross-pollination-at-work-to-transform-my-business/467062,"
In today's business landscape, the concept of 'cross-training' is more than a fancy buzzword; it's a critical strategy for improving understanding, teamwork and efficiency. It's a practical approach to setting realistic expectations among team members. It's also key to delivering consistent customer experiences and clear communication. Back when I was running my advertising agency, I put this concept into action, and I like to call it 'cross-pollination.'Imagine a media planner stepping into the shoes of a client services representative or an account coordinator spending the day in the life of a graphic designer. That's exactly what went on at my agency. This strategy wasn't just about dismantling silos. It was about creating an environment where different departments could collaborate effectively and share their knowledge and skills. When you have designers understand the media team's challenges and vice versa, you're not just improving individual skill sets but building a shared understanding across the whole company.Why is this important? In any organization, each department is a piece of a larger puzzle. When everyone understands what the other pieces are doing, things run a lot smoother. It's about getting everyone on the same page, which leads to better teamwork, more realistic expectations, and a more harmonious work environment.



Cross-pollination is simple but powerful. It's about building a culture of empathy and innovation, where everyone feels they're part of something bigger. It transforms a fragmented workplace into a well-oiled machine, where every part works in harmony with the others.Related: Set Yourself Up for Success By Setting Expectations


Implementing cross-pollination in a business demands a well-thought-out approach. It all starts with recognizing the unique strengths and the learning opportunities that exist within each department. At my agency, we had a distinct scenario: we had media planners who were great with analytics and numbers, while our designers' strengths lay in crafting visually stunning and effective graphics. Each team was a master in its own right, yet there was a noticeable disconnect, particularly with our client services team.Unlike the media planners and designers, the client services personnel directly contacted clients. This crucial difference in roles highlighted a gap in understanding. Our client-facing staff, while adept at handling client relations, sometimes lacked a deep grasp of the time and effort that went into media strategy and design. This occasionally led to misaligned and unrealistic client expectations about timelines and deliverables stemming from this lack of understanding.To address this, we encouraged a program where account representatives were integrated into the media planning and design processes. They didn't just observe; they were involved in the planning sessions, understanding the rationale behind each decision and witnessing the painstaking, time-consuming process first-hand. This experience was crucial. It gave them a real grasp of the time and effort required to create a media plan or creative proposal, helping them set more realistic client expectations.Related: How to Build Resilience into Your Business During a Recession


This cross-pollination didn't just benefit the account reps. Media planners and designers started to understand the challenges of client management and the importance of clear, realistic communication. This mutual understanding between departments led to a more cohesive workflow, better client relationships, and an overall more harmonious and efficient work environment.As a result, these account reps started setting more realistic timelines with clients. They could articulate why certain processes took as long as they did and managed client expectations much more effectively. This didn't just improve client relationships; it also fostered a greater sense of empathy and respect across our teams. Our designers and media planners, in turn, gained a clearer picture of the challenges faced by the account team in client management and expectations setting.By enabling these teams to spend time in each other's roles, they didn't just broaden their own skill sets — they developed a comprehensive understanding and appreciation for each other's roles and contributions. This holistic perspective was vital in ensuring that everyone was working towards the same goal – delivering exceptional service to our clients while maintaining the integrity and quality of our work.Having highlighted the impact of cross-pollination at my advertising agency, this approach can greatly improve how teams interact and function. But how can you translate this concept into actionable strategies in your own business? It's one thing to understand the value of cross-pollination, but another to effectively implement it. The trick is to pick up specific strategies and best practices that encourage this kind of teamwork. Below, I'll outline some practical steps and strategies that can help you apply the principles of cross-pollination in your organization, ensuring that your teams are working alongside each other and working together towards a unified goal.

It brings teams closer, fosters mutual respect and aligns objectives across the board. More importantly, it strengthens the bond between your business and its clients through realistic commitments and reliable service. By embedding these principles into the core of your operations, you're not just optimizing your processes; you're setting the stage for a more connected, responsive, and thriving business environment. Cross-pollination, in essence, is about harnessing the collective strength of your team for sustainable success and client satisfaction.

Alright, let's cut to the chase. You're not here for fluff or another cookie-cutter blog post that drones on about ""best practices"" you could find in a Business 101 textbook. Nah, you're here because you've got real problems to solve. And folks, solving problems is my bread and butter.Being at the helm of a business isn't just about crunching numbers and landing fat contracts. It's also about being the peacekeeper in the eye of the storm — the one who keeps everyone from throwing chairs when the deadlines loom and the revenue projections look like a toddler's crayon scribbles. If you think that's the easy part, you're in for a helluva ride. Strap in, because I'm about to drop some hard-earned wisdom.Related: 3 Ways Leaders Can Develop Their Diplomacy Skills to Motivate Their Workforce and Drive Productivity



The politics of business: Understanding stakeholder fiefdomsFirst, anyone who tells you that business is a meritocracy is either naïve or selling you something. Your organization isn't a utopia; it's a miniature political landscape with its lords and serfs. The faster you grasp this, the faster you can play the game — and let me tell you, diplomacy is the name of the game.Got a high-value client acting like a diva? Or maybe it's your lead developer who's got a chip on his shoulder? Before banging your head against the wall, remember this: Power dynamics are everything. Know who holds the cards and who's just bluffing, and then tailor your diplomatic maneuvers accordingly.


Are you an emotional robot? Time to wise upLet's talk EQ — emotional intelligence, for the uninitiated. Do you think you can just bulldoze your way through sensitive negotiations with clients or team members? Think again. The era of the ""I don't do feelings"" business leader is over. Now, it's about reading the room, understanding underlying motivations and — here's the kicker — giving a damn.Listen to the unsaid words, catch the subtleties, and learn to understand what's happening in the heads of the people you're dealing with. Whether it's catching that flicker of hesitation from a client or noticing that your team members seem a bit too quiet, these moments need your attention.The sweet spot between transparency and tact — let's keep it real, shall we?Alright, let's talk about one of the biggest tightropes you'll walk in business: the balance between telling it like it is and knowing when to zip it. Honesty may be a virtue, but oversharing can be a vice. Sure, you could tell your client about the heated debate over a glitch in the software. But do they need to know that Karen from Accounting threw a stapler? Nope, they don't.What they need to hear is that you've caught the snag and are on it like white rice. It's the difference between alarm and assurance.


The same goes for what you share with your team. Being transparent isn't about airing every little grievance like you're in a reality TV confessional. It's about sharing enough to keep everyone in the loop but not so much that you create a soap opera. The key here is not just to highlight the hurdles but also to offer a roadmap for how you're planning to clear them. That's how you command respect without whipping up drama.Related: Lessons From a Diplomat on How to Build Business RelationshipsCutting through the BS like a bossMan, how many times have you sat in a meeting where someone spouts off corporate jargon like they're trying to win at Business Bingo? Let's get one thing straight: Speaking in buzzwords doesn't make you sound smart; it makes you sound like you're hiding something — or worse, like you don't know what you're talking about.If you want people (clients or team members) to get what you're laying down, you need to talk like a human being. Use language that's straightforward but also evocative. Make your point, but do it in a way that leaves an impression. Consistency is key, of course, but it doesn't mean you need to be a broken record. It means the essence of your message stays the same, even if you change up the words.


The diplomat's secret weapon: Listening like your business depends on itDo you know what most people get wrong about diplomacy? They think it's all about talking — a well-placed word here, a strategic silence there. But let me hit you with some truth: The real secret weapon of any diplomatic genius is knowing how to listen. And I'm not talking about that passive, waiting-for-your-turn-to-talk kind of listening. I mean hearing what the other person is saying and absorbing it.When you listen this way, you pick up on the nuance behind the words. You get a sense of what the client or your team is worried about, what they're excited about and what they're not saying. And armed with this intel, you can tailor your communication to address those unspoken needs and concerns. It's not mind-reading; it's mindfulness.Related: 6 Ways to Become a Better ListenerHow to say ""no"" without becoming public enemy #1The trickiest part of diplomacy? Saying no without burning the house down. Whether it's a client asking for the moon or your team pushing for an unrealistic deadline, sometimes you've got to be the bad guy. The key is framing the ""no"" as a ""not now, but here's what we can do."" It's the difference between a door slammed shut and one left invitingly ajar.


Here's your wake-up call: Diplomacy isn't a band-aid you slap on a problem. It's a long-term strategy, an investment in future tranquility and success. Be the leader who fosters an environment where open dialogue is the norm, not the exception. People will take their cues from you, so make sure you're setting the tone you want to see.Look, at the end of the day, this is the skill set that separates the players from the pretenders. You can have the best product, the slickest marketing campaign and the most passionate team.

Although these arrive sometimes, the real challenge resides in resisting opportunities that don't align with your passions, core values and strengths.This happened to me ahead of launching my first business in 2017. First was the passion and core value elements.All of my years spent studying literature and music helped shape my focus of only doing things passionate to me. This passion, along with a few of the business practices that didn't meet my ethical standards, prompted me to turn down a highly lucrative C-level position. It was the best — although most challenging — decision in my entrepreneurial journey.


Before jumping on an enticing opportunity, pause and reflect. Do you possess the necessary knowledge and skills? And, more importantly, does it resonate with your passions and ethical outlook? Pursuing a venture that's misaligned with your passions, core values and strengths typically fails.Instead, focus on nurturing your unique talents. Embrace opportunities that allow you to leverage your interests and the skills you've honed over time. This approach increases your chances of success and leads to a more fulfilling career.Building a business that mirrors your true self — your interests, skills and values — not only has a greater chance of success but also brings job satisfaction, leading to higher productivity, quality output and profitability. Someday, your interests may pivot, but as long as you built a solid business around them, you can also pivot from your role and pursue other opps. This could mean selling a business, passing leadership to someone else or simply taking on a new role within the company.That said, all of that relies on having solid business partners, leading me to the next point.Related: How to Use Strategic Partnerships for More Explosive Growth2. Relentlessly seek ideal business partnersOutsourcing is a strategic move for small businesses. Instead of trying to juggle every task, finding partners who excel in areas outside your expertise or interest is more effective.Identify tasks that are outside your wheelhouse, whether it's complex IT challenges or social media marketing. Find individuals who specialize in these areas and who are passionate about them. Their expertise and enthusiasm ensure superior quality and commitment.In my journey, I've learned that finding the right partners goes far beyond mere skillset matching. It's about forging relationships with individuals or entities that resonate deeply with your business's vision and core values. This alignment is the crux of building a partnership that's not just functional but genuinely synergistic.


It's like a well-orchestrated band where every member's unique style and expertise contribute to a powerful performance. When partners share your vision, they bring more than their skills — they bring a shared commitment to your business goals, a mutual understanding of what you stand for and an unwavering dedication to driving the collective mission forward.This synergy differentiates between a business that simply operates and one that thrives. It's about creating a network where each component amplifies the other, leading to exponential growth, innovation and success. It's a lesson I hold dear and a strategy I advocate for any entrepreneur looking to not just build a business but to create a legacy.Also, this approach goes beyond mere delegation — it's about optimizing. When experts manage tasks, they're executed with greater efficiency, improving productivity, reducing costs and enhancing quality.Related: How to Develop B2B Partnerships That Grow Your Business


With the right partners, you can concentrate on what you do best: boosting your productivity and work satisfaction. Seeking the right partnership can significantly enhance your business success. Combining your unique strengths with those of your partners creates a robust, dynamic business that's well-equipped to succeed in a competitive market.For budding entrepreneurs, it's vital to resist the temptation of taking every opportunity and instead focus on areas where you excel. Outsource other aspects to individuals who are passionate and skilled in those domains.This strategy leads to a streamlined, efficient business that thrives on your core competencies. Embrace the power of selective collaboration and watch your entrepreneurial venture flourish, anchored in your passions and expertise.

74,3 Strategies to Optimize Your Hiring Process and Find the Best Employees,"Dec 25, 2023",Nancy Solari,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-strategies-to-optimize-your-hiring-process-and-find-the/465521,"
The most important decision for business leaders is deciding on who will come aboard to help build the corporate house.After owning several businesses and running a multimedia company, I've learned valuable lessons about bringing new people in. Here are three strategies I now use to make sure I am choosing the right candidate for the job. These tips should help you simplify the hiring process in 2024 and beyond.1. Avoid hiring under pressureExecutives are particularly vulnerable when the work is piling up and weeks go by without a new hire.



Vetting people starts with observing the person in a variety of circumstances, including the time leading up to the interview. Little things are tells. How does the candidate respond to others? You can have an assistant talk casually with the candidate and give feedback later. You can hold a secondary interview. I often bring in the top choices and have the person in that role interview them. The way a candidate treats everyone, from the receptionist to the CEO, is valuable information.Have all of your candidates send an email with specific verbal instructions they must follow. You're testing their ability to listen. Despite the simplicity of these requests, I have had people fail to use the correct subject line, fail to send the appropriate attached file and fail to follow the organization I requested.


For in-person interviews, I ask candidates to bring a physical copy of their resume. You may get excuses like, ""My printer was broken."" This tells you what you need to know.The best strategy is proactive. Prepare for the turnover that all businesses face before you hire another person. I learned quickly to create training materials and to spend time cross-training my employees. Not only will this method help new hires get up to speed faster, but when positions go unfilled, other employees can follow the guides and fill in.It's best to have multiple guides in a variety of formats — video, audio and document style. This allows anyone in your organization to move into position and fill gaps as needed.Related: The Pros and Cons of Hiring Family Members in a Small Business


2. Rise to the challenge of hiring remotelyAccording to research from CurrentWare, ""Disengaged employees cost the U.S. up to $550 billion in lost productivity per year."" Many companies like Upwork and CurrentWare can provide a variety of services, including productivity metrics, inactivity alerts and attendance verification. There are also phone apps that record and track sales calls.You can interview remote candidates in the environment where they will work. During the virtual interview, check their office space and look for tip-offs that display unprofessionalism. I'm legally blind, so my assistant sets up our Zoom call and watches as I have the candidate walk around the space, talking to me about their home office. I no longer ask for photos because it's tempting to use virtual environments rather than revealing our workspaces to each other.The work-from-home model means you have less control over little things that mean a lot. You can implement a dress code for team members who will appear on camera with staff members or clients. Whether the applicant has a dog matters, as does the noise level in a neighborhood. Generally, getting the candidate talking about their work, their home life and engaging them in real conversation can reveal much about a potential hire's viability.


Related: 10 Strategies for Hiring and Retaining New Employees3. Eliminate the unknowns in potential partnershipsMany partnerships come through networking. I was once interviewed on a podcast and really hit it off with the host — he soon became involved in my new business venture, even though I didn't really know this person. I didn't take the classic advice, ""Look before you leap.""After several months, there were some serious red flags. At that point, I looked into his background, but not before I had wasted time and money entrusting him with important tasks he simply didn't do. Oftentimes, friendships evolve into business partnerships that end in the loss of both.There are red flags, and I've learned not to ignore them. If you don't have a giant company with a huge HR staff, you may be tempted to trust your judgment and go with your gut. However, even if you know someone, you should look them up.


People have aliases, and they make up resumes. In fact, bios and CVs provide all the information you need to vet the claims. Look for awards that don't exist and titles such as Ph.D. or M.D. that they don't possess. Look for multiple social media alternate identities. Search the name of a potential business partner with the word ""scam"" and ""fraud."" You can look individuals up through professional organizations or verify business licenses for the startups and/or organizations listed on the resume. You can also speak to former colleagues to vet your potential partner's version of things, from the breakup to how they ran their business.Related: What Is 'Quiet Hiring'? And How You Can Use It To Your AdvantageThe workforce is truly the face of the company. Knowing this, it doesn't make sense to skip important steps in the hiring process, including fully vetting and researching candidates, reaching out for information and obtaining feedback and referrals.In the virtual world, it is easy for people to mislead us, exaggerate their experience or even cause harm to the company. When we take the time to fully engage in the hiring process, the payoff is finding the right team that is poised to help guide the company to greater heights.

75,How to Communicate Effectively and Build Positive Perception During a Merger or Acquisition (and Why It's Important),"Dec 21, 2023",Danielle Sabrina,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-communicate-effectively-during-a-merger-or/466459,"
During a merger or acquisition, a positive perception of the involved organizations is critical, but it can also be incredibly challenging. Employees, customers and other key stakeholders will likely have many questions about what the future will hold. Rumors and speculation can breed, eroding trust and fueling suspicion if communication isn't frequent and transparent.Every aspect of communication matters when uncertainty runs high, and consistency is critical. Everyone in the merging organizations should be marching to the same drumbeat. Craft messages that directly address the unique concerns of each stakeholder while keeping the overarching message consistent across all platforms and channels.Consistent and targeted communication is especially important when one of the companies might already have a tarnished image. For instance, when Microsoft recently acquired game developer and publisher Activision Blizzard, Blizzard was struggling with the public perception of its CEO, Bobby Kotick. Microsoft and Blizzard actively highlighted the acquisition's positive aspects while reassuring consumers and investors about Kotick's continued leadership at Blizzard. They also clearly outlined the measures they are implementing to address and resolve past issues.



Related: 4 Steps for Communicating a Merger to EmployeesSolid internal and external communicationDuring mergers and acquisitions, companies must communicate effectively and equally both internally and externally to maintain trust and stability. Neglecting either group can lead to significant challenges, making balanced, transparent communication a critical factor in the success of the transition.


For internal stakeholders like employees, consistent and transparent communication is vital, particularly from the CEO, to address employee concerns and maintain morale. This approach helps manage the uncertainties and changes accompanying mergers, ensuring the workforce remains informed and engaged.External stakeholders should also receive routine communications, including investors, the media and consumers. Press releases are often the best way to provide information to both the media and the public, but it's also worthwhile to cultivate relationships with media personalities in your industry to help with further positive coverage. Communicate with investors directly whenever possible, especially if significant changes occur. Regular personal emails from key internal stakeholders will keep investors feeling good about the merger.Transparency drives trustWithout transparency, there can be no trust. And trust is essential in mergers and acquisitions. Your customers want to trust that they can continue to buy from you, your employees want to trust that you will continue to meet their needs, and investors want to trust that your organization is making good business decisions that will pay off in the long run.Develop a strategy around timely and open communication with each of these segments, and stick to it. You can conduct live sessions, whether online or in person, where stakeholders can ask the leadership team questions and get answers to their concerns. Create an online FAQ hub, particularly for merger-specific questions, and update it regularly. Offer Q&A sessions exclusively for employees. These could be an online all-hands meeting or a more informal ""open office"" session with the CEO.


When problems arise, face them head-on with honesty. Better yet, before any issues arise, create a plan for any that could occur, and have a communication strategy already in place. Anticipating and discussing these challenges openly will help build trust and respect.One famous example of a merger that fell apart because of a lack of transparency and honest communication was the attempted merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler in 1998. The companies faced cultural clashes and weren't aligned strategically; unfortunately, neither communicated these challenges to key stakeholders. Not only did the merger fail, but both companies took financial losses and hits to their reputations.Related: 7 Strategies to Master the Art of Mergers and AcquisitionsSuccess beyond the mergerWhile the immediate merger period is currently top of mind, planning should already be in place for long-term reputation management. Before the merger, conduct a brand audit for all organizations involved, closely examining values, messaging and promises to consumers. Identify both commonalities and differences and then work together to develop a post-merger brand identity that resonates with the customers of both organizations.


Change is inevitable in a merger, and it is essential for both teams to communicate this clearly. Develop a story around the evolution of both brands that helps set expectations for internal and external stakeholders. Demonstrate how the merger enhances the capabilities, values and commitment to the customers served. Communicate this information on a range of channels, including social media, press releases, company blogs and internal employee communications. Ensure that your message is both consistent and transparent.Empathy and understandingEveryone affected by a merger has their hopes, goals and concerns.Actively addressing the emotional and practical concerns of stakeholders will help portray your organization in a positive light during what can sometimes be a tumultuous time. And remember — transparency is key. The truth will always trump false reassurances.Some fundamental issues to address include:


Job security: This will always be top of mind for employees. Be honest about these practical concerns. Will some people be let go? Will benefits packages change? Communicate on these topics clearly and with empathy for anyone who may be put in a difficult situation.Service disruptions: Do you anticipate any potential changes to service or product delivery during the merger? If so, be clear about the details. Letting people plan ahead builds trust and will keep customers loyal.Financial stability: Your investors want to know that this merger will provide a solid return on investment. To keep investor trust high, provide clear and frequent communication about any financial changes, especially if something unexpected occurs.Empathetic, honest and open communication can make or break a merger or acquisition. Create and execute a smart and strategic communication plan to help guide your company, customers, employees and investors into this new era so everyone can reap the benefits of this new partnership.

76,Unintegrated Trauma: How to Improve Communication by Understanding Stress Responses,"Dec 21, 2023",Kelly L. Campbell,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-improve-communication-by-understanding-stress/466461,"
Traumatic experiences manifest as invisible wounds that impact us psychologically and emotionally. While we often associate wounds with physical injuries, trauma creates internal damage.Unprocessed experiences become trapped within us as unintegrated information. This unresolved trauma then influences our behaviors and relationships, often without conscious awareness that it's happening. We only tend to recognize that something is off, wrong, or unsustainable. Understanding common trauma responses allows us to communicate with our colleagues, employees and clients alike with greater compassion and insight.Our job is never to diagnose or even try to unpack someone else's experiences, but the more awareness we can bring to our interactions, the more compassion we can have for each other.



Childhood trauma shapes adult reactionsAdverse childhood experiences (ACEs) stem from abuse, neglect, household challenges, discrimination, and other distressing situations. Studies suggest most people have at least one ACE, with much higher averages among the underestimated.The unresolved pain of early trauma then commandeers our nervous systems in adulthood. We develop patterns of thinking and reacting that echo old survival mechanisms. Though unconscious or subconscious, these habitual responses drive our professional (and personal) relationships.


In certain instances, we may observe that our reaction to a particular event, person, visual, or language used is not congruent with the reality of the situation. Those moments may be markers of unprocessed trauma. Said another way, this is what it looks like when the younger version of us is in the driver's seat —when they belong in the backseat, seatbelt-buckled, and enjoying their favorite snack. When the regulated, emotionally mature, adult version of us drives, we can respond versus react.A recent example of this was the Elon Musk interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin at the New York Times DealBook Summit, in which Musk mentions the abuse he endured during childhood. The influence of unintegrated trauma from his upbringing gives us a glimpse into aspects of his behavior that could be categorized as low-conscious leadership.Related: How to Lead with Compassion During These Traumatic TimesFour key trauma reactionsTrauma experts identify four common reactions to stress and perceived danger: fight, flight, freeze, and fawn (also called faint). While we each exhibit a primary tendency, these responses occur on a fluid spectrum. Our reactions depend on the situation and the person involved.


Fight reactions show up as aggression or defensiveness. Those with habitual fight reactions often faced belittling or neglect early on. Fighting helps them avoid repeating painful past experiences of unimportance, indifference and powerlessness.Flight reactions reflect an ongoing perception of danger. Anxious folks seeking escape through workaholism or perfectionism exhibit flight patterns. Their frantic busyness causes acute stress reactions like increased heart rate and breathing.Freeze reactions provide time to decide how to respond by stopping the moment. Those prone to freezing often grew up in unpredictable households requiring hypervigilance. Freezing allows the nervous system to pause on high alert before reacting.Fawn reactions prioritize avoiding conflict through appeasement. However, as children those who fawn adapted to volatile environments by placating others. While fawning colleagues may resent their people-pleasing tendencies, their response provides a sense of control.Related: Burnout Is Not Preventable — Here's How to Address Its Underlying Cause InsteadIn each of these four reactions, there are aspects of people pleasing and people controlling. People pleasers may seem kind on the surface but can lack boundaries and accountability. People controllers, who emerge from childhood powerlessness, micromanage and disempower their teams. Neither style effectively motivates or empowers. Both are on a quest for safety.Beyond fight or flight: Nuanced communicationUnderstanding others' likely trauma responses allows us to communicate with greater dexterity and care. We can identify reactive patterns through curiosity and non-judgment and adapt our language accordingly.With controlling colleagues, we might focus on maintaining their sense of autonomy and purpose. People-pleasing team members may need reassurance that speaking up won't jeopardize relationships. Regardless of specifics, leading with empathy fosters safety and collaboration.


My forthcoming book, HEAL to LEAD: Revolutionizing Leadership through Trauma Healing, breaks down the impact of trauma on leaders who exhibit people-controlling and people-pleasing behaviors. It explores the four fundamentals for uncovering the high-conscious leader within — Integrating Trauma, Embodying Vulnerability, Leading with Compassion and Lighting the Way.Healing happens in the bodyWhile talk therapy is certainly an effective gateway (i.e., I am an advocate and have 15 years of first-hand experience), mental health maintenance alone does not work to integrate trauma. Verbal counseling addresses thought patterns but can also keep some stuck in repetitive loops. Somatic methods, on the other hand, directly target the physical manifestations of trauma.Somatic therapy and mindfulness practices help discharge stuck emotional energy and tension from the body. Practical methods of somatic experiencing can be utilized in real-time, even during the workday—whether you work in the field, at an office, or from home.Related: Why Trauma Integration Will Give You a Competitive Advantage in Leadership


Conscious leadership through embodimentTrauma shapes us, but it need not define us. As leaders, turning compassionately toward our own wounds and those of others allows for mutual understanding. It permits authentic connection and releases us from patterns that no longer serve.Understanding trauma reactions and releasing trauma from the body together enable more conscious, compassionate communication. Blending somatic practices with this relational awareness empowers the healthiest possible workplaces. With insight into each other's pain, we stand a greater chance of building trust and mutually fulfilling professional partnerships.We rise together when we bring a higher consciousness to our shared humanity.

77,Building a Resilient Workplace — 5 Strategies for Fostering a 'Got Your Back' Culture,"Dec 14, 2023",Adam Markel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-strategies-for-fostering-a-got-your-back-culture/466189,"
The pandemic has certainly shaped the way we do business. From working from home to working flexible hours, businesses found ways to make things work despite the emotional toll Covid-19 brought on many of its workers.Fast forward to 2023, where we are now living in the post-pandemic era. While it's safe to say that everything is now ""business as usual,"" the changes that were made to minimize the pandemic's impact on business are still expected to continue as we head to 2024.For one, location will continue to become less of a factor with more companies allowing their employees to work from home full-time. Hybrid work has also slowly become a norm in the business world, and this is expected to grow to up to 81% by 2024.



It has also been projected that an estimated 70% of the workforce will be working from home remotely for at least five days a month by 2025, and by the looks of it, this trend isn't about to stop as businesses try to keep up with the times.Work from home or not, people can't help but feel anxious about the future. What does the future hold for themselves, their companies and the economy as a whole?


Related: 5 Ways to Build Organizational ResilienceIt's crucial for leaders to instill in their employees' minds — through simple words and actions — that they are not alone and that they have their backs because failing to do so can lead to a culture where people are more focused on self-preservation instead of thinking about the greater good.We have the opportunity to create a culture of selfless service as leaders. I learned about this lesson when I was 19 while working as a lifeguard at Jones Beach on Long Island's south shore.There were enormous waves and strong rip currents that frequently caused the pounding surf to be extremely intense, and the beach was frequently packed. Over 100,000 people may be there on crowded summer days.


Three whistle blasts alerted us about a missing swimmer one day. Our lifeguard team promptly mobilized and began combing through the surf all down the beach. We were called out of the water after more than an hour to confront the horrible news that the swimmer had perished. It was brutal.After the beach closed for the day, our leader told us we needed to take something away from this horrible experience. We would have to be flawless to ensure that nobody went down on our watch again and that we had to keep an eye on each other's backs if we were going to accomplish that.We became stronger and more cohesive as a team as a result of that setback and failure. We were aware that there were crew members watching us whenever we were summoned to conduct a rescue. We could not have repeatedly entered the sea and risked our lives if we hadn't known we had support at all times.Whether they're working from home or returning to an office, individuals today need to feel the same level of confidence and support. The following five strategies will help your company develop a ""got your back"" culture that will go a really long way for any organization:


1. Adopt language of selfless serviceAs a leader, you have to show genuine concern and support for the people around you by your words and actions. This does not mean putting up with subpar performance.As lifeguards, we were aware that arriving late or ill-prepared (or both) to replace the person on the stand put people's lives in danger and broke the code of looking after each other. There were repercussions for breaking the regulations, but there was also room for mistakes to be made and learned from. And if someone needed a break to recover, the crew rallied to honor the request.Related: How to Have Your Employees' Back When They Are Working Toward Your Business Goals2. Accept real feedbackPeople should be encouraged to pose and respond to inquiries like, ""What's working for me?"" and ""What's not working for me?"" Building trust occurs when individuals feel comfortable expressing themselves freely and are extended an open invitation to be transparent.


3. Integrate resilience rituals into your cultureCreate support networks to assist staff in developing resilience and incorporating it into the corporate ethos. This could entail arranging training sessions that are concrete and significant and convey the organization's values to staff members, as well as motivating them to practice mindfulness and take breaks.4. Reevaluate everythingNo sacred cows should exist. It's possible that something worked out well in January but not in February. Every policy, benchmark, principle or catchphrase from the past needs to be reviewed in some way.Related: Want to Unlock Business Resiliency? Prioritize Your People5. Create ways to celebrate togetherLooking back, being a lifeguard back then, I remember that even if it was a serious setting, we shared a lot of laughs and smiles that I still treasure to this day. After the workday was over, we teasingly and competitively challenged one another and celebrated as a group. What I learned is that such strong bonds are not created overnight. They are created by shared experiences and trust.


Every organization has a culture that either says, ""Got your back"" or ""Watch your back."" You can help people become more resilient so they can thrive through the problems they confront — now and in an uncertain future — by putting these principles into practice.

78,"'Why Are We Shouting?' Inside the Online Community That Is Helping Entrepreneurial Moms Connect, Collaborate and Stay Sane","Dec 14, 2023",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/jill-salzmans-key-strategies-for-mom-entrepreneurs-success/466975,"
As a self-described serial entrepreneur, Jill Salzman struggled to balance her two businesses with her responsibilities as a mother at the beginning of her career. Feeling overwhelmed and lonely, Jill created an online meetup for moms going through the same experience. This small meetup of 20 women grew into The Founding Moms, an online community for mom entrepreneurs that has exceeded 30,000 members in more than 200 cities around the world.Since launching The Founding Moms in 2010, the biggest lesson Jill has taken away from her business's growth is the importance of collaboration.""There is no way you can build a business alone,"" Jill said. ""You have to reach out. You have to learn how to be vulnerable with somebody else and share with them not just the stuff that's going well but the stuff that's not going so well and ask for help.""



In addition to running The Founding Moms, Jill provides coaching and consulting services to members of the platform. She also hosts her own podcast, ""Why Are We Shouting?"", where she tackles questions pertinent to mom entrepreneurs.Jill said she finds her clients often wait too long to admit they need help with their business. Seeing this, she encourages all entrepreneurs to be more open when talking about their challenges and to not be scared to ask for advice.


""My first piece of advice for any entrepreneur always is literally just go talk to one person about what's really going on in your business. That could be anyone in your life,"" Jill said. ""The practice of saying out loud what's bothering you helps to awaken this area inside of you that you have been just shoving and pushing down.""When advising clients, Jill said many business owners hold the misconception that other entrepreneurs are your competition, which makes them wary to share their ideas. However, Jill confirms that business owners will always get further when they choose collaboration over competition.On top of sharing ideas with other business owners, Jill said an important key to her success was attending events and networking with other entrepreneurs. By learning about each others' businesses and challenges, entrepreneurs can exchange helpful contacts and build networks that help them achieve their goals.""The only way that other human beings can connect with you is generosity, serving one another in a way that can help one another,"" Jill said. ""Just being yourself and being open to the world helps you find the people that you need.""


After almost two decades of running her own businesses, Jill acknowledges that entrepreneurship can be mentally and emotionally draining. To navigate this, Jill encourages business owners to be patient when first starting out and to lean on others for support when times get tough.""A small business owner is somebody who is ready for a mini roller coaster ride throughout this career,"" Jill said. ""If we can just limit that rollercoaster ride to not have such peaks and valleys along the way, we're going to feel more solid and stable, but we need to know that they're going to come.""In addition to networking and collaborating with other business owners, Jill's tips for riding the entrepreneurial roller coaster include:Take time for yourself. As an entrepreneur, you might feel pressure to be productive at all hours of the day to make your business a success. However, it is important to leave space in your schedule for personal time to avoid burnout.Be present outside of work. It's easy to be distracted thinking about the list of things you have to do for your business, especially when you're not working. Even if it feels hard, always try to be present in your relationships outside of work and connect with those around you. This will give you more energy when working on your business.Stay optimistic. When first starting your business, it could take some time before your big break. It's important to stay positive and persistent even as challenges come your way.Engage your customers for support. In addition to asking other business owners for advice, it can be especially insightful to ask for customer feedback. This can be in the form of a ""submit feedback"" box, a survey, or even a simple question during daily customer interactions.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Jill, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.Available on: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Pandora, and Soundcloud.

79,"How to Build and Sustain Deep, Meaningful Business Relationships (and Why It's the Key to Long-Lasting Success)","Dec 13, 2023",Aaron Knipp,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-build-and-sustain-deep-meaningful-business/465701,"
Business success isn't just about the right strategy or a well-crafted marketing plan. It's about something more profound, yet often overlooked: the power of human connections.Entrepreneurs who recognize the importance of nurturing deep, genuine relationships stand apart in the crowded marketplace. Inspired by Jason Mitchell's approach, this article explores the transformative impact these connections can have in the world of business.Related: 4 Strategies for Building Deep Business Relationships



The essence of human connection in businessThe digital age has transformed how we connect, often leading to a flurry of superficial interactions in the business world. Yet, there's a growing realization among savvy entrepreneurs that true business strength lies in forging deeper, more meaningful connections. It's not just about collecting contacts; it's about cultivating relationships that are rich in understanding and mutual respect. This approach transcends the traditional notion of networking, where quantity often overshadows quality. Instead, it emphasizes the value of each individual connection, recognizing that a single, well-nurtured relationship can open doors to opportunities far beyond the reach of a vast, yet shallow network.Entrepreneurs who master this art of relationship-building understand that it's not merely a nice-to-have, but a fundamental pillar of lasting business success. By focusing on depth rather than breadth, they create a resilient network that's not just a business asset, but a source of continuous learning, inspiration and mutual growth.


Deep relationships as a catalyst for business successThere's something incredibly powerful about a well-nurtured business relationship. It's not just about closing a deal or making a sale. It's about building a connection that goes deeper than a typical business transaction. Imagine this: An entrepreneur forges a bond with a client, not just as a business contact but as a trusted ally. This kind of relationship, rooted in authenticity and mutual respect, often leads to unexpected and lucrative opportunities. Word-of-mouth referrals, strategic partnerships and collaborative ventures tend to naturally flow from these genuine connections.It's like unlocking a hidden layer of business potential that can't be tapped through mere transactions. This isn't just networking — it's building a community around your business, where loyalty and support are the currencies. And in this community, each relationship becomes a catalyst for growth, proving that the strength of your business connections can be one of your greatest assets.Time investment in people as a strategic business moveLet's appreciate that there's a certain art to investing time in people that goes far beyond typical business interactions. It's about seeing beyond the immediate payoff and understanding the profound impact of genuinely caring about those you do business with. This is not about adding another name to your contact list; it's about creating a meaningful connection that enriches both parties.Take a moment to think about it: When an entrepreneur truly invests in their relationships, it's not just an exchange of business cards or a handshake at a networking event. It's about listening, understanding challenges, celebrating successes and sometimes just being there. This investment of time and authentic interest can turn a mere contact into a loyal business ally, a collaborator or even a friend. In the long run, these are the connections that stand the test of time, fostering a business environment that's not only more productive but also more fulfilling.


Related: How to Build Sustainable and Meaningful Business RelationshipsThe ripple effect of genuine care in professional networksThink about the ripple effect of genuine care in your professional network. It's like throwing a stone into a pond — the impact of that one thoughtful gesture or that extra bit of attention can spread far and wide. When you show real care and investment in your relationships, it doesn't just stay between you and the other person. It sends a message to everyone around you about the kind of business person you are.This kind of authenticity and empathy attracts others who value the same, creating a network that's not just wide, but also deep and supportive. It's about building a reputation not just for being successful, but for being genuinely supportive and connected. In this network, each person becomes not just a contact, but a potential advocate, collaborator and friend. It's a business environment where trust and mutual support are the norm, making every interaction more meaningful and potentially more fruitful.Building and sustaining deep business relationshipsSo, how does one go about building these meaningful business relationships? It's simpler than you might think, but it requires a consistent and genuine approach. Start with the basics: Be an active listener, showing genuine interest in the other person's thoughts and concerns. It's about engaging in conversations that go beyond just business talk, understanding their aspirations, challenges and even personal milestones.


Empathy plays a big role here — putting yourself in their shoes and offering support or advice when needed. Remember, it's not about keeping score; it's about building a connection. Regular check-ins, sharing relevant information or even a simple message to say hello can keep the relationship warm. It's these small, consistent actions that lay the foundation for a strong, enduring bond. Over time, these relationships evolve into a robust network of mutual support, where business opportunities and collaborations naturally emerge from a place of trust and respect.The real strength of a business lies not just in its strategies or products, but in the depth and quality of its relationships. By focusing on genuine connections, entrepreneurs can unlock a world of opportunities that go far beyond conventional business gains. It's these deep, authentic relationships that become the true drivers of long-lasting success and fulfillment in the business world.Related: Networking Stinks! Here Are 3 Better Ways To Connect

82,Want to Connect With Your Customers? Ditch Old Tactics To Forge Stronger Bonds,"Dec 4, 2023",Louis Lombardi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/want-to-connect-with-your-customers-ditch-old-tactics-to/464610,"
Most entrepreneurs will agree that it is essential to connect with customers through effective communication – that's a given. But not all businesses walk the talk, and some are completely missing the mark by using outdated strategies or, worse, not communicating at all. In a world of infinite choices and hungry competition, a lack of connection and communication is a recipe for disaster.On the other hand, deploying strategies that create and reinforce connections and ensure communication is a two-way street puts a business on the fast track to success (so long as the rest of the business is as sound as its communication strategy). In fact, data shows that effective customer communication can lead to significant benefits for businesses. For example, a study by Bain & Company found that companies that increase their customer engagement by 5% can see profits increase by up to 95%.So, how can businesses create, nurture and maintain customer connections and ensure efficient communications in a cluttered world where customers are constantly bombarded with messages?



Related: 8 Effective Ways to Connect With Your CustomerThe solution is to meet customers where they are. This means that businesses must understand where their customers (and prospects) spend their time and communicate with them through those channels with clear, relevant messages.


Be active on social mediaThe majority of consumers use social media, making it a great place to connect with your customers. Find out which platforms your customers use most frequently and be active on those platforms. Create a strategic posting strategy that includes content topics, formats and trends. Stick to a manageable and effective cadence, post content in various formats (based on the channel), and ensure the content is relevant to your audience while still adhering to brand guidelines. For the content and posting strategy, use the 80/20 rule: 80% of the time, post valuable content; the other 20% can be a mix of self-promotion and company-related content.Use digital walletsDigital wallets are becoming increasingly popular, offering a unique opportunity to connect with customers. Businesses can create a digital card and invite customers to add it to their digital wallet, then send customers personalized messages, offers and updates for products, services, or events through the digital card. Since digital cards are stored on a mobile device, and consumers check their devices multiple times a day, this enables a direct line of communication and a non-invasive way to share information in real-time.Use email marketingEmail marketing is still a great way to connect with customers, but it is crucial — now more than ever — to ensure emails are personalized and relevant. Segment your email list and send targeted campaigns to different groups of customers based on their preferences and behaviors. Invite customers to opt in and provide an easy way to change their preferences or opt out. It is also a great idea to send emails with a person's name instead of just using the company name.Provide excellent customer serviceWhen customers have a question or problem, they want to get help quickly and easily. To do this, make the company's contact information easy to find (customers get frustrated when they can't find an email address or phone number, which can create immediate frustration) and offer an FAQ page link in social account profiles and within emails. To ensure an entire exchange provides good customer service, be sure your tech stack supports customer service interactions and your staff is well-trained.


Some specific examples of how businesses can meet customers where they are include:A clothing company can use social media to share photos and videos of new products and offer customers live chat exchanges with stylists in real time.A restaurant can use digital cards to send customers exclusive offers and discounts that appear directly in their digital wallet.A software company can use a digital card at a trade show to update customers on the booth location and various activities throughout the show.By meeting customers where they are, businesses can build stronger customer relationships, leading to higher customer retention rates and, in turn, increased sales.

83,Great Leaders Must Be Great Coaches — Here's How to Become One,"Nov 30, 2023",Scott Taylor,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/great-leaders-must-be-great-coaches-heres-how-to/465738,"
What makes a great leader? Our traditional visions of leadership often center around a lone hero taking charge and charting a bold path for others to follow. But in my years of research on leadership development and my experience training hundreds of executives at top companies, I've found that successful leaders are much more relational and cooperative than this outdated view imagines.An entrepreneurial leader coaches her team to unleash their full potential. She helps team members develop a vision for their ideal versions of themselves and fuels their intrinsic motivation to bring these ideal selves to life. Your job as a leader is not to blaze a path alone. It is to inspire your team to move forward together.Related: 3 Effective Ways to Lead as a Coach Rather Than a Boss



How to inspire growthTo be a successful leader, you must become an expert in how to help others grow and develop. Unfortunately, many of the existing models for professional and personal development focus on setting goals, tracking progress and measuring outcomes — and inevitably lead to feelings of failure and disappointment when we fall short. These punitive, results-driven models don't offer the inspiration and support people need to fuel lasting change.There is a better way to coach your team. The research-driven approach I teach at Babson College's Arthur M. Blank School for Entrepreneurial Leadership is based on two existing behavioral change models that are built around internal psychological development and self-realization, instead of externally imposed metrics.


Intentional change theory (ICT), developed by Richard Boyatzsis, posits that people change themselves in a sustained way by making five self-discoveries, which I will explain in detail below. These self-discoveries lead to a vision of our ideal selves, which serve as our North Star as we grow and develop, and a process for aligning our current selves with our ideals.Edward L. Desi and Richard Ryan's self-determination theory (SDT) argues that the chances for sustained change are highest when people are driven by intrinsic motivation — their self-developed, internal motivations for change — as opposed to external motivators such as pay and praise. We are most likely to achieve this intrinsic motivation when three basic needs are satisfied: autonomy (a sense of being self-directed), relatedness (a sense of connection with and care for and from others) and competence (a sense of self-confidence in our words and actions).To be a great coach and effectively develop your team, you must meet these three SDT needs that are the springboard for intrinsic motivation, and then use that motivation to help your team members achieve sustained change by guiding them through the ICT discovery process. I'll explain the discovery process step by step to demonstrate exactly how it works, and you can read more in my paper on this topic for Leadership Quarterly.Related: How Real Leaders Coach Their Employees For Success


The process of intentional changeFirst, successful coaches encourage people to find their ideal selves — the initial discovery. The ideal self is someone's aspirational view of who they want to become or what they want to do, instead of what they feel obligated or expected to be. The ideal self serves as a guiding light giving life to someone's aspirations and actions. You can help team members identify their ideal selves by asking targeted questions to develop a vision statement for who they ultimately want to be. A vision statement isn't a traditional goal, but instead an inspiring description of someone's biggest aspirations. The questions should also positively impact a person's feelings of autonomy, relatedness and competence (the three core SDT needs). This will build trust in the coaching relationship, allowing team members to tap into the creative and vulnerable space needed to identify their ideal selves. As your team's needs are met through discovering their ideal selves, their intrinsic motivation will rise.You should take a similar approach to the second discovery process: helping team members identify their real selves. The real self is someone's current self as expressed through their values, strengths and weaknesses, personality and more. As in the first phase, you can employ questions and assessments that fulfill each of the three SDT needs as your team members work to pinpoint their real selves. Commonly used assessment tools such as Firo-B, Strength Finders, MBTI and DISC help people identify the strengths and capabilities they can leverage to move closer to their ideal selves.After your team members have identified their ideal and real selves, you can guide them to develop a learning agenda. This agenda outlines concrete action steps by which someone can close the gap between their real and ideal self by harnessing the strengths identified in the prior phase. A learning agenda should be inspiring and aspirational while offering feasible and concrete steps to align the real and ideal selves, a balance that helps maximize motivation and persistence.


Your team members can then move to the fourth discovery step, experimentation and practice, where they try out a ""provisional self"" by practicing the actions from their learning agenda that will move them closer to their ideal selves. Keep an eye on your team members' connections to their ideal self during this experimentation. If they seem unmotivated or start to lose direction, you should help them reconnect with their ideal self, potentially by returning to the first phase in the process if necessary.The final discovery — trusting relationships — is not a phase of its own, but a quality that should happen at each stage in the process. True, lasting change is most likely if there is a trusting, supportive relationship between an individual and their coach. It is your role to help foster this relationship with your team members throughout the discovery process and beyond, which will both increase their likelihood of success and serve as a boon to their motivation and overall wellness.Related: 10 Rules for Coaching Your Team to GreatnessEffective entrepreneurial leaders coach their team members to become the most aspirational versions of themselves. This approach creates psychological safety and satisfies people's needs in a way that allows them to maximize risk-tracking, creativity and innovation. They will be ready to confront a world with increasingly complex and unexpected challenges that require dynamic solutions.


Becoming a better coach — and making sure other leaders in your organization are effective coaches — is one of the best ways to supercharge your organization's success and your team's fulfillment.

Effective teams are the building block of any successful company. Optimizing teamwork involves creating an environment where individuals can collaborate seamlessly, maximize their strengths and overcome challenges. While this may sound straightforward, many obstacles get in the way, prompting organizations to run various teambuilding workshops focused on fun, communication and collaboration but which fail to achieve their intended aims.To achieve significant and lasting improvement in teamwork, you must begin with the individual team members. Only then can team members' interpersonal relationships and, in turn, team performance be optimized. This process begins with acknowledging the many teams within the team.Related: Team-Building Tips: 8 Ways to Make Sure Every Employee Feels Included



The teams within the teamJust as our planet exists within a system of planets, our nation within a system of nations, our organization within a system of organizations, and our team exists within a system of teams, that is not the end of the story. Of course, our team is a system of individuals. Still, there is more.Psychotherapist Dr. Richard C. Schwartz's Internal Family Systems model reveals that we are a system of ""parts,"" each with a distinctive persona and role. The many members of our internal ""team"" can be classified as:


Exiles who carry the pain of experienced traumas and hard times in isolation from other ""members."" These are our inner loners, scapegoats, black sheep and truth tellers.Managers who keep the trains running by focusing on top performance and keeping the Exiles invisible or under control. These are our inner heroes, golden children, star performers, doers and caretakers.Firefighters who shut down difficult emotions and problems through distractions like changing the subject, overindulgence or violence. These are our inner mascots, clowns, partiers and loose cannons.As with all teams, our inner team has a leader: the Self, ideally, an experienced and competent leader with a breadth and depth of perspective expressed through wise consideration of all the parts. When our inner team is not operating optimally, this Self can be drowned out and overruled by its members — particularly if they distrust the leader, believe the team is not being led competently, or detect danger. The result can include dysfunction (Exile rule), overperformance (Manager rule) and counterproductivity (Firefighter rule). Generally, when self-leadership is restored, the various members can be recognized, understood and integrated.The problem is that most of us don't know our inner teams — and still, more of us are unaware we even have inner teams. This puts us at risk for exhibiting behaviors mystifying to us and problematic for our teams.Related: How Self-Leadership Can Help Move The Needle Forward On Your Vision And GoalsGetting to know the inner teamWhile our teams and organizations are not the places to conduct therapy, we still can gain awareness of our inner teams and how they affect our work. We even can have some fun doing so. The steps below help you develop an observer's eye of yourself that provides insight and clarity that are more textured and multidimensional than you generally can get through personality tests and other instruments. The more relaxed and playful you can be, making sure you are not taking yourself too seriously, the more insights and benefits you will gain.


Meet your inner team members. Using guided meditation, freehand drawing or life mapping approaches, reflect on your work experiences while considering the archetypes of Exile, Manager, and Firefighter. Notice what events and personas come to mind as you adopt an observer role and flip through very happy times, stressful events and turning points as if they were in a photo album. Select one that seems particularly prominent based on the surface's various images, memories and personas.Now, meet your inner team member: What is this ""member"" like? How does the member show up: male, female, nonbinary? Animal, cartoon character, something else? What does this member look like? Do they have a backstory? What is their driving motivation or most important objective? How do they manage situations and other members? Repeat the exercise until you have identified three to five inner team members.Notice when these members show up to work. Now that you understand some of your inner team members, you can begin to recognize when those parts have shown up in your work activities. For example, you may gain a new understanding of why and how you were able to close a particular sale everyone thought was impossible or why you shut down a specific project that had been producing valuable results but which you just couldn't stomach.Do inner teambuilding. Like all teams, our inner teams can benefit from more mutual understanding and collaboration among members. Fortunately, simply by identifying and understanding our inner team members, we make great strides in relaxing our Managers, defusing our Firefighters and accepting our Exiles.


Related: 6 Steps to Build a Strong TeamIntroduce your inner teams. These exercises can also be applied at the group level, leading to a better understanding and performance of employees' inner teams and the group. In one team I facilitated, ""Mark"" introduced two of his inner team members: Ed the Enforcer, a driven taskmaster and Wacky Wade, a fun-loving connector who shields people from conflict.With much laughter, Mark's colleagues recognized it was Ed who bizarrely commandeered the team's float building for the annual fundraiser, and it was Wade's off-the-wall comment that took a contentious team meeting on a complete left turn, derailing the tension … and team productivity along with it. The exercise helped the team bond and gave them a vast collection of inside jokes and shared language that fueled their continued work.ConclusionOur organizations need strong collaboration and teamwork more than ever before. But too often, we are not ready to do that because our inner teams must first be understood and optimized. Without such inside-out approaches, even the most innovative team-building efforts will fail. Let's support our work teams by first making our inner teams work.

86,9 Potential Landmines in the Franchisor-Franchisee Relationship,"Nov 24, 2023",Scott Greenberg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/9-potential-landmines-in-the-franchisor-franchisee/465654,"
Franchising isn't immune to bad leadership or unethical behavior. If you sometimes question your franchisor's actions, it's possible your concerns have merit. Franchises, like any other business, are institutions run by humans. Not all of them are good partners. I've absolutely encountered some that don't operate in their franchisees' best interest, and most unhappy franchisees are convinced that's who they're in business with.But those franchisors are the exception. The overwhelming majority of franchisors are smart, ethical people who want to make money by building a strong franchise system. They genuinely want their franchisees to thrive and work tirelessly to support their local partners while trying to manage their own corporate enterprise. And they have a tough job. If you've run a business, you know how hard it can be to manage employees. Now imagine having to wrangle hundreds or thousands of independent, strong-minded personalities spread out over millions of square miles. We franchisees can be a real motley crew!Related: Insights and Strategies in Navigating the Franchisee-Franchisor RelationshipFranchisors and franchisees are equally responsible for building trust. But franchisors are people, just as we are. They feel joy, frustration, excitement, and fear. They get upset when they're yelled at. Sometimes they lose their temper and do the yelling. Ideally, they'll behave professionally—and so will we—but everyone makes mistakes. We're all out there living our lives and doing our best.



Here, we're going to focus on the franchisee's role in the relationship. It's the only part you can control, so make sure you're operating in the most constructive manner possible. Do that, and you'll have a more positive influence on your corporate partners—and hopefully enjoy a much more productive relationship.The Importance of TrustTrust is the foundation of any relationship. The essence of partnership is a belief that someone else has your back, and a willingness to put yourself in their hands. It's the single most important element of franchising. Here's how that word breaks down:Related: Why You Should Buy a Franchise Instead of Starting Your Own


I discussed this issue at length with Tropical Smoothie Cafe CEO Charles Watson. His company believes so deeply in the importance of building trust that they even use the word as an acronym to encourage the following qualities in their franchisees:Transparent: ""Be honest about what's going on.""Responsible: ""We've got our responsibilities, and you've got yours. We have to build the bicycle, but you have to ride it.""Unique: ""There's value in you being your unique self."" Charles called this ""bringing your whole self to work""—celebrating your true self.Service-oriented: ""We need to drive a servant leadership mentality all the way through the organization.""Tenacious: ""A great franchisee in a poor system can still be successful because they're really going to get after it.""Related: 7 Relationship-Building Lessons I Learned By Partnering With Over 20 FranchisesAfter she left PIP in 2008, Catherine Monson went on to become CEO and president of Fastsigns and chair the International Franchise Association (IFA). She defines the three criteria of franchisor excellence as the following:Franchisee profitability/economic viabilityThe franchisor has high moral character and focuses on franchisee successPositive franchisee-franchisor relationshipsHow awesome would it be to have a franchisor who focuses on these three elements? Many franchisees actually do—they just don't realize it. Our trust level isn't just based on someone else's behavior; it's also based on our perceptions. A person can be completely well-intentioned, but if you doubt them, your level of trust decreases. That doubt could be the result of something they said, did, or didn't do. It could also be because of a rumor or an incorrect assumption on your part. It doesn't take much to cloud our perspective.Related: To Make a Smart Franchise Purchase, Ask These 3 Contrarian QuestionsThe Tension Between Franchisee and Franchisor PerspectivesFranchisors struggle with franchisees they believe are noncompliant, resistant to change, or unwilling to invest what it takes. Franchisees feel their corporate office doesn't care, doesn't understand their market, or doesn't know what they're doing. They think the franchisor's only priority is selling more franchises. These perceptions say less about either side than they do about the delicate connection between them.


Relationships of any kind are volatile. A franchise is a powder keg. It's a long-distance relationship with financial ties. The model is loaded with tensions, areas where franchisees and franchisors can easily be at odds. Consider the issues below and the different perspectives each side might have.All these land mines are there, waiting to be tripped. When you throw in personality clashes, it's a miracle any franchise functions. But many do. There are countless franchise families where all parties enjoy profitable, flourishing relationships. They work through their differences on all the above issues to find common ground and ensure everyone's needs are met. Sales are made, bills are paid, royalties are taken, and supplies are purchased. Both franchisee and franchisor grow their companies, and at least once a year they have a pleasant drink together at the annual convention.Related: Why Entrepreneurs Do Not Always Make The Best FranchiseesBut this doesn't happen by accident.

Augmented Reality (AR) glasses, often dismissed as futuristic gadgets, are increasingly emerging as practical instruments reshaping the hybrid work environment. While Apple's Vision Pro is something many heard about, but few experienced, other effective AR glasses exist and are growing increasingly widespread. But how exactly are they transforming our approach to professional tasks and team dynamics?AR glasses: A tool for practical problem-solvingThe real utility of AR glasses in a professional context goes far beyond the wow factor. Let's consider the core functionalities that make these devices stand out. For instance, real-time transcription and translation services through AR can be a breakthrough in cross-border team communications. No longer do professionals need to be stymied by language barriers or the delays of after-the-fact translation.The ability to view and manipulate 3D models or technical designs remotely takes collaboration to the next level. Troubleshooting equipment issues becomes far easier when off-site experts can visually guide on-site technicians through annotations and instructions. AR glasses allow for a rapid transfer of institutional knowledge that can greatly benefit training, onboarding and team coordination.

AR glasses bring an added layer of interactivity to virtual meetings. The ability to annotate in real-time, view digital whiteboards, and even bring in data visualizations during a discussion enhances collaboration to a level that mimics in-person interaction. Shared augmented spaces allow for a sense of presence that 2D video conferencing lacks.


This leads to more focused and productive sessions where everyone is quite literally on the same page. From brainstorming to concrete problem-solving, the value of shared visualization and annotation cannot be overstated.Seamless transition between physical and virtual workspacesThe beauty of AR glasses lies in their ability to adapt to varying work environments seamlessly. This isn't just about making remote work more effective but also about transforming the way we interact in physical offices. Through real-time reminders, spatial orientation within an office building, or even health monitoring, these devices can take several administrative burdens off professionals, allowing them to focus on high-value tasks. They become an extension of the mind, reducing the need for extraneous notetaking and information lookup.Meetings can take place spontaneously, without the logistical hassles of room bookings and video conferencing links. Whether you're at home or in a meeting room, the experience stays consistent. This fluid integration between physical and virtual workspaces is where the technology really shines.Enhancing human interaction in a digital worldThe power of AR goes beyond digital utility; it has the potential to enrich human relationships in professional settings. Imagine receiving real-time, non-verbal cues from your audience during a presentation, thereby allowing you to adapt your approach and engage more effectively. It combines the best of digital data analytics with the nuance of human interaction. Having everyone's name and position appear before you in a meeting fosters deeper professional bonds.


The ability to discreetly access information about someone you've just met can be invaluable for introverts. AR glasses allow users to become socially smarter, transcending limits like forgetfulness and lack of context that often constrain human interaction.Integrating AI for context-aware assistanceA crucial aspect that can elevate the efficacy of AR glasses is the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI). By incorporating AI, these devices can become context-aware, offering data and suggestions based on real-time situations, thus making the user experience more dynamic and responsive.From smart scheduling assistants to provide talking points before an important meeting, to safety alerts if you're working in hazardous environments, an AI system tailored to your organizational needs can drastically boost both productivity and wellbeing. As AI capabilities grow more advanced, the possibilities for intuitive assistance become profound.Managing ethical and security challengesWhile the possibilities are vast, it's crucial to think about the ethical and security implications of incorporating such advanced technology into daily work life. The ability to record and analyze data in real-time inevitably raises questions about privacy and data security that organizations must address proactively. Strict access controls, encryption and transparency about how augmented data will be used and stored are vital.


There are also cultural challenges to consider, as some employees may feel pressure to adopt AR glasses while others prefer minimal use. Clear organizational policies and training around consent, harassment and inclusion will be essential. Handled carefully, these technologies can be implemented ethically in a way that respects both privacy and professional growth.Related: 10 Ways to Reimagine Retail and Virtual Shopping Since COVID-19Case study of applying AR glassesIn my role at Disaster Avoidance Experts, I've had the opportunity to guide companies through the integration of cutting-edge technologies to enhance hybrid and remote work. One case study involves a multinational company grappling with the challenges of fractured communication across its diversified teams — remote, in-office and hybrid.The corporation's primary hurdles were not uncommon: geographic, linguistic and cultural differences that often create significant barriers to seamless communication, leading to a host of inefficiencies and collaborative deficiencies. Recognizing the need for a tailored solution, we initiated a detailed analysis of the communication barriers within the company, followed by the development of a robust set of standards and norms to facilitate better communication practices.


An integral part of the solution was the introduction of customized AR glasses, incorporating cutting-edge features like real-time transcription and translation. This feature alone dramatically lowered language barriers, facilitating instant and clear communication between team members who spoke different languages. Spatial computing features added to the AR glasses allowed for a shared, interactive three-dimensional space for team members to collaborate on complex tasks and projects, enhancing the collective problem-solving capabilities.The impact of implementing AR technology was significant and measurable. Within three months, the company experienced a 23% improvement in team collaboration and communication effectiveness. This metric was likely derived from meticulous pre and post-implementation surveys that measured various aspects of team communication and collaboration.The positive outcome of this case study is twofold: It demonstrates the direct benefits of integrating AR glasses into corporate communication strategies and highlights the importance of a holistic approach that includes training and the establishment of new operational guidelines. The result was not just a technological upgrade but a cultural transformation that empowered employees to maximize the potential of AR for improved collaboration and productivity.Embracing game-changing innovationAs we navigate the complexities of a hybrid work environment, AR glasses present a transformative avenue that professionals and enterprises can't afford to overlook. They offer more than just digital augmentation; they have the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate, collaborate, and even relate to each other in a professional setting.


Of course, no technology is a panacea. But used judiciously, augmented reality promises to enhance productivity and connectivity in groundbreaking ways. In a world that's always in flux, adapting and adopting these technological innovations is less a matter of choice and more a requirement for staying ahead. Much like the internet and smartphones, what seems novel today may soon be an integral part of how business gets done. The future is here, and with the right vision, augmented reality can empower professionals for whatever lies ahead.

88,Why Assessments Are a Critical Component of Knowing Your Team,"Nov 9, 2023",Rachel Cubas-Wilkinson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-assessments-are-a-critical-component-of-knowing-your/464774,"
In sports, a great coach knows their players' strengths and weaknesses, as well as behavior and thought patterns. Likewise, in business, leaders must be thoroughly familiar with their team members.There are a few areas where this knowledge is critical. To start, leaders must understand the interpersonal psychological needs of their team. While humans share certain universal needs, our needs for things like being recognized, included in activities, etc., vary greatly by individual. These differences can affect how someone interacts with their team.Additionally, leaders need a solid grasp on how people's communication styles vary. The impact of differences in communication preferences cannot be understated, as they can lead to misunderstandings and even serious conflict. Furthermore, it is imperative that leaders understand the drivers of trust within their team and be able to identify things that might erode the sense of psychological safety required for people to perform at their most innovative and creative levels.



Obtaining this insight isn't automatic because people may not wear their unique communication needs on their sleeve. It involves spending time with people on an individual level. However, regardless of how keen one's powers of observation may be, human perception is inherently biased. This makes it impossible to gain a complete and accurate view of a team based on personal experience alone.In my experience, one of the best ways to obtain an unbiased understanding of a team involves using psychometrically validated assessments. In this article, I'll dive into how assessments can provide an objective understanding of interpersonal needs, communication styles and drivers of trust for the individuals and teams leaders work with.


Related: 10 Reasons Why Personality And Behavior Assessments Will Gain Prominence In Human Capital ManagementUnderstanding how interpersonal needs may affect your teamAs previously mentioned, we all have certain universal interpersonal needs related to how we interact with the people around us. According to Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation™ (FIRO Business) model, these include needs for:InclusionControlAffectionThis model has two categories of needs: Wanted needs, which are what someone wishes others to fulfill for them and Expressed needs, which are what people wish to fulfill for others. Recognizing the interplay of a team's interpersonal psychological needs is vital in fostering a collaborative atmosphere that unleashes the team's complete capabilities.Assessing the psychological needs within themselves and their team members empowers leaders to pinpoint the source of interpersonal problems.For example, if a team member with high Wanted needs for control is in a situation where they have little say over what is happening in a project that is near and dear to them, negative effects may be experienced by them and their colleagues. Once this challenge is identified, teams can collaborate on a solution that meets the psychological needs of each member and enhances the entire team. Rather than taking a knee-jerk response of giving the team member a great deal more control, they would first seek to understand how this might affect other team members with varying Wanted and Expressed needs for control. In many cases, a compromise might need to be reached between teammates.


This process isn't spontaneous, and understanding of these needs doesn't always emerge through day-to-day interaction. Teams need to actively cultivate it, and the process starts with an assessment of interpersonal needs through a psychometrically validated tool.Team communicationEfficient team communication offers numerous advantages, such as strengthening work relationships, increasing individuals' commitment to team objectives and minimizing workplace conflicts. While establishing an open and inclusive communication environment can be daunting, with careful consideration, leaders can create guidelines tailored to their team that ensure effective communication practices.Tangible steps to enhance communication include establishing well-defined communication channels and assigning clear responsibilities to those tasked with keeping the team updated. Moreover, consistently providing respectful constructive feedback can significantly enhance communication within the organization.However, such discussions — even when approached with good intentions — can spark negative reactions. Frequently, the root cause lies in individual variations in communication preferences based on personality. In such cases, an objective perspective can provide insight to navigate negative reactions or conflict. The psychometric assessment process can uncover communication misunderstandings rooted in personality differences.


Consider, for example, how people can come across negatively in their communications to people with varying personality types, based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®) model:Extraverted + thinking preferences: Their systematic, logical and analytical approach might come across as overly blunt, directive or condescending.Extraverted + feeling preferences: An inclusive and supportive approach characterized by empathy and a warm communication style can sometimes be perceived as overly emphasizing harmony and consensus to the detriment of efficiency and productivity.Extraverted + sensing preferences: Their detailed, efficient, practical approach may be viewed by others as inflexible and demanding.Extraverted + intuitive preferences: An open-minded, curious and big-picture approach can be seen as an overwhelming stream of ideas or lacking practical detail for realistic execution.With assessment-based insight into these potential communication pitfalls, leaders can build bridges of awareness and understanding within their teams.Related: 3 Effective Communication Strategies That Will Transform Your TeamIdentifying issues that undermine trustTrust describes the confidence team members have in each other's capabilities, intentions and behavior. And even on a team of highly competent members, if people aren't at ease being open and transparent, the team's effectiveness can wane. On a related note, psychological safety refers to the belief within a team that it's okay to freely express opinions and ideas without the specter of embarrassment or retribution.


This sense of trust and safety is crucial for nurturing creativity and innovation. Consequently, a lack of trust is evident when teammates hesitate to admit mistakes or seek help or when they speak ill of each other.Leaders play perhaps the most important role in shaping psychological safety in their teams. Personality assessment can give valuable insights into how their own leadership style may be helping or hindering the team's sense of trust and safety:Thinking + judging preferences: While they tend to express ideas clearly and lead decisively, they might overlook the impact of decisions on others and make hasty judgments without involving the team.Thinking + perceiving preferences: While they tend to be open to new information and changing course as needed, they may not consider the impact of their analysis and decisions on the team.Feeling + perceiving preferences: While they tend to seek others' input, they may not consider the value of taking an objective and logical perspective in team decisions.Feeling + judging preferences: They may include team members in decisions, but their tendency to avoid addressing challenging interpersonal issues can lead to detrimental impacts on team trust.As leaders become more self-aware of how their personality and behaviors can build or hinder trust, they can more readily begin to consider biases at play, address vulnerabilities and adapt to team member needs.In summary, to build high-functioning teams, leaders need a thorough understanding of their teammates. However, personal experience alone is insufficient and prone to bias. Moreover, since we don't always wear our cognitive and communication differences on our sleeves, coming into this insight can be a real challenge for leaders.


An assessment-based approach provides an unbiased view of teams that supplements the understanding that leaders can gain from personal experience, allowing leaders to identify team members' diverse needs, inclinations and behavior and thought patterns.Related: Why You Should Care About Psychological Safety in the Workplace

      Key Takeaways    



        Robert Kerbeck began work as a corporate spy to supplement his acting career. 
      


        Ultimately, he went from earning $8 an hour for his services to $2 million per year. 
      


        He says ""most people would be shocked"" to learn how much corporations spend to spy on their rivals. 
      












This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Robert Kerbeck, former corporate spy and author of RUSE: Lying the American Dream from Hollywood to Wall Street. I grew up in Philadelphia, where my family is well-known in the automobile business. To this day, the Kerbeck family is one of the largest Lamborghini, Ferrari and Maserati dealers in the country. As the oldest son, I was supposed to take over the Kerbeck car dealerships, but ironically, the trickery involved with car sales didn't feel right to me.Instead, I moved to New York to become an actor. Of course, actors need survival jobs. But I didn't have the patience to be a waiter, and I wasn't a late-night guy, so bartending was out. Then, one day, a friend mentioned a job he had. But he was very mysterious about it, and as soon as he mentioned it, he shut up as if he'd been told, ""Don't ever tell people about this job."" But I said, ""Come on dude, I'm broke. Help me out. I need a job.""



So, very reluctantly, he set up an interview for me. I traveled to the Upper East Side of Manhattan, arrived at a fancy doorman building and took the elevator to the penthouse. This woman opened the door and ushered me into the nicest apartment I'd ever seen, and I knew immediately that her business was very lucrative.Then, I proceeded to have the strangest interview I've ever had. She didn't tell me one thing about the job, didn't ask me anything about my skills. She just kept asking me about my relationship with my father and how he felt about my not going into the car business. It was all very strange, so I left pretty sure I didn't get the job. Obviously, this is in an era before cell phones, but when I got home, there was a message from my buddy saying, ""You got the job, but don't get too excited because nobody is able to do this job.""


Image Credit: Courtesy of Robert KerbeckNext thing I know, I'm at this building in a very rough neighborhood in Brooklyn to start training. I walk up to the fourth floor. I hear people yelling and screaming, and when I knock on the door, this young woman opens the door and says, ""Come on in; you'll work in my bedroom."" I had no idea what was going on. But I followed her into the bedroom, where there's a desk and a futon on the ground, and she says sit down and begins to explain what we do: We call major Wall Street firms and get people inside these Wall Street firms to tell us things that they should never in a million years tell us.""If I had been selling the information we learned to the Russians or the Chinese, I could have gone to jail for the rest of my life.""The woman who ran the company said she only hired actors because she needed people who could create characters and do voices and accents. Initially, she only hired women for the job because she felt that women made better spies — one of the ploys they'd use would be to act as a beleaguered secretary or assistant because, back in the day, most assistants were female.


As part of our training, we listened to their calls on speakerphone: They'd say, ""My boss is a jerk. My boss is yelling at me because I lost the client proposal; can you read it to me?"" Sometimes, they'd cry on the phone. And the assistant on the other end of the line would immediately divulge the information.My friend and I were the first men the firm hired; we made $8 per hour. Men weren't typically assistants, so we struggled in the beginning. Although the firm mainly focused on Wall Street, one of the first jobs we got involved spying on the defense industry. If I had been selling the information we learned to the Russians or the Chinese, I could have gone to jail for the rest of my life. Instead, we were selling it to that firm's top rivals. It's fascinating how, in America, that kind of capitalism is sort of okay. It's okay if Apple steals something from Google, but God forbid the Chinese government is stealing it from Google.Related: Google's Apple Partnership Under Scrutiny: High-Stakes TrialEssentially, clients want the playbook for your company. They don't want to know some of the information; they want to know all of the information. One thing that's very often undervalued is the organizational chart. Nowadays, there's a lot of information on LinkedIn about who works at a company, but it can't tell you who the rock stars are. We'd go in and find those top performers.


For instance, if it was a sales organization, we would get the sales numbers of your sales team so we know who's number one, who's number two, who's number three. Then we'd learn their salaries, so we could show our client, ""Look, number one and number two earn big salaries, but number three is a 25-year-old who's underpaid right now. They're a future hall-of-famer, but nobody knows it yet."" If you can poach that young, up-and-coming talent — think about how valuable that is.Of course, we also obtained other secrets. What new products is a company working on, and how are they going to price those products? What client relationships do your rivals have? What are those clients paying them? Can you underbid those clients?""When I worked as a spy, I relied on several tactics for a successful ruse.""Being a corporate spy requires a very unusual set of skills. One is the ability to act and improvise. But it also requires a very savvy business sense. You have to understand how businesses work and how to use that to get someone to release sensitive proprietary corporate secrets. That's why it was unique: Most artists don't have a great business skill set, and most business people don't have that flair with language and improvisation.


When I worked as a spy, I relied on several tactics for a successful ruse. First, I did my research so I could pretend to be an executive in another office, perhaps an international office, so that I could adopt an accent. I'd even dig up video clips of the executive speaking on YouTube or LinkedIn to get the accent just right. I always impersonated a real executive so I could assuage the concerns of anyone who might do their due diligence — though, most of the time, the person on the other end of the line accepted what I said at face value.Next, I added the pressure of a time constraint. For example, maybe I'm impersonating a German executive about to meet with European Union regulators to address a complaint that could impact the business; it could stop the business from operating or result in a fine. People who hear ""regulators"" or ""compliance"" don't want to get in trouble, so they're willing to provide the information to avoid that.Related: Goldman Sachs Responds to U.S. Regulators By Hiring HundredsOften, there's a third element to the strategy. We call it FOMO, or ""fear of missing out."" If someone seems suspicious of me and is asking questions, I'll start to validate that. I'll say, ""Hey [their name], you're more on top of it than nine out of 10 employees who give me whatever I want without any difficulty whatsoever. But this is important; we're in a real time crunch. I'm meeting with the regulators, and trust me, [their name], this will be good for you — because now, if you ever need a favor, you call me, and I'll help you with whatever you need. Maybe one day we'll have you come to work as part of compliance because you seem pretty sharp. I'm impressed that you're asking these questions. Good job verifying that I am who I say I am. Well done. Now, let's get back to what I need.""


""I think we're about to learn that some of these ransomware attacks are actually sponsored by rivals of companies.""Most people would be shocked to know how much money corporations spend every day to spy on each other. They ask me, ""Robert, do most firms hire spies?"" And I say, ""No, most firms don't hire spies — all firms hire spies."" They're smart, so they never do it directly. They're hiring spies through intermediaries, typically consulting or executive recruiting firms. That way, if someone gets caught spying, the firm can say they had no idea the consulting firm they'd hired used spies. That's how corporations get away with it: On more than one occasion, I presented stolen data directly to people who now are one step away from being CEOs of two of the largest financial institutions in the world.At the height of my corporate espionage career, I earned $2 million a year. My clients came to me through word-of-mouth, and I'd have people call me up with offers to double my rate. The spying economy was booming then — just as it is now. Consider some of the devastating ransomware attacks we've seen, most recently at MGM. It shut down for 10 days. You couldn't get into your room because your key card didn't work; the slot machines didn't work, and neither did the elevators. People are starting to suspect ransomware gangs, and I think we're about to learn that some of these ransomware attacks are actually sponsored by rivals of companies — because if you can't beat them by hiring better people or improving processes, you can shut them down for days and damage their reputation.Related: Clorox Cyberattack: Operations Disrupted, Financial Impact Looms


My career as a corporate spy ended after the economy crashed in 2008. All commerce stopped on a dime, and companies were no longer hiring spies because they were trying to survive. At that point, I had to get a real job in corporate America. I'd never taken a job in corporate America before, and in some ways, the face-to-face lying seemed worse than what I'd done over the phone. I thought we were all working together on the same team, and I had no idea about the politics and the backstabbing — basically, I ended up the dupe. I thought the company was going to pay me a lot of money to buy my business, but it was all a giant ruse to get information so they could land bigger clients and cut me loose.You have to stay humble because the second you think you've got it covered and have all the answers and are the master, you're ripe for being tricked. Hackers and social engineers constantly refine their techniques, and AI is especially dangerous. Now, you don't need to be a trained actor to put on a convincing accent.Related: 5 Ways to Spot and Avoid Deepfake Phone Scams | EntrepreneurIn the beginning, spying was just a survival job; that's how I rationalized it. It was only later on, when my acting career kind of faded, that I crossed over to the dark side and went deep into corporate espionage. Morally, there are things I did that I wouldn't do today, but I took the journey I wanted to take, and that's what I tell people: ""Take the journey you want to take."" Because we only have one life. Don't take the journey your mom or dad wants you to take. Don't take the journey your partner wants you to take. Don't take the journey your boss wants you to take. Take the journey you want to take.

90,End the Hassle — How to Say Goodbye to Bad Clients,"Nov 8, 2023",Dr. Sabrina Starling,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/stop-the-hassle-how-to-cut-bad-clients/464450,"
Sooner or later, it happens to all of us. We take on a client, and it starts fine, but over time, the interactions become more strained. Communication breaks down. There may be threats of legal action. Now we're totally preoccupied with this problem. Our team is spending countless hours trying to address issues pertaining to this client. We are snapping at our loved ones and mentally checking out as our thoughts become consumed by the challenges at work. Before we know it, we are dealing with a PITA client.PITA stands for ""Pain in the Assets."" These clients are difficult, make unfair demands and consume extraordinary time from you and your team addressing their needs. Because of this, you may be paying more to serve them than the revenue they bring into your business. OUCH!There's a significant impact on your stress level and mental health. When you are preoccupied at home because of problems at work, your loved ones sense it. When you zone out during conversations or are grumpy and easily irritated, the impact of PITA clients is spilling into your personal life. This can damage relationships. Chronic health problems may arise from long-term stress.



Related: Use These 10 Red Flags to Spot a Difficult Client From a Mile AwayWhat makes us vulnerable to PITA clients?The mindset we use when we start our businesses makes us vulnerable to having these problematic clients in our businesses. When we're in the startup phase, we say ""yes"" to every opportunity that comes our way just to get money into the business. We're happy somebody will pay us to do something. We can survive another day and keep going.


That's an effective startup strategy. It is not an effective strategy for the long term. You're opening the floodgates. You will get some good clients, and you will get some bad clients. You also will find yourself delivering products or services that may not be aligned with your sweet spot. That may take a lot of extra work for you to do. Even though money comes into the business, a lot of money could be lost as you deal with PITA clients.People-pleasing is another way to become vulnerable to PITA clients in your business. It's impossible to please everyone. I used to lay awake at 3:00 a.m. replaying conversations and wondering, ""How can I fix this? How can I make this better? How can I make the client like us again?"" That was bad enough when it was just me working in the business. When I added team members and allowed these demanding clients to remain in the business, I let them create stress for my team members.Another vulnerability is a lack of clearly defined standards in the business. If you cannot say, ""This is how we do business..."" you are saying to your clients, ""Hey, however you guys want to do business is fine with me. You guys make the rules.""How to prevent problems with PITA clientsThe best way to prevent problems with difficult clients is to define your immutable laws. These are your core values. These become your standards for doing business. They also become powerful tools for pinpointing your struggles with a particular client. It's quite likely that the client is violating one of your immutable laws. When your immutable laws are identified, it gives you the language to explain why the breakdown occurs.


For example, in my business, we support our clients in creating great places to work. Our clients want to learn leadership skills to attract A-Player team members. We value team members and believe in treating them with respect. When a client revealed they were engaging in shady payroll practices, we discontinued our work with the client and explained the value conflict.Related: 5 Reasons Why Your Business Is Losing CustomersEliminating PITA clients increases your profitThe 80/20 principle is illuminating when we think about the impact of PITA clients on profit. If 80% of our revenue comes from the top 20% of our clients, the inverse is that 80% of clients are responsible for only 20% of our revenue. Typically, PITA clients will be part of that 80% of clients who are not contributing significantly to our revenue. The time, energy and resources used in serving PITA clients take away from our efficiency. It can actually cost us more to serve PITA clients than what they pay us!When you stop serving PITA clients and focus your freed-up time and energy on serving your top clients, you will find additional ways to deliver value to your top clients. You are also likely to find ways to replace lost revenue from PITA clients quickly.


Related: How to Divorce Your Client and Protect Your Own InterestsSteps to eliminating PITA clientsThink of your team and top clients as precious gems to be protected. Put a velvet rope around your business. This velvet rope consists of your immutable laws and the qualities of your top clients. Use this criteria to screen clients. You do not have to say ""yes"" to every client who wants to do business with you. When coaching business owners dealing with PITA clients, I ask them to identify the early ""warning"" signs they detect. Listing these warning signs will help you identify future PITA clients. It's empowering to decline business.One of our clients commented she feels as though she has fallen back in love with her business because it felt so good to turn down work that was not within her sweet spot and to be able to fire clients whom she and her team were unable to serve effectively. Although the loss of income initially was scary, her expenses decreased over the coming months because her team spent less time trying to please perpetually difficult clients. She then used her awareness of what her top clients valued most to attract better clients.It can feel scary to turn away business. Once you do so, you will breathe a sigh of relief as it becomes fun to go to work. After all, you are getting to focus your energy on serving your top clients who appreciate you.

92,3 Leadership Secrets That Lead to Team Empowerment,"Nov 6, 2023",Cheri Beranek,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-simple-ways-to-empower-your-team/464374,"
Empowering a team is essential for driving success, but leaders may be hesitant to delegate authority because they fear the consequences of giving up control. They may worry their team members will make mistakes or decisions not aligned with the overall goals of the organization. Yet empowerment is not about micromanaging or controlling every aspect of a team's work. When supervisors and managers give teams autonomy and trust, they create a positive work environment where individuals feel a sense of ownership and engagement among their peers.The difference between an individual contributor and a supervisor or manager is the ability to maximize the whole. The responsibility of these leaders is to leverage an individual's skills, knowledge, and creativity toward achieving collective goals. Here's how they can start:Related: 4 Leadership Methods for Empowering Employees and Building Strong Teams



1. Provide clear strategic directionThe biggest obstacle to team empowerment is the failure of leaders to enable people to make their own decisions — most often, because they did not provide the strategic blueprint to guide those decisions. Even I can occasionally be guilty of this. When our company hits a point of change, I can be inclined to require the escalation of a decision up to me. Sometimes, that is necessary, but even after making that decision, I still need to remember to let go again and re-establish the blueprint so everyone else will be empowered to make that decision moving forward.At my company today, we talk about how to make decisions as close to the customer as possible so no one has to say, ""I'll have to talk to my manager about that first."" If we deviate from our strategic direction, we must step back and refresh the blueprint.


At one of my previous companies, the product lines were more scripted. People could authorize adjustments depending on their level within the team. We had a distributor level, a reseller level, and an end-user level, each with different pricing. A vice president could go down three levels, a director could go down two levels, and a manager could go down one without authorization.Because it was so defined, individuals were empowered to make a decision without giving away the farm. Establishing control levels like this allows team leaders to provide empowerment without full risk, while maintaining trust in people's capacity to learn on the job.Related: Good Things Happen When You Put Employee Motivation First2. Nurture leadership and compensate risk-takersLeaders and managers can play a big role in fostering the growth of individual contributors who want to develop their careers. In the early days of the organization, as we were figuring out our strategic direction, we kept our structure extremely flat. One individual contributor in the sales department showed interest in learning beyond his position, so I nurtured him into Head of Sales, then Head of Product Management, and now, Chief Operating Officer.


Today, I call him my business partner. It did not happen overnight, but I trusted and empowered him to grow one step at a time into leading the organization.Part of empowering a team is recognizing those capable of working with greater responsibility and those who might not be comfortable with the level of risk involved. It can also mean compensating high-performers at the level of their contribution if they do not want to rise to another level.In my first job with a software company, I worked with a colleague who was a phenomenal technical writer and was comfortable remaining in that role. The head of the department recognized his skill, too, and changed the pay structure so individuals could be paid at a level similar to a manager or above because of the superior level of their work.Apart from those cases, compensation should be commensurate with the risk-taking and responsibility people are willing to accept. Identifying the right team members to empower is doing risk-reward well: It incentivizes people to take ownership of their work and can have a significant impact on the bottom line.


Related: Money Is Nice, But It's Not Enough to Motivate Employees3. Empower small decisions and stay nimbleTo make all these adjustments is like steering the rudder of a sailboat. The more nimbly we can adjust to the input of the wind and waves, the better our chances of getting to the other side of the lake faster than anyone else. But if we try to make huge changes, like a 90-degree turn, the sailboat will go completely off course. Most empowerment success cases are small, individual actions, so we only need to course-correct within a few degrees of our current position.Trusting people to make decisions will always come with risk. We might find ourselves selling a product at a price point far lower than necessary to win a business. Salespeople who decided they did not need a sales or applications engineer to double-check their designs on a training program later met with problems in the field. In these cases, empowering an individual could cost a lot of money.So, the job of managers and supervisors is to minimize the impact of the decisions people might make and learn from them at the next stage. Make sure those problems are visible to others in a way that identifies what went wrong rather than singles out the person who made the decision. When a manager can separate the action from the person, everyone will feel more comfortable learning from mistakes.


The rewards of empowerment outweigh the risksFor empowerment to be effective, managers and supervisors should create an environment where team members feel comfortable and trusted. Data is power. Run analyses to know where the wrong decisions are being made.Either someone needs more training, or they are being asked to decide the wrong level. Identify which is the case and make a plan to solve the problem and keep them empowered. It is worth the investment because empowering teams is not only beneficial for individual growth and development but also contributes to the bottom line of the organization.

In the dynamic landscapes of entrepreneurship, investment and higher education, effective communication is vital. My company, Top Tier Admissions, brings more than 20 years of experience helping students secure places at Ivy League-level schools. As an educator, founder and CEO, I have seen how the art of persuasion and negotiation is most successfully applied in these seemingly disparate realms.Investors are primarily interested in the return on their investment, so it's crucial to understand their preferences, risk tolerance and what excites them about your industry. Colleges, meanwhile, seek students who will contribute to their community and excel academically. Extensive research on the institution's values, programs and culture is therefore vital to tailor an application accordingly.Related: 10 Social Media Tips for Students to Improve Their College Admission ChancesA few additional areas of both similarity and contrast to consider:The personal statement vs. elevator pitchCollege applications require personal essays or statements that showcase a student's intellectual vitality, experiences and academic goals. Much like the elevator pitch, however, this is an opportunity to stand out and make a real impression.



In the entrepreneurial world, the elevator pitch is your first impression — a concise, 30-second overview of your business idea, emphasizing its uniqueness and potential.Distinct life experience vs. unique value propositionCollege applications require a student to convey their distinguishing experiences and perspectives, highlighting what they bring to the campus that sets them apart from other applicants.Similarly, a winning business pitch should articulate a particular solution to a problem, demonstrating why customers choose your product or service over competitors.Self-reflection vs. market researchAcademic institutions demand introspection and self-awareness, so students would be wise to reflect on their personal growth, values and aspirations to provide a compelling narrative.


Entrepreneurs must conduct thorough market research to identify opportunities and assess demand. Investors expect data-driven insights.Extracurricular involvement vs team dynamicsStudent applications include vital sections devoted to extracurricular activities. The right student will showcase leadership, teamwork and authentic civic engagement — reliable indicators of character.Investors, meanwhile, will evaluate the strength of a team and its ability to execute a business plan, focusing particularly on complementary skills and shared vision.Related: Did a Giant Dancing Pineapple Just Jump Into This Meeting? Watch the Season Premiere of 'Elevator Pitch'!


Academic achievements vs. financial projectionsColleges, of course, assess a student's academic record (including standardized test scores) and letters of recommendation to demonstrate an ability to excel in a rigorous learning environment.Investors want to see a clear path to profitability, which includes well-researched financial projections and a sustainable business model.Interview performance vs. pitch deliveryAcademic interviews are an opportunity for a student to showcase potential contributions to and enthusiasm for an institution. Part of that is being prepared to offer thoughtful responses and ask well-researched and insightful questions.Business pitches should be engaging, concise and persuasive, which makes honing them to a fine edge instrumental in capturing an investor's attention.


College selection vs. competitive analysisColleges align with a student's academic and personal goals, and applications should be tailored to each institution to demonstrate genuine interest.Meanwhile, identifying and analyzing competitors is paramount in understanding market positioning. Investors want to know how you'll outperform other players in a sector.Related: Competitive Analysis BasicsWell-roundedness vs. adaptabilityHigher learning institutions tend to value individuals who have depth (not breadth) in a specific academic niche and are versatile and creative as they adapt their interests and talents to particular circumstances.


In the dynamic world of entrepreneurship, adaptability is crucial. Investors want to see that you can pivot and innovate.Campus visits vs. networkingVisiting colleges provides a networking-like feel for campus and culture. Colleges track demonstrated interest, so it's vital — even if students can't visit in person — to show interest in other ways (perhaps virtually).Similarly, building relationships with potential investors is vital, which includes attending networking events, pitch competitions and industry conferences.Related: 2023's Top Colleges for Aspiring Entrepreneurs


Remember that a well-crafted pitch can be a ticket to success, even in sectors as seemingly unrelated as these. While specific requirements and expectations may differ, the underlying principles of knowing an audience, showcasing uniqueness and delivering a compelling narrative remain constant.

95,5 Communication Hacks to Capture Your Gen Z Audience,"Nov 2, 2023",Mohamed Elhawary,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-hacks-to-capture-your-gen-z-audience/464189,"
In today's digital age, Generation Z has emerged as a significant market force with unique communication preferences that challenge traditional advertising strategies. As a member of the older millennial cohort, I've witnessed firsthand the shift in how brands must approach this younger generation.Today, I'm going to uncover practical hacks for engaging Generation Z effectively, ensuring your message not only reaches them but also resonates with their values and expectations.Let's dive in.



Understanding Gen-Z communication preferencesUnderstanding Gen-Z's communication preferences is vital in today's digital world.Born between 1997 and 2012, Gen-Z values authenticity, diversity and social justice, appreciating brands that embody these traits. They use their strong voice to stand up for what they believe in.


Social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat are essential for connecting with Gen-Z, offering the bite-sized content they prefer. These platforms are spaces for them to connect, share and discover trends.Lastly, Gen-Z is drawn to interactive, short-form and visually appealing content.Their short attention span means brands should focus on video content, interactive polls and visual storytelling to capture their attention and encourage engagement.Related: Move Over Millennials — Here's How Gen Alpha's Top Entrepreneurs Are Printing Money


Hack #1: Leveraging social media and short-form contentSocial media platforms, particularly TikTok and Instagram, are hotspots for Generation Z.They spend hours scrolling through short, snappy videos and images that tell a story within seconds. The rise of these platforms has transformed how we need to communicate, especially when engaging Gen-Z.Take Nike, for example. They have mastered the art of short-form content on TikTok, creating videos that not only showcase their products but also encapsulate the brand's ethos, striking a chord with the young audience.Similarly, Chipotle's #GuacDance challenge on TikTok is another fantastic example. It wasn't just about promoting their guacamole; it was about connecting with Gen-Z through humor and dance, all wrapped up in a short video.


When creating content for Gen-Z, here are some tips to consider:Keep it short and sweet: Gen-Z has a short attention span, so get your message across in under 15 seconds.Be authentic: They value transparency. Show the human side of your brand.Encourage participation: Like Chipotle's challenge, engage them in activities.Use humor: A good laugh always works.Stay updated: Gen-Z is always on top of the latest trends. Ensure your content is relevant and up-to-date.By following these tips, you can create content that not only engages Gen-Z but also turns them into brand advocates.Related: 10 'Old School' Employee Expectations That Will Die Out With Gen ZHack #2: Authenticity and transparency in brand communicationContinuing the journey of engaging Gen-Z, let's talk about the pivotal role of authenticity and transparency. This generation demands genuineness from brands, craving realness in every interaction.


Aerie, the lingerie brand, nailed this by embracing a no-retouching policy in their advertisements, portraying real bodies, which resonated strongly with Gen-Z's call for genuine representation.So, how can brands ensure their messaging aligns with Gen-Z's values?Keep it real: Authenticity isn't just a buzzword; it's your brand's personality. Let it shine.Transparent storytelling: Share your brand's journey, including the challenges. It adds a human touch that Gen-Z appreciates.Highlight values: If sustainability is at your core, showcase it. Gen-Z supports brands that reflect their values.Consistent messaging: Ensure your brand message is consistent across all platforms.Engage actively: Use social platforms for real-time engagement with Gen-Z, responding to their queries and joining their conversations.By implementing these practices, brands can build a solid, trustworthy relationship with Gen-Z, ensuring their message not only reaches but also resonates with this audience.Hack #3: Utilizing visual and interactive contentGen-Z has grown up in a world dominated by visuals, and it's no surprise they prefer content that captures their attention immediately.


Nike has achieved this by integrating powerful visual storytelling with relatable stories that speak to Gen-Z's values and interests, effectively building a community around their brand.Here are some strategies to create content that hooks Gen-Z:Innovative Visuals: Use tools like Canva or Adobe Spark to design eye-catching graphics and animations.Interactive Content: Incorporate quizzes, polls and interactive videos that invite participation and increase engagement.Storytelling with Video: Leverage platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels to share short, compelling stories.User-Generated Content: Encourage your audience to create content for your brand, building a sense of community and trust.Inclusive Representation: Showcase diversity in your visuals to create content that is relatable to all.By adopting these strategies, brands can effectively engage Gen-Z through appealing visual content, ensuring their message resonates with this dynamic audience.Related: From Z to Alpha — A Few Tips to Help You Understand the Next Generations of Consumers


Hack #4: Embracing user-generated content and influencer collaborationsUser-generated content (UGC) and influencer collaborations are golden tickets to gaining Gen-Z's trust. UGC, like reviews or testimonials, adds authenticity, showing real people enjoying your product or service.Brands like Gymshark leverage UGC to create a community where users proudly share their workout achievements wearing Gymshark gear.Influencer collaborations expand your reach, especially if the influencer's values align with yours.To incorporate these strategies:


Encourage UGC through hashtags or contests.Collaborate with influencers who resonate with your brand's ethos.Ensure authentic engagement rather than overly promotional content to connect with Gen-Z truly.Hack #5: Direct and instant communicationTo tap into Gen-Z's preference for quick and direct communication, implement chatbots on your website to provide instant answers to common questions. Use direct messages on social platforms to offer personalized responses. Ensure your customer service team is trained to provide swift and helpful replies.By prioritizing these direct communication channels, you're showing Gen-Z that you value their time and are committed to providing them with the seamless experience they desire. This not only enhances their engagement but also builds their trust in your brand.ConclusionIn summary, to effectively engage Gen-Z, leverage social media, authenticity, visual content, user-generated content and instant communication. These strategies are vital for brands looking to connect with this audience.Now is the time to adapt and evolve your communication tactics to meet Gen-Z's unique needs and preferences.

96,Demolish Your Company's Silos to Unlock Organizational Efficiency – Here's How.,"Nov 1, 2023",Francois Lacas,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/demolish-your-companys-silos-to-unlock-organizational/463571,"
Next time you take the train, observe the intricate system that ensures your safe journey. The seamless integration of tracks, looping around obstacles and overlapping at diamond crossings all enable uninterrupted train passage. Occasionally, compartmentalizing those tracks becomes necessary, temporarily separating one train on its own set of rails so it can operate independently without interfering with others in the area. However, no one train can operate effectively in isolation, at least not for long. It requires a constant exchange of information across countless systems to maintain the schedules and track assignments of hundreds of trains across thousands of miles of track. The result: Safe and on-time departures and arrivals without collisions or confusion on the part of operators or passengers.Whether we're talking about systems, individuals, teams, departments or business partners, striking the right balance between compartmentalization and collaboration is crucial to avoid siloed information and inadvertent ""collisions."" While every application or team has its specialty, excessive compartmentalization hinders cross-departmental collaboration, creating a brittle framework akin to disjointed train tracks.Not unlike a lone train on an isolated track, everyone focusing on their own tasks and expertise appears to work initially. Eventually, though, this approach reveals its limitations as projects and decisions of one department ultimately impact another — and a desperate need for cohesion and collaboration. A lone train, after all, is part of a much larger business ecosystem.



Related: How Siloed Data May Limit Your Business Growth (and How to Prevent It)Compartmentalization discourages (and often prevents) collaborationMany businesses have functioned largely under the compartmentalization model due to the lack of resources necessary to nurture dialogue. However, new technology capabilities and a demand for a digital customer experience at each level of the supply chain are transforming work dynamics. Collaboration is now a key differentiator, one that demands free and clear communication and the proper sharing of ""tracks"" (information). These empower and enable not only individual ""trains"" to reach their goals but also the business as a whole. Unless we break down silos, collisions are bound to occur because everyone is working towards their own goals.


Collaboration should be a key consideration of every business app or IT system we create or select, even when its integration into the whole is intended to benefit a specific department. Adding new tools should not overwhelm an organization by requiring every employee to cross-train on every program but rather enable all departments to reach new levels of optimization and visibility. Systems that allow the sharing of projects and data facilitate open dialogue and collaboration between departments and transparency in business goals. Here are several actionable steps to breaking down silos within your own organization to unlock the agility and strength that come from collaborative ecosystems.1. Deployment of the multipurpose, multi-tenant portal platformEnabling and encouraging collaboration among teams and departments isn't only helpful – it is crucial. Eliminating the need to switch between dedicated collaborative tools like Outlook, Teams, or Slack provides a seamless experience within the business apps themselves. A unified, multi-tenant portal should serve as a hub connecting customers, vendors and other business partners. Such a portal allows all these parties to upload, view, approve and process orders and payments. It's a many-to-many relationship, similar to a bustling terminus station, where individuals from anywhere can converge, depart and meet in one central location.2. Automated workflows to encourage visibility and cohesionOperational inefficiencies arise when organizational parts fail to connect, hindering team cohesion, causing costly errors, and reemphasizing the need for continuous alignment and dialogue. Conflicting goals and priorities among team members can lead to individualistic approaches, hindering team cohesion and creating a sense of disconnection. CFOs, in particular, face the challenge of preventing such ""silo consequences."" Luckily, technology can automate a great many workflows as well as reduce errors commonly caused by human oversight. Further, automated workflows support greater visibility across finance, marketing, and sales, allowing CFOs to more quickly assess which tactics (and the associated expenses) produce the most impactful, positive results — and which do not.


3. Centralized platforms that provide targeted training and clear objectivesWhen combined with clear directives, digital tools become catalysts for smooth operations, offering space for high-level thought and collaboration within and between teams. To tackle the issue of conflicting goals, as mentioned earlier, CFOs can introduce a centralized platform on which to align objectives and provide comprehensive (and, in some cases, cross-functional) training. Such technology platforms act as a connector to enable and foster collaboration, which in turn streamlines operations, bridges gaps and drives success organization-wide.4. Collaboration on the inside begets collaboration with those on the outsideInternal collaboration lies at the heart of a successful organization. Yet, it is essential to recognize that the true potential of collaboration extends far beyond these departments or even corporate walls. To achieve long-term resilience, fostering collaborative relationships throughout your entire business ecosystem is paramount: between individual team members, between departments across the organization, and out to your vendors, suppliers, and other partners.Prioritizing people and partnerships is worth the effortBuilding a collaborative ecosystem that prioritizes mutual benefits is like laying down a robust train track system for long-term resilience. By embracing collaboration beyond internal departments, we connect different tracks, tapping into collective strengths and adapting to evolving market demands.Breaking down silos between people, departments, and business partners by insisting on collaboration (as opposed to compartmentalization) doesn't just happen, however. It takes dedication, persistence, and technology that seamlessly enables, facilitates, and encourages sharing, both of personal communications but also the relevant data and insights from other systems. It is the absence of traditional silos that will keep everyone collectively on the tracks and moving forward.

97,3 Mindset Shifts That Will Turn Any Successful Company into a Significant One,"Nov 1, 2023",Scott Snider,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-mindset-shifts-to-change-you-from-successful-to/464035,"
Most entrepreneurs go through their entire business career focused on generating revenue and net profits. In other words, an income-focused mindset. This mindset's elements are things we know well as entrepreneurs and business leaders. These include people and culture, profitable revenue generation, customer retention and relationships and systems and processes, amongst many others. If focused on correctly, these familiar elements will undoubtedly generate profits and, ultimately, a successful company.If you asked a long-time entrepreneur (one that perhaps has owned their company for two decades and has navigated outside factors like a pandemic or a recession, who started their company out of the shed in the backyard or the bedroom in their home) if they thought their company was successful, many would proudly say, ""Yes."" They have built a great company. They have a purposeful product or service. They have great customers and a select few with deep and potentially long-term relationships. They have great people and a great culture; perhaps the owner is even the heartbeat of this culture.Some systems and processes move things along and allow people to operate in the best environment possible. They are proud and feel successful in what they have built. However, when they go to sell this same company, they are metaphorically slapped across the face. Someone has called their baby ugly for the first time in their long, successful history. Their business is not worth what they thought it was, what they need it to be, or worse yet, nothing.



This entrepreneurial mindset of income generation has caught up to them. Though they might have something successful, they do not have something transferrable. A transferrable company is ready and attractive to outside buyers or internal investors. It has a master plan that embraces and aligns with the entrepreneur's business, personal and financial goals. Not just a successful company but a significant one. A significant company is highly valuable, transferrable, ready and attractive in any market and also aligns with the owner's business, personal and financial goals.To go from successful to significant requires critical mindset shifts from income generation to value creation. This value creation mindset has three components. Those shifts are 1) business is personal, 2) exit strategy is a business strategy, and 3) embrace contingency planning.


Related: 8 Mindset Shifts Entrepreneurs Must Make to Achieve Their Ultimate GoalMindset Shift #1 - Business is personalWe have been told the opposite: ""Leave the personal at the front door before you enter your business."" But the fact is that we are one person, especially as an entrepreneur. Many entrepreneurs have been so focused on building their companies that they have spent less time investigating personal plans, purpose and vision for their lives in and outside their companies.A significant company has an alignment between three critical factors called the Three Legs of the Stool — the Business, Personal and Financial aspects we referenced earlier. Imagine a three-legged stool with one of its legs missing. You wouldn't be able to really sit comfortably upright.Now, imagine that one leg of the stool is shorter than the others. The stool would be wobbly at best. Spending equal time on all three legs is critical. To integrate this into our daily lives as entrepreneurs, we must realize we have two concurrent paths. One path is the business. One that we know and love well. The other path is personal, which embraces the personal financial planning we need as entrepreneurs and the personal planning that allows us to find purpose and have a vision for a complete life.


Related: Here's Why Financial Planning is Key To SuccessMindset Shift #2 — Exit strategy is business strategyAs an entrepreneur, your business is likely your largest personal financial asset. Harvesting its value one day is going to be critical. But did you know that as an entrepreneur, you do things daily in your business that eventually affect your exit? Entrepreneurs must shift from income-generating measures to value-creation tactics.Focusing only on income generation does not mean you have a valuable company. Yet you likely have a successful one. But by focusing on value creation, not only do you create more value long term, you create a more efficient and more profitable company today. Value creation measures often improve the four intangible capitals in a business. These are human, structural, social and customer capital. When the intangibles are strengthened, the business has employees who integrate well into your culture and stay long-term, documented process, strong company culture and a loyal customer base. Nearly 80% of your company's value lies within these intangibles. By integrating a value focus into your daily business operations, the organization moves toward best-in-class performance and ultimately becomes a significant company.Related: Five Mindset Hacks To Growing Success


Mindset Shift #3 — Embrace contingency planningAs entrepreneurs, we are not invincible. We are mortal. 50% of the exits in the United States of America today are due to one of the 5Ds: death, divorce, disability, disagreement and distress. These consequences can lead to bankruptcy, layoffs and an unplanned exit as the business is forced to shut down or transfer at a price much less than what the owner wants, needs or even deserves. If not planned for at least in part, these destroyers of companies could kill your company. Knowing they exist and actively planning for them in your strategies protects your largest asset and considers your personal financial and personal goals.By incorporating these three critical mindset shifts into their business, entrepreneurs can take their company from successful to significant. When the owner has a strong team of advisors, employees and leaders that also embrace the value creator mindset, they can reach an entrepreneurial lifestyle aligned and blended with their business, personal and financial goals.

The generational language gap is nothing new — and it's causing some comical misunderstandings in the workplace.Gen Z is amused when their millennial and boomer colleagues use the phrase ""out of pocket"" to signal they'll be stepping away during the work day because it means something entirely different for the younger set, Insider reported.Related: 3 Ways Gen Z CEOs are Crushing Stereotypes | Entrepreneur



What's the disconnect? Gen Z uses ""out of pocket"" to describe something that's ""inappropriate or wild,"" according to a ""cringe quiz"" for Gen-Z office speak fluency published by The Washington Post last year. In the context of the younger generation's definition, people who use the phrase to express they have a dentist appointment are instead suggesting they'll be creating chaos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.The Washington Post's quiz featured other generational communication divides, including the word ""slay"" (which basically translates to doing something really well) and, perhaps unsurprisingly, several emojis that can leave wires crossed.


Gen Z uses the skull emoji to convey they're dying from laughter, the smiley face with a mild grin to show they're not really happy and the painting nails emoji to express a range of meanings — ""sass, pettiness or nonchalant confidence,"" Lieke Verheijen, assistant professor of communication at Radboud University in the Netherlands, told the outlet.Related: 5 Simple Tips for Incorporating Gen Z Into Your WorkplaceEnding a sentence with a period might also be misinterpreted.The period ""has lost its original purpose because rather needing a symbol to indicate the end of a sentence, you can simply hit send on your message,"" Gretchen McCulloch, linguist and author of the book Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language, told NPR — so using it now ""can indicate seriousness or a sense of finality.""

100,Overwhelmed By Too Many Work Notifications? Here's How to Streamline Your Communication Channels,"Oct 9, 2023",Zamir Shukho,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/overwhelmed-by-notifications-heres-how-to-streamline-your/462970,"
In today's digital world, we use many ways to talk to others every single day, whether it comes to work or personal matters. We send emails, chat on messaging apps and use social media. But sometimes, all these messages can get confusing. Learn how to make your communication easier by using different messaging channels for different business purposes.Are emails old-school?No, in fact, email remains the cornerstone of professional communication. Period. Its formal and structured nature makes it ideal for external correspondence, official documentation, and client interactions. Additionally, important emails offer a written record of communication, making it easy to reference past conversations, agreements and decisions. My company keeps all professional communication with partners and portfolio companies within emails. This documentation is crucial for legal, auditing and accountability purposes.We've all been in situations where we've asked someone to ""send something via email to ensure it doesn't get lost."" So, yes, you can easily flag, pin and highlight threads or single conversations and retrieve any information when you need it – email threads allow users to track the history of a conversation, making it easier to follow the evolution of discussions and decisions over time. In terms of security, many email platforms offer robust security features, including encryption, to protect sensitive information. For a company, this is also a crucial aspect.



We all value professional and personal privacy. I love email, and if I see an important email and don't have an opportunity to read it carefully, here is what I do: I open it, read it quickly, then close it and mark it as unread. Sometimes, it is easy to get lost in open emails; in this case, I know I will get back to it when I have dedicated time for it.Related: A Quick Guide to Email Etiquette (Infographic)


LinkedIn: professional networking and personal brandI personally love LinkedIn. It is a premier platform for building and expanding professional networks and connecting with colleagues, peers, clients, industry experts and potential business partners.I have one habit when it comes to this social media – I try to read and respond/react to every message I get, except for obvious scams. I receive many messages on LinkedIn every single day – some of them are work-related (e.g., messages from founders, potential partners, and other players in the innovation ecosystem), while others are more personal and not within the scope of our fund.It's a great place to share best practices, keep up with the latest innovation and venture trends, and stay updated on industry matters.However, when I spot an opportunity or an important issue to discuss, I always transition the communication to email, where I include relevant colleagues in the conversation. It is entirely acceptable to request that your counterpart switch communication to email instead of continuing the conversation via LinkedIn.

It's no wonder its popularity has soared in recent years. In fact, many WhatsApp users switched to Telegram to take advantage of its robust privacy features.Telegram is my personal favorite. We use this platform for all our work-related communication regarding urgent matters and to communicate with our portfolio companies. I have more than 20 chats, each dedicated to a specific subject, with certain people from the company.When we launched our Softlanding program last year, we were deciding how to keep in touch with participants, sending schedules, relevant info and more. We figured out that Telegram is the perfect tool for that because it supports group chats and channels with many participants. On top of everything, Telegram offers cloud-based storage, allowing users to access their messages and files from multiple devices. This feature enhances accessibility and data backup. In our case, it was the most convenient messenger for file sharing and communication.


We also have our open Telegram channel to share news and key insights about venture capital in the USA. Telegram supports various message types, including text, multimedia files, voice messages, and documents. This versatility allows for effective communication and file sharing (e.g.reports, analytics), which is very convenient when you need to transfer something that email storage doesn't support.Related: Privacy Insight: Whatsapp Vs Signal Vs TelegramWhile Telegram has numerous advantages for business communication, organizations need to assess their specific needs, consider security and privacy requirements, and choose communication tools that align with their objectives and industry regulations.Each platform serves specific purposes, whether it's the formality and professionalism of email, the networking power of LinkedIn, or the real-time communication of Telegram and WhatsApp. The key lies in strategically separating and using these channels to tailor your communication to the right audience and context. This approach will help businesses maintain professionalism and streamline internal discussions.

101,Salespeople Have Some of the Highest Turnover Rates — But Here's How You Can Retain Them.,"Oct 9, 2023",Jason Miller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/focus-on-these-3-key-areas-to-keep-your-sales-teams-intact/458652,"
It is impossible to scale a business without a strong sales team. Recruiting top talent is only the first step; you need to give your team members reasons to stay.Salespeople have some of the highest employee churn rates as high as 35%, whereas other employees usually hover around 13%. This means you need to make sure you're vetting right from the get-go during your recruiting phase and making sure your training and retention strategies are valuable to keep your salespeople from leaving.Related: How to Manage a Successful Sales Team



RecruitingIf you want top sales talent, you need to make sure your company stands out. What's your unique proposition? Why should top candidates work for your company over others? Just like you attract the right customers with your unique selling proposition, you need to attract the right job candidates by creating the right atmosphere.Job description


Start off by having a clear job description that's realistic. I recommend including what the exact job requirements are as well as what the ideal candidate would look like. Many times, companies only include hard skills like being able to use certain customer relationship management systems, but it's important to remember that soft skills are just as important — and sometimes even more important. Technical skills can change as the industry changes or technologies advance, but soft skills are specific to the person and can help a person with their adaptability.I would argue communication skills are one of the most important soft skills to look for when hiring for sales. In my company, Strategic Advisor Board (SAB), this is the number one skill I look for. Many skills can be taught but in my personal experience, I've noticed it's a lot easier to teach hard skills to most people over soft skills.Company cultureYou want to make sure your new employee's personality meshes well with other employees' personalities, especially if they'll be working closely together with others in the organization. You'll also want to ensure they have the same values your company does. Consider including your other employees in the job interview process. You might even want to have it as a two-part interview process where they meet with you in the first half, and then the rest of your team in the second half.


Competitive compensation and perksAlthough there can be many different compensation options, offering growth opportunities both financially and position-wise is a great way to set yourself apart from your competitors. I've always been one to believe if you take care of your employees, they will take care of your customers. It's all a cycle and it's important for employees to feel valued.Related: Uncover The Best Kept Secret For Recruiting Elite Sales TalentTrainingYou want to set up your sales team for success, and a huge part of that will be how you train them. When my sales associates are starting out, I'll get them to record their calls so we can look back and see at what point they may have lost the client. I suggest making sure you're going through all aspects of the sales process from prospecting to qualifying questions, nurturing, pitching and objection handling.


Listen more, talk lessTop sales associates only talk 43% of the time in B2B sales, and they allow their prospects the other 57% of the time to talk. This is why getting your sales associates to record their calls is important. Teach your reps to ask open-ended questions to get your prospects talking more. Not only will it allow your reps to understand the prospect's pain points better, but it will also build a better rapport between the two individuals.Focus on solutions and valueMany sales reps miss the mark when it comes to pitching and they tend to focus on the product's features rather than the value provided. After your sales reps have pitched, I recommend getting them to ask prospects why they think this specific solution would help their problem. This way, the prospect is convincing themselves that your product is the correct one for their problem, and they're reiterating the value so your sales reps can make sure they didn't miss any important information when conveying to the clients.


Ask for the saleAbout 63% of sales calls end without the sales rep asking for the close. This is shocking to me as it's something that can be so easily changed. I recommend creating a sales script for your reps that includes a list of vital questions that should be asked on every sales call. This is what we do at my company: Every new sales rep gets put under the training of a senior sales rep and is given a script to follow for prospecting and pitching. Eventually, we encourage our closers to go off script and make it their own once they're more comfortable with the process — but until then, it's important to have a standard practice that everyone follows so no crucial steps are missed.Related: 5 Innovative Ways to Train Your Sales TeamRetentionA huge part of salespeople retention has to do with compensation, positive workplace environments and room for growth. All of that should be addressed during your recruiting and training processes. Something else that needs to be addressed is for management to be understanding of salespeople's plights. Burnout and lack of motivation are two major concerns.


OnboardingIt might be surprising, but it all starts with an efficient onboarding process and setting your new hires up for success. This is the first real impression your new employee will have on your business. Many employers think good first impressions are limited to customer interactions, but it's just as important to focus on your internal team. I'm a big believer that if you take care of your employees, they will take care of your customers. Onboarding also helps stop problems before they start and it helps get your new employee integrated with the rest of the team. It can be overwhelming to be a new staff member and having a comprehensive onboarding process gives them a way to ease into their work, the environment and into meeting the rest of the team.Give and get consistent feedbackAsk consistently if your salespeople have everything they need to do their job in the best way possible and if they have something in mind that would improve their roles, such as new software, hardware or equipment. It should also be a two-way conversation and not a one-sided review. You should always get your sales team to record their phone/video calls so you can review them together. Don't review it on your own and send them feedback; watch it together to give live feedback and let them ask questions as you go along. Also, get your sales leaders to share their own personal stories and problems and how they overcame them. It helps build rapport and a connection when you can share specific, personal examples.


Be understandingThis type of understanding needs to come from the top. Train your managers on how to motivate your sales reps. Keep in mind that everyone has different motivations but the most common ones include wanting to move up in the organization and having a work-life balance. A total of 89% of sellers experience burnout from their sales work.With that number being so high, it's no wonder work-life balance is important. Sales require a vast array of skills and require your sales reps to be mentally tuned in and on much of the time. Along with hearing ""no"" a lot or having a dry sales streak, this can be demotivating. Find what works specifically to motivate your individual reps, be there to support them and make sure they understand they're not alone.Related: 3 Ways to Retain and Motivate Your Top Salespeople


Final thoughtsTo have a strong sales team, you need to start by recruiting the best talent. Recruitment includes starting with a clear job description, having a positive company culture and creating a unique proposition with salaries and perks. Next, you need to make sure your training is setting them up for success. It should include topics such as making sure they listen to your customers, focusing on solving problems during the pitch and asking for the sale.Lastly, in order to have high retention rates, focus on going back to the beginning with the onboarding process to make sure you set expectations and stop problems before they happen. Make sure you give and get consistent feedback and understand what motivates your employees in order to stop burnout. Give your sales team a reason to want to invest their time and skills in your business by doing the same for them.

102,Is Someone Using Subtle Power Moves on You? Here's What You Need to Know — and How to Regain Equal Footing.,"Oct 9, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/dont-fall-for-subtle-power-moves-heres-how-to-regain/462346,"
Power imbalances are everywhere, and they can show up in subtle ways, even during simple, initial interactions. Ever had someone say ""it's nice to see you"" at a first meeting, then repeat your name ad nauseam? The person could be attempting to build rapport, or they might just be deploying tactics they've gleaned from leadership literature.Sure, some leadership advice can be helpful (most people do appreciate eye contact and a smile). Still, it can also be shallow, unnatural and, ultimately, detrimental — for example, the oft-repeated suggestion to turn up the volume to seem more commanding. Part of the problem? Management books and commentaries often oversimplify and rarely offer useful guidance about the skills and behavior required to get things done, according to McKinsey & Company.Subtle power moves, whether off the cuff or calculated, have the potential to throw their recipient for a loop, effectively giving the person using them the upper hand. Sometimes, it can be challenging to determine another person's intentions, especially if you're not well-acquainted with them. But when it comes to power imbalances, impact just might be more important than intent: If you feel like your power is slipping away, it probably is.

103,Motivation is the Secret to a Successful Team — Are Your Employees Motivated? 4 Tips for Empowering New Hires,"Oct 4, 2023",Greg Waisman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/are-your-employees-motivated-4-tips-for-empowering-new/459414,"
Workers burning out from stress and quitting their jobs is a prevalent problem for companies worldwide. A workplace study conducted in 2023 revealed that 44% of surveyed employees suffer from a lot of stress issues, resulting in either quitting altogether or staying and doing the absolute minimum while losing most of their motivation.For companies to retain and bolster their talents, leadership must engage with their workers and encourage them, pushing them towards greater accomplishments.Being a business founder myself, I am responsible for employee communication, onboarding new people, and maintaining team cohesion at my company. In this article, I would like to draw on past experiences and share some principles that I believe to be paramount to empowering your team toward success.



1. Onboarding is the starting point where your employee should see transparencyNew employees are the lifeblood of any company, which is why it is crucial to conduct the hiring process with due care. Effective onboarding programs go beyond just providing basic orientation and paperwork completion. You must cultivate a welcoming environment that instills confidence and that new workers can connect.This also means being 100% transparent about your company's goals and corporate culture and familiarising newcomers with your values, policies, and procedures. In doing so, you allow employees to clearly understand what your company is all about and whether they wish to be a part of what it does.


For example, my company has an established practice of giving new candidates introductory meetups with our founders. We call it ""company pitching"". Once a group of potential hires is formed, one of the founders meets with them to discuss the company and its ideas. This is a great form of interaction, as it encourages discussion, allows us to showcase our best selling points to new people, and motivates them to contribute from the get-go.Another important thing is to have regular meetings and monthly briefing sessions during which your team can discuss all relevant updates. This is crucial to ensure everyone is on the same page about where your company is going.Related: 6 Communication Tips to Strengthen Your Company's Culture2. Maintain communication between employees and company leadershipAnother big thing to pay attention to is keeping open channels of communication between regular workers and company management. This is a fundamental step in fostering a sense of belonging to an organization.


When employees feel that they can reach out to the management just as easily as a fellow regular worker and be heard, they feel more valued as individuals. People love honesty, and having ways to share things that are important to them openly goes a long way in bringing teams closer.This sense of closeness, in turn, means that people often better understand the bigger picture and can better align their individual efforts with the company's goals. They are also more willing to speak up and share ideas during meetings when they feel their thoughts would be genuinely considered.Here's another personal example: at my workplace, we do not have separate rooms or cubicles that separate employees from the management. We all work from an open and shared space, allowing team members to easily come up to each other and speak about anything on their minds. In addition to the collaborative workspace, all our team members and founders have the same working equipment, hotels and flight class. We think it's important for everyone to be on equal ground.All of this helps foster trust and the mentality of unity, shortening the metaphorical distance between team members. And being responsible for the company's ideology, me and my fellow founders strive to follow these principles even more so than most of our employees.


Related: 3 Communication Strategies for Entrepreneurs Wanting To Improve Their Teams3. Showcase the value of what your employees are doingOne more useful tip to drive your workers is to clearly show them that the work they do for the company has value and that they stand to gain plenty of benefits themselves.What can an employee get besides the usual salary and experience from their company? Some businesses choose to introduce the practice of on-the-job training, providing educational opportunities that stand to benefit both the company at large and individual workers.4. Set challenges and create a competitive spiritPeople are often motivated by a challenge more than by receiving a salary, simple as it is. If you want to push your team to greater heights, create a competitive spirit in your company while fostering collaboration.


This might sound a bit contradictory, but hear me out. What I mean is that instead of pitting your employees against each other, you'd be better served to cultivate competitiveness against some other company operating in the same market. This would give them a unified goal to work towards.Start by clearly articulating the strengths and unique selling points of your team. Emphasize how these traits differentiate your company from competitors and build confidence among your workers. Set up milestones that would signify that you've surpassed the other company in some way.These milestones will foster an environment that encourages continuous self-improvement and learning among the team while clearing them will result in celebrating mutual successes and gaining motivational boosts.Read More: Why Empathy is Crucial to Your Success in the Business World


People are the cornerstone of your organization: make sure they know itTo sum up, if you want to keep your employees motivated and prevent your workforce from quitting, the most important thing you can do is make them feel valued. And the best way to do so is to foster a culture that combines individual excellence and collaborative success. Make your team believe that working at your company allows them to be part of something valuable. Doing so will bring people closer and push your company to new heights.

104,Want to Sound Smarter? This Stanford Professor's Simple 3-Point Technique Will Help,"Sep 28, 2023",Matt Abrahams,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/sound-smarter-with-this-stanford-professors-simple-3-point/458398,"
What would you do if you had to jump in unexpectedly and give a presentation with only a few minutes' notice?Sarah Zeitler, marketing manager at a publicly traded manufacturing conglomerate, found herself in exactly this situation. She'd organized a videoconference for 200 people — and when one of her speakers didn't show up, she had to fill that slot herself. How? ""I took a deep breath,"" she says, and then she deployed a structure that I taught her. It's called ""What - So What - Now What.""We all, in some way, need to speak spontaneously — whether it's like Sarah in that meeting, or just when a conversation takes an unexpected turn. And strange as it sounds, you can prepare for spontaneity — not by pre-scripting an interaction, but simply by creating some boundaries and habits that increase your chance of success. One of the most important steps is to think about structure and how to design your messages, which is exactly what Sarah did.

Image Credit: Peter ReynoldsI'll get back to the ""What - So What - Now What"" structure in a moment, but let's first focus on why structure is so important in the first place.Today I'm a lecturer of strategic communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and author of the new book Think Faster, Talk Smarter. But I first learned the value of structure as a student when I worked as a campus tour guide. My bosses trained me to set expectations and to provide visitors with a clear path or direction. When I started my tours, I didn't simply say, ""Hi, I'm Matt. Let's go,"" and start sharing whatever information struck my fancy. Rather, I started our discussion by outlining for visitors a sense of where we would go, and by extension, where we wouldn't be going. In the process, I answered common questions, such as how long the tour is and whether we'd take any breaks.By sketching out a basic road map at the outset and then executing on it, I gave myself clear direction for the tour and also made it easier for visitors to relax, pay attention, and absorb what I was saying. If visitors hadn't known what to expect, a little voice in their minds might have continued to wonder about what they would later experience.When conveying our ideas to others in a wide variety of contexts, we do so much better if we follow a road map or structure and articulate it in some way at the outset. Just like on a tour, this alerts our audience members in advance to what is coming. Think back to the last time you listened to someone ramble when they spoke or meander when they wrote. How did it feel? Were you engaged? Was their message clear? Or did you quickly lose patience, get distracted, or tune out?


Related: Successful People Have 2 Types of Goals, a Stanford-Trained Mindset Expert Says. Without Both, You Won't Reach Your Potential.When I mention structure to clients and audience members, some of them confuse it with a mere listing of information. They think that if they organize what they want to say into a series of bullet points or slides, they have a structure.Don't get me wrong: Lists can be a wonderful thing…at the grocery store. But lists won't help us respond better and deliver more compelling messages.A structure as I define it is a narrative or story that logically connects ideas with one another, organizing them into a beginning, middle, and end. ""What – So What – Now What"" is one such structure — and it's my favorite, on account of its simplicity and versatility. You start by discussing an idea, topic, product, service, or argument (What). Then you explain why it's important, helpful, or useful (So What). You end with what your audience should do from here with this knowledge, including how they might apply it or what actions they should take (Now What).


Here are a few other structures:1. Problem > Solution > Benefit You evoke an issue, offer a solution, and end by discussing the benefit that your solution will confer.2. Point > Reason > Example > Point You make a point, give the rationale behind it, offer some illustrations, and wrap up by returning to the point.3. Comparison > Contrast > ConclusionYou make a comparison, begin by reflecting on the similarities, then the differences, and wrap up by coming to a conclusion.4. Situation > Task > Action > Result


You describe an event that transpired or evoke a situation, then discuss the challenge in front of you and what you did to address it, and end with a discussion of the results you obtained.As a speaker and speaking coach, I've found that structuring my presentation affords at least four benefits.First, as I've suggested, arranging information as a logical story helps keep our audience's attention and interest. Beyond previewing where content is going, a story structure has built into it the ability to make connections or transitions between ideas. ""There's something propelling a story,"" historian of education David Labaree says. ""It's more of an intellectual struggle to simply follow a logical argument. But if you can weave [information] together into something that feels like a story, then you're more likely to be able to draw people in.""Related: 3 Tips on How You Can Stop Using Meaningless Buzzwords


Second, structure helps both us and our audience to remember important messages. We humans are miserable at remembering information. Our brains are designed to forget much of what we experience, but they're also designed to seek out, enjoy, create, and remember narratives. By structuring our communication as a logical sequence with a beginning, middle, and end, we prime our messages to be noticed and retained, both by us and our audiences. One study of students giving in-class presentations found that only a few told stories, but that their peers found these stories far more memorable than statistics. Queried afterward, 63% of students reported recalling stories from the presentations while only 5% recalled data points.Third, structure makes processing information easier. In part, this is because we explicitly signal the structure to readers and help them orient themselves as they receive information. Research in cognitive neuroscience supports this. Scholars like to talk about ""processing fluency"" — how easily and smoothly information gets encoded in our brains. It takes a certain amount of effort for our brains to process random collections of information, but a structure boosts processing fluency because we don't have to work as hard to make sense of individual pieces of information.And fourth, structure improves our own thinking.You might presume a disciplined structure makes our job as speakers more difficult. Quite the contrary. In spontaneous situations, we have two big problems we must solve: what to say and how to say it. Having a structure solves the ""how to say it"" part, while also influencing ""what to say."" When we're telling a story with a logic embedded in it, we know at every point where we've been and where we're going. That frees us to spend more mental energy thinking about the actual content we seek to deliver.


In short, structure gives us confidence. We don't have to clench our fists silently wondering if we'll come up with something to say after we finish our current thought — and our audience doesn't have to wonder where we're going, or whether we're respecting their time. We have a road map, and we're all on it together, from beginning to middle to end.Related: 18 Ways to Showcase Your Intelligence Copyright © 2023 by Matthew Abrahams LLC.

It can be tough if you're offered a promotion without a raise. The upside of a promotion is that new opportunities can arise, increased responsibilities can be assumed, and job satisfaction can be improved. Alternatively, a lack of a pay raise can signal that you aren't being fairly compensated.So why would a company offer you a promotion without raising your salary? There may be valid reasons for them to do so. There may be no budget available for an employer to increase the salary of an employee. Rather than not offering a raise to a hardworking employee, companies may offer promotions without raises. Clearly, the company is trying to show that it appreciates and recognizes you by making this offer.Related: 5 Tips for Practicing Self-promotion Without Being Totally Annoying

106,5 Ways Entrepreneurs Can Boost Their Visibility with Affiliate Marketing,"Sep 21, 2023",Ksana Liapkova,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-ways-entrepreneurs-can-boost-their-visibility-with/458481,"
Whether a company is in the early stages of its development or has a long history, online visibility is key to maintaining engagement with current and potential customers. Partner marketing plays a crucial role — not only because of transparent ways to measure the ROI and awareness but also because of its cost efficiency.Customers' trust in your brand is today's most efficient currency, which cannot be achieved only through traditional channels and marketing campaigns. Customers' decisions to choose one product over another are largely influenced by the authenticity of messaging and associated products – and here, content still remains king.Our own research based on the companies' dataset (these calculations were made based on an internal dataset of 6.2 million marketplace orders in the U.S. Jan-Jun'23) shows that content platforms count for more than 25% of sales leads alone in the U.S., followed by affiliate stores 18.5% of sales, coupon services (12%), cashback services (8%), and social networks (more than 7%) at attracting sales for American marketplaces.



In what ways can affiliate marketing boost the visibility of a brand? Keeping great awareness within your community and growing your customer base is easy with these five simple steps.Related: 7 Strategies for Entrepreneurs in Partner and Affiliate Marketing


1. Your audience is online 24/7 and not only in one placeBy using all available platforms, the brand's message and proposition can be reached more effectively than if it focuses on just one. Affiliate marketing allows a brand to appear on almost all existing types of content sites and platforms.For instance, according to ConvertSocial data, more than 25% of U.S. beauty industry orders are attracted by partners by purchasing traffic in various advertising networks — Google, Facebook and Instagram. The share of content platforms is also high here — they account for more than 30% of all beauty purchases.A brand would find it extremely difficult to set up work with all possible traffic channels outside of the affiliate marketing model. This would require huge resources and put the budget at risk when testing new sites. The affiliate program allows the brand to get the maximum audience coverage, even from those sources that the brand is not yet ready to master on its own — and at the same time, pay only for targeted actions.Related: 3 Effective Strategies to Reach Your Online Target Audience This Year


2. Make content creators your partners in affiliate marketingContent creators are eager to monetize their traffic, so working with brands directly is crucial. Content creators involved in affiliate marketing do not face the strict constraints of advertising contracts, making it a perfect vehicle for such collaborations. This means that information about the product or brand can be presented in the most native and creative format. Also, the brand can subsequently give unique conditions to the most effective partners, conduct unique campaigns with them and make them brand ambassadors, further strengthening the connection with their audience.When brands want high-quality, customized content and propose an affiliate compensation model, creators actually take it as a sign that a brand is willing to invest in a real partnership. The key here is to make posts from affiliates more personal and more transactional at the same time. Remember: consumers are wary of this content; they want quality posts, not sales pitches or ads.Related: 5 Things You Should Know Before Collaborating With An Influencer3. Event marketing-based campaigns are highly effectiveAffiliate marketing provides an opportunity to attract not only sales but it can also work with unique brand events. A concert by the U.S. rapper Travis Scott was held right in the middle of a Fortnite game. A partner platform, Mitgame, along with Fortnite's marketing team and other affiliate organizations and partners, attracted players who could listen to the concert right there — which boosted brand awareness of the game enormously, thanks to good timing and a choice of appealing content.


More than 10 million people attended the virtual event, making it Fortnite's largest-ever event, with multiple shows, a very elaborate performance and a captive audience — and this can surely be topped in the future.4. Think ROI and apply different compensation modelsPerformance marketing is viewed as a solution where advertisers only pay for results, but it's still important to consider ROI. To put it another way, consider maximizing the return on your advertising investment. You must choose the appropriate affiliate in addition to the appropriate compensation plan. CPC can be a fascinating form of payment if one of your goals is to increase your online visibility. The CPL (Cost per Lead) is typically used for setting appointments or obtaining more email contacts, whereas the CPS (Cost per Sale) is more pertinent with the goal of increasing sales.If you'd like, you can also combine various payment models. By temporarily raising the commissions, many advertisers animate their affiliate programs and challenge their affiliate partners during the highlights of their commercials. In any case, your desire to build awareness for your brand shouldn't stop you from regularly reviewing the results of your campaigns to ensure that your investment is worthwhile.Related: 3 Tips to Get Started with Affiliate Marketing


5. Consult a specialized affiliate platform for assistanceAs you can see, affiliation can be very time-consuming despite being fascinating and extremely profitable. It can be challenging to navigate between the search for affiliates, the creation of content, the animation of your programs, the follow-up of the results obtained and the potentially associated optimization.Your affiliate account manager will oversee and optimize your program and will be available to give you advice and respond to your questions. In this situation, you can entrust the management of your affiliation campaign to an affiliation platform.

107,7 Keys to Achieving a Balanced Recruitment Strategy,"Sep 20, 2023",Pedro A. Barboglio Murra,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/7-keys-to-achieving-a-balanced-recruitment-strategy/458226,"
Imagine building a team like crafting a masterpiece; every hire adds a unique touch, and recruitment stands as a pillar that determines the future trajectory of a company.The debate between prioritizing skills or cultural fit has been longstanding, with both having their merits. But how did we arrive at this crossroad, and how do businesses navigate this complex decision-making process?The indispensable nature of skillsProductivity relies heavily on abilities, which determine an employee's capacity to perform assignments and add value to the organization's development. It is crucial to differentiate between ""soft skills,"" encompassing qualities like effective communication and collaboration, and ""hard skills,"" referring to specialized proficiencies required for a specific job. Within industries such as finance, healthcare and engineering, certain technical abilities, like a software developer's expertise in a specific programming language, are indispensable.



Cultural fitWhile skills are tangible, cultural fit is more nebulous. It's about how an individual aligns with the company's ethos, values and work environment. An employee might be highly skilled but might struggle in a company if their personal values clash with the company's culture.An individual used to a hierarchical work environment might find it challenging in a flat organizational structure. Furthermore, companies with strong cultures often report higher employee satisfaction and lower turnover rates, emphasizing the importance of cultural fit.


Related: Are You Hiring a Cultural Fit? Do You Actually Want To?Challenges in prioritizing one over the otherWhen companies overly prioritize skills, they might end up with a technically proficient workforce that lacks cohesion. On the other hand, focusing too much on cultural fit might lead to a harmonious but potentially less skilled team.This balance is especially tricky for startups, where every hire plays a pivotal role in shaping the company's future. There's also the risk of creating an echo chamber if cultural fit is overemphasized, potentially stifling innovation.The global shift: Offshoring, nearshoring and the cultural quandaryThe globalization of the corporate world has added another layer to the recruitment puzzle. With companies increasingly looking beyond borders to hire talent, the cultural fit becomes even more crucial. Factors like communication styles, holiday schedules and even daily work routines come into play.


For instance, a company in the US might find it beneficial to offshore to India or the Philippines to get a friendly budget, but they'd have to consider the cultural nuances that come with it.Here are seven tips for achieving a balanced recruitment strategy.1. Define what ""cultural fit"" means for your companyAs a first step in recruiting, you should clarify what ""cultural fit"" within your organization means. To achieve this, you need to go deeper than just listing core values; you also need to identify the behaviors, attitudes and work styles most aligned with your company's mission and objectives. Prepare a comprehensive list that can guide the recruitment process by collaborating with team leaders and even existing employees.Related: How to Develop a Company Vision and Values That Employees Buy Into


2. Use behavioral interviewsCandidates are asked to describe past experiences and actions during behavioral interviews, emphasizing past experiences and actions rather than hypothetical scenarios. Besides assessing their technical abilities, you can also gain valuable insight into their problem-solving skills, adaptability and how they handle workplace challenges, all of which are essential for cultural fit.3. Implement skill and personality assessmentsAn objective measure of a candidate's hard and soft skills, as well as their personality traits, can be achieved through standardized tests. For example, aptitude tests can help you determine a candidate's job-related skills, while personality tests can reveal their interpersonal skills and cultural fit. If you combine these assessments, you can get a clearer picture of a candidate's suitability.Related: 5 Reasons Why Personality Assessments Can't Predict High Performance4. Involve team members in the interview processWhen existing team members participate in the interview process, they can provide multiple perspectives on candidates' suitability. Insights into how a candidate's skills would complement those of the existing team can often be provided by team members as to whether they would fit well within the existing team dynamics.


5. Consider trial periodsA short-term contract or probationary period can serve as a ""test drive"" for both the employer and the candidate. During this time, you can assess how well the new hire's skills and personality fit within the company culture and how effectively they contribute to team objectives. This allows both parties to evaluate the working relationship and make informed decisions about long-term fit.6. Continuously review and adaptThe ideal balance between skills and cultural fit can change as your company evolves, enters new markets or adopts new technologies. To ensure that your recruitment strategies align with your organization's current needs and goals, reviewing them and adjusting them regularly is crucial.7. Be mindful of cultural differences in global recruitmentWhen hiring talent from different countries, it's crucial to consider the cultural implications. While offshoring or nearshoring can offer cost benefits and access to a broader talent pool, it also introduces challenges related to cultural fit. For instance, communication styles, work ethics, and even holiday schedules can differ significantly from one country to another. Therefore, conducting a thorough cultural assessment and skill evaluation is essential when recruiting internationally. This could involve understanding local customs, work ethics and legal requirements. Companies can also consider cultural assimilation programs to help new hires integrate more seamlessly into the existing work environment.ConclusionGetting the balance between skills and cultural fit right is more art than science. In order to succeed, a candidate must be considered not only for their technical abilities but also for their ability to fit within the organizational culture. Implementing a balanced recruitment strategy incorporating both these elements can lead to teams that are not only skilled but also harmonious, leading to greater productivity, job satisfaction, and long-term success.

108,4 Ways to Avoid Holiday Staffing Blunders,"Sep 18, 2023",Daniel Altman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-ways-to-avoid-holiday-staffing-blunders/456918,"
The fall and winter holidays are some of the busiest times of the year for businesses, both in services and the supply chain. In 2022, lots of businesses found themselves with either too few or too many workers during the last months of the year. This time around, the smartest business leaders will avoid a staffing mismatch with a more strategic approach.Last year, it was almost inevitable that some employers would find themselves short or overstaffed. Demand for goods — particularly those delivered to and consumed in the home — had skyrocketed in the early years of the Covid-19 pandemic. Businesses throughout the supply chain, from manufacturers all the way through retailers, struggled to bring hiring up to pace with demand. But then the bottom fell out; starting in the spring of 2022, demand for goods stalled and demand for services boomed.As a result, big inventories built up throughout the supply chain, and some companies found themselves with more workers than they needed when the holidays rolled around. A lot of them decided to hold onto these people, even if there was less work for them to do, and wait for demand to return. The thinking here was that letting them go and then trying to rehire them would be more difficult and costly than just keeping them on the payroll — but this still meant resources sitting idle.



The situation was the opposite in services. The big surge in spending that started last spring took plenty of businesses by surprise, so they raced to hire more workers. Yet this was far from easy since employment levels in leisure and hospitality were still well short of their pre-pandemic trend. Average wages, which had already risen by about 17% since the pandemic began, climbed by another 5% to lure people back to the sector. The gap started to close — but not before as many as a quarter of businesses had to forego at least 10% of revenue for lack of staff.Related: 5 Tips to Ace the Busy Holiday Season With Flexible Work


Normal service is set to resume, but when?This year's holiday trends will probably be easier to anticipate for companies across the economy since the balance of spending on goods and services will look more like it did before the pandemic. But there are still risks to the upside and downside for demand, including whether the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates or allow the economy to resume its boom. A few months ago, retailers were expecting a muted holiday season. Now, growing optimism among consumers may lead to higher spending.This continuing uncertainty means that agility in staffing will be at a premium. So what can businesses do to prepare?Figure out what can't and won't change. Some contracts for the holiday season will need to be fulfilled regardless of the latest economic news. Their labor requirements won't change, so that labor can be set aside when deciding how much payrolls might grow or shrink when other sources of demand fluctuate.Find out who can do what. The simplest way to react to changes in demand is by adjusting the hours of existing employees. But first, it's important to know what workers are willing to do. Are some workers ready to accept fewer hours, perhaps in exchange for a more flexible schedule? Are others, including part-time workers, willing to do more? It's especially crucial to know these things during the holiday season when more workers are likely to have personal obligations and travel plans. Having a clear idea of the payroll's capacity to flex up or down on short notice will decrease reaction times while aligning expectations about what might happen will keep more employees happy.Line up your options in advance. If you think you might need to bring in temporary or flexible workers — either to deal with extra demand or to stand in for permanent employees — then build the necessary processes and relationships now. Negotiating labor supply contracts with temp agencies can take time, and things tend to move more slowly during the holiday season. Alternatives include online labor market platforms. Even though businesses can sign up and start looking for workers anytime, it still pays to build a roster of trusted professionals. Bringing in workers for training or practice shifts now will help to assemble a deep bench of people who already know the business and can jump in on short notice.Think about the future when reacting to the present. Changes in payrolls bring new people into the organization, and businesses may want to keep some of them in the New Year. After all, businesses will always have turnover, no matter what the economy is doing. So what looks like a short-term assignment need not always be one. Treating workers with equal dignity and offering a path to a closer relationship can unlock the best of their abilities, not to mention loyalty.Related: How to Scale Up Your Holiday Workforce the Right WayNot everyone who works during the holiday season will end up as a permanent hire — and it's hard to tell right away who will — but it's worth leaving the option open by laying a strong foundation for the relationship. And that's equally true for businesses that are just hoping to bring the same people back for the next holiday season. Trying not to cancel shifts at the last minute, being respectful of time spent with family and letting everyone participate in a little holiday fun at work, no matter their tenure, are good places to start.

109,Do You Talk Too Much? You Need Brevity — Here are 6 Communication Strategies to Avoid Over-Talking,"Sep 14, 2023",Roxanne Klein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/do-you-talk-too-much-here-are-6-communication-strategies/458097,"
Effective communication is essential to business success. As a business owner, your ability to convey your thoughts clearly and concisely can make or break deals, collaborations and relationships. One common pitfall many fall into is ""nibbling"" — the habit of over-explaining, asking unnecessary questions and failing to get to the point quickly.I have nibbling tendencies. If you do as well, this article will explore strategies to help you avoid nibbling and become a more efficient and respected communicator.Related: How Talking Too Much in Class Turned Into My Greatest Asset



The power of brevityImagine this scenario: You're meeting with potential investors eager to present your groundbreaking business idea. However, instead of diving into the core of your proposal, you spend the first fifteen minutes sharing unnecessary details about the origins of your company. This is a classic example of nibbling, veering off track and failing to reach the point.For most entrepreneurs, time is money. When you ramble about details that do not pertain to the subject matter, you take precious time away from others. Remember to present your ideas, comments, or concerns concisely.

Prepare for in-person or over-the-phone communicationBefore in-person or over-the-phone communications, write down the main points you want to convey. If you are chairing a meeting, always have an agenda. If it is not a formal meeting, but you still have several items to discuss, I always recommend writing down your main discussion topics before approaching the person you will be communicating with.By doing so, you will help yourself stay on track. If you need to tell a back story to get your point across, comment that the back story is necessary in advance to the person or group you are speaking with. That way, whomever you communicate with will understand that you share critical information. I recommend scheduling calendar time before meetings to plan your agenda and the items you need to discuss.2. Choose your questions carefullyA nibbler's common habit is to ask a question differently to achieve a different answer. Although this tactic can be effective in sales, if your goal is not to sell but to communicate, you need to accept the responses you receive from others. Additionally, if you have already decided on something, it is not a good idea to ask others the question to try to validate your own decision. You are not only wasting the time of your colleagues but also damaging trust and credibility.


3. Try to answer your own questionsLet's say you have an issue with your computer, and a person in your office is good with technology. Try to find out the answer first online before asking for help. This approach demonstrates to others that you only ask questions when necessary.Related: How to Ask the Right Question in the Right Way4. Be a patient listenerEffective communication is a two-way street. Allowing your counterpart to respond is vital. Never interrupt someone mid-answer with more questions. It disrupts the flow and conveys that you're more interested in your agenda than their input.Let the other person fully answer when you ask a question before moving on to the next question. Doing so shows your respect for their perspective and encourages more comprehensive responses. Remember, conversations are about building connections and furthering relationships

Although it can be tempting to go into someone's office and ask a question you feel is vital, remember to respect your colleagues' space. No one likes to be interrupted, especially for matters that are not urgent. If you do not need an answer at a particular moment, always use email. Plus, having the dialogue in email makes it easy for you to review in the future.You are more likely to get to the point immediately and include only the necessary details in emails. Emails discourage on-the-fly nibbling during impromptu conversations, as you've already collected your thoughts in written form.Of course, there are situations where an immediate response is critical, and in those cases, a phone call or face-to-face conversation may be warranted. However, by embracing email efficiency, you reduce the likelihood of falling into the trap of unnecessary nibbling during impromptu interactions.


Related: The Do's and Don'ts of Email Etiquette6. Shift in mindsetA conscious awareness of your communication patterns can be an excellent first step to breaking free from the nibbling habit. Always strive for clarity, respect, and efficiency. Being a non-nibbler isn't about rushing through conversations. It is about delivering your message effectively, asking purposeful questions, and genuinely engaging with others. By honing these skills, you'll save valuable time, build stronger connections, and leave a lasting impression as a business owner who values meaningful dialogue.Nibbling is a tendency I believe I have always had. Until about five years ago, when my managing broker mentioned that I was a nibbler, I had no idea I was one. I think it is easy for anyone to either be a nibbler or become one. However, if you plan ahead, remember to be respectful of other's time, and be aware if you are a nibbler, your nibbling tendencies can either disappear or significantly decrease.
