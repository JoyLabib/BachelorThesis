0,You Won't Be a Successful Entrepreneur Until You Adopt These 3 Habits,"Apr 22, 2024",Kelly Hyman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/you-wont-be-successful-until-you-adopt-these-3-habits/472615,"
Contrary to popular belief, reaching professional goals doesn't always have to equate to revenue. Although money makes a difference when growing your brand and solidifying your place as a successful entrepreneur, make sure you're investing in yourself in other ways as part of a long-term strategy.Sometimes, that means creating (and sticking to) healthy daily habits. In other instances, it may mean a small monetary investment for a bigger payoff down the road. Wherever you are in your entrepreneurial journey, there are ways to step out of a scarcity mindset and seek affordable ways to push yourself to the next level.Investing in yourself doesn't have to be expensive. You may soon find that all the ways you invest in yourself help you reach your revenue goals faster than you think. Here are a few ways to get started.

Establish a routineEvery entrepreneur has habits and tricks they swear by that have helped them get to where they are. Some promise being an early riser is what has made all the difference. Others make sure to schedule time for mediation. Regardless of what appeals to you, remember that everyone is on their path. What may work for some people may be a deterrent for you.


A good way to find a routine you can stick with is by dividing your day's schedule into categories, such as projects, administrative work/meetings, health and wellness, and fun. Each of these areas is important. Prioritizing wellness and fun is just as important as focusing on work; otherwise, expect burnout as a consequence.Once you've created your own categories, place them into time blocks. For example, if you like to exercise first thing in the morning, set aside time on your calendar that reflects that commitment to your health and wellness routine. Then, fill in the time slots with your other priorities for the day and repeat through the week.It matters less when you wake up and more when you pay attention to your day.Related: Best New Shows For Entrepreneurs Streaming Free Now


2. Level up your knowledgeThe internet has made it easy to get free information. Whether you want to master social media marketing or learn new software, online tutorials and classes help you get where you want to be.Many cities also have free classes or networking groups that allow you to add to your skill set. Stay curious and expand your mind in areas that will help you grow your business. Everything from project management to accounting to scaling your business can help you streamline processes and give you more time to focus on strategy.Once you find an online channel or in-person mentor you like, you can decide if investing in a paid course or book is beneficial. However, start with the free knowledge available online and at your local library to understand what's possible.Add learning to your schedule as a set appointment for yourself. Otherwise, it can be easy to de-prioritize this important investment, which allows you to stay current within your industry and pushes you to connect to a higher level of growth.


Related: You Won't Have a Strong Leadership Presence Until You Master These 5 Attributes3. Cut expensesAnother valuable way to invest in yourself is to eliminate what you don't need. This includes monetary costs and people or projects that are draining your energy.Since time is money, it's important to examine where yours is being used and make adjustments as needed. When it comes to actual monthly expenses, look at your bank account.What subscriptions do you have that you no longer use? Which platforms are not working for you? Alternatively, which platforms are working well that you'd benefit from investing in a higher tier?


Furthermore, if you have a newsletter or paid ads to promote your business, how closely are you reviewing monthly reports? Are you making changes based on analytics? Even if you have a small ad spend, ensure it's giving you the return you want. Otherwise, that cost can be distributed elsewhere.Cutting costly connections and projects without a return on investment is equally valuable. Limit or eliminate the areas which aren't fulfilling your needs. This can take longer to establish as there are likely more personal attachments, but being an entrepreneur means preserving your energy, not giving it away for free.Essentially, evaluate all places you're spending time and money and decide if it still makes sense for where you are in your business.Related: 12 Cost-Cutting Strategies to Help You Thrive in a Slow Economy


Being an entrepreneur is a marathon, not a sprintAs with any other job, entrepreneurs have good days and bad. Since you are in charge of your own success (and failures), constantly reflecting on what is and isn't working is necessary. It helps you change direction before going down the wrong path for too long. It also enables you to move out of your comfort zone when you get too comfortable.Investing in yourself will always pay off. Though you may not see immediate results, its steadiness propels growth and ensures you are equipped to carry on for the long run.

1,Your Work Ethic Is Not the Problem — Debunking Three Modern-Day Productivity Myths,"Apr 22, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/lets-debunk-these-3-modern-day-productivity-myths/471744,"
In ancient Greece, philosophers like Plato and Aristotle were already grappling with the notion of work-life balance. The latter described amusement as a remedy for the ""ills of work,"" which he said was accompanied by ""toil and strain."" Work, they acknowledged, was necessary for living a virtuous life — and paying for stuff — but it shouldn't be the end, in and of itself.Nearly two-and-a-half millennia later, we still struggle to define what constitutes a good life and how work and productivity factor in. Our modern-day hustle culture, and many of today's outspoken business leaders, would have you believe that more is more. A steely, unwavering work ethic is a requisite for success. Sleep can wait, so the thinking goes.But a growing body of research plus some innovative companies are showing that the truth about productivity is more nuanced. More isn't always more — but working long hours isn't always bad either. There are no hard and fast rules.

2,How This Millionaire Investor Overcame Opioid Addiction to Become the World's Fastest Marathoner Over 50,"Apr 19, 2024",Jon Bier,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-this-millionaire-investor-became-the-worlds-fastest/472946,"
Ken Rideout was a hard-charging, money-minting Wall Street player until a series of financial crises and opioid addiction almost ruined him. But rather than succumb to the demons of drug abuse and economic ruin, Rideout rode out the storm.""Every time I've been in the depths of hell, I've turned it into a strength,"" he says.Rideout is now a successful investor and the world's fastest marathon runner over 50. On the latest episode of One Day with Jon Bier, I talked to him about how he turned his life around, the importance of a never-quit mindset, and his five essential tips and tactics for living your best life.



 


'Showing up is so important'Rideout has won countless races, including the 50-and-over division at the New York City and Boston Marathon. Recently, he placed first in the Gobi March, a grueling 7-day, 155-mile footrace in Central Mongolia.But he says half the battle is just showing up.""If I didn't have the balls to go there and get on the start line, I would've never known that I could do this, and it has become like a crowning achievement for me,"" he says of the Gobi race. ""But guess what doesn't happen? If I don't go there, no one cares because I don't win. I don't know what I can do.""Rideout emphasizes the importance of consistently showing up and putting in the hard work, whether it's for training, pursuing new experiences, or facing challenges.


""Showing up doesn't just mean on race day. The race itself is a beauty contest,"" he explains. ""The hard work has been done months in advance, in the rain, in the snow, in the dark.""Related: I Ran a Marathon Without Training. Here's What I Learned and How It Made Me a Better Entrepreneur.'Do things outside your comfort zone'Rideout is all about pushing new boundaries.""One thing that I've always done that's been a huge strength is I will try anything,"" he says. ""I'm down to try just about anything.""He tells the story of talking to his wife a few weeks before the Goby marathon after he was having second thoughts.""I told her, 'I think I can win, but do I really wanna go sleep in the desert for six days? I'm not a camper. I like staying in posh hotels. But she told me, 'You are always talking about doing things outside of your comfort zone. You talk all this shit online. You should take your own advice.' And as soon as she said it, I was like, it's on. I'm doing it.""'Thrive in a routine'Rideout credits a disciplined daily routine with helping him stay motivated and accountable for his fitness goals. He says establishing consistent habits makes it automatic.""I missed my calling not going into the military when I had the chance,"" he says.


His typical weekday routine consists of taking the kids to school (he has 4), and running for 90 minutes at around 8:30 a.m. He breaks for a shower and gets work done, and at about 4 p.m., he lifts weights for 30 minutes. Then, he takes his kids to Jui Jitsu and has a family dinner.He says, ""For people who might be struggling with motivation in certain areas, I can tell you that when you do something enough, eventually, it just becomes automatic.""Related: The Power Of Routines'Learn from failures'Rideout shares how quitting during an Ironman in Kona, Hawaii, in 2012, was his biggest bomb as an athlete, but it also changed his mindset.


"" I quit. I just stopped on the run, just gave up like a big baby,"" he recalls. ""I was so disgusted with myself that it basically transformed my whole journey. I told my wife, 'I will never feel this way again. I would rather be dead. I don't wanna live like this. I don't wanna live with this feeling. When I think about quitting that race after getting there and then disrespecting the race and all the people doing it in a weird way, it makes me feel like less than zero...I promise you I will f$%king die before I quit.""'Endurance is key.'How does a former opioid addict in his 50s manage to outrace clean and mean athletes in their 20s? Rideout says it's all about endurance.""As you get older, you get mentally tougher. You have things more in perspective,"" he explains. ""When you're younger, you're doing so much. There are a lot of distractions and it's great. But once you come to the realization that the clock's running, then you start really focusing and optimizing for the things that are important to you right now.""I still don't think I'm a very good runner. I'm just trying harder than people.""

3,Do You Want to Live to Be 100? This Researcher Has the Answer to Why Longevity is Not a Quick Fix or Trendy Diet,"Apr 19, 2024",Elisette Carlson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/do-you-want-to-live-to-be-100-this-researcher-has-the/472338,"
Dan Buettner is an explorer, National Geographic fellow, award-winning journalist and producer, and author of The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer from the People Who've Lived the Longest. In 2000, Buettner traveled to Okinawa, Japan, to investigate why people lived to be 100 and beyond there. With the support of National Geographic, Buettner and his team then traveled around the world in 2004 to explore other regions with reportedly high lifespan, better known as longevity.He identified five places, which he named ""The Blue Zones,"" where people live the longest, healthiest lives. The five original Blue Zones were Okinawa, Japan; Sardinia, Italy; Nicoya, Costa Rica; Ikaria, Greece; and Loma Linda, California. The research and learnings from the five populations where he interviewed many centenarians living high-quality lives became a Netflix Documentary entitled ""Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zones."" Within these communities, people prioritized family values, community, Mediterranean diets and living in walkable neighborhoods.I've known of Dan for years, and while I don't hold his three Guinness World Records in distance cycling, we share a mutual passion for cycling and the outdoors. I intended to dig deeper into his insights regarding how people, especially in America, always look for the quick fix and jump on the latest fad wagon. Be it Ozempic, no alcohol, cold plunging or eating a carnivore diet, I asked Dan for his opinions on these trends, more of which included CrossFit workouts, keto diets and intermittent fasting.



I said to Buettner, ""Amongst all of these protocols, trends, supplements and nutrition plans, where is the magic of longevity?""""There is no short-term fix,"" he responded. ""We keep searching for it, and we keep failing. None of it has been proven to work on humans for more than single digits of a percentage of people.""


Every year, we are marketed to try new diets, supplements and workouts and three months into them, 90% of people fail at what they started. Buettner explained how he discovered five populations that are living long because their daily unconscious behaviors are healthy and sustainable. And guess what? It doesn't cost much.Related: Adopt These 9 Habits and You'll Be Unrecognizable By the End of 2024Nutrition and specific foodsBeginning with food, Buettner explained how people eat so much processed food and tend to rely on a ""see food"" diet. If we see it on our counter or pantry, or there are treats in the office, we eat them and are mindlessly eating.This data was backed by research at Cornell, and in his books, he encourages people to set out bowls of fruit in their kitchens and keep healthy food accessible, including beans and nuts, both of which have strong nutritional benefits and help reduce inflammation. Beans are also loaded with fiber, something that 80-90% of Americans need more of, and they're inexpensive, shelf-stable and benefit the healthy gut bacteria. Buettner also relies on a handful of nuts daily, and his research shows that nuts add 2-3 years to life expectancy.


Buettner eats a plant-based diet, and the five cultures in the Blue Zones mostly do the same. These communities eat meat about once per week, whereas an American eats an average of 240 pounds per year — ""about a bathtub full of meat.""He explained that meat is like radiation in that we know we are likely going to die sooner of Type 2 diabetes or cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. He also loves his coffee and explains that coffee drinkers have lower rates of Type 2 diabetes or Parkinson's and also have better physical endurance and cardiovascular output.Related: These Four Words Can Change The Way You Approach Every Impossible TaskCommunity and purposeYour circle of friends influences happiness, health and a sense of purpose. For example, if you have active friends, you'll likely be active, and if your best friends are obese, there's a good chance you'll be influenced in that direction. ""Upgrade your circle of friends"" to people who will encourage you to be happy and healthy, make you laugh and make you feel good about yourself when you are with them.


Related: Your Peers Shouldn't (Only) Think Like You Moving naturally and avoiding health trends that failSo how about sauna and cold-plunging? Buettner occasionally saunas and believes that cold plunging is already on the decline. Unless you are swimming in the ocean, surfing or doing something you enjoy, he believes that intense cold plunging at 35-40 degrees, which is what most cold plunge studios do, is painful. As with most gym and nutrition trends, people get excited for a few weeks or maybe a year, and then they almost all say, ""Enough.""I loved hearing Buetter explain that the ""no pain, no gain"" mentality is wrong. The opposite is correct and true: ""The least pain, the most gain,"" and doing this long enough to make a difference is precisely what populations in the Blue Zones do. The Blue Zones populations interact with the outside environment, sit down at meals with their family, socialize with friends and prioritize sleep.These are human things that bring joy amongst daily and inexpensive habits that expand lifespan — such as living in walkable neighborhoods where you walk to get your food and run your errands, eating mostly fresh and non-processed food and avoiding things that cause you pain.


When I asked him about Ozempic, he exclaimed, ""Who the hell wants to jam a needle into their gut to lose weight?"" Again, it's another fad miles away from longevity.The number of obese people in America has tripled since 1980, and Buettner explained how this is an unmitigated mental health failure. Most Americans get fewer than 20 minutes of exercise per day, while Blue Zone people walk to most locations, garden or weed in their yards and practice stress-reducing activities, unlike CrossFit, which can raise inflammation and cause injury.Buettner, also an outdoor enthusiast, passionate about ultralight hiking and pickleball, explained that 75% of Americans can benefit by simply walking to work or taking public transportation. The morning we spoke, Buettner told me that he went to get a haircut, had a physical therapy appointment and then picked up some breakfast, all on his bike.I encourage you to watch the Blue Zones documentary to learn more about specific longevity lifestyle habits. If we all adjusted just a few small daily habits, it might just help us 'Live to 100.'

Branch Basics founders Marilee Nelson, Allison Evans and Kelly Love ""never set out to sell soap,"" let alone launch a cleaning brand that would generate tens of millions in annual sales.But the company's ""mission to create healthy homes"" while keeping cleaning routines simple continues to resonate with customers — 50% of whom are returning, according to the brand. Among other select accessories, Branch Basics offers a comprehensive ""starter kit,"" which features a fragrance-free, ""plant- and mineral-based"" cleaning concentrate along with various glass bottles that can be filled with different combinations of the solution and water to meet specific needs: from wiping down a bathroom counter to doing a load of laundry.Image Credit: Courtesy of Branch Basics. Marilee Nelson, left; Allison Evans, center; Kelly Love, right.



The story of how the company came to be begins with Nelson, who, after battling chronic illness, was told that she'd never have kids and needed to go on dialysis. Nelson wasn't sold on the prognosis and turned to another doctor who used ""food as medicine"" — a leap of faith that ""literally changed her life,"" eradicating those health issues and even inspiring her to become a medicinal cook. Later, after her 10-year-old son was exposed to pesticides and suffered brain and immune system damage, she took another hard look at environmental factors that might contribute to healing.""His immune system had been so damaged that he could not detoxify the things we're all exposed to every day,"" Nelson says, ""and he would have extreme reactions. I took one box and thought, Oh, I'll keep my favorite perfumes in here, favorite skincare products and things, in the closet, and when he gets better, I will bring them back out."" However, according to Nelson, the box's removal made such a significant difference that it showed her ""how important it is to [recognize] how powerful these chemicals are."" Nelson's son started to heal, and when word of mouth spread, she developed a course to help other people better understand the products in their homes.


Related: How This Pediatrician-Turned-Entrepreneur Transformed a Health Policy into a Consumer Product for Kids""Of course, the type of fuel we put in our bodies matters for how we feel.""Nelson's niece, Allison, had a similar experience. Diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, Evans was told by doctors that ""no lifestyle change"" could help her heal and to take birth control indefinitely; in college, she faced a range of symptoms — muscle aches, loss of motor skills and more — and says she was prescribed numerous medications to no avail. At the time, Evans and her aunt Marilee weren't particularly close, but she consulted with her and realized that some simple lifestyle changes just might help her feel better.According to Evans, removing certain products with synthetic ingredients and eating whole foods did help her condition improve, and as graduation neared, she decided to spend eight weeks with Nelson in the Texas Hill Country, where she'd learn more about healthy living from her aunt. Her friend Kelly joined her, and despite being in good health, also noticed a transformation — ""My dry itchy eyes, headaches, muscle aches are all gone,"" Love recalls, adding, ""the more I learned about all this, it just made sense to me: Of course, the type of fuel we put in our bodies matters for how we feel, how we think, how we act.""

The organization also notes that even naturally occurring fragrances, such as citrus, ""can react to produce dangerous pollutants indoors.""


""Nontoxic"" labels on products aren't the be-all and end-all either, Nelson notes. After all, ""it's the dose that makes the poison,"" as the Swiss physician and chemist Paracelsus said nearly 500 years ago. According to Nelson, looking at the ingredients themselves is key. The founders want people to feel empowered to examine any product — from Branch Basics or another company — and understand the ingredients being used. To that end, they offer a $99 ""Toss the Toxins"" course to ""walk you through a step-by-step process to remove products that pollute your home and body.""Related: Go Green Or Go Home: 3 Ways Industrial Facilities Can Clean Up Their Acts""Our 32-ounce liquid concentrate cleans your windows, cleans your baby's bottom, cleans your produce.""Branch Basics' ""minimalist"" product line is meant to make the whole process easier — and save time.

It's so safe it can be used on the skin.""


""Our 32-ounce liquid concentrate cleans your windows, cleans your baby's bottom, cleans your produce, takes off your eye makeup, cleans your countertops [or] your hardwood floors — whatever depending on the the ratio,"" Evans adds.The approach is resonating with customers, the company reports. Gross sales grew around 42% year over year from 2022 to 2023, with revenue hitting $40 million last year. The company currently has more than 50,000 product subscribers, 600,000 email subscribers and 10,000 five-star reviews on its concentrate and Oxygen Boost, which amplifies the power of the concentrate ""for tough cleaning jobs.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Branch Basics""We know that human health is our priority... [that] keeps everything aligned.""The company's laser-focused commitment to its customers — it reportedly responds to every single customer question on Instagram and TikTok — no doubt fosters a lot of that brand loyalty. What's more, Branch Basics boasts a 6% referral rate compared to the industry's 2% average.""We approach everything [by asking] What do we want?"" Love says. ""What's missing in the market? What do we, as people who are moms, as people who are health-conscious, need and want? Because, most likely, other people would need and want those things, too. We know that human health is our priority, so when we formulate products or make our marketing plans, [that] keeps everything aligned.""This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

5,How to Escape Entrepreneurial Burnout When You Can't Just Quit,"Apr 18, 2024",Lesley Pyle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-escape-entrepreneurial-burnout-when-you-cant-quit/471967,"
I have experienced burnout before as an entrepreneur. Yes, burnout is an extremely common topic. A quick search mostly shows tips on how to avoid it, which is great until you find yourself in the middle of it. In fact, I found that when I actually experienced it for myself, few resources gave me an answer that would work with my life.The number one answer I found online? If you're experiencing burnout, quit your job. For someone who owns a business, that's not so easy. Now, it's not impossible to get rid of your business and change career paths. If you want to do that, you certainly can.However, being an entrepreneur certainly follows the idiom: in for a penny, in for a pound. Most business owners I know are all in. There is no other career for them. Finances, schedules and other people's lives are all tied to a business. Stepping away is not always an option.



So, what do you do when you're experiencing burnout as an entrepreneur and you feel like your entire career is on life support as you barely make it through each day?Related: 3 Insights From the First Large-Scale Study on Burnout and Entrepreneurs


Address the root issueTake a moment to determine what is causing you the most stress. Pinpoint a few key stress-inducing areas. Perhaps it is a single client. Run through the numbers — can you part ways with that client? Are they worth the hassle? And if they are a larger client, you can come up with a plan to find someone else to replace that revenue stream. Businesses are always changing. You are not required to have the same clients for 10 years, 20 years or even a single year. Some companies and some clients do not work well with each other, and that is okay.Perhaps you just feel as though you've lost passion for the job. Do you feel bogged down with menial tasks? Maybe you're a more creative person, but as your business has grown, you've found yourself stuck with things like scheduling meetings and following up on emails. You should hire a virtual assistant. They can share the load and get smaller items off your plate so you can focus on what you love to do.Maybe you've just lost sight of your ""why"" along the way: You don't remember why you started your business or what made you passionate about it. Try going down memory lane — look through old photos or social media posts, talk to people who knew you before you started your business, and maybe even see if you can find some notes from when you first started. This can help you get a little perspective back on the company so that you can make a plan to get back to your original mission.While I would love to say take a week off from work to really sit with yourself and review what's going on, I understand that's not always possible. Pick a holiday or your slowest time of the year. Block off some time as though you are in a meeting and figure out what the root cause of your burnout is, and then make a plan on how to change things so you do not experience it again.


Protect your healthAbove all else, protect your health. According to the Mayo Clinic, burnout is a serious health concern. You don't just feel tired and sluggish — your entire body is suffering and will show signs such as exhaustion, loss of sleep, mood changes and more. Burnout can quite literally turn you into a different person if you are not careful.And, if you continue to try and push through it, you will find that your body will stop you by making you get sicker more often, or even causing you to develop a serious issue such as heart disease. Burnout should not be taken lightly.I want to provide a bit of a warning: If you've realized that you do need to step away from your business to stay healthy, then you should do so. That is not an easy decision, but at the end of the day, you need to protect your health. As entrepreneurs, we are driven by our businesses and often feel obligated to clients, so it might help to reframe it like this: Losing you to a serious disease will cause more problems for friends, family, employees and clients versus you deciding you need to step away to stay healthy and ultimately happy.Related: How Entrepreneurs Can Protect Their Mental Health While Being Their Own BossOn the other hand, if you want to keep your company and find ways around burnout, try these solutions:Consider seeking therapy. Sometimes pushing yourself to burnout can be a symptom of larger issues that a medical professional can help with.Set boundaries. You are your own worst enemy, and you will work too hard, pushing yourself to impossible deadlines that maybe not even your clients have asked for. Set times to work and set times to step away from work. Good clients who recognize the value your business brings will honor those times.Take a break. You might not be able to work a full vacation into your schedule, but you can set 10 to 15-minute breaks throughout the day to just breathe.Work out your stress. Although you may feel exhausted and sluggish, burnout is actually just another type of stress, which means it can be relieved through physical activities such as walks or high-intensity workouts.If you find yourself suffering from burnout, don't give up hope. Instead, give your career some CPR and get it off life support by reaching out to others for help so that you can protect your health and your business.

6,Eliminate Busy Work and Become More Productive with These Task Management Tips,"Apr 18, 2024",Kimberly Zhang,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/boost-efficiency-by-eliminating-busy-work-now/472852,"
Productivity means doing things smartly and efficiently. When you're productive, you're not just busy—you're doing things that really matter. First, think about what you want to achieve. Then, make a plan to reach those goals. Being productive means using your time and resources wisely. So, stay focused, plan well, and avoid busy work to maximize your efforts.Identifying busy workBusy work is when you spend time and energy on tasks that don't help you achieve your goals. Sometimes, we do helpful things but don't make real progress.Examples of busy work include talking about things that don't matter, spending too much time on emails, or going to meetings that aren't important. It's like spinning your wheels – lots of action but not going anywhere. Instead, focus on activities that actually move you closer to your goals. That's true productivity, not just being busy.



Using a time clock can help you keep track of how much time you spend on tasks. This can help you work faster and more efficiently.Emails can be distracting. But you can avoid interruptions by setting specific times to check them. This way, you can focus better on important tasks instead of getting caught up in busy work. So, next time you're working on something, try using a time clock and setting email-checking times. It could really help you be more productive.


Related: This Bad Work Habit Is Stealing a Shocking 72 Days of Your Time Per YearWorkplace productivity statisticsDid you know that the average worker is only productive for about 60% of their workday? That means a lot of time might be spent not getting much done. It's even less for office workers – only around two and a half hours of real productivity each day.When teams are engaged and work well together, amazing things can happen. Highly engaged teams have fewer problems, such as internal theft, absenteeism, and job turnover.Surprisingly, social media can cost businesses a lot of money. Employees spending time on Facebook and other sites wastes billions of dollars annually. And those long, unproductive meetings? They're taking up billions of hours, too.


Nowadays, it's not just about being busy – it's about having the right talent. Talented and right employees can change how much work gets done. In fact, they can be up to 400% more productive than average workers. The best ones can even complete difficult tasks super efficiently, sometimes reaching productivity levels that are eight times higher than normal.Related: Wasted Employee Time Adds Up: Here's How to Fix ItKey elements of productivity Did you know that employees can be twice as productive when they are engaged in their work? When people feel connected to what they're doing, they tend to work harder and get more done.But there's something else that can affect how productive people are: sleep. If you're not getting enough sleep, it can make you less efficient at work. In fact, sleep deprivation costs businesses a lot of money – $63 billion every year. And it's not just a few people – one-third of workers in the US aren't getting the sleep they need.


Another thing that can distract people at work is the internet. When employees spend time online doing things like watching sports or shopping, their productivity can be cut in half. It's important to stay focused on work tasks to get things done efficiently.Turning busy work into productivity To make sure your team is using their time wisely, it's important to plan ahead and delegate tasks properly. Start by figuring out what needs to be done first, and then guide your team to focus on those tasks. This will help them stay on track and motivated.If you notice your team spending too much time on the same things over and over, try finding ways to make those tasks easier. You could use software or tools to automate them or group similar tasks together to get them done more efficiently.It's also a good idea to break up the workday into smaller chunks and take breaks in between. This can help prevent burnout and keep your productivity levels high. Also, keeping the office tidy and organized can help reduce distractions and keep your team focused.


Besides, you can use tools like time clocks, to-do lists, and project management software. These can help your team stay organized and on top of their tasks. With the right planning and tools, busy work can become productive work in no time.If you delegate tasks based on expertise, you'll find less time wasted on busy work. Follow up by regularly evaluating workflow. Keep your team informed about fresh methods and tools; thus, you can support them in working more intelligently rather than just harder. Identify what needs improvement and be willing to make changes.Related: 12 Factors That Are Fueling Your Workplace Mental ExhaustionTools to stimulate productivity If you've ever used a legacy digital calendar to become better with time and more organized, you probably felt you were spending too much time entering and revising data. The latest digital calendars are equipped with AI-enabled solutions that memorize your schedule and take over booking, organizing, and updating events and meetings on your calendar. They also sync across devices and tools, enabling a more efficient and productive work process.


Cluttered inboxes are one of the most significant productivity roadblocks employees encounter. The best email management tools can categorize similar emails and give employees a variety of tools to manage them easily, quickly, and efficiently. They can block senders, delete multiple emails at once, or unsubscribe from emails automatically.Final VerdictsBy organizing tasks, setting clear goals, and using helpful tools, you can turn busy work into productive work. You should plan well, divide tasks wisely, and stay motivated to succeed. With your effort and the right methods, productivity can increase, distractions can decrease, and work can be more efficient for everyone.

Responses have been edited and condensed for clarity.Image Credit: Courtesy of CCRSP INC. Dr. Amareen Dhaliwal. How were you introduced to EdTech, and what inspired you to start your side hustle in that space?When I had the opportunity to tutor STEM classes in college, I quickly realized teaching was my passion. I excelled on the newly formatted MCAT and decided I wanted to help students achieve higher scores (one of my students even reached the 99th percentile!). A college friend suggested I create a pre-med club focused on innovative learning experiences, which sparked my interest in curriculum development and the use of learning management systems supported by professionals in medical and scientific fields. The idea to build a website and offer tutoring services emerged after I hosted a successful MCAT seminar, and my commitment to tutoring in college laid the foundation for my future endeavors.



My tutoring venture expanded into a holistic coaching experience, which focused on the psychology of studying, anxiety management and wellness, including the utilization of 24-hour planners, exercise and nutrition. This comprehensive approach led me to pursue a psychiatry residency. Despite not initially seeing myself as a business person, the need for innovation in MCAT preparation drove me to entrepreneurship.Related: Best New Shows for Entrepreneurs (Streaming Free)


After collaborating with peers in clinical trials, we launched online clinical research courses, aiming for excellence and continuous improvement. This endeavor was more than a business; it was about making a meaningful impact and addressing broader needs. CCRPS INC was founded to address the underemployment of foreign medical graduates and healthcare professionals in the U.S. despite their impressive credentials. Together with colleagues in clinical trials, we aimed to provide educational courses to help these individuals secure entry-level positions that offer both competitive salaries and a sense of purpose. We established a strong online presence, developed expert-led courses and focused on education and career preparation. Our commitment to quality content quickly earned us recognition and trust, positioning CCRPS as a leader in the field.What were some of the first steps you took to get CCRPS off the ground?First, we identified our niche by recognizing a gap for non-clinical medical professionals seeking valuable career paths. We built a user-friendly website and formed partnerships with providers, building trust by seeking out video and audio reviews from graduate students to help other students have a better idea of our comprehensive and in-depth educational approach. We collaborated with experts to create high-quality course materials and secured the necessary accreditations to establish credibility. We also offered comprehensive career support and focused on quality education, which spurred organic growth through referrals and a robust online presence.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building the side hustle, and how did you navigate them?Building and growing a startup requires constant ""figuring out"" of challenges. The biggest challenge was meeting and surpassing our clients' needs so they could continue to grow. Additionally, delegating to the right people requires trial and error; you can't expect to get it right from day one! The key to overcoming these challenges is learning to be okay with the ups and downs, being the rock when changes don't go as planned and consistently providing excellent services.Related: This Insurance Agent Started a Side Hustle Inspired By Nostalgia for His Home State — Now It Earns Nearly $40,000 a Month


How long did it take you to see consistent revenue from your work within EdTech?From the outset, our business achieved net profitability, a testament to our compelling curriculum. Starting with one in-person student whose enrollment funded our initial website and SEO efforts, we adopted a strategy that allowed us to reinvest early profits into expanding our operations. This approach was essential in both our foundational stages and as we scaled, particularly with the MCAT company.Despite promising early enrollments, our focus has always been on student success and quality education rather than merely generating revenue. This commitment enabled us to reduce prices over time, making education more accessible and aligning with our belief in the importance of affordable education. Engaging students meaningfully requires commitment, evidenced by our successful partnerships with contract research organizations and our lean yet effective operational model.How do you balance your entrepreneurial pursuits with a demanding career in medicine?Following a year-long hiatus to launch CCRPS, I transitioned back into my residency. Today, brilliant clinical research professionals and a solid team manage the day-to-day operations and business aspects, ensuring student success remains a priority at CCRPS while I fully immerse myself and focus on my residency.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.


What do you enjoy most about running your own business?I appreciate the profound influence I can have on students' success and career advancement. Witnessing their growth, seeing their achievements and knowing that we play a pivotal role in shaping their futures is incredibly rewarding and reaffirms my passion for education entrepreneurship every day. With over 22,000 student members from more than 1,200 organizations, including six government agencies and 308 universities, the reach and influence of CCRPS are evident. A 2024 LinkedIn review of graduates highlighted remarkable outcomes, with placements in over 1,600 companies and 23% achieving managerial roles or higher. Furthermore, the initiative has significantly contributed to developing the clinical research workforce for various contract research organizations. This progress, driven by a team of exceptional clinical research educators, underscores the collective effort and dedication to advancing clinical trials and healthcare.What's your advice for others hoping to start successful businesses?Learning how to harness and delegate our strengths effectively is crucial. Sometimes, guidance from those who've walked the path before us can be a game-changer; seeking expert mentorship in areas we find challenging can make all the difference.Start small and focus on what matters: In a world brimming with startups, it's vital to remember that at the heart of every idea and venture are the people we aim to help. They are our priority, always. Let's embrace our unique talents, lean into learning and always put people first.This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

Ninety-five percent of workers are looking for or plan to look for a new job this year, according to a report from job-search website Monster. If you're one of them, it might be worth your time to check out LinkedIn's Top Companies for 2024 — because they're all hiring, with more than 85,000 current job openings, one-third of which are hybrid.LinkedIn's annual compilation of data can help professionals find out which organizations are industry leaders making an impact with growth opportunities, equity in the workplace and more. Each company on LinkedIn's list was ranked according to eight pillars that translate to career progression: ability to advance, skills growth, company stability, external opportunity, company affinity, gender diversity, educational background and employee presence in the country, per the platform.Related: LinkedIn Changed Its Algorithms — Here's How Your Posts Will Get More Attention Now



""This year, companies in financial services, healthcare and tech dominate the U.S. ranking, driven in part by pandemic rebounding and overall stability within these sectors despite layoff headlines for some big-name companies,"" the company said in a statement, which also noted that 44% of the companies included in the 2024 ranking are new to the list and represent a range of industries including motor vehicle manufacturing and biotechnology research.Several key trends emerged across this year's top companies. They're embracing the power of artificial intelligence, relying on AI for meeting summarization, code generation, customer service assistance, predictive analytics, modeling and more; cultivating academic communities with an AI focus; and even creating their own AI platforms and governance teams, per LinkedIn.


The top companies are also on the hunt for soft skills like adaptability, curiosity, collaboration and communication, and they're aiming to center company culture and connection, according to the research. Some examples include Wells Fargo, which hosts events like puppy-petting with local dog foster organizations as part of its Stress Down Days program, and PwC, which encourages breaks by outfitting its offices with gaming areas that include foosball, shuffleboard, basketball and more.Related: Unlocking the Power of LinkedIn: How Entrepreneurs Can Leverage the Platform for Growth and SuccessBut perhaps one of the most significant developments for employees? That might be these top companies' mission to ""uplevel"" compensation packages. When asked to rank the most important factors in a job, 45% of workers said pay took the No. 1 spot, a Washington Post-Ipsos poll found. Although many would consider salary the backbone of any compensation package, the top companies on LinkedIn's list also look beyond pay when it comes to their ""robust compensation packages.""JPMorgan Chase & Co. (#1) provides financial coaching to help employees earn and save more; General Motors (#11) offers upskilling initiatives like the Geek Program technical competitive events and tuition assistance; the American Express (#49) Colleague Networks feature international buddy programs and informal coffee chats to increase employee visibility with leadership; Continental (#29) implements job rotations for internal mobility, including short- and long-term international assignments; and Procter & Gamble (#22) wants team members to have the opportunity for ""several careers within a career,"" per LinkedIn.

9,Former U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard Says 2 Things She Learned in the Military Made Her a Better Leader — and Reveals How to Have Productive Conversations When You Disagree,"Apr 15, 2024",Jeff Fenster,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/tulsi-gabbard-a-journey-of-service-and-unity/472416,"
This week, I was honored to have Tulsi Gabbard on the show to discuss her life, passions and new book, For Love of Country: Leave the Democrat Party Behind.From her early days as an environmental activist to her distinguished military career and subsequent political journey, Gabbard's life has been marked by a commitment to public service and embracing the transformative power of personal growth.Related: Use This Simple Strategy to Push Through Limitations in Your Life



Her journey began with her passion for environmental activism. When she was a teenager, she co-founded the nonprofit Healthy Hawai'i Coalition, but she says it was her military deployment that truly shaped her perspective and instilled in her the values of adaptability and critical thinking. She enlisted in the Hawaii Army National Guard in 2003 and deployed to Iraq in 2004. Serving in the military taught her the importance of being open to different ideas and perspectives, a lesson she says she carried to her political career.""I enlisted because of 9/11 like a lot of other Americans and volunteered to be deployed to the Middle East,"" she says. ""During my almost 21 years of service, I can't express in words how grateful I feel to have served alongside such incredible people from all walks of life, from all parts of the country — people who not only love our country but love each other.""


As she detailed during our conversation, she believes that respectful conversations and exchanging ideas are essential for progress and unity in American society. Gabbard emphasized the need to bridge the divide between differing opinions, encouraging citizens to engage in meaningful discussions rather than resorting to divisive rhetoric. By prioritizing the well-being of the people over political agendas, she says we can create a more inclusive and cohesive society. ""If [politicians] are not focused on serving the people, then [they] are focused on the wrong things,"" she says.Related: 'First to the Gym, Last to Leave': The Mentality That Drives NFL Great Shawne Merriman's SuccessGrassroots movements and collective action are also at the core of Gabbard's vision for positive change. She believes real transformation can only be achieved when citizens actively participate in the democratic process. Gabbard encourages individuals to be informed, hold leaders accountable and engage in civic activities that drive change from the ground up, no matter how difficult it may seem.Her life of service in the military and politics has taught her a valuable lesson about keeping calm and collected during tough times. ""Stay spiritually grounded in [your] purpose,"" she says. ""Know exactly who you are, and know that generally speaking, those who are attacking you are doing so based on their own insecurities and fears.""


In a time when political polarization seems to be the norm, Gabbard's journey reminded me of the importance of being open to different ideas and staying active in the community. As we navigate the challenges of our time, I believe that we can all draw inspiration from Gabbard's leadership principles of humility, compassion and spiritual grounding. ""Be humble,"" she advises those in leadership positions. ""In order to lead, one must do so truly with a servant's heart that cares for, inspires and teaches those they've been charged to lead.""About The Jeff Fenster ShowSerial entrepreneur Jeff Fenster embarks on an extraordinary journey every week, delving into the stories of exceptional individuals who have defied the norms and blazed their own trails to achieve extraordinary success.Subscribe to The Jeff Fenster Show: Entrepreneur | Apple | Spotify | Google | Pandora

10,Bantam Bagels' Founder Fell Into a Mindset Trap 'People Don't Talk About' After Selling the Now-Defunct Business for $34 Million — Here's What Happened,"Apr 12, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-happened-to-bantam-bagels-founder-reveals-her-struggle/472502,"
In 2013, Elyse Oleksak, co-founder of Bantam Bagels, got a call from her husband Nick about a bite-sized snack that would set some big plans in motion. ""Mini bagels stuffed with cream cheese,"" Oleksak recalls him saying in her recently released memoir A Shark Ate My Bagel: How We Built Bantam Bagels. ""Sort of like doughnut holes, but bagels."" Oleksak had heard plenty of ambitious ideas from her entrepreneurially-minded husband in the past, but tiny stuffed bagels were one she could get behind. The duo met at a grocery store after work to start experimenting.Image Credit: Courtesy of Elyse OleksakIt was the beginning of Bantam Bagels' near-decade-long journey, one that cycled through ""success followed by failure"" and ""elation followed by panic,"" Oleksak tells Entrepreneur exclusively.



The business made a splash on Shark Tank, where the Oleksaks struck a $275,000 deal for 11% equity with Lori Greiner (hence the title of Oleksak's book) in 2014. In the next several years, it saw sales hit $45 million as it expanded the product line to include mini stuffed pancakes and egg bites, landed in 10,000 stores and 8,500 Starbucks and was ultimately acquired by the Ohio-based T. Marzetti Company for $34 million in 2018 before ceasing operations in 2022.Related: All 7 'Shark Tank' Stars Share Tips on How to Become a Millionaire


""We were going to die in the wake of our own success if we didn't do something about it soon.""Like many entrepreneurs who find themselves at the helm of a fast-growing business, the Oleksaks had an ""aha moment"" when they realized their cash-versus-growth dilemma. ""We got to a point where even though this was our baby and it was something that we had owned at near 100% for so long, we were going to die in the wake of our own success if we didn't do something about it soon,"" Oleksak says. So the Oleksaks sold to T. Marzetti. It felt like a perfect match, Oleksak recalls, and the couple stayed on in marketing and product development capacities.However, getting used to her new relationship with the company wasn't easy, Oleksak admits. It's a struggle that didn't make it into the book, she says, but an important one nevertheless. According to Oleksak, with all of the focus on success stories and flashy sales, there's an all-too-common experience that gets lost in the narrative because ""people don't talk about"" it: How do you cope when all of your hard work pays off and your dream finally comes true?""Every single ounce and fiber of our being was dedicated to the survival and growth of this company [for years],"" Oleksak explains, ""so when you operate in this fight or flight mode for so long, it just becomes who you are."" Simultaneously chasing success and steeling for calamity takes a serious mental toll, Oleksak says, and when there were no more fires to put out, her brain began ""inventing disasters"" that didn't exist and therefore had no concrete solutions — a never-ending ""spiral.""


Related: 4 Ways Highly Successful People Handle Tough Times and Get Back on Track""When we were left feeling safe and at peace, I almost didn't know what to do with that safety and peace.""""We found loving arms for our explosive child,"" Oleksak says. ""We did it. But every single sense of self and success [had been] wrapped in this swirl of panic at all times, so when we were left feeling safe and at peace, I almost didn't know what to do with that safety and peace. Your brain almost doesn't know what to do when it stops. I personally went through an extreme breakdown."" Oleksak likens the experience to those of professional athletes who have to redefine themselves after a career in sports.Seeing your biggest dream become a reality can be amazing, but you have to prepare your brain for a complete mindset shift and pick up the appropriate tools to navigate that, according to Oleksak. The entrepreneur is a huge proponent of therapy and credits it with helping her recalibrate what it takes to get from one day to the next without considering chaos a foregone conclusion. ""I worked through a lot to find mental peace and stability and be able to be present again in the moment,"" she says.


Unfortunately, just a couple of years after T. Marzetti acquired Bantam Bagels, the pandemic put pressure on the supply chain, making it a challenge to stock the same variety of products as retailers streamlined processes wherever possible. By that point, Oleksak says she and her husband had given up a lot of decision-making authority and weren't involved in the conversations that ultimately led T. Marzetti to stop production of the brand. Still, Oleksak — and the nearly 1,500 people who signed a petition in support of Bantam Bagels' return — would love to see the products make a comeback one day.Related: 5 Ways to Protect Your Mental HealthAs Oleksak reflected on her entrepreneurial journey ""full of ups and downs,"" she kept coming back to all of the connections she'd made along the way — from every customer who purchased a Bantam Bagel to the manufacturers who took a chance on the product, celebrity endorsers including Oprah, Sarah Jessica Parker and Whoopi Goldberg, and so many more — and wanted to give back with a behind-the-scenes look at lessons learned over the years. So Oleksak put pen to paper and drafted A Shark Ate My Bagel, then opted to self-publish it ""the entrepreneurial way,"" with a marketing plan that included her own website and an Amazon push.""Thank God I organized all those lessons because, man, did I make a lot of mistakes,"" Oleksak laughs. These days, she's approaching the publication of her book as she would the launch of a ""mini business"" and says she's putting most of her energy into that right now. But she also looks forward to working with small businesses in the future, helping them avoid the mistakes she made and secure wins of their own.

      Key Takeaways    



        Narcissism isn't inherently pathological for an individual or other people, Lundquist says. 
      


        Disordered narcissism impairs how people operate in the world and is highly damaging to relationships. 
      


        A healthy sense of narcissism can come with major advantages, especially in the workplace. 
      



""Narcissism refers to the sense we all have of ourselves — the regard we hold ourselves in, the ways that we focus — and sometimes fixate — on ourselves,"" Matt Lundquist, a Columbia University-trained psychotherapist and founder and clinical director of TriBeCa Therapy, tells Entrepreneur.Narcissism isn't inherently pathological for an individual or other people, Lundquist says, but the term is so frequently used ""as a pejorative"" that the idea that narcissism can be normal, healthy — and even underdeveloped in some instances — falls by the wayside. One need look no further than so-called ""#NarcTok,"" where people use the diagnosis ""as a stand-in for all manner of unpleasant behaviors and character traits.""In reality, classifying someone as a ""narcissist"" in a clinical psychopathology context implies ""they have an impairment in narcissism that is severe enough to cause problems in how they're operating in the world,"" Lundquist explains. They may have narcissistic traits or what is termed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual as a Narcissistic Personality Disorder, he adds.

12,"Following These Five Practices Dramatically Improved My Mental Health — Find Out If They Could Help You, Too.","Apr 8, 2024",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-following-these-5-practices-saved-my-mental-health/470699,"
Mental health affects all of us. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), 1 in 5 adults experience a mental illness every year. Both NAMI and Forbes Health cite suicide as the second leading cause of death in adolescents ages 10 to 14 years alone. The CDC reported a 2.4% increase in the number of adults receiving mental health treatment between 2019 and 2021. There's no doubt that poor mental health affects our ability to thrive in our relationships and at home, work and school.Mental health can be a challenging thing to manage. Nine years ago, I decided I wanted to learn more about it, and I hired a licensed therapist (who I still see weekly). After nearly a decade of focus, I've found that the following five practices dramatically improve our mental and emotional well-being. I discuss these practices with my clients on a daily basis, and literally all of them report positive effects from practicing them.Related: We Need a Real Commitment to Mental Health at Work. Here's How (and Why).



1. Identify and then prioritize the things that matter most to youIt's easy to get swept up in the demands of others and forget about ourselves. Determine what activities, hobbies, events and jobs you love most and prioritize those things. Mental wellness often seems to disappear when we don't make time for the things that make us tick. It doesn't matter whether it's pickup soccer, painting or playing guitar. Figure out what you love to do and regularly spend time doing it. Have dreams and articulate them.If you've always wanted to learn to speak a foreign language or write a book, I recommend you don't lose sight of that. For some, these goals are forgotten once we have children or start to age. I recognize it's hard to juggle and balance the demands of a family or career with your own needs and interests, but it's not impossible. It starts with you believing it can be done and committing to doing it — no matter what. To start, create a vision board or mission statement and post it somewhere you can see it. This helps remind us of the things that matter most.


2. Set and enforce boundariesDon't be afraid to say no. Some of us were raised to be people-pleasers and feel compelled to always ""do it all."" This thinking is misguided. Anytime we say yes to one thing, we're automatically saying no to something else. If that ""something else"" is always yourself, you're likely not caring for your mental health. In my expeirendce, this will catch up with you. Unhappy, frustrated and burnt-out individuals spend a tremendous amount of time doing things for other people and not nearly enough time doing things for themselves. Figure out what you really want to do and what you don't. Then, articulate it confidently and without guilt.As Stephen Covey said, ""It's easier to say no when we have a greater yes in mind."" When you know what matters most (to you), you'll have an easier time making (and protecting) space for it. To start, give the things you most want to accomplish a place to live and breathe on your calendar. Use Outlook or another calendar to schedule time for your top priorities — this will help you say no when a last-minute conflict arises.Related: Entrepreneurs Are Scheduling Their Days Down to the Minute for Ultimate Success3. Honor and validate your emotionsMany of us like to be right. Understandable; it feels good to know things and be correct. However, sometimes our desire to be right stands in the way of us actually doing what's right. It's not uncommon to gaslight others. Frequently, people invalidate the experiences, beliefs and emotions of others just because they don't mirror their own. Learn to recognize that you can't control how often this happens to you, but you can control your response. Make a point to regularly connect with yourself and truly understand your feelings. Once you know what those are, trust and listen to them. Don't allow yourself to be talked out of them.


Getting advice and mentorship from someone you deeply care about (who also has your best interests at heart) is one thing. Being gaslit by someone who feels threatened by your success or is uncomfortable with a difference of opinion is entirely another. If you choose to be influenced or persuaded, make sure it's for the right reason. To start, regularly journal or talk to a therapist (or coach) about how you feel. This helps you connect with yourself and be self-aware of what you're really experiencing.4. Celebrate every step of your journeyWhen it comes to pursuing big goals, the road is long. It can be easy to become discouraged. Remember to celebrate your efforts along the way, not just at the end. Make time to acknowledge what you've done well and choose to be proud of yourself. Instead of focusing on perfection, focus on progress. Are you wiser, stronger and braver than you were a few months ago? What about a year ago? If the answer is yes, then make sure you choose to feel good about yourself and where you're at, even if you're not completely done yet. To start, keep a gratitude journal or list of your accomplishments. Catalog specific things that are working well. If you do this consistently, you'll rewire your tendency to see the negative or engage in any sort of negative self-talk. Instead, you'll notice far more of the good. And that feels good.Related: 3 Reasons to Celebrate Small Wins in Your Business5. Only associate with people who support your mental healthWho we surround ourselves with matters. Many people who struggle with mental well-being keep the company of others who actively try to undermine them. Ultimately, we tend to adopt the beliefs, values and mindset of those we see the most. If you associate with negative people who complain, you'll develop a tendency to do the same thing. If you associate with catty people who love to gossip, you'll develop a tendency to judge as well.


It's been said that ""Two things prevent us from happiness: living in the past and observing others."" If we care about our mental well-being, it's important to surround ourselves with like-minded people. Spend time with others who have goals, pursue their purpose with passion, set and enforce boundaries and will respect you as you do the same. To start, take inventory of the people with whom you spend your time. How do you feel when you're around them? Do they support and encourage you? Do they champion your goals? If not, limit your interactions with them and replace that time with these other activities.Most of us face a tremendous amount of outside pressure from our bosses, families and even friends. It can be extremely hard to prioritize ourselves and our well-being over the demands of others — but we must.

  I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.
  
    When Cliff Smith lost his job, he picked up an under-the-radar gig that would make it possible to keep dining out — something he and his wife love to do.

      Key Takeaways    



        Smith and his wife first heard about the EyeSpy side hustle from friends who knew founder Mistie Boulton. 
      


        Smith started with the company over two decades ago; these days, he completes about three evaluations each month. 
      


        Since he began keeping track in 2008, Smith has enjoyed a $40,000 food budget in exchange for his reviews. 
      












This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cliff Smith. Smith is based in Palo Alto, California and has been an evaluator for EyeSpy Critiquing & Consulting since 2003. The piece has been edited and condensed for clarity. I started working as a mystery diner with EyeSpy over 20 years ago. Our friends knew the founder Mistie Boulton, so they were among the very first people to do it, and when they told us about it, we thought it sounded too good to be true — to have our meals at nice restaurants paid for in exchange for writing up the experience. We didn't jump on the opportunity right away, but when I lost my job and began to tutor GMAT prep, I picked up the side hustle so we could continue dining out.Typically, I complete around three evaluations a month, and the work takes me to fine dining establishments as well as more casual restaurants; sometimes, the evaluation will even be for a takeout order. One Saturday last month, my wife and I did a brunch evaluation at The Village Pub, and our budget for brunch was $250 — and we needed it. We actually went slightly over with the tax and tip. The following Friday, we got a pizza delivery. So it remains a mix, and that's one of the advantages: This side hustle gets you into places you might not go otherwise.

You can negotiate when to do the assignment within the month, and if you can't do it that month, you can explain why and potentially take on the assignment the next month, but you may not get it again. It depends on what's going on — sometimes if they already have someone for the following week, it doesn't work out.


For each evaluation, there's an online survey form, and they do differ. Different restaurants care about different things. For example, The Village Pub cares a lot about how they handle the wine. Do they observe proper protocol? Do they keep filling your glass? Other places don't care nearly as much about that, but they might care about how many people say goodbye to you. So before an evaluation, you really do need to look at the form. Even if it's a similar kind of restaurant, the management may care about different things for different reasons. And you're supposed to remember when they did different things. I take pictures so I have a timestamp for all of it.Related: This 29-Year-Old Left His Marketing Job to Pursue a Side Hustle — Now He Earns Nearly $200,000 a Year: 'So Attracted to the Adrenaline Rush'You have to turn in the evaluation within 24 hours. When we started, it was two days, but they changed it to the next day. And in a way, that's reasonable because you have to remember a lot, and it does fade. The time it takes to finish an evaluation depends on the place. For the pizza place I mentioned, I completed it that night and maybe spent two hours on it at most. But I probably spent about six hours on The Village Pub evaluation. I wouldn't do it all in one day for a place like that.We also have to submit photos. I use Photoshop to crop them because I'm surreptitiously taking the pictures — though it doesn't have to be too surreptitious because a lot of people are taking pictures these days — but I take so many that I don't want to be too obvious about it. I don't take great pictures all the time. For the food, I do, but for the other things, not so much. But I may take a picture of the table to show the place settings if they care about their positioning. Later, when I'm submitting the photos, I need to crop them so they look better, and I reduce the rest so I don't bring the EyeSpy server to its knees.


Since July 2008, I've tracked how much I was budgeted for each evaluation — and it comes out to $40,000 in total. Of course, the real number is higher than that because we started the side hustle in 2003. And, of course, the cost of dining out has increased over the years. My favorite part of being a mystery diner is the ability to go places we wouldn't otherwise; it gets us into restaurants like The Village Pub, where we just wouldn't spend that kind of money on a dinner, let alone a brunch. We also try places we might not normally try. We go to Oren's Hummus, which is owned by the founder Mistie Boulton, all the time, but before working with EyeSpy, I'm not sure if we'd ever had Middle Eastern food.Related: I Started a Semi-Passive Side Hustle That Earns $33,000 a Week on Amazon: 'Selling There Is a No-Brainer'I also appreciate that I really have a voice. Generally, if you go to a restaurant and they treat you badly, you might ask to speak to the manager, and maybe you get comped or you get a free dessert. But I have a nuclear weapon. If I note that something isn't right, there probably will be a change. This wasn't vindictive, but one time, we went to a nice bistro in San Francisco, and our server just wasn't very accomplished. It wasn't a deal-breaker that would keep us out of that restaurant in the future or anything like that, but things weren't smooth or well done. A few months later, we went back to the same restaurant, and that same server was there, but now she was an assistant server, not the main server. So I thought, Well, they listened. And she seemed to be okay doing that; it was a better fit for her skill set. It's gratifying to know that I'll be heard because the restaurant management paid to hear it.

15,Prioritizing Your Employees' Well-being Is the Smartest Business Decision You Can Make — Here's How.,"Apr 4, 2024",Durana Elmi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/prioritizing-your-employees-well-being-is-the-smartest/466999,"
Employee wellness is more important than ever in today's fast-paced work environment. With my six years of experience leading the Cymbiotika team, I've learned employee wellness is more important than ever.Businesses prioritizing their staff's health and well-being see increased productivity, morale and overall job satisfaction, according to a 2016 article from the National Library of Medicine. Implementing wellness strategies is not only a smart move for the company's long-term success but is also a new standard to consider in a healthy workplace — so here are seven to take into consideration.Introduce meditation spacesMeditation is a powerful tool for managing stress and enhancing mental clarity. Recognizing this, companies have introduced dedicated meditation rooms, offering employees a tranquil space to unwind and refocus during the workday. These quiet areas serve as a physical reminder of the company's commitment to its employees' mental health. By encouraging regular breaks for meditation, businesses can help employees reduce stress and boost their productivity.



Related: This CEO Became a Better Leader By Harnessing a Practice Traditionalists IgnoreMake physical fitness a pillar of well-beingExercise is a key component of both physical and mental wellness. Many companies offer their employees access to personal trainers, encouraging them to incorporate fitness into their daily routines. This promotes physical health, helps manage stress and improves mental well-being. Such initiatives demonstrate a commitment to the holistic health of employees, acknowledging the strong link between physical activity and mental health.


Providing opportunities for exercise before or after work hours makes fitness more accessible and convenient for employees. It also creates a culture where health is valued and encouraged. Whether it's a group workout session or personalized training, the presence of a personal trainer can motivate and guide employees in their fitness journey.Incorporate culture-building events and activitiesPromoting holistic wellness in the workplace is about creating a supportive community. Many companies take advantage of this through internal wellness events, focusing on activities like breathwork classes and grounding exercises at the beach. These events not only celebrate the team in the office but also provide them with mental health and well-being tools. Such initiatives create a supportive environment where employees feel valued and their wellness is prioritized.In addition to these events, integrating regular wellness activities into the work routine can have a profound impact. For example, initiating yoga sessions or arranging informative talks on health topics provide a space for learning and relaxation. They also facilitate stronger connections among employees, fostering a sense of community and belonging. This approach benefits individual employees and enhances the overall work culture.Related: Workplace Wellness Isn't Just for Big Corporations. Here's How Small Businesses Can Build a Culture of Health.


Cultivate team spiritSocial connections at work are vital for a positive and collaborative work environment. Specialized team lunches provide a casual setting for employees to connect, share experiences and unwind. Such gatherings are an opportunity to build relationships and a sense of community within the team.These gatherings can be a platform for celebrating successes, sharing ideas or simply enjoying each other's company. They encourage open communication and a more relaxed atmosphere, leading to increased creativity and collaboration. Integrating social gatherings into the work culture strengthens team bonds and creates a more inclusive and enjoyable workplace.Boost morale with weekly raffles and wellness incentivesInnovative approaches to boosting morale, such as weekly raffles and wellness incentives, can have a significant impact. These activities add an element of fun and anticipation to the workweek. Raffles for wellness accessories or event tickets encourage employees to engage in activities that promote their health.These raffles and incentives serve a dual purpose: They reward employees and promote wellness-oriented activities. Participating in these raffles can be a motivational tool, encouraging employees to focus on their health and well-being. The excitement of winning and the benefits of the prizes contribute to a positive work atmosphere. This approach to employee engagement is a creative way to integrate wellness into daily work life.


Strengthen bonds with team building eventsTeam building is essential for creating a cohesive and collaborative work environment. Hosting multiple events each month is an excellent strategy for strengthening team bonds and improving camaraderie across internal teams. These events, from recreational activities to wellness workshops, provide employees with unique experiences that foster teamwork, offering a break from the routine and helping employees connect in new and meaningful ways.The nature and direction of internal events can vary in nature, but their impact on mental health and team dynamics is uniformly positive. Whether it's a group outing or an in-office workshop, these events create shared experiences that build trust, shared experience and understanding among team members. They also provide a platform for employees to showcase different skills and interests, contributing to a more dynamic and engaging workplace. Incorporating such events into the company culture can significantly enhance employee satisfaction and team cohesion.Related: Employee Morale Is More Than Pep Talks and High Fives — Here's How You Can Really Capture the Power of Team Spirit.Take employee fulfillment beyond the officeCommunity outreach is a powerful way to extend wellness beyond the office walls. Activities within your community, like a local beach cleanup, not only contribute to environmental conservation but also give employees a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Participating in these activities allows employees to connect with their community and with each other, fostering a sense of belonging and shared responsibility. This kind of involvement can be deeply rewarding, offering a break from the daily grind and a chance to make a positive impact.


Investing in employee wellness is a strategic move that yields significant returns. Businesses can cultivate a holistic approach to well-being, empowering employees to flourish both inside and outside the workplace. This translates to tangible benefits: increased productivity, enhanced morale and a more positive work environment, ultimately contributing to the company's long-term sustainability. Remember, prioritizing employee well-being has always been — and continues to be — a smart business decision.

Sleep, exercise and good nutrition are proven stress reducers and productivity enhancers, according to Harvard Business Review. That might sound simple enough, yet more than half of employees report being relatively unproductive at work, per McKinsey & Company. So what else exactly goes into unleashing creativity and optimizing performance in the workplace or in pursuit of another professional goal?Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Lewis, acclaimed author of hit titles including Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game, The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine and most recently Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon, about the crypto fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, explores just that in his new class on MasterClass.The class not only breaks down Lewis's unique approach to masterful storytelling — ""which will enhance your life in all kinds of ways,"" the author says — but it also delves into the processes that lead to productivity and success in writing-related endeavors and beyond.



Related: 'Big Short' Investor: SVB Crisis Is Accelerating Economic Slowdown""At the bottom of the best me is love. It's love of what I do; it's love of the characters, for better or worse.""One essential component? That would be the creation of an environment conducive to success, according to Lewis. You have to zero in on that space and commit to it, the author says, adding that you should choose a location ""where you feel safe."" For Lewis, that means working in his office surrounded by photos of his family. ""At the bottom of the best me is love,"" he explains. ""It's love of what I do; it's love of the characters, for better or worse. It's love of telling stories. It's love of the interaction with the reader.""Additionally, Lewis suggests minimizing all potential distractions: Remove the cell phone from your desk ""because it's only a matter of time before it buzzes or rings,"" and consider slipping on headphones to listen to a mix tape. ""The key to it all is the feeling of impossible interruption,"" Lewis says. After a while, that playlist might even have a Pavlovian effect and kickstart any working session, he adds, admitting he wrote the whole of The Undoing Project to Frozen's ""Let It Go.""Related: 10 Simple Productivity Tips for Organizing Your Work Life""It's useful to have routine, but the minute it becomes a superstition…it becomes a crutch.""Lewis also notes that we can ""learn from the smartest baseball players about the power of routine,"" but the trick is to establish a loose routine — and ensure it doesn't start to get in our own way. ""You need to insist upon the difference of routine and superstition,"" he explains. ""It's useful to have routine, but the minute it becomes a superstition…it becomes a crutch.""Lewis prefers to write at the beginning of the day because ""your mind processes problems when you sleep"" or at the end of the day (he sometimes worked from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. before he had kids). Otherwise, Lewis isn't precious about it: ""The routine is put my ass in the chair. Don't get up until I have 1,000 words. Let that be a floor, not a ceiling. If you can go beyond that, that's great.""Related: Want to Be More Productive? Stop Trying to Finish Every Task, and Do This Instead""I know exactly where I want to go so there's no snag. When I start the next day, it will be obvious where I start.""Another perhaps surprising tip from the author is to ""stop before you're actually finished"" — essentially, you want to interrupt yourself in the middle of a task when it's going well so that it's easier to jump back into it later. ""I know exactly where I want to go, so there's no snag,"" Lewis explains. ""When I start the next day, it will be obvious where I start.""And some final words of wisdom for those who have their sights set on a writing project? Although you can ""be in almost any mood when you start writing,"" it's better to edit when you're in a good one. ""Write on caffeine, edit on wine,"" Lewis says. ""Don't write on wine and edit on caffeine. That's the wrong way around. It's a very bad way to do it.""

""Why am I nervous? I know this guy!""That thought ran through my head as I prepared to interview Dr. Michael Gervais at a recording studio in SoHo.If you're not familiar with Dr. Gervais, there are a few things you should know.First: He's a world-renowned performance psychologist who works with the best in the world.This includes Fortune 100 CEOs, Olympians and musicians.Second: The guy is effortlessly cool and looks a lot like Tom Cruise. It's easy to assume he's never been in an awkward situation, ever.As we sat down for the interview I asked what seemed like a silly question.""Do you mind if I check my notes?""I have no idea why I asked that question. Maybe it's because I thought the notes made me look less professional.He replied, ""Yeah, use your notes brother, one hundred percent.""Like I said, the dude is super cool. I was relieved after his response and ready to lead a thoughtful interview. But I shouldn't have needed his permission to perform at my best.And this brief exchange highlighted why his new book, The First Rule of Mastery, is so crucial for anyone looking to unlock the best version of themselves.I was experiencing what Dr. Gervais refers to as FOPO, or Fear of Other People's Opinions.



""I think it's one of the greatest constrictors of human potential. It's the thing that lies right underneath the surface that thrusts us into wanting to be safe, wanting to be accepted, the fear of rejection.""Dr. Gervais shares why this fear has been so pervasive for such a long time.""We have a strong need to be accepted by other people, and that's biological. That goes back 100,000 years ago when we needed to fit in. That was a near death sentence if we were rejected from the tribe and somebody said 'Hey, you're not good enough.' When that happens, we're kicked out of the tribe. It's too much to, to gather, to fight, to forge, to protect. So it was a near death sentence. So fitting in was really important for us and our brains are very sensitive to that.""We joked about how it was happening in real time during the interview and I identified a few other times FOPO had already shown up that day.


As I sipped my black coffee I told Dr. Gervais about the impact ""ordering anxiety"" has on visits to coffee shops. In New York City, you better be ready to order. If not, everyone, including the staff, is going to become impatient very quickly.That anxiety is also a result of FOPO. And if we zoom out, we can identify other areas where the Fear of Other People's Opinions holds us back.As Dr. Gervais stated during a conversation with the Next Big Idea Club, ""FOPO is a phenomenon so pervasive and familiar that we often don't recognize it, even when it's influencing our decisions, our self-worth, or our perceptions of success and failure.""So, is FOPO showing up in your life?That Linkedin post you were afraid to publish.""What if nobody comments? I'll look foolish?""The excuses you make for not going to the gym.""Everyone else is already in shape, what will they think of me?""That apology you were afraid to make.""What happens if they don't care, or are still upset after?""In these instances, FOPO isn't just forcing you to order a black coffee when you really want something fancier – it's creating a negative impact on your career, health, and relationships.So, how can you stop worrying about what other people think of you?As per Dr. Gervais, the key is having a strong sense of purpose.""Connecting to something bigger than we are makes us less susceptible to the opinions and negative thoughts that follow the separate self. We become more like the ocean than a small puddle of water that's easily displaced.""Dr. Gervais played a crucial role in helping me find my purpose.Years ago I completed Finding Your Best, the online coaching program he developed along with Pete Carrol.


As stated on the website, the goal of this course is to help you, ""build a life of meaning and purpose, while also learning to push the limits of your personal performance, with our scientifically tested principles.""After completing the training I had a clear definition of the vision for my life, the tools needed to make it happen and felt the connection to a higher purpose.But it was my connection to Dr. Gervais that ultimately pushed me to take action on that purpose.I lost my son TJ in 2017, but didn't talk about it publicly.Dr. Gervais was the first person outside of my immediate network that I felt comfortable sharing my full story with.He was receptive, provided more training, then encouraged me to be a beacon for others who need help navigating life's challenges.But, just like I shouldn't need his permission to read my notes during an interview, I shouldn't have needed his permission to share my experiences with the world.I knew this was something I needed to do, but I was letting the fear of other people's opinions hold me back from helping those who could gain inspiration from my story.


Fortunately, I moved past that fear, and I did so on stage in front of 500 people at a ConvertKit conference.I opened up about losing my son, how it changed the trajectory of my life, and why I was able to enjoy so many experiences as a result of pushing through as opposed to giving up.Immediately afterwards, several attendees thanked me for being vulnerable and sharing tools they could use to navigate their own challenges.Sharing my story has made me feel less alone, unlocked incredible opportunities and built amazing relationships.And it finally allowed me to truly live in my vision without the fear of other people's opinions.Closing thoughtsWhen I first started writing this article I intended for it to be a book review, but that wouldn't do justice to the impact of Dr. Gervais's work.Instead, I decided to share my transformation, and then guide you towards the resources that can help you along your journey.There are a few ways to do that:Dr. Gervais is the first guest on my new podcast, Reclaim and Advance. You can listen to our full interview - except the part where I ask if I can check my notes - by subscribing today.And of course, you should strongly consider picking up a copy of The First Rule of Mastery. I'll share the full description so you can get a better idea of what you're in for.""FOPO shows up almost everywhere in our lives—and the consequences are great. When we let FOPO take control, we play it safe and small because we're afraid of what will happen on the other side of critique. When challenged, we surrender our viewpoint. We trade in authenticity for approval. We please rather than provoke. We chase the dreams of others rather than our own.


But it doesn't have to be this way.""

18,"6 Principles for Nurturing a Healthier, Happier Workforce","Apr 2, 2024",Milind Pant,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-leaders-can-nurture-a-healthier-happier-workforce/471515,"
One of my favorite documentary series is Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zones with Dan Buettner. I enjoyed it so much, I recommended it to all my friends and colleagues. I love how it helped uncover proven formulas that have been used for centuries for cultivating longer, healthier lives, including nutrition, daily movement, a sense of purpose and strong social networks within intergenerational communities.As a CEO of a global wellness company, it got me thinking: Is it possible to apply some of the learnings from these unique health regions in a business setting?While I've not had the chance to visit a Blue Zone myself (in fact, I was disheartened to learn that many of the Blue Zones are endangered), I have been giving a lot of thought to the role of the workplace in our health. I believe we have an opportunity, as business leaders and entrepreneurs, to nurture and grow environments where team members, customers and stakeholders can benefit from focusing on healthspan: not just living longer, but living better, healthier lives. But how do we get there?Related: 8 Ways to Foster an Environment of Employee Wellbeing



Designing a business Blue Zone Blue Zones don't just have to be defined as regions — companies, online communities and local workplaces can also be places that spark healthy aging. After all, many workplaces are communities with their own cultures and rituals that can either negatively impact our health or truly boost our well-being and longevity.The benefits of a healthy workforce are well documented: better morale, higher productivity, greater employee satisfaction, increased levels of retention and loyalty, and even better performance on the stock market.Here are six principles, borrowed from Blue Zones, that can inspire health and well-being in the workplace:


1. Providing nutritious food optionsWhile many companies provide snacks or lunches as a perk for their employees, more often than not, the foods on offer consist of highly processed junk and empty calories. Studies have shown that eating at work leads to increased weight and health risks, not to mention decreased productivity.Workplaces can encourage healthy eating habits by providing healthier (and tasty) food options and by getting creative with nutrition education and food that brings people together in workplace cafés and business meetings. At our business in China, for example, thousands of colleagues start the day by sharing healthy ""morning nutrition"" juices and smoothies.2. Instilling a sense of purpose in the workResearch has shown a connection between physical health and the ability to live out one's life purpose. And work can be a huge part of our purpose if we're able to find meaning in what we do. For business leaders, integrating purpose throughout the company's strategy and culture can provide opportunities for employees to connect with what matters to them, whether that's contributing to meaningful causes, working to improve their community or designing products and services that improve people's lives. For us, that means not only helping entrepreneurs succeed — but a shared goal of helping a billion people live healthier for longer.3. Fostering intergenerational connectionsOne thing many Blue Zones have in common is the ""village"" approach to life and work. Multiple generations care for one another and work together to achieve common goals — typically in multigenerational homes. But this concept can easily be replicated at work, particularly as the labor force ages. With five generations currently in the workforce, there's value in finding ways for all ages to connect and learn from one another, marrying deep industry knowledge and experience with innovation and new ways of thinking.


Related: 9 Ways Employees Can Stay Healthy at Work4. Encouraging community building and collaborationIn an era of remote and hybrid workplaces, forging genuine connections with colleagues and customers can be a challenge. But it is possible — and highly worthwhile. At our HQ, for example, we have a new ""Treehouse"" workspace that was designed to spark greater in-person connections and inspire collaboration among employees. But I've seen incredible results happen virtually as well — health and wellness entrepreneurs have created thriving online communities that are improving healthspan, thanks to a collective approach to healthy habits.5. Providing stress management resourcesStress at work is inevitable, but American workers are the most stressed in the world, according to a recent Gallup report. And high levels of ongoing stress are literally making people sick. Finding healthy ways to manage stress is crucial for improving our healthspan, and employers can do their part by providing resources and opportunities to practice stress reduction techniques. Personally, I'm a big believer in the power of exercise and mindfulness, but there's also a lot to be said for workplace wellness programs, health benefits and encouraging work-life balance.6. Modeling health yourselfAs a business leader navigating a demanding role running a global company, I've committed to a personal health journey inspired by many of the health and wellness entrepreneurs I follow online. And in the spirit of leading by example, I've chosen to share my journey every step of the way. My goal is to inspire others to explore healthier ways of living and working too, and I hope that more business leaders will join me in doing the same. The more we showcase healthy habits, the greater the impact we can have on improving people's lives — and our businesses.


Related: Don't Underestimate The Importance of Employee Wellbeing. Your Business Will Suffer The Most.Taken together, all of these factors make for a truly holistic approach to health at work. But keep in mind that even if you can only tackle one or two of these principles, you can still have a positive impact on people's healthspan.Designing businesses inspired by Blue Zones ultimately results in stronger companies run by healthier teams. And even if we don't live to 100, at the very least we're helping people live longer, healthier and happier lives. What could be better than that?

      Key Takeaways    



        In 2008, Vaccarella needed a better, practical beach bag — so she decided to create one herself. 
      


        The bags flew off shelves at a local boutique, but disaster struck after she invested her kids' college savings in more pieces. 
      


        Hurricane Sandy ""unexpectedly opened a door,"" leading to donations and increased interest in the bags.

Yes, I spent 26 years in commercial real estate before fully dedicating myself to Bogg in 2018.



When did you start the business, and where did you find the inspiration for it?It seems like a lifetime ago. The idea came to me in 2008, born out of a practical need for a better beach bag. I envisioned the ultimate mom bag: durable and sturdy, with non-collapsing sides, large enough to carry everything we needed and washable at the end of the day. The catalyst was a trip to the Jersey Shore and a serendipitous encounter with EVA material, which I realized was the perfect material for crafting the perfect beach bag.Related: The Remote Side Hustle a 43-Year-Old Musician Works on for 1 Hour a Day Earns Nearly $3,000 a Month: 'All From the Comfort of Home'


What were some of the first steps you took to get Bogg Bag off the ground? How did you come up with the ""Bogg Bag"" name?As a full-time working mom with no experience in bag sales, the leap into launching Bogg Bag was huge. The idea came to me as a necessity, and despite the challenge of stepping into unfamiliar territory, I was determined to give it a go.The goal initially was to patent the Bogg Bag concept and sell the idea, avoiding the complexities of manufacturing. After facing numerous rejections, I realized the only way to see my vision come to life was to do it myself.Naming the bag was simpler than you'd think. Reflecting on water, frogs and lily pads, I played around with words until Bogg stuck. It felt right, signaling a fresh start — Bogg, it's the new bag!You used your kids' college fund to bring the dream to life. What happened next?After our first batch hit a small local boutique, they flew off the shelves. At first, I wondered if it was just friends and family showing support, but I chose to believe it was genuine love for the product. Encouraged, I doubled down and ordered 600 more. Those sold out too. Feeling bold, I invested my kids' college savings into over 1,000 pieces. It was a major moment, unloading a full container in our storage unit's parking lot under the night sky. But as we unpacked, my heart sank — every piece was marred by black streaks, unsellable to the high standards I dreamt of for Bogg.

We found a new purpose for these imperfect bags. The storm had wreaked havoc on our community, so we repurposed the flawed bags as emergency kits filled with essentials for those affected by the storm, distributing them to families in need. It was a heartrending experience, but providing aid gave a new meaning to our efforts.Initially, I thought this marked the end of Bogg's journey. However, about a year later, our Facebook page lit up with messages from those recipients. Beyond their thanks, they wanted more bags — for themselves, for family, as gifts. That overwhelming response reignited my resolve. I knew then that Bogg had to make a comeback.Image Credit: Courtesy of Bogg Bag


What were some of the additional challenges you faced while building your business, and how did you navigate them?After leaving my steady job in 2018, the pressure of succeeding on my own was immense. Having been accustomed to a regular income for 26 years, the shift was daunting. I set an ambitious target: $1 million in sales for 2018. Miraculously, we hit it. Then 2019 began promisingly until Covid brought the world to a standstill. Like everyone, we were in uncharted territory with no playbook on how to adapt.While many brands shifted to online sales — a logical move in such uncertain times — we chose a path less traveled. We stayed in close touch with our retail partners, sharing in their hardships and looking for ways to support them. The Bogg Bag's unique selling point — its washability — unexpectedly became its strength during the pandemic. Hospitals purchased them for healthcare workers, schools for teachers, and stores filled them with goods for contactless pickups and deliveries as Easter approached.This approach may not have been the most profitable in the short term, but it was the right thing to do. Maintaining these relationships was more important than immediate gains. To this day, I'm grateful for the support we were able to provide during those tough times, a sentiment echoed by our partners whenever we meet at trade shows.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? What does total revenue look like now?Even in the early days of 2014 and 2015, we began seeing monthly revenue come in, albeit modest, but steady and growing. Fast forward to 2023: We hit a milestone that once seemed a distant dream, crossing over $50 million in revenue. Now, with momentum on our side, we're ambitiously setting our sights even higher, targeting a groundbreaking $100 million in 2024. This growth is a clear testament not only to our product's value but also to the incredible team behind Bogg and the unwavering support from our community. We truly have something special.

20,"After a Life-Changing Experience, This Founder Discovered the Power of Gratitude. Now She and Her Co-Founder Husband Want to Spread Positivity to Classrooms — for Free.","Apr 2, 2024",Dan Bova,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/parents-nominate-your-school-for-free-gratitude-journals/472039,"
Former school teacher, business owner and mom of four Katie Wood has seen the power of gratitude first-hand. ""Our daughter had to have life-saving surgery, which led to my mind spiraling out of control,"" she tells Entrepreneur. ""That led to me embracing the power of a morning gratitude routine. It really helped me, and when Covid hit, one of our daughters asked me about my special mornings and if she could do it, too. I searched for a kid-appropriate tool for her to use and kept coming up empty. That's when the entrepreneur spirit — which is scary but so powerful — took over, and from there, I created A Simple Seed.""A Simple Seed of Growth, Gratitude & Giggles is a morning journal to help kids — and their parents — start the day with positivity, focus and accepting themselves for who they are. ""We hear so much about anti-bullying initiatives, which are great,"" Katie says. ""But daily gratitude can have a tremendous effect that goes even further. It has been studied by the University of Kentucky, and researchers found all kinds of benefits for children. They found that kids who practice gratitude are more empathetic, less likely to retaliate or be aggressive than kids who don't practice gratitude and are happier overall.""



The study spurred Katie and her husband, Steve, who is a paramedic fireman outside of Boston, to create a school edition of their journal and launch the company's 50-in-50 Challenge. ""Our goal is to give free copies of the journal to 50 schools in 50 states,"" Steve says.The 50-in-50 Challenge works simply: Teachers or parents can nominate their school by visiting the company's site and answering a few questions about why they think it's a perfect fit. There is no ""right"" answer to who would qualify, Katie says, but she does have a soft spot for those school districts that face financial challenges. ""I was a teacher in the South Bronx,"" she says, ""and I love the idea of helping schools in underserved communities.""


The couple hopes to get these books to schools with the help of sponsors. ""This is a zero-profit project for us,"" Katie says. ""We're simply looking for sponsors to cover the costs of the production and shipping of the books. And we believe between $10,000 and $15,000 would be enough to cover the entire United States.""Related: 'We're Curating Happiness': See How This Entrepreneur Is Transforming the Wellness SpaceThe Woods say this is an easy win for sponsors who want to do good in the world and gain positive exposure in the process. ""These books will be in all 50 schools, and every parent and child at those schools will know who provided them,"" Katie says.


""The great thing is that we've validated the idea,"" Steve says. ""We've seen it in action, and it works."" A school in New Jersey was gifted the journals, and the principal reported back ongoing tangible proof that they had a positive impact.""We heard that kids are leaving little nice notes on each others' lockers,"" Katie says. ""The teachers would walk down the hall and hear kids yelling out gratitude chants in the morning. It all just confirms that gratitude can have such a tremendous impact.""Related: 'Success All Comes Down to Storytelling' How Chef Adrianne Calvo Is Cooking Up Big Business Through Podcasting and Social Media""Our goal is to do a questionnaire at each winning school before and after they get the books to find out what they learned and what was most powerful,"" Katie says.

Each school gets the chance to plant a small seed that will grow for their entire state.""

21,90% of Execs Say Providing Employee Health Benefits Will Be Unsustainable By 2030 — Here's One Solution Businesses Need to Consider,"Apr 1, 2024",Michael Waterbury,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/90-of-execs-say-providing-employee-health-benefits-will-be/469603,"
Healthcare appears to be headed for a breaking point as the cost for employers threatens to become unsustainable. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey, 9 out of 10 executives say it will be impossible to continue providing employee health benefits by 2030.Rising healthcare costs are a challenge, but not an impossible one. Employers today have options. More and more, companies of all sizes are self-funding their employee healthcare to control costs, while fully funded and self-funded employers alike are adopting high deductible health plans (HDHP) that require lower premiums.There are risks with these approaches, though. Self-funded employers who do not take care to contain healthcare costs can see their own expenses spiral. High deductibles, meanwhile, can saddle employees with greater medical debt.



However, these cost-saving measures do not need to result in an outsized risk for the employer or medical debt for the employee. Low-cost enhancements to health benefits can provide substantial support to employees in any workplace, regardless of whether their health plans are fully insured or self-funded.For self-funded employers in particular, these improvements are especially advantageous, as their expenses are directly linked to the healthcare costs incurred by their employees.


The most effective enhancement available to employers is the healthcare navigator. With a single phone call, employees who work for businesses that offer a navigator with their healthcare plans can save in numerous ways, lowering overall medical costs for the self-funded employer and helping covered workers avoid medical debt.Related: There's A New Trend In Healthcare That's Saving Money For Small BusinessesPrice comparisonPeople aren't usually aware of what their health plan covers until they need to use their insurance. That can be a stressful time to find out how much a necessary procedure costs. And it's unlikely that someone in need of medical care is going to shop around and compare prices.This is where healthcare navigators come in: They can do the comparisons for the plan participant and often find a care path that costs significantly less than the one recommended by an insurance plan or primary care provider. In this way, navigators help employees avoid certain costs that could otherwise have a devastating effect on their personal bottom lines, as well as the financial health of self-funded employers.


Bill reviewBy now, many people are aware that billing errors are shockingly common in the healthcare industry. When a patient pays a bill they aren't actually responsible for, the patient is due a refund of the overpaid amount.However, the average employee might not be aware that they've overpaid or might not have time to investigate whether they were billed in error. Likewise, a self-funded employer may not have the internal resources to do this kind of investigative work. A healthcare navigator knows how to quickly spot this type of error and can help the employee (and the self-funded employer) get the refund they are owed.Financial assistanceOften, people don't know that they qualify for hospital financial assistance. Employees might assume they're not eligible for such programs based on their income, so they don't apply, when in fact financial assistance could save them (and the self-funded employer) thousands of dollars.Healthcare navigation can guide people through the process of applying through a hospital's financial assistance portal, potentially leading to significant direct savings.


Related: How to Protect Your Money from Getting Eaten by Health-Care CostsTime savedFor the average person who isn't well-versed in the complex language and structure of the health insurance universe, trying to figure out and deal with health care costs is extremely time-consuming.Frustrating health insurance issues that would have taken a plan participant four hours to solve take only one hour with a navigator. Those lost hours of problem-solving don't just cost the employee; they can cost the employer as well by cutting into work hours and tying up HR resources.Not just for low-cost plansWhile employees on HDHPs and businesses that self-insure stand to benefit the most from healthcare navigators, there are advantages to this kind of policy enhancement for any company offering their employees health insurance.


No matter how the care is funded or what type of plan an employee is signed up for, healthcare can be intimidating. Any employer who provides workers with an ally in the fight to get the best care with the lowest personal cost is likely to build goodwill among staff and burnish its reputation as a people-first enterprise.Combining all these types of cost savings, from pre-treatment to bill review, it's possible to establish a comprehensive figure that accounts for the total savings realized by using a healthcare navigation service. Depending on the size of the company, this can add up to millions of dollars.Making sense of the complex and expensive world of healthcare requires dedicated expertise. Healthcare navigation is something that employers and employees can't afford to go without.Related: 6 Ways Entrepreneurs Can Solve the Problem of Medical Debt

23,Want to Attract Success? Don't Do These 9 Things,"Mar 20, 2024",Kelly Hyman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/want-success-dont-do-these-9-things/471131,"
Every entrepreneur has their version of what's led to where they are today. Whether it's a specific routine or tried-and-true perseverance, there's a lot of advice on the ""to-dos"" of success.But what about the things to avoid?There are as many ways to limit your success as stepping stones to lead you to where you want to be. Avoid getting in your own way and making it harder to get to your destination. There's plenty not to do to prepare for success as well. Here are nine things to avoid. Often, simply switching to a more positive mindset (eliminating negative habits) can clear the path.



1. Neglect self-careToo often, entrepreneurs focus on the grind alone without taking breaks or paying attention to their physical and mental health. This isn't sustainable and will lead to burnout or, worse, giving up on their business dreams altogether.Schedule time to exercise, sit down for meals and sleep at approximately the same time every night. These simple habits are as important as any metrics to measure your business success. By taking care of your health, you'll see the difference in your energy and outlook, which only helps fuel your growth.


2. Doubt yourselfSelf-doubt plagues every entrepreneur, at least in the beginning. Being your own boss means you need to be your own cheerleader as well. Turn to trusted peers and friends to give you constructive feedback when needed, but keep confident in your abilities.Once you begin second-guessing your choices, it becomes harder to move forward. Getting stuck due to indecision or feelings of unworthiness creates additional barriers. As entrepreneurs, there's already enough of those to deal with.Instead, explore different things and experiment with what works. Not every move will be perfect, but everyone can help you learn and improve as you go, which makes for a better entrepreneur and a better business.Related: The Biggest Threat to Your Boundaries Isn't Your Boss or Family — There's Someone Else You Need to Face First


3. Refuse to ask for helpEven if you have years of experience in your industry, stay humble enough to know when you need guidance. Trying to juggle every aspect can be overwhelming and means you don't have time to concentrate on the things that really matter.You must consider not only your trade or craft but also accounting, taxes, marketing and all the other aspects that help you grow. Whether it's advisory support from a respected colleague or outsourcing help for things like social media or copywriting to build your brand, delegating tasks helps you grow your business.4. Avoid networkingBuilding strong professional relationships leads to limitless opportunities. Expand your connections by networking with those both in and beyond your field. Start online through LinkedIn. Interact with posts and share helpful information of your own.Also, attend in-person events to meet with like-minded individuals. It will expand your business circle, and networking can be motivational as you take your business to the next step. You never know who might cross your path and who may be a valuable resource for you or vice versa.


Related: 4 Reasons Why Networking Is a Must for All Successful Entrepreneurs5. Postpone goalsTalking about ""someday"" means goals get pushed back further and further. Aiming high is great, but taking it step by step is a more realistic way to get you to your goals and continue once you reach them. Don't put off your goals because they seem out of reach today. Instead, put steps into place that can lead there so you get closer to your goal every day until you realize you've arrived at its doorstep.6. Overlook planningPlanning is the catalyst that helps you reach your goals. Without a plan, days go unstructured, and it's easy to do many small things that aren't linked to any objectives. Instead, take time at the beginning and end of each day to look at the day/week ahead.Also, prioritize deadlines. Though everything may seem urgent, trying to do it all at once means fewer things are likely to get done or, at least, get done well. Being an entrepreneur means balancing schedules to ensure you have enough creative time to dream and enough productivity time to do.


Related: 4 Strategies to Increase Your Success7. Play it safeBeing an entrepreneur already means you've taken a risk. Explore new areas where you can take the next leap and avoid getting too comfortable. It could be speaking on a panel, authoring an online article, or broadening your services.There is always another lesson to learn or another goal to create. Stay curious and eager to head to what's next. However, don't skip over the wins, big or small.Related: Want Success? You Have to Take Risks.


8. Minimize winsThere was once a time when you wanted to be an entrepreneur, and you put the plan into action to make that come true. Every time you achieve something, make sure to celebrate the win.It can be a revenue goal, a new client, or even crossing off your weekly to-do list. Looking back and adding up all the wins motivates you to keep going and lets you know you have what it takes to succeed.9. Stray from valuesAlways hold true to your values no matter how much success you achieve. When people slip away from their integrity, it trips them up and prevents future success.Stay aligned with your vision, work ethic, and how you treat people. You will go further when you align, and the wins will feel all the more worth it.

      Key Takeaways    



        Sarah Michelle Boes followed her passion for teaching into nursing school. 
      


        After passing her nurse practitioner's exam proved easier than expected, she wanted to instill confidence in others. 
      


        She put together her first course within a week of that exam — and became a millionaire within the year. 
      












This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sarah Michelle Boes, the founder of Sarah Michelle NP Reviews (SMNP), which was acquired by Blueprint Test Prep in 2022. Boes currently serves as the chief nursing officer for Blueprint Test Prep and hosts the podcast Becoming A Stress-Free Nurse Practitioner. She earned her BSN from the University of Kentucky, her MSN in Nursing Education from Western Governors University and her post-MSN-FNP from Eastern Kentucky University. The piece has been edited and condensed for clarity. Image Credit: Courtesy of Sarah Michelle BoesI grew up in rural Eastern Kentucky, and I always had this passion for being a teacher. I had my heart set on it. But my parents are teachers, and they're like, ""Absolutely not. You can't do that."" There are a lot of politics and bureaucracy within teaching. It's a lot more than just being an educator. Then, when I was a teenager, my grandmother was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. Without great access to premium healthcare in our area, we had to travel two hours to Lexington to get that diagnosis and receive a care plan that she could take back home. That was over the summer, so I went with her, and that was my first introduction to nursing at the Markey Cancer Center.



Those nurses were incredible. I feel like oncology nurses, in general, are kind of angels. Not only did they take care of her, but they also took care of me. It was just a great experience. So, knowing that I wasn't going to be able to be a teacher, I was like, Well, nursing — I feel like I could get something done. And there would be a teaching aspect because there's a lot of patient education, but I'd also get a human connection with people, which I thrive off of. So it was a no-brainer, and I attended the University of Kentucky, which guaranteed me admission to their program — and that's a really big deal.Related: This Nurse Turned $500 in Savings Into $100 Million in Sales After Sharing Her Hair Care Routine on YouTube. Now She's Revealing Her Secrets to Success.


I grappled with anxiety during nursing school. A class was notorious for weeding out people, and everyone dreaded taking it. I had a ton of anxiety in that class in particular, so much so that my instructor was like, ""I don't think nursing is for you. You're too anxious to be a safe nurse."" I had to choose to stay. The grading scale in nursing is also very different: In most programs, anything less than a 76 means you fail — and on the first exam in that class, I got a 74. I literally failed the first exam by one question. So I had to figure out how to contend with my anxiety, to think about the tools I could use.So, I started to figure out how to manage that class and my anxiety. Then, I began tutoring, ultimately quitting my full-time job as a manager to help students full-time. I taught them the skills that had helped me tackle that challenging class in a different way, and my anxiety didn't pick up again until I was a nurse practitioner — because it had been a long time since I'd taken a high-stakes exam. There was no one to turn to get perspective because I was the first nurse in my family, and I didn't know many people who were nurse practitioners.What's more, I took my nurse practitioner exam in the prime of Covid, May 2020. So it was chaos. Testing centers were down, and some places would let you take it online at home, but others wouldn't. By the time I took the exam in the middle of May, it had been canceled five times, three of which I'd already arrived at the testing center. So, there was a lot of anxiety involved. I was like, Am I ever going to take this test? My job is riding on this.Related: Nurse Makes $2 Million In One Year With Side Hustle Selling Class Notes Online


I was so stressed that I ended up breaking a tooth in my sleep because I was grinding them so hard. I was going to have to get a dental implant to the tune of $7,000; my hair was also falling out. But I finished the 175-question exam in less than an hour, and I passed. I was like, I can't believe I was stressing over this thing. This was so much easier than my nursing exam. All I needed was confidence in myself because I'd spent years in schools and hundreds of hours in clinical preparing. None of my reviews had given me that confidence.That realization — and the fact that I still had to pay for a $7,000 dental implant — motivated me to put together my first review course. I started my business because I was like, I can't afford this $7,000 implant. I figured if I put together a little review course and even just earned $500, that would help pay for it. And I started to think about how it could be done differently — how it could be less like someone lecturing you and more like studying with a friend. So, I came up with a Q&A approach, which I'd used as a tutor in nursing school and when I taught nursing students at the collegiate level.Within a week of passing the exam, I made my first three-hour course. I actually gave it out to all of my classmates for free. There were 30 of us, and I was like, ""Hey guys, I'll give you this course for free if you invite someone else into the group when I give it to you."" I gave the course to the first 100 people who came into the group. Then, not even a couple of days later, someone who had taken the course went on to pass, and it kind of exploded through word of mouth. It got wild really quickly. The first person I tried to sell it to for $25 got mad because her friend had gotten it for free, so she haggled me down to $15. Still, I made $1,000 on the first day I started selling, and I didn't even make $1,000 in a week as a nurse. I was like, What if I made $1,000 a day, every day? What would life look like?Related: Her 'Crude Prototype' and $50 Craigslist Purchase Launched a Side Hustle That Hit $1 Million in Sales — Now the Business Generates Up to $20 Million a Year


By the end of June and July, I'd surpassed what I used to make annually as a nurse. I told my nurse practitioner job I wouldn't be coming. I wanted to see how far I could take the business, but being reasonable and never having run a business before, I kept my full-time teaching job, just in case. But every spare hour I had, every weekend, was all about the business. Because I was so anxious about it being a startup, fragile and new, I waited to quit my teaching job until I made $1 million. We hit seven figures in seven months.About a year and a half in, I was still using third-party software to host my courses — nothing was in-house or really in unison. It got to the point where my students were literally breaking the software; I needed my own. We actually spent $100,000 trying to build an app that ended up completely falling apart. That was really hard, but we just kept running up against technology, and I realized I was the bottleneck to this thing. The business wanted to grow, so I started looking into other options.We considered a sale and put out some teasers, hoping to get constructive feedback. As it turned out, the test prep provider Blueprint had some internal meetings about the prospect before I even sent out the teaser. They had medical stuff, and they had LSAT stuff, but they didn't have any nursing material at the time. And I wanted to take some pressure off myself because a week into sending out the teasers, I found out I was pregnant. I never want people to think I sold because I was pregnant; it just coincided with the timing.Related: I Turned My Side Hustle Into a Passive Income Stream That's Earned More Than $1 Million — But Making Money Isn't Even the Best Part


We loved the Blueprint team, but the deal just wasn't right at first. My husband and I had decided on a number before we had a single conversation, and I'd recommend any entrepreneur do the same. Otherwise, it can be hard to navigate a deal when emotions are running high. So the first deal wasn't our number, and we walked away. Then they came back with our number, and we ended up selling around the two-year mark. That money has been life-changing.At 36 weeks pregnant, we found out that my daughter was going to have a congenital heart defect. We had no idea. So everything kind of flipped on its head really quickly. When I gave birth, the money gave us the flexibility and ability to be with our daughter when she needed it the very most. She had six surgeries in her first five months of life, two of which were open-heart surgeries. So, very crazy, chaotic times, and what a blessing to be able to have not only a maternity leave, but also a medical leave, and to be able to be fully present for that — and not only me but also my husband. We could be there together and support one another.Now, my daughter is 19 months old, and for the past year, we've been working to do a legacy gift to our local children's hospital, where they literally saved her life. Hopefully, next month, fingers crossed, everything's going to be finished, and they're actually going to dedicate the Norton Children's Heart Institute to my daughter. They are trying to build out a premier heart program there, and you have to have the funds to be able to do that. So the money gives us a lot of freedom and flexibility — my husband's also starting up his own business — but our work with the children's hospital is the most meaningful and impactful accomplishment.This article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of being a Young Entrepreneur®.

26,"She Never Wanted to Start a Business, But Chronic Insomnia Was Motivation — Here's How She Achieved 8 Figures in Sales and 8 Hours of Sleep a Night","Mar 19, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/bearabys-founder-surpassed-20m-in-sales-gets-better-sleep/471256,"
Dr. Kathrin Hamm, founder and CEO of sleep-wellness company Bearaby, never wanted to be an entrepreneur. After graduating with her Ph.D. in economics, she started as an economist at the World Bank. Her work took her all over the world and provided invaluable insight into the small, medium and women-founded enterprises she tried to convince banks to lend to — but she ""learned firsthand how hard it is, especially in developing countries, for women to get access to finance and start and grow their businesses.""During her time in India and Bangladesh especially, Hamm faced long, ""exhausting"" travel days. She'd ""never been a good sleeper,"" waking easily even as a child, and she developed a chronic case of insomnia. It began ""on a more moderate level,"" with difficulty falling and staying asleep, before the periods of wakefulness became longer and longer, motivating her to look into different solutions.Image Credit: Courtesy of Bearaby. Kathrin Hamm.



She started by investigating various mattress options, but when she dug deeper, she found an article discussing weighted blankets. The piece focused on helping children with sensory issues, Hamm recalls, but it also mentioned that evenly distributed weight on an adult body could support better sleep. Hamm was immediately intrigued — as a potential customer.Related: The No-Excuse Approach to Sleep and Work Performance for Entrepreneurs


""Let me buy a product, sleep better and then move on with my career.""""I came from a consumer lens,"" Hamm says, ""and knowing how hard it is for women to start a business, I [was] like, Yeah, I'm good here. I don't want to start a business or even think about becoming an entrepreneur. Let me buy a product, sleep better and then move on with my career.""However, the purchase process proved difficult. Unable to find options online, Hamm had to go to a pharmacy in Germany, where she's from, to place an order. Six weeks later, a ""big bean bag"" arrived. It was orange and blue and ""very noisy,"" Hamm says. She was reluctant to even try it at first and wondered if she'd made a mistake.""But then I put it on during the day on a weekend, and I just passed out after 10 minutes,"" Hamm says. ""And I woke up more than two hours later, [after] a solid nap, completely passed out, and I'm like, Wow, this is magic. This thing works for me.""


Related: Fighting Sleep Is a Losing Management Strategy. Let Your Employees Take Naps.So Hamm kept using the blanket at night, but there was a problem: Because the blanket was filled with plastic beads to add weight, she often got too hot. The underlying functionality works; the weight on my body works, Hamm remembers thinking, but how it is made doesn't work. After some research, Hamm discovered that the technology, which largely consisted of bead-filled chambers between layers of blanket, had been around for 30 years — ""Nobody had innovated anything about this product.""""Why can't you just use strips of cotton?""Hamm decided to experiment with alternative designs. She drew some inspiration from her time spent in India, ""where there's a culture of making rugs, knitting, crocheting,"" but the ultimate breakthrough came from a conversation with her mom. Hamm had been considering changing the material or adding holes for airflow when her mom said, ""Why can't you just use strips of cotton?"" They would create a thick yarn that could be knit together for natural airflow, eliminating the need for heavy artificial materials that shift around and reduce comfort. That idea led to the development of Bearaby's first small blanket, made from a cut-up t-shirt.


Confident she was onto something, Hamm opted to take a year's leave from her job to focus on the business. ""I didn't want to take too much of a risk, again, knowing that it can get really hard,"" she admits. ""[But] my boss was super supportive, and she said, 'Look, if it doesn't work out, we make a case study out of it.'""Hamm withdrew $120,000 from her retirement fund and raised just over $250,000 from a crowdfunding campaign to fund the prototypes for the first batch of blankets. She also looked into patents, but they were expensive, so she did the drawing herself, then had a lawyer put together a provisional patent application, which entitles the filer to 18 months before they have to pay more money. That went through just a couple of days before launch in December 2018; the blanket sold out in two weeks and was the only product of its kind on the market for a couple of years, Hamm says.Image Credit: Courtesy of BearabyRelated: How to Take Advantage of the 'First-to-File' Patent System


Despite the early success, the more than 50 factories that Hamm approached weren't inclined to take on the product. They'd never seen anything like it: It wasn't apparel, and it wasn't bedding. So, for that first year and a half, Hamm rented a small garage outfitted with knitting machines and knitters to churn out the first products. The strong sales helped the business continue to finance production, which was a good thing, too — because people still weren't all that interested in investing in the first-of-its-kind product.""In hindsight, we had to learn to be profitable.""Hamm leaned into the ""bootstrap"" mentality, which was a blessing in disguise. ""In hindsight, we had to learn to be profitable,"" she explains, ""to become in tune with our production processes and marketing processes, to be efficient, which sometimes you didn't see at that time in the direct-to-consumer space. Everyone was like, 'I raised that much money, and I'm putting that much million on a marketing spend.' So we never had it, but now, in an environment where money is not flowing [as] freely, we never had that money in the first place, so we are feeling pretty good right now.""Bearaby saw another major advantage in brand loyalty. Hamm notes that people seeking wellness and sleep tend to form an ""emotional connection"" with the blanket,"" and that it's easy to fall in love with a brand that helps you sleep better. Substantial interest also translated into an early retail presence. Just five months in, Bearaby was in West Elm, thanks to customers who walked in and wanted to try the blanket. That happened with Nordstrom, too.


Related: Customer Loyalty Is Your Holy Grail for Success. Here's How to Cultivate It.As Bearaby considered expansion, it centered on functional products that would uphold its commitment to quality and sustainability (the company is certified by third-party organizations, including The Global Organic Textile Standard, The Forest Stewardship Council and The Global Recycled Standard). Because anxiety so often goes hand in hand with insomnia, the company landed on its warmables line; boasting a weighted and heated neck wrap, bottle and lap pad, it ""takes the nervous system to zero,"" Hamm says.Image Credit: Courtesy of BearabyNaturally, Bearaby's products have become an integral part of Hamm's own sleep routine, and as she's gotten older, she's realized even more just how much sleep she actually needs. ""Now I sleep for a minimum of eight hours,"" she says. ""I'm training myself to get nine to 10 hours of sleep, obviously not every night, but definitely every weekend. Also, [it helps] whenever I get a chance to take a nap, like just a 20-minute nap to reset. [I make sure that I have] these conscious breaks, whether [it's] napping or deep breathing because running a business is a marathon, and if we don't take care of our bodies, we're not able to do that over a very long time.""


""Just have tunnel vision for one year, and then reevaluate after those 365 days.""Hamm's five-year marathon with Bearaby has led to over eight figures in sales and more than 10 patents — but it all started with a single, somewhat reluctant leap of faith. And according to the founder, that's exactly what it takes to be successful.""Once you believe in a product, just take a chance and give yourself a year,"" Hamm says. ""It's much more manageable if you [have] a considerable time frame where it's like, Okay, in that year, I'm giving everything I have, 100%. Because sometimes we second guess ourselves. After [a few] months or six weeks, we don't see the success, [and] we start doubting ourselves. You say [I have] one year, and I'm not asking if this is working. Just have tunnel vision for one year, and then reevaluate after those 365 days.""This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

      Key Takeaways    



        I. Roy Cohen celebrated his 101st birthday in October.
      


        The former CEO said his ambition and projects in retirement had led to a longer life.
      


        His health tips include eating fresh fish and vegetables, and he walks circuits around his home daily.

I. Roy Cohen shared his secrets to longevity.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. When I. Roy Cohen was born in 1922, his parents' farmhouse had no running water or electricity. A wood stove in the kitchen heated the entire property, and there was an outhouse for a toilet.""It was tough from day to day,"" Cohen, a second-generation immigrant to New York, told Business Insider.But his upbringing motivated him to aim high.""I remember carrying buckets of water to the chicken coops, one in each hand,"" he said. ""It was cold. 'I'm not going to live this way all my life,' I said to myself.""



Cohen, who attended a one-room schoolhouse, received a scholarship to an agricultural college — ""The only thing it didn't cover was board and lodging,"" he said — where he earned a bachelor's in microbiology and a master's in biochemistry and nutrition.Cohen had a basic childhood on a farm with no electricity or running water. Courtesy of I. Roy Cohen. via BIA pharmaceutical company hired him at a salary of $3,900 a year. He got married, had three children, and became the CEO of another pharmaceutical firm.Now 101 years old and still in his home, he's in good health. He manages his finances, oversees renovations, and is interested in philosophy.""I keep in shape, mentally and physically,"" he said.He said he'd learned a series of longevity lessons over the decades and shared some with BI.Be ambitiousCohen said he ""came from zero"" to become a CEO.


The centenarian took risks in his career, such as pivoting from research to a role in advertising at his first drug company, despite having no experience in the latter.Cohen spent his 55-year career at three companies, culminating in his role as CEO.Cohen with his wife, Joan, at a work function in the 1960s. Courtesy of I. Roy Cohen. via BIHe traveled the world — for business and pleasure — before retiring at 81.""The idea of early retirement is horrible to me,"" he said of working almost six decades. ""It's stultifying.""He said the secret to a fulfilling career — and longevity in general — included stepping out of your comfort zone.""If you want something badly enough, if you feel something's not right and you need a change, you'll find a way,"" he added.


Work at relationshipsCohen, who had seven brothers and sisters, said he learned to ""get along with other people,"" often out of necessity.His childhood revolved around relationships with his siblings.""You have no choice but to figure out how to stay stable,"" he said. ""If you live with a whole bunch of other people, you can't carry on wildly and selfishly as if you're the only person in the family.""His first marriage was annulled after less than a year. It was sad, he said, but the experience helped him reconsider the idea of a life partner.Cohen and his wife, Joan, had 3 children and 6 grandchildren together. Courtesy of I. Roy Cohen via BI""I was cautious about making that commitment again,"" he said, adding that he found ""the right woman"" in his second wife, Joan, a teacher, who died six years ago at 83.""It took a while to adjust to each other, but, like all things, you have to work at it,"" Cohen said. ""It's no good if you head down a negative pathway without communicating properly.""


He urged younger people to do the same. ""You should keep an open mind and listen to the other person's point of view.""Follow the Mediterranean Diet and walk dailyCohen thinks his longevity has a genetic element. His father and mother died at 86 and 90, respectively.Still, he said there were some simple rules he'd followed throughout his life.The 101-year-old, who said his only health issues were prostate-related, is a devotee of the Mediterranean diet, popular among wealthy executives like Jeff Bezos, who famously ate ""breakfast octopus."" Biohacking tech millionaire Bryan Johnson also follows aspects of the diet, and sells his own ""longevity"" olive oil.


While the diet is beloved by wealthy longevity-seekers, it features relatively accessible ingredients that are easy to prepare. Cohen avoids processed foods and meat in favor of fresh fish, vegetables, and olive oil.""If I want a snack, I'll munch on a piece of cauliflower, a carrot, or a red pepper,"" Cohen said. ""I eat a lot of cabbage and salad.""He said he'd long incorporated fitness into his life, starting with his work on the farm.Cohen with his wife and their first child, David, now 63. Courtesy of I. Roy Cohen. via BI""I used a pitchfork to throw bundles of hay onto the wagon and into the barn,"" he recalled. ""You're lifting a chunk of hay over your head, and it's very difficult.""These days, his exercise regimen involves 20 minutes of leg exercises while sitting on the bed every morning. He also walks ""circuits"" around his open-plan kitchen and living room. ""I do at least 60 every day.""Keep your brain agileThe centenarian said he was sorting paperwork to prepare his tax return for the accountant to submit in April.""I keep track of all my finances,"" he said. ""I tackle all the details before they before they even come up.""It keeps my mind in shape.""He said he ""constantly has a project on the go."" Most recently, he had the driveway and roof of his house redone and installed lighting in the trees.""Being busy keeps me happy,"" Cohen said.He said it was important to nurture a positive attitude with age.""People allow things that are not that important to drag them down,"" he said. ""But you can't allow yourself to be angry or jealous all the time.""He also said spirituality had helped steer him through life.""It doesn't have to be organized religion, but it's important to try at least to figure out what makes the world tick.""

In 1991, the average reported retirement age was 57; in 2022, it was 61, according to a Gallup survey of more than 1,000 U.S. adults.The increase is perhaps not surprising given recent inflationary pressure, but it paints a troubling picture of what's ahead if Americans don't set themselves up for retirement in the years to come.And a new survey from personal finance resource GOBakingRates suggests that many of them won't. The research, which surveyed over 1,000 U.S. adults, revealed that nearly 40% of Americans are contributing nothing to a retirement fund — and 30% of them say they'll never be able to retire.

29,How to Biohack Your Circadian Rhythms and Achieve Peak Mental Performance,"Mar 15, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-biohack-your-circadian-rhythm-to-hit-peak-performance/469380,"
Almost every morning, I force myself out of bed to hit the gym before work. On pitch-dark winter mornings, I can't help but feel like I'm going against nature. In a way I am — it's no secret that light is one of the most significant modulators of our circadian rhythms. If I happen to be working from Jotform's headquarters in San Francisco just after daylight saving time starts each spring, the groggy feeling is stronger than ever.While daylight savings may guarantee more sunlight at the end of the day, it also means darker mornings. That's why many sleep experts didn't agree with the U.S. Senate when it proposed to implement daylight saving time year-round (and as of the writing of this story, the so-called ""Sunshine Protection Act"" is still in limbo). Sunnier evenings may boost spending, but they don't necessarily boost health or cognitive function.The good news is that circadian rhythms are a matter of nature and nurture. There are simple behavioral tweaks we can make to optimize our cognitive performance based on our innate 24-hour cycles. As CEO of Jotform, a company that collaborates across various time zones, I try to be aware of the latest findings from circadian experts so I can do my best work wherever I am and encourage our team members to do the same. Here are some truths about circadian rhythms that have important implications for your thinking and productivity.

      Key Takeaways    



        Tremblay and Ciupka wanted to ""think beyond the industrial era five-day workweek, two-day weekend."" 
      


        After reading case studies and analyzing their own team's productivity, they decided to eliminate Fridays. 
      


        The model requires an ""experimental, progress-oriented mindset,"" but they'll never go back to a five-day workweek.
      



This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dominic Tremblay. He and his partner Ludwig Ciupka are co-founders of TUX, a creative agency that gives back through its Karma Foundation and boasts clients including Eucerin, Prada, Lancôme Paris, Make Up For Ever, Milk & Bone and Doctors of the World, among others. Image Credit: Courtesy of TUX. Dominic Tremblay.In 2021, we started to think about how we could push TUX further. We're an LGBTQ+-owned company that's been B-Corp-certified since 2017, inspired by many companies that were really innovating in terms of sustainability practices. For us, the next quest became, Could we reinvent the workweek? Could we think beyond the industrial era's five-day workweek and two-day weekend? It was a big decision, so we began the research process.

31,Top Ways I've Learned to Keep Motivation High in an Asynchronous Workplace,"Mar 12, 2024",Tom Medema,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-keep-motivation-high-in-an-asynchronous-workplace/470472,"
The asynchronous work environment was largely forced upon us in recent years, with professionals worldwide having little say in the matter. However, the continued commonality of this geographically extended workplace means we have to make sure that by cutting certain corners of traditional work, we aren't depriving ourselves of personal working life hacks and skills, such as motivation, that should be ever-present in workplaces.From my experience, intrapersonal-type skills tend to be cast aside and devalued in an async environment. Our focus for today is motivation, which is one of them. If we just stop for a second to think about prior conversations regarding our levels of motivation, I believe that most of our memories will jump to a time when a pitfall in motivation brought about the conversation, and thus, occurs at a time when it is almost impossible to successfully maneuver ourselves out of this rut, and onto an inspired, powerful, and motivated path once again.This mustn't be the case, and as a pioneer of async communication and workplaces myself through my role as CEO of Bubbles, I want to make sure we are continuously mindful and self-aware, but that we also collaborate to structure our working environments in such a way that we give each other the highest chance of success and omnipresent motivation. Let me show you how.



Related: Has Technology Killed Face-To-Face Communication? How to Navigate the Nuances of Digital Age CommunicationUnderstanding asynchronous workTo understand optimizing asynchronous motivation, we should first boost our understanding of this newfound technique. I say newfound, but in reality, async communication has been around for donkey's years (relatively speaking), with email and fax, for example, but these processes were never enough alone to fully run businesses from. This is why, with the recent influx of revolutionary async communication methods and tools, such as Bubbles, and the increasing popularity of tools like Slack, we are witnessing a new asynchronous generation and phenomenon among professionals. However, not everyone is keeping up.


In 2022, Buffer's State of Remote Work report revealed that only 38% of companies had an async-first policy, despite 52% of employees desiring an async set-up. Moving and evolving with the times is something critical in my view of a successful business, and trying to always align with what our employees want is something that should go without saying. If we ignore these lighthouse signals, we are likely to witness, ironically, things like a lack of motivation in our teams. Nevertheless, I want to focus on the instances where async has been chosen and help as best as I can, starting with some soft-skills and intrapersonal skills.Related: How to Create an Asynchronous Work CultureFlexibility and employee preferencesThe allure of remote work largely stems from its flexibility. Buffer's report highlighted that 67% of remote workers valued flexibility in time management, while 62% appreciated the choice of work location. This flexibility, however, must be balanced with strategies to keep remote workers motivated and engaged.Empathy and recognition in asynchronous workEmpathy is naturally intertwined with asynchronous working. Providing our employees with vast flexibility and choice of working locations cannot be discredited in terms of a caring approach to each individual, to the extent that these two remote benefits came at the top of an importance list in the same Buffer report. I want to note here, though, that this is not just about 'being nice' to our staff, because the reality is that we will gain masses in return for this thoughtfulness, through boosts in motivation, productivity and desire to impress. This claim that I make is not plucked out of thin air, and in fact, according to Businessolver, a staggering 70% of employees and HR professionals agree that empathetic organizations lead to higher employee motivation. Moreover, 68% of HR professionals believe employee recognition and feedback positively impact retention (SHRM). In an asynchronous setting, where face-to-face interactions are limited, recognizing employees' efforts becomes even more vital to maintaining motivation.


Here are five more strategies for maintaining motivation.1. Establish clear communication channelsClear and efficient communication is imperative for your team to thrive in an asynchronous environment. I am not just referring to the technology here, as although that is the umbrella above this, it is equally important to set expectations for response times and time-based performance.Related: Open Your Digital Doors: Communication and Remote Work2. Build this culture of recognitionRecognition excites people and boosts motivation. Professionals are aware of this to some degree, with Reward Gateway proving that 60% of employees want to see managers or leaders praising their colleagues' work more often. When feedback like this arises from a group who are looking to become a more prosperous and motivated team, we can be sure that regular recognition, whether in one-on-one sessions or daily stand-up, is something to focus on.


3. Promote work-life balanceOne of remote work's main and most widely covered struggles is unplugging after work hours. Again, encouraging a healthy work-life balance and being empathetic with after-hours communication can prevent burnout and maintain motivation.Related: Having A Work-Life Balance is Nonsense. To Reach Your Goals, Follow Another Approach4. Provide opportunities for professional growthEmployees want and need growth and development opportunities even in an asynchronous environment. Keep the conversations going about career paths, and make sure to mentor wherever you can.5. Implement flexible work policiesFlexible work policies are a key motivator, and a highly valued aspect of async, as established earlier. A PR NewsWire report also indicates that 81% of employers see improving talent retention as a motivation for adopting flexible work policies, as well as boosting the pool from which they can hire. Allowing employees to choose their working hours can increase job satisfaction and motivation, meaning you get more from less.So, I hope by now you have clocked on to the importance of not neglecting key aspects of our work lives, such as motivation. This is a lesson that is aimed at helping you and your teammates, so I hope you can go away from this motivation to instill some new values in your asynchronous workplace!

In his 2005 book, The Success Principles, Jack Canfield quoted motivational speaker Jim Rohn, saying that we're the ""average of the top five people"" we associate with. I've found this to be incredibly true. The people we spend the most time with influence nearly all our thoughts and values. Essentially, we become a reflection of them.As we identify the right people, it's equally important that we identify the wrong people. In my recent book, 6 H.A.B.I.T.S. of Powerful People, I identified four types of people that are best avoided. If you want to generate a successful and happy life, avoid associating with the following people.Related: 7 Toxic People to Avoid When Starting a Business



1. Gossips: If they gossip with you, they'll gossip about youThere's only so much airtime in conversations. When we focus on one topic, we can't focus on another. Each minute you spend discussing other people is a minute you're not spending discussing your own ideas. Often, gossips stay stuck because they're so busy talking about things they can't control (other people) that they don't make time to talk about the things they can control (themselves). When you're with them, you forego opportunities to explore your own visions of the future: things you're passionate about, what you stand for, the life you'd like to create for yourself and how you plan to make an impact in the world.Psychologist Murray Brown theorized that a two-person emotional system is unstable: under stress, it forms itself into a three-person system or triangle. Gossiping with others can be a way of building a bond with them, which serves as a substitute for bonding over something more meaningful. Sadly, when people learn to build bonds in this way (triangulating: involving a third absent party), it's hard for them to turn it off. It becomes a pattern of behavior, and this habit is hard to break.


Ask yourself how much you're gossiping with friends. Consider how you'd feel if these friends gossiped about you. If you want to feel happier in your friendships, look for new things to discuss besides other people. Talking about your recent challenges, learnings and successes usually feels good. Talking about your future dreams, goals or plans is also quite exciting.2. Liars: They'd rather save face than face a tough conversationHonesty is critically important in relationships. People who lie, especially repeatedly, break trust. Relationships built on distrust are extremely unstable. You waste valuable time wondering if what you're being told is the truth, and once again, that time is better spent building bonds of connectedness. It's possible to regain trust when it's gone, but it isn't easy and takes a lot of work.Healthy relationships are built on trust, not lies. Anyone who feels it's a good idea to deceive you instead of having a tough conversation usually lacks character. If you've lied to anyone recently, consider proactively fessing up. It might not be pleasant, especially in the moment, but telling people the truth feels good and shows your companion that you truly value them and the relationship. It also helps you get right with yourself.Related: How to Improve Your Relationships — Both Personally and Professionally


3. Dream killers: They don't support your goalsIdentifying and manifesting our dreams is hard work. Surrounding ourselves with people who don't believe in us or aren't willing to support us is a surefire way to fail. We can all do nearly anything we want in life, if we have the right level of desire, focus, determination, discipline and preparation. But associating with people who tell us our dreams are silly (especially if it's coming from someone we respect or love) makes it much harder.In 2014, I decided I wanted to become a runner. Back then, I couldn't even run a 5K. I logged hours of training and in 2015, I completed my first half-marathon. I then decided to run a full marathon. A close friend (whom I greatly admired) told me this feat would be nearly impossible for me: I didn't have the years of experience to achieve such a lofty goal. I almost listened to her. Before I did, I enlisted the advice of a few running acquaintances I'd met in the previous year. These new friends offered an incredible amount of encouragement and helped me recognize how strong and capable I'd become.I decided to listen to them instead of my close friend and ran my first marathon in early 2016. I now see I was on a slippery slope at that time. Had I listened to my longtime friend instead of my new acquaintances, I might never have run a marathon. Now, I've run 12. I found so much strength in their words. Surrounding myself with the right people at a time of major mental and physical struggle and growth helped me accomplish something remarkable (to me).Ask yourself if you have any friends who continually tell you that things are out of reach for you. Great friends will support your wildest dreams and cheer you on, not tear you down. After this experience, I decided to only keep friends who encourage my success even when it has nothing to do with their own success.

The best relationships in life are the ones where we feel safe and secure. We feel able to be ourselves. We don't feel unaligned with our core values. Any person who feels comfortable putting you in uncomfortable situations so they can advance a selfish motive isn't a friend. Think about your friends. Do you have any who routinely put you in dangerous or uncomfortable situations that don't result in your growth? Or encourage you to compromise your values? If so, it's time to reevaluate.Keep these kinds of people out of your life, and I guarantee you'll be happier and more successful. Even though it can be hard to tell a toxic friend goodbye, your life will improve because of it. The discomfort of making the decision and having the conversation is well worth the benefits that come from being choosy about the company you keep.

36,Women's History Month: 5 Powerful Women Who Paved the Way for Others,"Mar 1, 2024",Kelly Hyman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-powerful-women-who-paved-the-way-for-others/469422,"
March is Women's History Month, which, according to the official website, is about ""commemorating and encouraging the study, observance, and celebration of the vital role of women in American history."" While this deserves attention year-round, it still calls for a highlighted celebration.A rising number of prolific women continue to pave the way for others, including those in the legal field. By setting a precedent cemented in law, they've changed the trajectory of cases for the future and left the door open for other life-changing actions and opportunities to take place.Whether they were first in their profession or ruled on a case that changed history, here is a brief look at how women have emerged in the legal field, where they still face challenges and a few of the many women who have made their mark.



Evolution of female attorneys in the U.S.Between 1950 and 1970, women made up less than 5% of attorneys in the U.S. This percentage began to slowly increase over the following decades, though it wasn't until 1991 that women attorneys reached the 20% mark. But, in 2022, the number of women attorneys was still at 38%.The conversation regarding gender diversity has been a harrowing road for females to compete against their male counterparts for wage and partner equity and appointment to prestigious groups and positions. According to a 2019 ABA study, the following was reported:


48% of women missed out on a desirable assignment compared to 11% of men54% of women were denied a salary increase or bonus compared to 4% of men75% of women experienced demeaning comments, stories, or jokes compared to 8% of men82% of women had been mistaken for a lower-level employee compared to 0% of menThese discrepancies make the perseverance of women in law even more admirable, as they've overcome setbacks hindering them from the beginning. And, as the world changes and more women are being admitted to the bar and finding their way to the top of their field, it's inspiring for others to follow suit.Related: The Biggest Challenges Women Entrepreneurs Face1. Ruth Bader GinsburgRuth Bader Ginsburg is heralded for her fight for women's rights and gender equality. She is famously noted for saying, ""Women belong in all places where decisions are being made."" After attending Harvard Law School, she eventually transferred to Columbia Law School, graduating top of her class in 1959. Following graduation, she taught at Rutgers School of Law before becoming a legal partner with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in two gender equality cases, including Reed v. Reed in 1971.Reed vs. Reed was a landmark decision that found the law's dissimilar treatment of men and women was unconstitutional, and discrimination would not be allowed. Ginsburg became the founding counsel of the ACLU's Women's Rights Project and was appointed to the United States Supreme Court in 1993.


2. Sonia SotomayorNominated in 2009 to the Supreme Court by President Obama, Yale Law School graduate Sonia Sotomayor became the first Latinx and third woman to be appointed. For years before the appointment, she served as the Assistant District Attorney in the New York County District Attorney's Office before entering into private practice.One of Sotomayor's most notable cases is Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc. This case involved a disagreement between Major League Baseball (MLB) teams and players over compensation for the loss of ""free agent"" players. Her ruling on the baseball salary cap in 1995 restored the terms of the previous labor agreement and ended the MLB strike by opening day for the 1994-1995 season.Related: 3 Ways to Prevent Imposter Syndrome From Ruining Your Business3. Ketanji Brown JacksonA 1996 graduate of Harvard Law School, Ketanji Brown Jackson was confirmed as the first Black woman and first former federal public defender of the Supreme Court. Before the appointment, she served as a judge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.


Further, during her time as a commissioner for the U.S. Sentencing Commission, she was part of retroactively applying the 2020 Fair Sentencing Act, which allows those with extreme sentences for prior drug convictions to seek reduced sentences.4. Charlotte E. RayIn 1872, Charlotte E. Ray became the first Black female attorney in the U.S. She graduated from Howard University and was the first woman to be admitted to the District of Columbia bar. Though she faced inevitable challenges due to her race and gender, she argued a case in the D.C. Supreme Court in the case of Gadley v. Gadley three years after being admitted to the bar. Through her perseverance, she set a precedent for other female lawyers in other states to be admitted to their respective bars.Related: 5 TED Talks by Powerful Women Leaders That Inspire and Motivate5. Anita HillAttorney and professor Anita Hill likely has the highest notoriety from her 1991 testimony. At the time, she spoke in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual harassment she experienced from then-Supreme Court Nominee Clarence Thomas.


In her testimony, she alleged inappropriate conversations and sexual advances by Thomas during her time as his legal advisor. As a result, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which solidified employee protection against workplace discrimination.

37,"This 'Clairvoyant' Thought Exercise Can Help You Make the Right Choice in Just Seconds, Says Google's Former Chief Decision Scientist","Mar 1, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-make-better-decisions-fast-from-a-former-google-exec/470478,"
We've all been there. It's time to make a decision, and you're stumped. Which choice is the right one? Whether it's a big decision or small, feeling a sense of analysis paralysis isn't uncommon, even among so-called ""experts"" in making tough calls: 57% of newly appointed executives said that decisions were more complicated and difficult than they expected, research from Harvard Business School found.Just like anything else, decision-making is a skill that can be learned and honed for better results — inside and outside of the workplace. But too often, the decision-making process isn't given due attention; instead, it's left up to the highest in a chain of command who doesn't fully understand the implications of a choice, sometimes to the detriment of the whole.""People treat decision-making as something that just happens, and there's also such a hierarchical aspect to it,"" Cassie Kozyrkov, former chief decision scientist at Google and leader in the decision intelligence space, explains. ""When it's so tied in with hierarchy as opposed to skill, you do get a little bit of overlooking the fact that there are skills that you could bring to it.""

""Decision intelligence is [about] turning information into better action at any scale, in any setting.""Kozyrkov, who holds graduate degrees in mathematical statistics, psychology and cognitive neuroscience from Duke University and North Carolina State University, helped train and build data science teams at Google. These days, she's a trusted advisor to business leaders at Fortune 100 companies; an outspoken advocate for the need to ""stand up to AI,"" an issue of negligent human decision-making at scale; and the CEO of Data Scientific, which provides expert advisory and consulting services for AI.""For me, decision intelligence is [about] turning information into better action at any scale, in any setting,"" Kozyrkov says. ""There's the stuff that happens to you that you, by definition, can't do anything about; [you] can't see it coming. And then there's what you do have control over — and that's the quality of your decisions.""Related: Let Go of These 10 Things and Start Making Better, Faster Decisions


In her Decision Intelligence LinkedIn course, Kozyrkov breaks down the science of decision-making. The first part delves into the basics of improving technique — no special tools or resources required. One of them relies on a decision science concept known as the value of clairvoyance, Kozyrkov says. ""This isn't about crystal balls or psychics,"" she adds. ""It's a thought exercise people forget to make, particularly in the data setting.""The exercise goes like this: Imagine that you have access to an all-knowing psychic who could give you all the information you need to make the best decision, then consider how much you'd pay them for those details. ""If you find yourself answering with a small number, that is a strong signal to you that you shouldn't be investing in a whole lot of data, going through a whole lot of process,"" Kozyrkov says. That's when a ""go with your gut"" approach can be more effective than a deep data dive.""If you know these three things, you know a lot about the [AI] system.""With the rapid development and adoption of AI, Kozyrkov is particularly interested in ""the decision-maker behind the curtain."" When the technology isn't used for basic organization or record keeping but instead to automate decision-making at scale, leaders have the potential to ""impose [their] will on a million decisions,"" Kozyrkov says. That's when it's crucial to analyze precisely how data is used and decisions are made.


Kozyrkov has developed a set of questions to help people gain that understanding; she calls them the ""Kozyr criteria."" ""[They're] the decisions that create an AI system,"" she explains. ""If you know these three things, you know a lot about the system. You know a lot about its risks and how it might benefit some people more than others, for example. And you know a lot about what could go wrong with it right off the bat.""The first question to ask is, What is the objective of the system? ""That is very much a subjective question that a decision-maker has to answer,"" Kozyrkov says. ""There's no one true, right answer for it.""Next up, consider the provenance and schema of the data. ""Of course, we would love to go and examine your data set,"" Kozyrkov says, ""but it's not like you're going to show it to us. So tell us please where you got it, how you got it, perhaps how you checked it. Did you have a diverse set of individuals checking it for problems? What do you know about where it came from? How much are you relying on it?""Finally, How do we know that it works? ""What were the criteria, and under what conditions was it tested? If you are told that some food is safe and you find out that it's only ever been eaten by cats, you might worry about whether it's safe for you as a human, but if no one tells you how it was tested and where and under what conditions, you have very little to go on,"" Kozyrkov explains.


Related: These Decision-Making Tactics Can Help You Formalize Your Process and Make Better Choices""It always comes from humans. There's no way to remove the human.""Kozyrkov admits that these criteria are ""deeply subjective"" and dependent on what the decision-makers in question are trying to achieve. However, allowing AI to be ""faceless"" and ignoring the fact that people are sitting in a room and influencing the technology's behavior opens up the potential to harm billions of people.""It always comes from humans,"" Kozyrkov says. ""There's no way to remove the human, but sometimes you just scale up a human so much that it boggles the mind that people can be scaled up that much — [and] we forget that there are humans behind it. [That's why] I would love to have a decision-intelligence-first approach.""

A possible ransomware attack on a unit associated with UnitedHealthcare — the largest insurer in the U.S. — has upset drug prescription orders at thousands of pharmacies for the past week.The cyberattack, detected February 21, targeted Change Healthcare, a division of United's Optum; two senior federal law enforcement officials said it looked like a foreign country had undertaken the attack, The New York Times reported.Related: The Jaw-Dropping Range of Cybercrimes is Due to the Gap in the Cybersecurity Workforce



Change, which was acquired by UnitedHealth Group for $13 billion in 2022, is responsible for roughly 15 billion transactions a year, spanning U.S. patient records and prescriptions across dental, clinical, and other medical areas.

      Key Takeaways    



        Gooljar began arranging the flowers his roommate brought home from Trader Joe's in 2020.
      


        He grew the IRIS blossom Instagram account to more than 40,000 followers and has made over $500,000 in just a few years. 
      


        Gooljar is on a mission to keep growing and lift up other diverse creators along the way.
      












""I've always been an artist,"" Rob Gooljar, founder of IRIS blossom, says. ""I've always been a creative person. I've done a lot of mixed media, painting, drawing, music, photography, but my medium shifted to floral.""In 2020, Gooljar was struggling with depression while working toward his Ph.D. in urban, social and economic geography, and he credits his then-roommate Becca Whittier as ""the catalyst"" for his new creative outlet. Whittier would bring flowers home from Trader Joe's, and Gooljar would arrange them.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom



Arranging flowers became a passion, and Gooljar decided to start an Instagram to bring others along on his artistic journey, especially those who might feel excluded from an industry known for lacking diversity. The average florist in the U.S. is 47 years old, and most of them are women (77.2%) and white (77.3%), according to data from Zippia.With his social media platform, Gooljar put out the kind of representation he wanted to see: ""Hey, I'm a queer Black florist — kind of, not really. I'm just playing with flowers, but watch me, and let's see what happens.""

Now His Creations Are Beloved By Celebrity Chefs — and Can Sell for More Than $1,000.People saw Gooljar's posts on the Instagram account, which grew from zero to more than 40,000 followers, and began asking to buy arrangements. In the past three-and-a-half years, the self-funded company has fulfilled thousands of orders and made more than $500,000 — but it's just the beginning.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossomGooljar is expanding IRIS blossom to South Florida, where he moved last year, while Whittier and two employees continue to helm the company's operations in Greater Charlotte. Meanwhile, he's working with another business partner, Jihann Hanchell, to get IRIS blossom's sister business, island IRIS, off the ground in Turks and Caicos. The idea there is to offer ""full-scale design"" for luxury events.""He was really kind, but looked at me and was like, 'Well, you're not going to get a business loan.'""Gooljar isn't entering into these floral ventures ""blindly,"" he notes. He also has a holding company and a consulting firm. Still, despite Gooljar's entrepreneurial savvy and IRIS's track record of success and growth, its journey hasn't been without some serious challenges. Two of the biggest barriers, according to Gooljar? Funding and space. And in the floral industry, those tend to go hand in hand.


""It's very hard for small businesses to exist in Charlotte without being pre-existing,"" Gooljar says. ""Pre-existing meaning that A, you come from money or B, you have somebody to help you. So we worked out of our two-bedroom apartment [when] we were doing events that were $15,000-$16,000, and we were doing it on our kitchen island that was six-and-a-half feet long. We had buckets all over the house.""IRIS blossom has been ""100% self-funded"" from the start and able to accomplish all it has thanks to its supportive clients, Gooljar says. The revenue earned goes back into the company's growth, a strategy that's helped it achieve its milestone of $500,000 in revenue in just a few years. But in the early days, Gooljar did try to secure a business loan — and was turned away.Related: This Black Founder Stayed True to His Triple 'Win' Strategy to Build a $1 Billion Business""I had a white banker in Charlotte, and he was really kind, but looked at me and was like, 'Well, you're not going to get a business loan because you have to be in business for a few years,'"" Gooljar recalls. ""And then I would ask, 'Well, how are people who are just starting a business getting a loan?' 'Oh, they probably have an online presence, or they probably just go into it with money, and then they can put up their own money.' That kind of quasi, not-really-plausible explanation about funding and gatekeeping funding.""


Affording space in Charlotte remained a significant obstacle. Eventually, Gooljar and Whittier moved into a three-bedroom apartment. But there still wasn't enough room for the rapidly growing business, and Gooljar didn't want to spend all the money they made on rent. At one point in their search for a reliable place to store their expensive, perishable materials, someone offered to rent them an Airstream travel trailer for thousands of dollars a month sans air conditioning or running water.Now, Gooljar lives and works out of a house in Florida.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom


""It's cool when people look at me, and they're wondering if my business is working out: All I can do is smile and say, 'You know, it is.'""Throughout his time building IRIS blossom, Gooljar says he's ""stepped on a few toes"" within the gatekept industry and has had to field some pointed questions: ""Well, who are you?"" ""Is your business going to last?"" ""How's your little business going?"" ""How's your flower thing going?""But none of that has deterred Gooljar, who comes from a ""very long line of people working hard.""""My grandma cut sugar cane for 40 years in Trinidad,"" Gooljar says. ""My parents came here with nothing and worked and tried their best. And I'm trying to change that tide. So yeah, it's cool when people look at me, and they're wondering if my business is working out: All I can do is smile and say, 'You know, it is, and I'm putting in the work for it.'""

Now She Has $25 Million in Funding — and Smart Advice for Fellow Black Women Founders.Gooljar admits that ""there's still a long way to go"" in transforming the industry into a more inclusive space, but he's happy to report that other diverse floral businesses popped up in Charlotte after his own — because ""there's room for everybody.""""I see some of the landscape changing, especially when I go into the floral cooler, and I see somebody else that's Black, or I go into the floral cooler, and I see somebody that's young, or I go in there, and I see somebody with pink hair or something,"" Gooljar says.""You have to face those obstacles and keep pushing because there's always going to be people who are preying on your downfall.""Next, Gooljar plans to implement a national subscription program for IRIS, a sort of ""color-by-numbers"" approach. He'll ship the flowers nationwide, and customers can follow along with his arrangements via video. ""I want people who don't feel creative in their current jobs or current lives to get that creative outlet just the same way that I needed that outlet,"" he says.In the long-term, Gooljar's goal is to collaborate with a tech company to make it possible for people to order IRIS flowers on an app ""like they do an Uber."" But even though Gooljar envisions IRIS as a wide-scale service allowing employees to run ""little mini IRIS blossoms out of their own homes,"" quality remains a top priority.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom

It's not always easy, and Gooljar admits there have been ""plenty of times"" he wanted to give up, but he's always kept going — never wavering in his belief that great things are on the other side.""You can ask anyone that I know, and they will tell you that they don't know anybody that grinds the way that I do,"" Gooljar says. ""And I'm not saying that you just have to throw yourself into everything all the time. But I think a big part of this is that you have to face those obstacles and keep pushing because there's always going to be people who are preying on your downfall. There are always going to be roadblocks. There are always going to be obstacles. There are always going to be things to climb, but you have to just keep going.""

43,How Learning to Take Care of Myself Helps Me Take Care of My Business,"Feb 23, 2024",Nellie Akalp,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-learning-to-take-care-of-myself-helps-me-take-care-of/468820,"
In the constant bustle of entrepreneurial life, the idea of self-care too often takes a back seat. That happened to me. However, I realized that self-care was crucial for my personal well-being and the success of my business.I've now learned to embrace self-care because it calms, refreshes and energizes me, ultimately making me more focused and productive. Here are some tips that helped me.Related: Self-Care Isn't Selfish — It's Essential for Sustaining High Performance. Here's How to Avoid Burning Out.



The consequences of self-neglectNeglecting self-care can lead to burnout, a common issue among entrepreneurs. Many business owners don't like to admit having felt burnt out — but I will.Our business was steadily growing when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. As it continued, my typically upbeat attitude began to erode. I felt so isolated being confined to home. I got sad when Covid-19 prevented my kids from having their regular high school graduation.


Many people experienced something similar. But entrepreneurs are used to being in control, and Covid-19 took that away from us. The impact was profound. Losing control made me feel even worse, and I started feeling burnt out and experiencing daily severe highs and lows.Burnout can impact entrepreneurs even without a once-in-a-lifetime trigger like a global pandemic. The key is recognizing when you're burning out before your flame extinguishes. Do you know the signs? According to the Young Leaders Of The Americas Initiative (YLAI), here's what to look for:Lack of creativityFatigueReduced productivityAnxietyDifficulty concentratingHeadachesChange in appetite or weightNegative attitudes toward employees or familyDifficulty sleepingAre you stressed or anxious?You cannot solve the problem unless you uncover the root cause. As our business started to suffer, it was crucial to stop the spiral. Like most of America, we were working from home. I finally realized that although my husband and I had run two successful companies together since college, we could not work in the same room.I was beyond stressed — I felt anxious. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), it's essential to know the difference between stress and anxiety.


Stress is ""generally a response to an external cause, and goes away once the situation is resolved."" Anxiety is a ""persistent feeling of apprehension or dread that doesn't go away and interferes with how you live your life.""The symptoms of stress and anxiety mimic those of burnout. If you identify with the above signs, act now by taking back control of your life.Related: 8 Self-Care Tips From Wildly Successful EntrepreneursTaking control with self-careI realized I had to stop ceding my power and seize control of what I could. First, my husband and I started working in separate rooms in the house. That helped alleviate one source of my anxiety, but I turned to self-care to eliminate the rest.


Self-care is vital for all business owners, but especially for women who often juggle professional and personal responsibilities. Too often, we think of self-care as ignoring others. But self-care is not self-indulgence. Once you accept that it's about making a strategic investment in your success, you can start on the road to recovery.I needed a plan and sprang into action. Food had become one of my coping mechanisms, so I created a daily exercise plan and committed myself to healthy living. I also needed to restore my balance and found meditation was the answer. I now meditate twice a day for about 30 minutes.There are many misconceptions about meditation. Let me try to dispel them:You can meditate whenever you have time. Even three minutes will work.Sitting like a pretzel is not required. Just find a comfortable position.You don't need a mantra or a goal. Just let your mind go.You can use guided meditation or do it on your own.Meditating worked to eliminate my anxiety, sharpen my focus, and boost my productivity. Meditation is so effective at stress reduction that we incorporated it into our workplace and added 10-minute meditation sessions to our team-building activities. This helps enhance collective focus and morale and fosters a culture of wellness.


There are other options for exploring self-care:Rediscover the joy of playfulness: Return to a forgotten hobby, buy an adult coloring book, tackle a jigsaw puzzle or play with Legos. Reconnect with the simple pleasures that ignite your spirit.The sounds of silence: This is particularly hard for entrepreneurs, but set aside time to unplug and disconnect from social media and technology. Savor the peace and clarity that silence can bring.Challenge your comfort zone: Learn a new skill or language. Take dancing or cooking classes. Embracing the discomfort of learning something new can restore your confidence and expand your capabilities.


Practice random acts of kindness: Volunteer at a local charity. Get your staff involved. Become a SCORE mentor. Anonymously pay for someone's coffee. Helping others can get you out of your head.Related: Worried That You Don't Have Time for Self-Care? Here's How to Fit It Into Any ScheduleYou may also need to revisit your stressors. Are you overworked? Feeling isolated? Try:Surrounding yourself with mentors, peers and friends who understand the entrepreneurial journey can offer perspective and alleviate your isolation.Setting realistic goals for your business and personal life. Break larger goals into manageable steps.Learning to say ""no"" is one of the hardest things for entrepreneurs to do. But turning down business when you're overwhelmed allows you to better serve existing customers.Delegating gives you time to tackle crucial work tasks and invest in self-care.While there's lots of advice for self-care all over the internet, remember you're an entrepreneur and should redefine it to fit your needs. Self-care is not a one-time activity, but an ongoing journey of exploration and discovery.

44,How Taking Up Boxing Transformed My Outlook on Entrepreneurship,"Feb 20, 2024",Sam Saideman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/3-lessons-i-learned-about-entrepreneurship-from-boxing/469096,"
If you pursue anything hard in life, you've likely dealt with sacrifice, whether that's a sacrifice of personal health, mental health, relationships, time or finances. Likely while chasing that goal, one or more of those things have suffered. When asked what surprised him most about humanity, the Dalai Lama said, ""Man. Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health."" He goes on to get far more philosophical and far more depressing, but the above quote is a great testament to the power of chasing dreams without being mindful of what you need to not just survive, but thrive.Now, that's not to say making sacrifices in pursuit of goals isn't a good thing — it's usually necessary. But being intentional about what you're giving up for what you're trying to get is how one lives a life without regrets. This is something that has remained relevant in my daily work to become a better leader, and while I've grown over the years of running businesses and learned along the way, nothing has made me grow and learn more than getting in the ring.A little over a year ago, I was reconnecting with an old friend from college, and he mentioned his new fascination with boxing. I had been around it as a teenager with friends pursuing it, but it had never been something I actively took part in. He convinced me to go with him and retry it in my adulthood. New Year's resolution and all, I went, and the rest was history. That one day in Nashville's Fighters Boxing Gym hitting heavy bags sparked an obsession which has resulted in boxing becoming a large line item on my expenses, more than half my laundry and most of my personality.



Here are the three most important lessons I've learned so far from the squared circle.Related: Knockout Personal Branding Strategies From Mayweather and Pacquiao


1. Resiliency is mandatory for successWorking in a startup environment where every deal matters and sparring in boxing are more alike than you think. For one: You have to have thick skin. No matter how much we try to ""cut off the ring"" with better services and have the client ""on the ropes"" with making a purchase decision, sometimes the potential client changes their direction and hires someone else. Those punches, while they may not hurt as much if you focus on each individual hit, but over several rounds, they start to add up. Learning to keep fighting and not accept defeat is how you force the fight to a decision without getting KO'd. In other words, if you're not resilient and you didn't stumble on hidden treasure, you likely won't last long in business.As an entrepreneur of a startup that never took on investment, my back has been against the ropes more times than I can count. This key lesson of staying resilient and not taking ""no"" for an answer has allowed me to stay determined and motivate my team to develop new verticals without having to close shop or lay people off. I attribute my ability to pivot my company to offering influencer marketing campaigns to brands and musicians/labels in a large way to boxing. Staying adaptable and being unwilling to throw in the towel. Boxing took me there.2. Focused time spent learningFocusing on learning is necessary for all great battles. There are no cutting corners on this one. If you don't put the hours in, you won't prevail. That goes for the time in the ring or in the boardroom. You need to work on the basics of being a good leader as much as you need to work on the fundamentals in the gym. Muhammad Ali said, ""The fight is won or lost far away from witnesses — behind the lines, in the gym and out there on the road, long before I dance under those lights."" Muhammad Ali would've been great in any profession. If you don't carve out uninterrupted time to improve, you won't improve.In my years as an entrepreneur, I've struggled to find uninterrupted time for growth. Digging into redlines, a client calls me. Working on a proposal, an employee asks me a question. Learning the importance of unavoidable ""offline"" time has made me more demanding of that in the workplace. I am now able to whiteboard, learn about new lanes or do whatever else I need to without compromising or being half distracted. If you're distracted while boxing, you'll feel it (literally). If you're distracted at work, you'll feel it differently — but both are equally detrimental to winning.


Related: 7 Lessons From the Boxing Ring3. Your corner can make or break youA boxer is usually only as good as his corner. To be truly great, you need a great trainer and cut man, just like an entrepreneur needs great leaders within their business and advisors outside of their business. The people you surround yourself with in either realm must be people who can be supportive and are also not afraid to speak their minds when things need improving. I'm far deeper into my entrepreneurial journey than my boxing journey; however, the coaches I've spent my time learning from, hitting mitts with, and sparring at The Punch Club in Los Angeles and Fighters in Nashville, have been the same type of people I try to surround myself with in business. Don't be afraid to make changes if those people aren't the right fit.It's easy in the workplace to be okay with keeping things the way they are. Justifying actions that shouldn't be justified because of busyness. Boxing has taught me that every voice in the room can make or break winning or losing. It's helped me to be more proactive with making changes when things aren't working.So the next time you're exhausted, worried about staying on your feet and the bell rings — or the Google Calendar alarm dings — be ready to fight with everything you've got left. I know I will be.

Danielle Cohen-Shohet.When did you start your side hustle in the self-care industry, and what inspired it?



My interest began when I did freelance makeup artistry out of my Princeton University dorm room. I've always had a passion for design and art, and for as long as I can remember, I have been entrepreneurial. I have a tendency to want to become an expert at something I do, so when I became interested in makeup, I took it much further than most and started a side hustle in college. During that time, my twin sister and I also pursued a digital receipts payments venture. Those were both enriching experiences; however, I had no idea at the time that I'd later take a leap and combine those interests to start a software payments company now worth over $510 million.Related: These Sisters Started a Side Hustle After a 'Light Bulb' Moment Standing in Line for Coffee — Now Their Business Has Done $100 Million in Total Sales


What were some of the first steps you took to get that side hustle off the ground? I learned voraciously, strived to be the best and just rolled up my sleeves to start. Back when I was in college, makeup artistry tutorials were just starting to be democratized on YouTube, so I dove into them and just got my hands dirty practicing. I drilled college classmates and friends for feedback and just kept getting better from there. It sounds simple, but these first steps helped me succeed faster.Were there any challenges that came with running the side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those? Anything that you can grow from will have challenges. While doing makeup artistry, I experienced first-hand the pain points that many of our GlossGenius business customers face today: time management, coordinating schedules and growing a client base without the proper infrastructure, just to name a few. I dove headfirst into solving these challenges with manual spreadsheets and tools that I would hack together, which sparked the idea for what would later become GlossGenius. I wanted to provide other business owners with best-in-class technology and infrastructure that would make it easier to run a business.


How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue? On average, how much revenue did it bring in? For me, it was originally more so about satisfying a creative interest than revenue. It took several months before I started to earn real revenue, and it was meaningful enough to cover a lot of living expenses while in college.Related: She Spent Her Honeymoon Working on a Side Hustle. It Raised $35 Million and Counts Celebrities Among Its Investors.When did you decide to transition into startup mode and found GlossGenius, and what motivated that move?


After understanding the problems facing service-based self-care businesses, I decided to start a software company that would solve many of these problems with technology. I had graduated college and started a career in finance at Goldman Sachs, but I kept thinking about how to help self-care entrepreneurs run better businesses. It was really hard to manage a client-first business when there were so many scattered, disconnected systems.I had taught myself how to code, so I felt as if I could do anything. After getting a couple of years of experience at Goldman, I took a leap and left to start GlossGenius. Given the industry experience, my technical background and the digital receipts payments company I had pursued with my twin sister — who is my partner and chief business officer at GlossGenius — it just felt obvious to put all of this into a software payments company focused on the self-care industry.Image Credit: Courtesy of GlossGenius. Danielle Cohen-Shohet and Leah Cohen-Shohet.How have you approached scaling the company? 


Before we could even think about scaling the company, we first focused on solving a real problem that is a critical part of our customers' lives. There is so much opportunity to empower entrepreneurs to run, manage and scale their own local businesses. Our platform impacts customers' livelihoods, and our solutions are an important part of their everyday lives. That focus was foundational to have in place before scaling.With that in place, one of the things I did early on was learn everything about the business: Building products, launching products, recruiting, marketing, closing partnerships, handling customer support tickets and much more. Having a deep knowledge of all parts of the business has been important to scaling the company as it has helped me understand what excellence looks like in all parts of the business. With that type of understanding, I could surround myself with fantastic people and leaders to take teams even further.Related: The Sweet Side Hustle She Started 'On a Whim' Turned Into a $20,000-a-Month Income Stream: 'It's Simple, It's Affordable and It's Fun'Because there are so many problems to solve for businesses, we also had to remain disciplined in solving the most important problems for customers first. So as we've scaled, we have continued to flex discipline and only pursue initiatives that create value for our customers. We say no often and are thoughtful about how we sequence what we pursue. We obsess over our customers' needs and absorb their feedback like a sponge, as it plays a key role in driving GlossGenius' growth and new products. Keeping the connection with our customers as we've scaled is something I'm really proud of.


When you look to GlossGenius's future, what are you most excited about? We are creating a gateway for entrepreneurship, giving self-care business owners the infrastructure to scale their businesses and empower more entrepreneurship. While we've already built a platform that is mission-critical to our customers, there is still so much for us to do to achieve our mission. With the responsibility of serving over 65,000 businesses and powering billions of dollars of transaction activity, we are working to make our software products more intuitive and magical for customers.The recent launch of our GeniusAI, a generative AI-powered tool, is a good example of this. This tool helps beauty and wellness practitioners draft ready-made, personalized email marketing campaigns, enabling users to simply enter a few notes and receive messages tailored to their goals and brand. In an industry that has traditionally lagged in technological adoption, it is exciting that we get to be the company that puts this in customers' hands. Another recent GlossGenius product launch is Genius Loans — fast, flexible financing that helps customers grow their businesses. Products like this underscore our support of customers with what they need, when they need it — well beyond what's typically expected from SaaS platforms.What are some of the biggest lessons you've learned over the course of your entrepreneurial journey? 


I've learned that true success means helping others succeed. I am fortunate to lead a company that's so tightly aligned with our customers' success. With the opportunity to build and lead GlossGenius, I've had a masterclass in learning the special framework of how to make decisions that build long-term value for customers.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill. It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.Do you have any advice for people interested in starting a side hustle or business of their own? Be fearless. Don't take no for an answer. And importantly, surround yourself with like-minded people. You might find this through a community like the one we've created for entrepreneurs with GlossGenius, or you might look to people closest to you. I've had many close supporters along the way, but my strongest collaborator is my twin sister, Leah. She has been a thought partner from day one and has played an invaluable role in expanding the company into what it is today. So surround yourself with people who get you.

I dipped one toe in the water and a sharp pain shot through my system. Knowing that I'd never be able to ease my way in, I quickly slid the rest of my body into the freezing cold water. I took slow, deep breaths — experts say this signals to your brain that ""I'm okay"" and prevents you from going into flight or flight mode. But as my mind ran circles around the physical sensations, I felt anything but okay.Then a funny thing happened: a minute passed, and it felt ever so slightly easier to stay in the water. Thirty seconds later, I emerged with a strange and surprisingly pleasant feeling of calm. I had survived my first cold plunge — and was already wondering when I'd do it again.Cold plunging is just one example of biohacking. A term borrowed from the ""tech hacker"" ethos, it's the science of tweaking your physiology and nervous system for optimal performance. Some types of biohacking may seem extreme, exhibitionist even — like when someone plunges a syringe in their hand to inject themselves with a genome-altering substance. But there are also more subtle techniques that anyone can start using today; that I have incorporated into my routine to perform my role as CEO of Jotform to the best of my body's ability — without losing my mind. Here is a closer look at some of those techniques, plus why I've become a believer in biohacking.

47,"In the Age of Instant, Here's Why Leaders Must Learn the Art of Patience","Feb 15, 2024",Hanif Lalani,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-leaders-must-learn-the-art-of-patience/469302,"
In my exploration of yogic philosophy, I have found particular resonance in the concept known as pratyahara. Its translation from Sanskrit is ""the conscious withdrawal of energy from the senses"" — broken down to its most simple interpretation; it is the practice of redirecting our awareness from the external world to the inner experiences.Today, our culture prioritizes immediacy and constant engagement, and as a result, pausing for reflection is increasingly becoming a lost art. Although pratyahara's origins can be traced back thousands of years, its importance has only grown as sensory overload becomes more common. Instant results have become the norm throughout many aspects of society, and our ability to practice patience is waning.I have found that leaders often grapple with impatience more than most. The inherent traits that make us effective in business — decisiveness, ambition and a drive for results — can also create a breeding ground for a heightened sense of urgency and restlessness. We are under considerable pressure to meet the high-paced demands of the modern business landscape, and there is an expectation for instant solutions, accelerated growth, and immediate responses.



Additionally, the pervasive influence of technology and the era of instant communication have created an environment where waiting has become a rarity. With the ability to send messages across the globe in seconds and access information at the touch of a button, impatience has become a byproduct of this culture of immediacy, and leaders often feel the weight of these expectations more intensely than most.Now more than ever, we as leaders need the ability to navigate uncertainties and make thoughtful decisions. Cultivating patience gives us the mental space to pause and reflect before making choices. It encourages a careful consideration of options and potential consequences. This allows us to differentiate between decisive actions stemming from a thoughtful evaluation of the situation and impulsive reactions driven by the moment's urgency.


Related: Harness the Power of Patience to be a Better LeaderDeveloping mindfulnessAs with most things, the first step to developing patience is becoming mindful of the feeling itself. We often attribute our impatience to external factors beyond our control: someone is taking too long in front of you at the grocery store or getting stuck in bad traffic.While it may seem natural to attribute impatience to external events, our emotional responses, thought patterns and mindset play a large role in how we experience and express impatience. When you understand that your reaction is still within your control, you can be empowered to reshape your internal responses to them.Beginning to cultivate patience starts with setting an intention to identify when impatience arises within you and what situations most commonly bring it forward. Even before starting this exercise, you can probably already think of a few scenarios that trigger those feelings of frustration and restlessness such as being placed on hold or having to listen to someone take what seems to be an interminably long time to explain something.


Related: Why Mindfulness Matters for EntrepreneursExpectations vs. realityImpatience often occurs when reality isn't conforming to our expectations. We expect that project timelines will not be delayed, meetings will start promptly, and deliveries will be on schedule. We expect people to behave as we want them to, promptly responding to emails, meeting deadlines as promised, and actively contributing to meetings. The dissonance between these expectations and the unpredictability of real-world situations is where impatience can grow.Related: The 5 Most Important Cognitive Biases Holding You BackMind-body connectionAfter pinpointing the sources that trigger your impatience, you can then explore how impatience manifests in both your mind and body. Simply suppressing impatient feelings will only exacerbate the problem; instead, work on becoming familiar with the physical sensations that accompany them. Is your stomach in knots, or are your shoulders suddenly tensed all the way up next to your ears? Have you clenched your fists or tightened your jaw?


The physical expressions of emotions serve evolutionary purposes, preparing the body to respond to challenges. However, in modern life, these physiological responses can sometimes be disproportionate or misaligned with the actual circumstances. Understanding the mind-body connection is an important factor in developing strategies to manage our emotional and physical responses to impatience.Shifting attentionOne of the most practical tools available to develop patience is to shift one's attention. You are not your emotions, which means that you have the power to control how you are reacting in a given scenario. Impatience is unarguably unpleasant, so consider what you would rather feel instead. While calm is often seen as the opposite of impatience, achieving this shift can be challenging. Instead, explore alternative emotions such as curiosity or compassion. Curiosity allows you to engage with the present moment, finding interest in the details of your situation. In contrast, compassion towards yourself and others creates understanding that can soften the edge of impatience.Rediscovering presenceSo much of our lives have become automated. Technology has allowed us to streamline tasks that once required concentration and time to complete, and while this has certainly created new efficiencies, it is important not to allow ourselves to also run on autopilot. Understandably, when we become used to distractions, the idea of being present in the moment without external stimuli can seem unappealing. Our culture values constant activity and busyness, and slowing down and dedicating time to mindfulness inevitably clashes with that.However, mindfulness can be a valuable tool for cultivating and strengthening patience. It does not have to involve taking up a yogic practice or dedicating extensive hours to meditation. At its core, mindfulness is simply the conscious choice to observe your thoughts, sensations and surroundings without judgment, allowing for a heightened awareness of the present moment. Leaders today must resist the urge to fall in with the age of instant gratification, choosing instead to practice the dying art of patience through their actions and decisions.

49,This Obscure Product Gained Viral TikTok Fame and Soared to $125 Million in Sales — But 'Steering the Cult' Can Be 'a Little Scary',"Feb 12, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/how-tiktok-turned-the-pink-stuff-into-cleaning-product-gold/469604,"
In 2018, The Pink Stuff was a relatively unknown cleaning product with a niche market, produced by Star Brands for only a few hours each month at a factory near Birmingham, England.That changed when Sophie Hinchliffe, an Essex, England-based hairdresser with a penchant for cleanliness, began sharing her home cleaning routine on her Instagram account, @mrshinchhome — eventually, soaring demand landed The Pink Stuff in 30,000 retailers worldwide, The New York Times reported.Related: 5 Tips to Help Curious Marketers Get Started on TikTok



Hinchliffe's practical and friendly cleaning advice, featuring The Pink Stuff, resonated with her audience on Instagram. Her followers, now 4.8 million strong, tuned in to watch grime disappear under the guidance of their relatable ""scrubber in chief."" And although Hinchliffe never made the jump to TikTok, Pink Stuff-related videos did and have been viewed more than 2 billion times, according to Star Brands.@myaa.nic Realistic bathroom clean ASMR #DoritosTriangleTryout #realisticcleaning #cleaningtiktok #cleantok #floorscrub #thepinkstuff #thepinkstuffcleaning #fullbathroomclean #realisticcleanwithme #showerscrub #cleaningasmr #spongesqueezingasmr #scrubbingasmr ♬ original sound - Myaa.nicCustomers eagerly awaited restocks, and soon Star Brands had to significantly ramp up production. Operations expanded to running three lines all day, doubling the workforce, and pushing international sales to new heights. Today, The Pink Stuff is sold in 55 countries and is available at major retailers like Walmart, Home Depot, and Amazon, where it retails for $4.99, with annual sales quadrupling since 2018 to about $125 million, per the NYT.The Pink Stuff joined an ever-growing list of products that have gained popularity on social media for their ability to offer viewers a ""life hack,"" often one that most people didn't even know they needed, such as desktop vacuum cleaners, car trash cans, or a stainless steel watermelon slicer, all of which found an audience on the platform, per Good Housekeeping.However, brands that rely on virality as their sole marketing strategy might find themselves in a tough spot when the novelty wears off and viewers move to the next big thing. Henrik Pade, a managing director at Star Brands, admitted to the NYT that The Pink Stuff's virality is ""a little scary"" because there isn't much control over messaging.Related: TikTok Is the New Normal. 5 Reasons to Add TikTok to Your Content Marketing StrategyMarina Cooley, a marketing professor at Emory University, told the outlet that brands should focus on loyalty for a more sustainable approach.""It doesn't sound like there's an adult in the room, steering the cult,"" she said of Star Brands.

When people talk about retirement, typically, they're referring to a linear path: Go as far as you can in your career, turn a certain age and leave the professional world for good. It might be the traditional model, but these days, it doesn't work for everyone — for several reasons.More than half (56%) of American workers believe they're behind on their retirement savings, according to a recent Bankrate survey. Meanwhile, since the beginning of 2020, prices of everyday goods and services have increased about as much as they did in the full decade prior to the pandemic, per Bloomberg.Related: This Is the Key to the Retiree Lifestyle You Want — and the Income You Need

51,What The NFL Teaches Us About Creating a Winning Team,"Feb 9, 2024",Daniel Rosenrauch,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-the-nfl-teaches-us-about-creating-a-winning-team/465510,"
Building a successful business is remarkably similar to building a winning football team. As an avid football fan and CEO, I've seen how both realms require a deep understanding of identity and purpose. This article explores how we can draw parallels between these two worlds to foster a purpose-driven culture in our businesses.The parallel between business and footballMuch like business, football is not just about the raw talent or resources at hand; it's about how these elements are harnessed toward a common goal. In football, the early weeks of the season are a period of self-discovery. Teams experiment, learn their strengths and build upon them. Similarly, a business doesn't inherently possess a culture from day one.Related: 4 Traits of Winning NFL Teams That Work in Business



Identifying core values: The foundation of a teamIn football, a team's identity is often rooted in its core values — whether it's resilience, teamwork or innovation. In the business world, these values are equally critical. They serve as a compass, guiding decisions and behaviors. At Viirtue, we realized the importance of aligning our corporate values with our overarching goal of simplifying technology purchases. This alignment became the cornerstone of our culture, ensuring that every team member was working towards a unified vision. Even for some who have a skill set that is extremely niché, this mindset can help them find purpose. For example, on an NFL team, there is a position called the long snapper. This player only plays a few snaps a game but can have an instant impact on the final score, either positive or negative.Encouraging individuality – the key to a dynamic cultureOne of the unique aspects of our corporate culture is the emphasis on individuality. Like a football coach who recognizes the unique strengths of each player, we believe in empowering our employees to bring their full selves to work. This approach has not only enhanced our innovation but has also created a more inclusive and dynamic work environment. Sometimes, you may have team members who confuse encouraging individuality as an excuse to not commit to the mission or to not present themselves to customers as a professional. As a leader, you must make it clear these go hand in hand. Pro sports teams often tout the mantra ""look good, feel good, play good."" We have encouraged that within our team.


Mission clarityIn football, clarity of each player's role and how it contributes to the team's success is paramount. In the business arena, this clarity is just as crucial. My company ensures that every member understands the broader mission and how their individual efforts contribute to our collective success. This clarity fosters a sense of purpose and belonging, driving both individual and team performance. Our team members truly understand that they are at the core phase of an imminently large software company. They understand our mission is not easy, but the reward is completely worth the effort.Building connections in a remote worldThe challenge of building a cohesive culture is magnified in a remote work setting. Taking cues from sports teams, which build camaraderie through shared experiences, my company invests in regular team gatherings. These events are more than just meetings; they are a celebration of our shared journey and achievements. By flying everyone in for an annual event, we create a sense of unity and family, which is invaluable in a remote work environment.Aligning incentives with visionJust as a football team aligns incentives with performance and team goals, a business must ensure that its reward systems are in sync with its vision and values. My company created an incentive structure that not only rewards individual achievements but also reinforces our collective goals and values. This approach ensures that our team remains focused on what truly matters – our mission to simplify technology for our customers. When we implemented our core values, we didn't send our team a list and make them memorize it. Instead, we created a core values contest and awarded the winner who exemplified those values monthly with an American Express gift card. This allowed us to spend time educating the team on our core values without it feeling forced.Related: The Secrets of a Former NFL Player's Journey to Entrepreneurship


Authenticity and sustainabilityIn both football and business, authenticity is key. Fans and employees alike can discern when a team or a company is not true to its stated values and mission. It essential to ensure that your culture, goals, and practices are not just a facade but also a true reflection of your beliefs and commitments. This authenticity has been central to my company's success and resilience.Building a purpose-driven culture in business, akin to cultivating a successful football team, is a multifaceted endeavor. It requires a deep understanding of one's core values, a commitment to individuality and inclusivity, clarity of mission, strategic team-building, aligned incentives, and, most importantly, authenticity and sustainability. By embracing these principles, just as a well-coached football team achieves greatness on the field, a business can realize its vision, driven by a team united in purpose and passion.

53,Fear Can Hold Us Back – But It Can Also Drive Us Forward. Here's How to Turn Fear Into Fuel.,"Feb 6, 2024",Mohammad Farraj,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/fear-can-hold-us-back-but-it-can-also-drive-us-forward/468284,"
Fear is one of the most natural emotions. In fact, according to Medical News Today, ""The fear response has kept us alive. It is primal, and we should respect it. At the same time, it can be unpleasant and interfere with people's day-to-day functioning.""It often holds entrepreneurs back from pursuing their dreams and ambitions — according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 75% of all ventures fail within their first decade. However, fear should not be the reason that any business fails. Fear can be rooted in a combination of stress and anxiety, which can become a serious mental health issue.To overcome the stress of fears and find success, detach emotions from decision-making. Be rational and focused when choosing a business and planning for success. Though challenging, my experience in starting a business offers insights. Confidence in tasks eases stress. As a new restaurateur, immersing myself in business tasks boosted my confidence and expanded my skills — and it can help you, too.



Related: 11 Fears Every Entrepreneur Must OvercomeHow I balance work and lifeI recall hearing a folk song from the '60s that said, ""Our life is more than our work, and our work is more than our job."" That is exponentially true for me, as the co-founder of a restaurant franchise, as a physician and as a husband and father.


It is important to separate all of our several ""selves,"" compartmentalize them and give each of them the attention they deserve, while attending to the needs and desires of those we care about: our spouses, children, colleagues and in my case, the co-founder of my business.Here are three ways I compartmentalize:When you are at work, be focused on work — request that family and friends only communicate when there's an emergency during work time. The new iPhone voicemail screening feature can help you avoid distracting interruptions.When you are at home, be present with your family — that might mean no devices at the dinner table.When you are out with friends, be a friend — listen, share and enjoy their company.One of the most challenging periods of my entrepreneurial journey was in the early days of launching my food truck, while simultaneously pursuing my degree in dental school and caring for my family.The truck had just begun gaining some traction in the local community. Juggling truck responsibilities, dental exams and family life was challenging. Balancing fresh ingredients, academic deadlines and family time felt like a daily tightrope walk. Despite the difficulty in compartmentalizing tasks, focusing on achieving balance allowed me to succeed. It's normal to feel you could have done more, no matter how hard you try to fulfill all duties.


Related: Warning! Technology Is Sucking Your Time Away from Your Success Putting the ""I"" in teamChances are, if you started a business, you began by identifying your personal strengths and weaknesses and assigned yourself a role in the organization chart for your new business that you had confidence you can master. Setting myself up for success as much as possible, I chose to delve deeper into the marketing aspect of the business while allowing my partner to focus on his strength in operations.Discovering oneself in the business realm involves:Self-reflection: Entrepreneurs benefit from deep self-reflection to identify strengths, values and passions. Crafting a bio for our website forced me to delve into my core.Self-care: Entrepreneurs often neglect self-care, but it's crucial to take mental and physical breaks when under pressure. A brief walk around the block helps manage stress effectively.Self-scheduling: Act as your own best boss by scheduling dedicated ""me time"" daily. Harvard Business Review emphasizes the importance of giving yourself permission for self-care. I use this time for creative tasks, forming a great creative team with me, myself and I.Related: 8 Self-Care Tips from Wildly Successful Entrepreneurs


Getting help when fear of failure becomes anxietyThe three fears all new entrepreneurs share are:Fear of financial lossFear of failureFear of the unknownIn launching my franchise restaurant, I conquered financial fear by investing only what I could afford to lose. Despite the daunting prospect of using my personal credit card amid student loan pressures, clear vision and strategic planning allowed me to decide confidently. Alternatively, you can explore options like applying for a small business loan, providing a lump sum to be repaid over time.There are three basic ways to combat the generic fear of failure all entrepreneurs face:Get real: Confronting failure as a very real possibility is the way to avoid it. What we did was identify all possible causes that could lead failure, then reverse-engineered them — that means do what needs to be done by understanding exactly what not to do.Make a plan: A comprehensive, well-structured plan can instill confidence and help mitigate fears by outlining strategies and contingencies. For example, my goals as chief marketing officer included innovating our social media and furthering its growth to increase our audience reach. I looked to improve our Google metrics.Ask around: Seek guidance from mentors, advisors or experienced entrepreneurs. Start with your current network first. While I had brothers and a father who have started and ran successful business, I would never hesitate to ask for advice and help. Reach out to the local chapters of SCORE, the SBA or your chamber of commerce. Related: Getting Over the Fear of Being an Entrepreneur


The key to overcoming fear in starting a new business is to recognize that while fear can hold us back, it can also drive us forward. Research has shown that fear of failure can also motivate greater striving for success. However, combatting the more serious mental health challenges of entrepreneurial stress requires emotional fortitude and often, professional help.

Many people are familiar with the term ""helicopter parenting,"" where parents become over-involved with their children's lives in an attempt to ensure their safety and success.

Enter ""benign neglect"" — a parenting style that nurtures independence in children.

55,A Japanese Wellness Technique Could Be the CEO's Secret to Health and Productivity,"Jan 31, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/the-science-behind-forest-bathings-productivity-benefits/466427,"
In Walden, Henry David Thoreau observed that ""We can never have enough of nature,"" and one of the things I love about working at Jotform's San Francisco headquarters is how accessible nature is. I can take a quick bike ride to a handful of beaches, as well as a pier crowded with sea lions. If I feel like hiking, tall peaks beckon in just about every direction. If I drive about a half-hour north, I can reach Muir Woods National Park, which is more than 550 acres of dense forest. That last spot, in particular, is perfect for what's termed ""forest bathing,"" which, along with morning sweat sessions and power napping, helps me play a longer, happier, more productive and healthier game as an entrepreneur.First term-conceptualized in Japan in the 1980s, forest bathing (shinrin-yoku) was the product of a government campaign to encourage people to find respite from then-rampant tech-boom burnout by taking advantage of the country's extensive protected forests. The idea was, and is, to immerse oneself in the woods and absorb its surroundings using all five senses — to see the trees and take in their colossal magnitude, as well as smell the leaves, listen to the natural sounds, feel the fresh air and taste foraged goods (with an appropriate eye on safety).Related: 7 Reasons the CEO Should Get Outside to Exercise

56,"A Former McKinsey Consultant Used This Not-So-'Sexy' Mindset to Take Her 'Healthy Indulgence' Snack Brand From Her Kitchen to 4,000 Retailers","Jan 31, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-deuxs-founder-uses-a-tech-mindset-for-massive-growth/468958,"
Sabeena Ladha, founder and CEO of the ""good-for-you"" snack brand DEUX, has a ""pretty deep relationship with junk food."" That's ""kind of a funny thing to say,"" she admits, but her childhood in the small town of Euless, Texas, where her father ran a gas station and convenience store, kicked off the passion for snacks that would help shape her professional endeavors.""My parents worked 24/7,"" Ladha recalls. ""They're immigrants, so they had that hard work ethic built in them. So he was working 12-, 14-hour days, six, seven days a week, and on the weekends, my sisters and I would go to the gas station, and we would get to pick a snack. I always picked one salty and one sweet snack."" They weren't necessarily the most healthful choices, but at the time, those products weren't quite as ""villainized"" as they are today, she says.Image Credit: Courtesy of DEUX. Sabeena Ladha. 



Although Ladha ""looked healthy"" as a high school athlete who played basketball and ran track, she quips that her ""insides were made of partially hydrogenated oil and trans fats."" It wasn't until college that she dove into health and wellness, even starting a blog ""before it was cool"" to unpack juice cleanses and cryotherapy.Related: After Being Diagnosed With Cancer, She Created a Cookie That Would Help Her Eat Cleanly and Satisfy Her Sweet Tooth. Now, Her Products Are Sold in 25,000 Stores.


""Not everyone wants to eat a salad for every meal of the day, so how do you help people make slightly better decisions?""""[I was] trying to make the scary world of wellness a little bit more approachable for Sabeena in Texas,"" Ladha explains. ""Not everyone lives in Los Angeles and has access to 18 farmers markets on a Saturday. That's just not realistic. And not everyone wants to eat a salad for every meal of the day, so how do you help people make slightly better decisions?""Answering that question ultimately led Ladha to the ""healthy indulgences"" concept of DEUX. The hot-pink brand offers cookie doughs, dessert spreads and donut holes that are vegan, gluten- and preservative-free and contain ""functional ingredients"" like vitamin B12 to support sustained energy and L-Theanine to help with cognitive function and mental focus.Image Credit: Courtesy of DEUX


Ladha was ready to ""break the rules"" and innovate in the snack space, but she credits much of her success with the fact that she learned those rules before she broke them. Her previous experiences working on Frito-Lay at PepsiCo, managing a P&L at Diamond Foods, consulting at McKinsey & Company and launching brands in venture capital helped build a strong foundation for her entrepreneurial journey.Related: The Founders of This Paleo, Gluten-Free and Vegan Brand Say It Succeeded Because of Its Restrictions""[Experimenting with scale] required some capital because there's a lot of waste that comes with that.""Ladha started experimenting with chocolate chip cookie dough in her kitchen in June 2020, when the pandemic was well underway, and many people wanted to graduate from the ""sourdough and wine phase"" and indulge in healthier ways, she says. Today, all of DEUX's cookie doughs have a similar base, incorporating oats, nut butter, flaxseed and coconut sugar.


But one of the biggest challenges in those early days was figuring out how to scale DEUX's perfect recipe with a manufacturer. ""You would think it's [just] math, right?"" Ladha says. ""Like, you just scale up the recipe into making 3,000 pounds instead of one pound. And it really did not work like that. It got drier; it got a little bit more dense. It wasn't as sweet. So you have to then go through iterations, and that required some capital because there's a lot of waste that comes with that too.""Related: This Entrepreneur Believes Courage Is the Key Ingredient for SuccessInitially, Ladha didn't want to raise capital; she put $20,000 of her own money into the business and resolved to test the product first. Ladha was more than willing to pivot if the idea didn't gain traction, noting that she ""wanted an idea that would work"" rather than one that had to be ""force fit"" into the market. But DEUX was ""profitable on first ship,"" and once Ladha realized the serious potential there, she decided to raise.Image Credit: Courtesy of DEUX


To date, DEUX has raised about $6 million. The company's first fundraising round kicked off in January 2021, and Ladha says that capital — and the ability it gave DEUX to produce at a significantly higher volume — made it possible for her to appear on Shark Tank after its producers reached out. Ladha didn't land a deal on the show, but DEUX has continued to see tremendous growth in the years since.""[If you] take that kind of tech mentality and bring it to food, it will just help you understand if there's actually product-market fit.""DEUX has transitioned from an exclusively direct-to-consumer (DTC) brand to one with a significant retail presence in Target, Whole Foods, Sprouts Farmers Markets and more. DEUX hit 1,000,000 units sold last year and more than doubled its store count to 2,600 in 2023. And in the first half of 2024, DEUX will see that figure skyrocket again with the launch of donuts at major retailers nationwide, totaling more than 4,000 stores across its three product lines.Ladha says that retail will make up the ""lion's share"" of DEUX's revenue this year but stresses that DTC remains important for the brand for two reasons: data collection and marketing opportunities. The former helps the business understand who its customers are and which flavors resonate with them, and the latter has allowed it to explore brand collaborations, like its recent Buttercream Sugar Cookie with The Skinny Confidential.


Image Credit: Courtesy of DEUXRelated: Freshly's Founder Ditched Wall Street to Start a Restaurant in Arizona With His Parents. It Failed, But He Pivoted to Build a $1.5 Billion Business.Now, Ladha is focused on making DEUX a household name — ""full stop."" She envisions it as a ""better-for-you Nestlé"" with a modern twist and says a not-so-""sexy"" ""tech mindset"" is helping it get there.""It sounds much cooler to be like, 'You know, I was just making this cookie dough for my friends and family, and then I went to a farmer's market, and Whole Foods discovered me, and now I'm at Whole Foods now nationally,'"" Ladha says. ""That's a cooler story, right? But if you can collect data and test and learn and take that kind of tech mentality and bring it to food, it will just help you understand if there's actually product-market fit. That's why I joke, 'Don't do it — but see if you should do it.'""

Retirement should be a time of relaxation and enjoyment, but for many Americans, it's a source of financial anxiety.More than half (56%) of American workers believe they're behind on saving for retirement — and 37% feel they're ""significantly behind,"" according to a recent Bankrate survey.But where people choose to live out their golden years can make or break their retirement. A new study from WalletHub reveals the best states for retirees, evaluating crucial factors like tax rates, cost of living, access to quality healthcare and fun activities.

3. Virginia looks after its seniors' well-being with robust elder abuse protections and highly regarded medical care. The state has a reputation for being tax-friendly without estate or inheritance taxes and also boasts miles of shoreline, low crime rates and clean air.4. Delaware has one of the lowest tax burdens nationwide. Its significant senior population translates to a strong sense of community and minimal social isolation. It also has the lowest poverty rate among seniors aged 65 and up.5. Wyoming stands out for its commitment to elder safety, clean air and a sense of community evidenced by high senior volunteering rates. It also has low tax burdens, with no estate or inheritance taxes.Image Credit: christiannafzger | Getty Images. Snake River near Jackson, Wyoming. Related: Looking to Retire?

59,How Mindful Eating Can Supercharge Dynamic Thinking,"Jan 27, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-mindful-eating-can-supercharge-dynamic-thinking/467506,"
Entrepreneurs are ever in search of ways of reducing the number of decisions they make, in part to save brain space for the ""big stuff."" Some thought leaders pare down their wardrobe to a standard look (à la Steve Jobs), for example, while others optimize (and not necessarily healthfully) by eating the same thing every day.A novel take on this efficiency principle came in the form of a Bay Area company that marketed a product called Soylent in 2013. Tired of wasting money and energy on food, one of its founders, Rob Rhinehart, invented a ""super sludge"" intended to supply the body's essential nutrients — a mixture of maltodextrin, amino acids, fiber, olive oil and other ingredients. According to a journalist from Wired, that original formula looked like pancake mix and tasted like chalk.After reading that article, I could grasp why the concept could be regarded as potentially dystopian (its name inspiration, after all, a 1973 movie in which humans are forced to consume reprocessed human corpses), but Soylent is still going strong. The company, now based in Los Angeles, continues to grow and innovate (now offering tastier options like chocolate and strawberry). Its success supports the notion that busy professionals will spring for convenience when it comes to their appetites.



I'm a big proponent of simplifying as many tasks as possible. And while no stranger to the occasional lunch-replacement smoothie, I'm not sold on outsourcing meals entirely. Luckily, for food-loving entrepreneurs, there are creative benefits to thinking more about and diversifying what and how we eat.Related: 7 Tips for Startup Food Entrepreneurs


Ingredients for creativityAs something of a counterpoint to Rhinehart-esque food practicality, a 2021 literature review written by a team of researchers and academicians offered evidence to suggest that people with a view of food as simply fuel miss out on the creative benefits of eating more mindfully. Engaging multiple senses during a meal (taste, smell, tactile qualities, etc.), they wrote, can boost creative thinking in various ways, and offered the experience of wine as an example: Those who enjoy it think about taste, smell, color and mouthfeel, and might come up with descriptive metaphors for each. Creative wheels start turning. It follows that engaging with food by paying attention to analogous qualities (and any metaphorical associations) may likewise boost inventiveness.The authors also made a case for eating foods that result in genuine enjoyment. Creativity is enhanced, they suggest, when people feel happy, including being relaxed or moderately excited. So, to borrow a phrase from author Marie Kondo, consider foods that spark joy when you eat them. Maybe it's your partner's famous lasagna (which gets even better the next day as leftovers), a burrito from a favorite food truck or a big, colorful salad.Eating something delicious and taking the time to appreciate it can prime the brain for exploration. Better yet, certain foods can actually boost the brain's power.Related: Your Poor Eating Habits Are Hurting Business


Nutrition that sharpens the mindThe first rule of thumb for choosing meals that give rise to sharp thinking is to think about them beforehand: to make choices before you're ravenous. Various studies make plain that humans are far better at resisting salt, calories and fat in the future than in the present.Glucose, a type of sugar, is the main energy source for the body's cells, and it's worth keeping in mind that brain cells use the most energy. But when it comes to glucose, not all foods are created equal: Some release theirs quickly, leading to a sudden spike in energy (and an equally fast plummet). Members of this ""simple carbohydrates"" family include pizza, pasta, bread and sugary drinks. Others, termed ""slow carb foods,"" release glucose gradually, among them starchy vegetables (sweet potato, squashes, beets), whole grains, beans and legumes.Other foods are linked with memory and cognition. Research published in a 2014 edition of the Journal of Psychiatric Research revealed that the amino acid tyrosine (the precursor of the ""feel good"" hormone, dopamine) enhances cognitive performance, particularly in short-term stressful or cognitively demanding situations. So, load up on seaweed, bananas and almonds. Other research has found that the plant-based omega-3 fat, alpha-linolenic acid, which is abundant in walnuts and flaxseed, likewise improves memory and cognition, as do the antioxidants in berries. Foods high in choline and folate, like eggs, are linked to improved cognitive performance and memory. A 2014 study published in the British Journal for Health Psychiatry found that young adults who ate more fruits and vegetables reported boosted well-being, more intense feelings of curiosity and greater creativity.The bad news is that, in the real world, we don't always have time to prepare balanced meals, but it's actually a cinch to supplement whatever you're eating with nutrient-packed options. If I have pizza for lunch, for example, I'll add a handful of almonds for a snack. If there's a bagel for breakfast, some olive oil seaweed chips will be added later in the morning. The goal is balance. I also automate snack selection by programming delivery orders ahead of time. That way, when my stomach rumbles, I reach for brain-boosting dried fruits rather than a bag of M&Ms.


Related: Fueling Your Body is Key to Fueling Your BusinessAs CEO of Jotform, and the author of a book on automation, I understand the inclination to optimize as many tasks as possible. If I want to carve out time for important creative work (aka ""the big stuff"") and reserve more hours to spend with my family, something has to hit the chopping block. But I also believe in the tangible and intangible benefits of being thoughtful about what I eat — I would rather invest time in identifying and automating busywork than skipping a lunch with colleagues or friends. If you are what you eat, after all, then wouldn't it simply be wise to make that food high-quality, enjoyable and creative?

The power of positivityLife becomes your story with every thought, action and decision. The art is in the narrative.

So, we should welcome change as an opportunity for reinvention and, in doing so, put ourselves in a better position to fully exploit the fluid and unpredictable nature of dynamic environments.

And a misstep into a minor setback on the road to achieving your goals.Cultivating resilience in the face of adversityResilience is the secret sauce of entrepreneurial success. Because the risk of failure is always present, feeling a continuous spring of resilience in the face of challenges can create opportunities to bounce back from inevitable setbacks in a more robust, more powerful, and engaged way. By looking at other resilient individuals who have succeeded in the face of unrelenting adversity, we can gain insight into practical strategies that can be leveraged to build resilience and use adversity as a launching pad for future possibilities.Nurturing authentic connectionsAs you pursue success, genuine connections and meaningful relationships are paramount.

The more that you learn, the more places you'll go."" Nowadays, we spend too much time on our screens and mindlessly scrolling. Put this time into action by reading more books. Our minds are continuously being wired to have shorter attention spans, and if you add AI to that, we will continue to lose memory and remember fewer things.

62,How to Talk to Your Boss Like a Boss (And How to Listen to Your Team),"Jan 23, 2024",Ginni Saraswati,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-squash-your-fear-of-speaking-up/468285,"
One of the things I love the most about my team is our cultural diversity, which currently spans 15 countries. As a Sri-Lanka-born, Australia-raised, current resident of NYC, I understand a thing or two about the value that different perspectives can bring to the table. My experiences shaped my determination to create a global workforce representative of everyone living on this pale blue dot.Recently, I sent out our annual, anonymous, end-of-year team survey. This format invites honesty without the potential awkwardness accompanying truth-telling in the work environment. Every year, I am impressed with the thoughtful feedback.My admiration for these noteworthy observations made me think about how feedback works in an organization and how I could foster more. I wondered about the roles that company and individual cultures play in the grand scheme of collaboration and progress. In the context of a remote international team, what factors are at play regarding feedback?



I started to think about my own past experiences. One of my last ""day"" jobs had an interesting work culture. Human Resources often felt weaponized rather than being a resource for the human workforce. Almost every day, I overheard the casual, ""Oh, I'm going to HR."" I didn't feel safe to be myself in this type of work culture for fear of saying anything that could result in a visit to HR.The only time it felt safe to speak up was in the employee engagement survey administered yearly. Sadly, I and other team members often felt that the suggestions we made and the feedback we left weren't heard. Nothing ever changed or got acknowledged. From that experience, I realized that there are two things team members need: emotional safety to be able to share honest feedback and suggestions and a response or acknowledgment from management.


Related: Open vs. Anonymous Employee Feedback — Which is Better?Identify the cultural influencesTwo types of cultural influences affect our comfort level when it comes to speaking up. The first is the culture we come from as individuals. This refers not only to where you grew up but also to how you were raised. In some cultures, different concepts of hierarchy can discourage open communication with superiors. Whether or not a person feels comfortable having a direct conversation- and providing feedback to the boss- depends in part on these individual cultural norms.The second culture at play is workplace culture. Fear of Speaking Up, or FOSU, as coined by Karin Hurt and David Dye, can be a real problem if it goes unnoticed at the top. If you're not getting feedback or hearing suggestions offered by your team regularly, then you might consider whether or not people feel comfortable coming forward in your work environment.Advice for leaders: Stop talking and start listening.Here's the thing: the boss doesn't always have to have the answers. You're the decision-maker, and the buck stops at your desk, but that doesn't mean you always have to be the one to come up with the solutions. In fact, you probably shouldn't be.


If a team member comes to you with a problem, try asking their opinion first rather than shooting off your answer right away. This simple invitation opens up the door to a feedback loop. This becomes a triple-win for you because it does a few things in one fell swoop:It empowers your team, which builds confidence and creates a sense of ownershipIt gives you additional insight and ideas that you might not have considered previouslyIt alleviates FOSU by letting people know that you really do value their opinionsRelated: The 4 Levels of Listening: Why Every Good Entrepreneur Should Talk LessAdvice for employees: How to start the conversation.If speaking up feels hard, you're not alone. Maybe you grew up in an environment where kids were ""seen and not heard,"" or you had a bully for a teacher who instilled fear. This trajectory of powerlessness is one thing when you're young, but problems can arise if they follow you into adulthood, particularly when you enter the workforce.It's important to work toward overcoming this hurdle, however uncomfortable it might be initially. Otherwise, you risk falling victim to what Andy Molinksy, Professor of Organizational Behavior and International Management at Brandeis University, calls the liability of deference. This refers to the gap between deferential cultures and those that operate a bit more loosely when it comes to hierarchy.


If you struggle to speak up and feel uncomfortable around authority figures, it can significantly hinder your ability to progress. This is because relationship-building is critical to getting noticed, being considered for promotions, and moving up. So the big question is, how do you shift your mindset and make this career necessity less uncomfortable?Author and podcast host Karin Hurt believes that a space where ideas are shared helps a company thrive. She offers a few tips for confidently speaking to your boss.Remind yourself why what you want to say is important. Recognizing your why will give you a surge of confidence.Don't ruminate on past experiences that didn't go well with other authority figures. Instead, think about positive experiences you've had when you spoke up.Start the conversation by letting your boss know how much you care about the organization. This creates a connection through shared values.Think about what you want from your boss's perspective. If it's a raise or more administrative support, be able to back it up with numbers.Value their time. Be polite, ask how their day is going, and then get to the point.Related: How to Communicate Like a BossIf your workplace is one where you feel your opinion is valued, then that speaks well for your leadership team. For leaders, it's important to know how to leverage the unique values and perspectives of those under your wing. Focusing on creating and contributing to a positive workplace culture becomes a force multiplier that positively affects retention and your company's long-term success.

63,3 Mental Rules to Help You Understand (and Finally Relax) Your Busy Brain,"Jan 22, 2024",Leah Borski,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/3-ways-to-understand-and-finally-relax-your-busy-brain/467260,"
A client of mine, let's call her Sandra, came to me for help to handle high levels of stress in her life. She's the CEO of a 70-employee company in a male-dominated industry. That in itself was a lot of pressure. Add the strain of balancing work from home with parenting two small children. In her words, she wanted to be able to create her own calm during the chaos.She felt so overwhelmed, that we needed a simple launch point to relieve her stress. I advised her to start by taking a five-minute relaxation break during each workday. I gave her solid strategies to weave it into her existing schedule right away. For example, we planned the break during regular lulls in her daily itinerary. She didn't need to rearrange her whole life to do this. With a little back and forth, we discovered early afternoon should work best. She never scheduled meetings then and her kids usually took a nap after lunch.But at our next session, she confided that she was struggling. Instead of helping her relax, the downtime seemed to add to her stress. Her busy brain raced out of control. It clamored on about the meeting she just led, her afternoon agenda, what to cook for dinner, etc.

64,Imposter Syndrome — How to Upgrade Your Mindset to Outsmart This Mental Epidemic,"Jan 22, 2024",Alex Sabbag,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-upgrade-your-mindset-to-outsmart-imposter-syndrome/468303,"
Imposter syndrome might very well be the biggest epidemic to hit your life. Personal, professional and everywhere in between, this one doesn't discriminate — and it preys on individuals of all ages and demographics, regardless of credentials and accomplishments.Imposter syndrome is the common feeling of self-doubt, not being good enough, intellectual or traumatic experience fraud and the overall embodiment of a lack of mentality. It convinces you that you're not enough, and that alone can press you into dangerous mental health territory.I have been an entrepreneur since I was 25. At that age — before living all of my life since then — I didn't have fear, nagging self-doubt or worry. I was bold and comfortable with failure. The older I got, the more prevalent the voices swirled in my head, telling me I was not good enough.



For me, imposter syndrome has kept me on the proverbial bench of my own life time and again. I didn't go to business school, I don't have a graduate degree, my last business didn't make seven figures, and my trauma isn't significant enough to matter. On and on and on, and when left unattended, screams like a wildfire demolishing a beautiful prairie. Poof! Down to the dirt.While I know better, quieting the noise is no easy task. The good news is that I'm not alone with this one, nor are you. So many face imposter syndrome, even those who aren't ready to admit it yet. Self-doubt has become as common as our plea for more self-care: the latter a friend, and the former a foe.


Related: 4 Ways I Overcame Impostor Syndrome as an EntrepreneurSo, while we could all wallow in our overwhelming need for external validation, I invite you on a different path. Let's double down on what we can do to invite more peace and presence instead of looking for the subsequent performative posturing that oozes dopamine from the instant gratification of social media hits or flattering praise from irrelevant audiences.Imposter syndrome doesn't stand a chance if you're rooted in purpose, flowing in practice and surrounding yourself with people who lift you. Imposter syndrome is, at its very core, rooted in fear. But what if fear was just courage becoming known?Have faith, friends. Have faith that you made it this far because you have done enough. Have faith because you are enough — one more time for the cheap seats. You ARE enough. And since this is all easier said than done, here are my little nuggets of wisdom to keep the negative self-talk at bay so you can employ the courage and confidence to press on with more lightness, peace and ease.


1. Be awareSometimes the truth hurts, but we get nowhere by kidding ourselves. When you feel the negativity creep in, take a minute to identify what's happening. Simply naming the emotion or emotional response reduces its power over our mind.2. Welcome it inA brilliant coach and a beautiful friend shared this practice, and I've used it repeatedly. When the feeling comes, acknowledge its presence. Invite it into your life like a neighbor passing by on the street. Pull out a chair and ask it to sit down. Being with the feeling lets us know that we can work through it. Take a couple of deep and maybe uncomfortable breaths with it there. And kindly ask it to leave.3. Stop comparingIn other words, stay in your lane! Stop looking at what everyone else is doing, and stay focused on your creations. If there is something there that needs additional focus, double down on you. You were not put on this earth to be like anyone else, so quit measuring yourself against them. You're stirring up competitive tendencies that have no business in your world. Make a conscious effort to take social media breaks, spend more time in stillness, and have ample quiet time to get clear on your thoughts. Heck, you could even celebrate other people's wins!Related: A 5-Step Approach to Managing Imposter Syndrome


4. Embrace growthThoughts of being less than or underqualified could stem from an overall feeling of stuckness. We all get stuck occasionally, and it's important to keep challenging ourselves to learn and grow. If we don't, we get bored, and when we're bored, we start scrolling. It's a hamster wheel that got us into this mindset mess to begin with! So make an effort to learn, keep being interested, and, as a result, interesting.I sought my yoga teacher training certificate to understand why yoga was a powerful practice. I did it for myself, to deepen my own mind, body, and soul connection. Little did I know I would relocate to Southern California and own my own studio within five years of being certified. I'm surrounded by voices that have thousands of hours of credentials, have been teaching for decades, and, to me, fully embody the yogic lifestyle. Instead of feeling less than, I'm grateful to offer these voices to the community and wholeheartedly celebrate the opportunity to learn alongside such qualified individuals.5. Celebrate victoriesHonor your wins — big or small — as they come. Make a concerted effort to pat yourself on the back when you get to the 6 a.m. workout class, land a big client, close a seven-figure year or get external recognition. None of this is easy, so give yourself some gratitude when you accomplish even what seems like the most minor thing in your life.6. Take risksMy all-time favorite quote is this: ""Fortune favors the bold."" If you don't try, you'll never know. Remember that redirection is God's protection. When you are told ""no,"" I invite you to hear ""not yet."" But the biggest takeaway is that you must put yourself out there. In your most authentic way, share your gifts with the world.


I started my first business when I was 25. I left my stable job at a PR agency in downtown Chicago and accepted $1,000 monthly to support a non-profit I felt passionately about working with. The following month, I doubled that retainer and brought on a new client at an equal amount. I was out of my depth, but I learned by doing. None would have been possible if I hadn't taken a chance. Failure is an incredible teacher, and it's all impossible if you don't try.Dealing with imposter syndrome might feel overwhelming, and maintaining mental health can feel like a full-time job. These tips and regular mindfulness practices like yoga, breathwork and meditation help keep you in alignment. One day, one hour and one moment at a time. And remember, you are not alone. You've got great company here; we're all on this life journey together.Related: How to Overcome Imposter Syndrome and Tame Your Inner Critic

It appears to be the brutal end of an era for the iconic ""Sports Illustrated"" brand as the company's entire staff — both online and print — were told in a devastating email Friday afternoon that their jobs had been eliminated.The publication, which is licensed by the Authentic Brands Group, missed a payment of roughly $3.75 million causing its license to publish to be revoked and therefore leading to the dismissal of all employees.On Thursday, the Arena Group issued a release noting that there would be a ""significant reduction in its workforce of over 100 employees"" but did not elaborate further. By early Friday afternoon, employees had received an internal memo that they would no longer be working for the company.



""We appreciate the work and efforts of everyone who has contributed to the SI brand and business,"" the memo reportedly read.In a post on X, the NewsGuild of New York and the Sports Illustrated Union issued a statement vowing to fight for all employees affected by the terminations.

      Key Takeaways    



        After the pandemic shuttered his float spa business, Michael Garrett started a DIY project that has turned into a booming cold plunge company with $100 million in annual revenue. 
      


        Plunge leveraged influencer marketing and a strong domain name to achieve explosive growth and outstrip industry competition in cold water therapy.
      


        Garrett and his cofounder Ryan Duey are now expanding their product line into another hot wellness category.
      




















          Plunge
        


In this ongoing series, we are sharing advice, tips and insights from real entrepreneurs who are out there doing business battle on a daily basis. (Answers have been edited and condensed for clarity.)When the pandemic shut down Michael Garrett's float spa business, he did what many legendary entrepreneurs do: He went into his garage and started tinkering. His goal was to create a cold plunge tub for peoples' homes that was easy to maintain and use daily. After many, many, many iterations, he and his dad developed a prototype that Garrett thought could be a game-changer.He brought on his friend Ryan Duey to help launch the company, and three years later, Garrett's hunch that this could be big proved to be true. The founders are running a company that grosses $100 million annually. A ton of hard work (and a little bit of luck, the founders say) has put their company, Plunge, at the epicenter of the exploding trend of cold water therapy, icing out their competition.



Entrepreneur spoke with the co-founders about the launch, growth and future of their company.What drew you to cold plunges? As a treatment and as a business?


Garrett: I think Ryan and I both got introduced to it through listening to Tim Ferriss and then learning more from Wim Hof and Joe Rogan. For anyone experiencing any inflammation-related issues, cold water therapy feels so amazing after just three minutes. I went on a van road trip and was getting into rivers and lakes up in the Rocky Mountains for six weeks. When I came home, I was craving it like crazy, so I DIY-ed a freezer chest I could fill with water. I was doing it every day and loved it.Duey: We were parallel plunging. I saw the Wim Hof documentary on Vice, and it kind of changed my life. Previously, I thought I was a pretty healthy person, but around 2017, I got six colds in six months. A health mentor of mine had me try breathwork and cold plunging at a commercial facility. The colds basically ceased happening, and I was like, ""Okay, I'm sold.""How did you develop the product you'd eventually sell?Garrett: My dad is a big DIY guy and was a big help and influence on me deciding to try this. I knew a lot about filtration and keeping water clean from my float tank experience. There was this company called Vanity Art about a half hour from my house, and they had all these damaged tubs that I could buy for like $100 to prototype and iterate on.

Now Her Products Are Sold in 25,000 Stores.Duey: I give Mike the credit for really seeing the opportunity. When he showed me his first prototype, it worked great, but from an aesthetic standpoint, it wasn't a 10 out of 10. I wasn't all in on it, but he kept iterating, and the next time he brought me to his garage, I saw the new unit and couldn't believe it. It was a night and day difference. That was my first glimpse into how great a product guy Mike is. After that, I said, ""Let's do it. I'm in.""Garrett: What we sell is a convenient cold plunge. You're not dumping bags of ice into water. You set your tub for, let's say, 48 degrees, and the system constantly filters the water, keeping it at 48 degrees. When you're ready, you flip open the cover and get in. You change a filter once a month, so it is pretty minimal maintenance.Related: This Founder's Platform Is Unlocking the Secrets of Living Longer Through Personalized NutritionHow did you grow so quickly?Garrett: We went all-in on influencer marketing early on. Our first one was Aubrey Marcus. We built him a cold plunge, shipped it out, and said, ""Hey, if you could give a cold plunge to someone, who would it be?"" He gave us a couple of names, and we continued playing the gifting game, getting our products at the homes of big influencers, including Tony Hawk. We also capitalized on the name of the company: Plunge. We have the domain plunge.com. Most people called it an ice bath when we launched, but it was soon commonly called a cold plunge, so we quickly became number one in SEO.Duey: We sold maybe 30 or 40 units in that first year. Now we have months where we sell thousands. It's been exponential growth. We started in the garage, and now we have about 200,000 square feet of warehouse space under management.Credit: PlungeGrowing quickly can cause unforeseen problems. What are some issues you've needed to contend with?Garrett: To me, it's about maintaining culture. We doubled in size this year, so it's about figuring out how to seamlessly onboard new team members, get them hitting the ground running and ensure everyone understands and maintains our culture.Duey: We have five core values within the company that we talk about. The first is being ""all-in"". The second is, ""I got you,"" which is about ownership and trust. The third is that ""all boats rise,"" which is about doing the right thing. The fourth is to ""courageously direct,"" and the fifth is ""find your edge,"" which is about having a growth mindset.


Related: This Company Is on a Mission to Tackle the Concussion Crisis in Football. They're Now in 14 NFL Locker Rooms and Growing.What new products are on the horizon?Garrett: We just began selling saunas. We went down the sauna path because many of our customers wanted to pair their cold plunge with one and were asking which they should buy. Ours has a unique design: [It has] an angled backrest, and the benches flip up so you can do yoga and movement inside. And just like the cold plunges, we went for the ultimate in performance. When we started developing ours, most saunas were infrared and got up to 140-160 degrees. But research shows that the magic really happens at 175+, so ours goes up to 230°F. You can set yours up outside in Wisconsin in the middle of the winter, and trust me, it'll still get super hot.Credit: PlungeWhat would you say to people who dream of launching a business but don't have that ""big idea"" yet?Duey: One idea is to go and join something that has a great idea and momentum. Get on that ship for a little bit and learn. See what success looks like and what product market fit looks like. From there, when creativity starts to spark, you know what it takes to be a part of a winning culture.Garrett: Totally on the other end of the spectrum — I quit my job and went backpacking. I needed to find space; I needed to wait. I remember in my mid-twenties, I thought about starting a sandwich shop. I had this amazing sandwich and figured out how to reverse-engineer it and make it my own. But then, one day, I wondered, Is this my why? It wasn't. The idea lost momentum because I didn't care about it that much. So I had to wait and earn a living until the big idea hit. There's no right answer for every person!

NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers will no longer make his regular Tuesday appearances on ESPN's The Pat McAfee Show, at least through the remainder of the season.The decision comes in the wake of Rodgers' controversial statements including an unfounded suggestion linking talk show host Jimmy Kimmel to Jeffrey Epstein and Rodgers' promotion of conspiracy theories, CNN Business reported.Image Credit: Icon Sportswire | Getty ImagesRelated: Aaron Rodgers Went on a Darkness Retreat to Decide His Fate with the NFLRodgers, who host McAfee paid seven figures to appear on the program, elicited backlash last week when he falsely accused Jimmy Kimmel of having ties to convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. New court documents recently unsealed in the case name individuals previously connected to Epstein.



""Either he actually believes my name was going to be on Epstein's list, which is insane, or the more likely scenario is he doesn't actually believe that; he just said it because he's mad at me for making fun of his topknot and his lies about being vaccinated,"" Kimmel said during his opening monologue on Monday.Kimmel called for Rodgers to apologize, though he was skeptical he would, and the injured New York Jets player did not, per CNN. In his next appearance on Pat McAfee, Rodgers instead went on a conspiratorial rant replete with medical misinformation and attacks on the news media and ESPN executive Mike Foss, who issued an apology for Rodgers' earlier comments.For most of the segment, Rodgers railed against Covid-19 vaccines — falsely claiming they've caused widespread injuries and death — and promoted the unproven coronavirus treatment ivermectin, The Daily Beast reported.""I don't understand [Foss's] comment, because he didn't help out either,"" Rodgers said on Tuesday, per the outlet. ""I'm going to quote Mike. He said, 'Aaron made a dumb and factually incorrect joke about Jimmy Kimmel, it should never have happened, we realized that in a moment.' Mike, you are not helping.""

""Some of [Rodgers'] thoughts and opinions do piss off a lot of people,"" McAfee told CNN.

If you're like most Americans (71% according to Sleep Foundation), you probably make your bed every day or almost every day.It might even be one of the first things you do after you wake up — and research shows that having a consistent morning routine can lower stress, increase energy and make you more productive. What's more, a survey from Best Mattress Brand revealed that 34% of people who make their beds were ""very productive"" at work compared to 21% of those who neglected the task.But making your bed every morning is one habit that could actually do more harm than good — and may even endanger your health, according to sleep experts at Zoma Sleep.

72,Are You Sober Curious? Dry January Is on the Rise and Here's Why You Might Want to Try It,"Jan 2, 2024",Elisette Carlson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/dry-january-2024-6-tips-and-non-alcoholic-recommendations/467747,"
Thousands of Americans are opting to drink less or simply reset after the holidays by cutting alcohol from their diets for January of 2024. Dry January is not a new trend, but rather one that began in the U.K. in 2013 by a nonprofit called Alcohol Change UK, and one that will include about 1 in 5 Americans, as it's a popular time to be ""sober curious"" and set health goals.In 2022, 35% of Americans participated in Dry January, according to the CGA, a food and beverage research firm. That's an increase from the prior record of 21% of those who completed Dry January in 2019. According to Google Search Trends, with nearly three-quarters of millennials cutting back on alcohol and more than 40% of Gen Z skipping it completely, both retailers and consumers seek options to suit a variety of occasions.Interest in Dry January has jumped by 259% from January 2022 to January 2023, according to an analysis by Pantry and Larder. The most common reasons for participating in Dry January include a desire to be healthier (79%) and to reduce overall alcohol consumption (72%), according to a 2021 survey from Morning Consult. Over 50% of respondents also said it has become an annual tradition.



While non-alcoholic products account for less than 1% of the alcoholic beverage category, retail sales of booze-free beverages drove $510 million during the 52 weeks ending July 29, 2023. That's a 31% increase over the same period one year ago, according to Nielsen IQ, which tracks retail sales, including supermarkets and convenience stores. Revenue in the non-alcoholic beverage market in the United States is projected to reach $496.5B in 2023, and it's estimated that the market will experience an annual growth rate of 3.90% (CAGR 2023-2027).Related: Why Giving Up Alcohol Will Make You Succeed


2023 was the year of the mocktail, making Dry January easier to take on as a challenge than in the past. Searches for ""mocktails"" hit an all-time high this past year, and more restaurants and bartenders are offering up tempting mocktails such as a ""Nogroni"" using artful zero-proof spirits such as those from Seedlip or one of my favorites, Ritual Zero Proof. We also see full-service curated non-alcoholic bar services for events such as Southern California's Good + Bar, which embraces functional ingredients and holistic wellness.I covered non-alcoholic adaptogen options earlier this year, and since then, I've enjoyed others such as Hiyo, botanicals-based Aplos, and plant and mushroom-based Little Saints. Athletic Brewing Co, makers of the #1 selling craft beer brand that is now valued at $500 million, is challenging consumers to ""Give Dry a Try"" in January by offering a 50% discount and bonus gifts. Music artist Katy Perry is also offering a 32-can bundle of her new non-alcoholic apéritif, De Soi. You can find an extensive list of booze-free options on Zero Proof Nation, founded by Laura Silverman. Sober since 2007, Silverman didn't feel that hospitality was inclusive of sobriety, and she created her website out of a desire to build an authentic community around the zero-proof lifestyle and to elevate the stories behind the beverages.So why should you give Dry January a shot? According to the University of California Davis Health and the CDC, the health benefits can include weight loss, improved liver function, reduced blood sugar, better sleep, and improved mood and energy levels. While I enjoy an occasional celebratory alcoholic beverage, I'm partaking in going dry for January as I feel more energized and sleep better without alcohol. Plus, I thoroughly enjoy craft and adaptogenic mocktails, especially with a Tajin or salted rim.If you're tempted to take on the challenge, there are excellent apps that can help support tracking your Dry January. Reframe utilizes neuroscience to help drive behavioral change. At the same time, Drinkers Helper kicks off with a short quiz to help users cut back on drinking (note, you don't have to quit) and utilizes a multi-pronged approach of tracking, insights into your drinking, support groups and motivational exercises.


The most appealing app to me is Sunnyside, as it incorporates mindfulness and encourages you to explore your relationship with alcohol, including helping you better understand your triggers to help you minimize drinking without the pressure to quit. Sunnyside promotes that 146 million U.S. adults drink alcohol, and 47% want to cut back. They offer tools to help and say that they will ""never judge you."" On average, Sunnyside members cut back on their drinking by 30% in their first 30 days of using the app.Related: Has Dry January Really Lifted Non-Alcoholic Beverage Makers' Spirits?Below are some tips for taking on Dry January successfully:Shift your mindset about how you think about alcohol. Rather than focusing on what you're giving up, focus on what you're gaining from the challenge, from health benefits to personal accomplishment. Celebrate those wins and note or journal about how you feel with better sleep, how much money you saved or weight you've lost.Enlist a sober buddy or community. Accountability is helpful for motivation. You can have a friend or circle of friends that you plan other activities with, rely on each other and if you want to get really competitive, throw a wager into it. Losing money is highly motivational. The Forfeit app, backed by Habit Contracts from James Clear's Atomic Habits is hardcore and has a 94% success rate.Find a mocktail or alternative you love. Dry January is a perfect time to explore drinks. You might surprise yourself kicking back with an Athletic Brewing Co. ""Run Wild IPA"" beer or a low-sugar Kombucha at dinner and feel good about it because you wake up hangover-free and health-optimized.Replace the time you would typically reach for a drink with another mood-boosting activity. If you have a go-to five o'clock wine habit, opt for a workout with a friend (you'll never regret a workout), try a new recipe or pick up a new hobby such as art, music or a new skill.Practice an assertive ""no thank you"" when offered a drink and feel confident when doing so. If someone asks if you'd like a drink, and they question your ""no thank you,"" expand it to, ""I'm actually not drinking right now — I'm doing Dry January."" And if they continue to question you or tell you it's ""lame,"" respond with ""Why are you drinking?"" That'll get them to leave you alone.No need to give up if you slip up. Just like veering off a diet, a timeline or a commitment, don't beat yourself up over it and start over the next day. This is why some Dry January apps are helpful, as they offer encouragement and support mindful drinking.Related: 3 Tips for Navigating Work Events as a Sober Person


At the end of January, it's critical to have a plan. Evaluate how you felt during the month and celebrate your achievement with something not alcohol — a nice meal, a gift you've been eyeing or a massage. Surprisingly, most people will continue to abstain or drink on a much lower frequency. Plan to have an agenda for February. For example, only drink on weekends and limit to a certain number per week or only on vacations and special occasions. Almost anyone can benefit from a sober month, and ultimately, it's about taking on a challenge that will help you kick off the New Year with healthier habits and, most importantly, teach you mindfulness about your relationship with alcohol.

      Key Takeaways    



        Decisions, or a lack of decision, out of fear are constricting.
      


        Fear keeps us playing small.
      












    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

Assuming you have all the courage you need, what action could you take that would have the greatest impact on your life?That's a powerful question. It has profoundly impacted me over my 18+ years as an entrepreneur. It has precipitated profound transformation in many entrepreneurs' lives.Recently, at a conference, I delivered my workshop on taking your life back from your business. I concluded with this question and asked attendees to share their responses as they saw me during the conference. Over the next day or so, I was in deep conversation with entrepreneurs, sharing their courageous actions and fears. I was touched by the vulnerability and the difficult life circumstances we entrepreneurs endure as we grow our businesses. There is a profound impact on our personal lives when times are tough in the business. Likewise, there is a significant toll on our leadership when we face stressful circumstances in our personal lives. The work we do on ourselves to lead with love is profoundly impactful.



Decisions, or a lack of decision, out of fear are constricting. Fear keeps us playing small. Years ago, on a teleseminar (back in the days before Zoom!) I asked this question. One of my clients immediately knew his answer: to place a bid on a new building. He placed the bid, and his offer was accepted. His business has since expanded multiple times across multiple locations. When he called me to tell me what happened, he confided he needed a bigger location for quite some time, and the idea of taking out a substantial loan to pay for it made him fearful: ""What if I can't make the payments?"" What if I am misjudging the demand for our services?"" What if we go bankrupt because of me?"" These were just a few of the gremlins running through his head.Related: 4 Strategies to Increase Your Success


Our gremlins are the enemy of change. They demand the status quo. On the surface, they may sound like the voice of reason, protecting us from rash choices we could regret. In reality, our gremlins keep us stuck. Our gremlins come out in full force when contemplating transformative action in our lives and businesses.One of the reasons I love this particular powerful question is that it surfaces what we intuitively know to be in our best interest. I was reminded of this when I asked this question at the conference. Multiple entrepreneurs are stuck in (i.e., tolerating) dysfunctional marriages and business partnerships. Others have team members undermining productivity, profitability, and good culture.If you are avoiding making decisions due to fear, instead of dwelling on the ""what ifs,"" ask yourself powerful questions to get out of your own way:What's possible when you stop tolerating this situation or behavior?What opportunities arise when you make this significant change?When others react positively to your choice, what will they be saying?Twelve months from now, what will you appreciate most about your choice to take action?Our blindspots keep us stuck. Ten years ago, when I was choosing to stay in a bad marriage for the sake of my kids, a good friend asked me what I thought my kids were learning. That one question opened my eyes to a significant blind spot. My fear had me focusing on how a divorce might damage them. Her question made me consider how they might be damaged by staying in the marriage. Her question also got me to consider what good might come of this significant life change. She moved me from fear-based thinking to making choices out of love, knowing that not only could I handle the fallout of a divorce but that my consistent love for my children would pave a healthy path forward for us.


Related: How to Harness the Power of Fear in 8 StepsA client recently called to tell me he fired a team member immediately following our meeting last week. He was planning to take another six months to take this action out of fear about its impact on production. As he tuned into how much this team member's lack of accountability was costing the business and undermining the culture my client was trying to create, he was no longer willing to tolerate it. He made this decision with confidence in his leadership to see his team through the challenges this situation creates in the business. He made this decision with confidence that he would identify opportunities to do so even though he did not immediately know how to replace the team member. He made this decision out of love for the future he is creating for his team and his family.What opportunities are created when you make decisions out of love rather than fear?What are you tolerating?With the new year upon us, what is it time to change? What impact will that have on you and your business?I'd love to hear your answers.

75,6 Easy Travel Hacks That Will Save You Time and Money,"Dec 22, 2023",Kelly Hyman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/6-pro-tips-for-saving-money-on-travel/466563,"
Travel is one of the biggest business expenses. Between flights and accommodations, food and a strong Internet connection, it all begins to really add up. However, the airport is one often overlooked place where prices start to spike. It's easy to go through a daily budget in just one layover quickly.To avoid this from happening and to put money back into your pocket, here are a few quick money-saving tips to remember at the airport and as you set out for your next destination.1. Use a refillable water bottleBottled water at the airport can cost upwards of $4, depending on your chosen size and brand. To save on costs, not to mention plastic waste, pack your own refillable water bottle.



Most major airports now have filtered water dispensers to help keep you hydrated. Even though saving a few dollars doesn't sound like much, it's an unnecessary expense you can avoid simply by packing your own water bottle. Plus, it allows you to be eco-conscious at the same time.Related: 5 Ways to Save Time and Money on Business Travel 


2. Pack your own snacksSame as with packing your own water bottle, bring your own snacks. The cost for a small bag of chips or dried fruit can be several dollars more expensive at the airport than buying it from the grocery store before leaving.Also, since buying snacks is often an impulse, try to eat before leaving home or pack a sandwich or salad for the plane. It'll save you the cost and chaos of trying to find something healthy and cost-effective to eat while navigating the terminal.3. Book an early flightEarly flights often cost less than those that leave later in the day. In fact, certain airlines have recently promoted less costly early bird flights for popular destinations.Though it's nice to get those extra hours of sleep, you can also possibly avoid larger crowds and have more seat options if you choose to go with the first flight out. When you have schedule flexibility of choosing when you fly, compare flight prices and see if an earlier one can save you some money.

Become a loyalty member to your favorite airlines and hotels. They'll reward you with exclusive savings and points and add perks like late checkout or food and beverage vouchers.Also, booking engines like Hotels.com accumulate points, leading to free nights and last-minute savings on premium hotels through their site or app. As long as you already favor one airline or hotel group already, why not see what kind of bonus benefits you can get?Related: 9 Travel Hacks That Will Save You Time and Money


5. Monitor flight pricesMonitor flight prices with Google Flights or other tracking sites. This will help you get the best bang for your buck for the type of flight you want. It may be cheaper to book one-way flights on different airlines. Though direct is best, sometimes you can save significantly if you choose an alternate route.With airlines having more cancelation and flight change options, confirm what flexibility is available to you. When there is a free cancelation or airline credit, you can always switch when you find a better deal.

76,FDA Has Seized 'Thousands' of Fake Units of Ozempic Amid Reported Cases of 'Adverse Reactions' in Patients,"Dec 22, 2023",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/fda-warns-against-thousands-of-units-of-fake-ozempic/467479,"
Those looking to slim down before the New Year might want to heed an important warning.On Thursday, the FDA said that it had seized ""thousands of units"" of counterfeit Ozempic, a semaglutide injectable used as a weight loss drug, which have made their way to pharmacies and suppliers.The agency says that five people have been affected by the counterfeit drugs so far but that their conditions have not been serious, and their symptoms are ""consistent with known common adverse reactions"" to authentic Ozempic, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.



Related: A New Weight-Loss Drug Could Be a Complete Game Changer. 'Psychologically, You Don't Want to Eat.'The FDA warned that not only is the Ozempic substance itself counterfeit, but the drug information, label, carton and needle used for the injection are also counterfeit, noting that there's no way to confirm that the needles are sterile.


Patients and pharmacies are encouraged to purchase the substance only through distributors authorized by Novo Nordisk, Ozempic's manufacturer.""FDA takes reports of possible counterfeit products seriously and works closely with other federal agencies and the private sector to help protect the nation's drug supply,"" the agency wrote in a release. ""FDA's investigation is ongoing, and the agency is working with Novo Nordisk to identify, investigate, and remove further suspected counterfeit semaglutide injectable products found in the U.S.""In June, Novo Nordisk filed lawsuits against five med spas and wellness clinics in four U.S. states for allegedly selling counterfeit Ozempic and Wegovy, another weight loss drug.Related: Novo Nordisk, the Maker of Ozempic, Is Suing Spas and Clinics For Allegedly Selling Knockoffs


""Our priority is to ensure that patients have a safe and positive experience with our FDA-approved semaglutide medicines, and these actions are a direct reflection of that focus,"" Doug Langa, president of Novo Nordisk, said in a company release at the time. ""We believe it's important to provide additional tools and education to support the proper use of our approved semaglutide products and create broad public awareness regarding the difference between our FDA-approved medicines and other products being labeled as semaglutide.""Those who believe they may have been sold counterfeit medication are encouraged to report it to the FDA here.

In this ongoing series, we are sharing advice, tips and insights from real entrepreneurs who are out there doing business battle on a daily basis. (Answers have been edited and condensed for clarity.)Who are you and what's your business?I am Gil Blander, a scientist and entrepreneur, born and raised in Israel. After graduating with a Ph.D. in Biology from the Weizmann Institute of Science I moved to the United States to perform a postdoctoral fellowship at MIT. I spent five years there and worked in a couple of system biology computational biology companies before founding InsideTracker, where I am the Chief Scientific Officer. InsideTracker provides a personal health analysis and data-driven wellness guide, designed to help you live healthier and longer. By analyzing your body's biomarkers, InsideTracker provides an objective assessment of the current state of your well-being. Then, our AI-powered platform uses findings from thousands of scientific peer-reviewed publications and over ten billion biomarker data points to generate a custom set of actionable and personalized recommendations and insights including what food, supplements, exercise, and lifestyle changes are good for you. Integrated within an intuitive mobile app, InsideTracker reveals your personalized path to improving your health, wellness and longevity from the inside out.



What inspired you to create it?At the tender age of 12, the passing of a close relative acted as a poignant reminder of life's fragility, sparking a profound commitment within me to contribute to the pursuit of longer, healthier lives. This pivotal moment steered me toward the study of biology, a field through which I envisioned making a meaningful impact. Upon completing my postdoctoral fellowship at MIT, I joined a computational biology company, leveraging its platform to construct the pioneering computational biology model of caloric restriction. Recognized as a potent intervention for lifespan extension in model organisms, this model illuminated the potential of utilizing food as a strategic tool — a paradigm shift from the conventional drug cabinet in the bathroom to the kitchen.


This realization, my ""aha moment,"" ignited a passion for harnessing personalized nutrition as a proactive approach to prevent future diseases. The vision unfolded — a paradigm where food becomes a tailored prescription, shaping a future where preventive healthcare is as accessible as a well-curated meal plan. We began with a direct-to-consumer approach because we believe it is a faster way to make an impact. However, we strongly believe that working with clinicians to bring the InsideTracker revelation to everyone is the way to go, and that future is almost here.Related: This Company Is on a Mission to Tackle the Concussion Crisis in Football. They're Now in 14 NFL Locker Rooms and Growing.What has been your biggest challenge and how did you pivot to overcome it?Navigating the intricacies of day-to-day business operations posed a significant challenge for me. My strengths lie in innovation, science, and product development conceptualizing compelling ideas and translating them into tangible products. However, managing processes, overseeing operations, and handling a large team of employees are not my natural forte. Recognizing this, I made a strategic decision from the inception of the company to enlist a CEO who could adeptly steer the organizational ship while enabling me to concentrate on what I do best — driving innovation and product excellence.


How did you go about finding that CEO?The process involved an exhaustive series of interviews with numerous candidates. It was imperative to identify an individual whose skill set complemented mine and who could effectively lead the company with a shared vision. After careful consideration, I found the perfect match in Rony Sellam. A decade later, our collaboration remains strong, a testament to the success of this decision. Having a capable CEO at the helm has not only streamlined day-to-day operations but has also allowed me to stay true to my passion for innovation and product development, fostering a harmonious and enduring partnership.Related: The Co-Founder of OLIPOP Dropped Out of College and Built a $200 Million Business. Here's His Smartest Advice for Entrepreneurs.What advice would you give entrepreneurs looking for funding?


The customer is your best investor and holds the key to navigating the challenges of fundraising in today's economic landscape. Securing capital can be a daunting task, but with the current array of services and gig economy opportunities, building a prototype or minimum viable product (MVP) has become more accessible with a modest financial investment. Strive to reach the MVP stage and actively seek paying early adopters. Their feedback and testimonials not only validate your product but also serve as a powerful leverage point when courting potential investors.For novice entrepreneurs, establishing connections with individuals who appreciate you and invest based on trust is crucial. Alternatively, find investors who are passionate about your idea and are willing to invest in its potential. Building these relationships is an investment in the long-term success of your venture.Irrespective of the venture's stage — be it early, mid, or late — cultivating relationships with investors is an enduring process. Converting investors may take time; we, for instance, engaged in numerous meetings over the years before sealing deals with some of our key investors.As a founder, CEO, or executive, maintaining a perpetual awareness of fundraising is paramount. The optimal time to seek funding is when you don't urgently need it. Moreover, even if you are confident in your current financial standing, seizing investment opportunities is wise. The journey to the next milestone is invariably longer, more complex, and costlier than anticipated. Embracing financial support when it's available ensures you are well-prepared for the unpredictable challenges that lie ahead.

They are willing to work tirelessly, day and night, all year round, to achieve their goals. They possess a unique vision that others cannot see and have the ability to work with any personality type, even if they are difficult, as long as their value outweighs their cost. They also know how to adapt their team and strategy to suit any situation.What is something many aspiring business owners think they need that they really don't?


Many aspiring business owners often believe that amassing a significant amount of capital is an absolute necessity for launching a successful venture. While financial resources are undoubtedly important, the misconception lies in the assumption that a substantial sum is the sole determinant of success. In reality, numerous successful businesses have been built on innovative ideas, strategic planning, and effective execution, rather than a vast initial investment. Overemphasis on the need for a large amount of money can hinder creativity and resourcefulness. Many startups have thrived by focusing on lean and efficient operations, utilizing available resources judiciously, and prioritizing ingenuity over an abundance of funds. Therefore, aspiring entrepreneurs should recognize that a wealth of ideas, resilience, and strategic thinking can often outweigh the perceived necessity of significant financial backing in the early stages of business development.Is there a particular quote or saying that you use as personal motivation? ""If you set your sights on the moon, your trajectory will lead you to the moon."" I appreciate this sentiment as it underscores the idea that those with ambitious aspirations are more likely to attain significant achievements. Personally, my overarching objective is to contribute to the extension of people's lifespans and the enhancement of their overall well-being. However, I recognize that for others, the metaphorical 'moon' may symbolize entirely diverse aspirations, reflecting the inherent subjectivity of success and purpose. This statement encourages a universal appreciation for aiming high and pursuing individualized goals, recognizing that the journey toward greatness varies for each person based on their unique aspirations and dreams.

82,4 Ways Intuitive Healing Can Save Your Life — And How to Get Started,"Dec 6, 2023",Rachel S. Ruby,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/4-ways-intuitive-healing-can-save-your-life-and-how-to/465674,"
When it comes to healing from divorce (and any trauma), learning how to use your intuition can be a game changer that can help speed up the process. Like the many other sub-categories of healing, becoming familiar with your intuition can take time at the start, but once you have mastered it, it can serve you in many ways throughout your lifetime.What is intuition, and how can learning to tune into it help you heal? Intuition is the ability to sense something we may not be consciously aware of. It directs us to listen to cues from the mind, body and spirit, and use them to help make positive choices. It definitely can be learned, and we all have this ability, but many of us either don't know how or choose not to see or ""feel"" the signs and do anything about them when we do.You most likely have experienced a moment where you receive a ""sign"" from the universe – this can be in the form of a dream, a waking image, something someone says to you at a certain time, the appearance of someone in your life who delivers an important message, or even something you happen to see or read. The sign usually comes at a reasonable time, such as when you are on the precipice of making a big change or decision or starting a new journey.



Related: 4 Reasons Intuition Is an Essential Leadership SkillIntuitive healing involves using intuition to heal — the ability to recognize the signs and explore the messages they convey before making choices. We then use the information we obtain to make the best choices to stimulate the healing process. More importantly, this process is robust and can make us feel like we did something positive in our healing journey, and this change of mindset is a big boost for healing.


Here are some ways to get in touch with your intuition so you can use it to help in your healing journey:1. Get quiet and ask yourself for guidanceTaking a pause when facing a tough choice is a beautiful way to let your mind and spirit know you are seeking guidance. It is common for many people to ask friends or family for help with a decision, but others will tell you what they think is right for you when the truth is that you are the only one who can determine this.Find time and a quiet place every day to reflect on your choices. Close your eyes and simply breathe. Feel the sensation of breathing and just being. You can ask yourself, ""What is right for me in this situation?"" Try to focus on just the breath. Personally, I have had some answers come to me immediately, but others take time — hours or even days later. It is important to be very aware during that time because signs can be subtle.Related: Making The Case For 'Silent Leadership'


2. Listen to your dreams by keeping recordGuidance can also come through dreams, so if you wake from one, try to write it down immediately — before you wake up and can't remember. I keep a small dream journal by my bedside. You can also speak into the recording button on your phone and write it down in the morning. It may disturb your sleep for a moment, but you will be glad that you have a record of the dream when you wake up. It is easy to forget dreams when we don't make an immediate record of them.3. Open your heart to notice the nudges or signsOnce you are hyper-aware of what is happening within and around you, you will start noticing things. You may pass a billboard, or a friend may call you and tell you something going on in their life that provides clarity for your situation, which can provide guidance. Get a journal and keep track of all the things that resonate with you and the question or decision you are trying to figure out. Once you start doing this regularly, you will become more attuned to your body and the signs.4. Trust your inner voiceLearning how to trust the little voice inside or see something as a sign comes from stillness and deep reflection on the choices you have to make, but it also can come from asking for guidance and then not focusing on it, instead letting the help come to you. Sometimes, the sign is a little voice that tells you what to do. Do that! I know the times I have not listened to this voice led to decisions I later regretted. The universe will reach out to you with a sign, but it is up to you whether you choose to see it or ignore it. Learning to trust yourself can be challenging in the face of traumatic situations, like going through a divorce, but it will make you stronger, allow you to heal and create a new life. The key is to trust yourself - the more you listen, the better you will get at intuitive healing.Learning to trust and listen to your intuition is one of the best tools to utilize in any healing process, but it is not the only one. Multiple tools must be used in conjunction with each other to rewire the mind, body and spirit so you can be wholly healed and move forward with a new life that brings joy. Help is often needed, so don't hesitate to contact an energy healer, therapist or healing coach. Healing is a difficult process, and thus, many people tend to give up; once you realize that you are here for a short time and can live not just an average life, but a blissful one, it is magical.

83,Embrace the Art of Saying No: 4 Tips for Setting Healthy Boundaries,"Dec 5, 2023",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/master-the-art-of-saying-no-and-balance-life-on-your-terms/464901,"
In today's world, there are a host of demands placed on us. Between our bosses, best friends and families, there's no shortage of people asking us to commit time to various projects, events and activities. In some cases, we're not only asked but rather told what our top priorities should be. This works just fine when we agree and feel aligned with those requests, but what about when we don't?Failing to prioritize ourselves and our desires can leave us feeling overworked and burnt out. Perhaps more importantly, endlessly saying yes to others robs us of joy and fulfillment. It can prevent us from feeling passionate, empowered and energized. Our families and loved ones often pay the price.Today, many mental health experts encourage us to set boundaries with others. That can be a scary prospect, especially for those of us who were brought up to be people pleasers. If you want to set better boundaries with others but not torch your relationships, here are a few things you'll want to do.



Related: 5 Expert-Backed Strategies for Setting Boundaries at Work1. Figure out what you truly do (and don't) want to doYou'll find it's nearly impossible to set boundaries with others if you don't first know what your boundaries even are. Sometimes, setting boundaries means telling others no. This is easier to do when we have a ""greater yes"" in mind. But that means we must know what our ""greater yes"" is.


Anytime you're asked to do something, consult with yourself before anyone else. Ask yourself: ""How do I feel about this? What do I want to do? What do I feel is the best decision?"" Once you've decided these things, you're already in a better place to communicate. But just wait until you're asked. Regularly have these discussions with yourself, even before you get asked.Become very aware of how much bandwidth and capacity you actually have during any given season. The more you spend regular time identifying your most important priorities and values, the more strongly you'll feel about them and the easier it will become to articulate them.2. Make an agreement with yourself that it's okay to disappoint other peopleBefore you can have an effective conversation with others about your boundaries, it's important to accept the possibility that they might be disappointed by what you say. Remember: That's okay. People don't have to agree with all your decisions, including those who love you. Someone else disliking your decision doesn't make it wrong.Recognize that others may not respond favorably when you set boundaries. When you say, ""I'm sorry, but I'm not going to be able to do that this weekend,"" others might do a variety of things ranging from asking follow-up questions to becoming upset or angry to attempting to convince you to change your mind. When you plan on these things happening before the conversation, it makes it easier to handle them if and when they occur. Understand that other people's reactions are often more about them than about you. Those reactions don't mean you've done anything wrong.


Related: Why Setting Boundaries Is the Secret to Preserving Energy and Focusing on What Matters3. Communicate your position respectfullyVerbally articulating our boundaries with others is an important part of the process. You get the opportunity to share how you feel about something presently happening, and you also get the opportunity to set expectations for the future.Perhaps you don't like the nickname an acquaintance has given you. They think it's a clever joke, but you find it offensive. Perhaps you are uncomfortable with how close a colleague often sits; you feel it's an invasion of your personal space. Maybe your friends routinely stay far too late when you invite them into your home or your mother insists on visiting you every Sunday, but you no longer want her to.Whatever it is, sharing how you're feeling about the behaviors, asks or demands of others is important. That's because, when done well, it can lead to change. This allows the relationship to improve. Oftentimes, we're afraid to set boundaries with others because of how they will react. We can assuage these fears by remembering that setting boundaries is not about others; it's about us.


There's no need to criticize or attack others. Rather, we can simply share how we've been feeling and what we'd like to see change. It's especially helpful to be specific. Instead of saying, ""Mom, I just feel you're too involved in our lives,"" you can say, ""Mom, I'd like to have some more time to myself to read, clean and spend time with the kids. You being at our home every Sunday has been tough on me. I'd like to ask that going forward, you only come twice a month instead of every weekend.""Related: How to Teach Your Employees to Set Boundaries Instead of Always Being 'On'4. Learn to feel good about itI've noticed that many of us feel guilt or even shame when we try to set boundaries. These feelings discourage us from doing it. As you contemplate setting boundaries, instead of worrying about everyone else, remember to consider yourself first. It's less important that everyone else around you is ""okay"" with it, and more important that you feel good about it. If someone or something is wreaking havoc on your life, you don't have to simply ""put up with it"" at the expense of your happiness. It's an act of bravery to ask (or say) what you want and need, and you should choose to feel good about having the courage to do that.Setting boundaries with others can feel overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be. In fact, it's a key part of building a better life. We only get one shot at this life, and every moment matters. When we spend months or years tolerating things that make us uncomfortable, our worlds tend to shrink. Identify what's most important to you and take these steps to advocate for it. Believe it or not, you'll often find that doing this leads to better and more honest relationships with those around you, not worse relationships.

LIGHT Helmets


In this ongoing series, we are sharing advice, tips and insights from real entrepreneurs who are out there doing business battle on a daily basis. (Answers have been edited and condensed for clarity.)Whether you are glued to RedZone on Sundays or are a casual fan, one fact about today's NFL game is hard to miss: concussions are a serious problem. In the 2022 season, brain injuries suffered by players on the field were up by 18 percent.Enter LIGHT Helmets, a disrupter in the protective headgear industry that has utilized materials used in the helmets of military special operators and aviators, as well as professional auto racers, to develop the lightest football helmet on the market. They weigh just 3 pounds, 13 ounces, as opposed to more traditional helmets that can weigh up to 6 pounds, which begs the question: How does a lighter helmet provide better protection? ""In simple terms, the reduction in the mass of the helmet reduces its kinetic energy when a tackled player's head meets an immovable object — the field,"" says LIGHT CEO Nick Esayian. ""So you're not hitting the back of your head with nearly as much velocity. Added bonus: taking two pounds off the gear you're playing in gives you that competitive edge to be faster out there.""



We spoke with Esayian to discuss the company's origin, how it managed to break into the walled-off world of the NFL, and its game plan for future dominance at the pro, college and youth levels. To hear more, check out his LIGHT Impact podcast, where Esayian interviews sports, military and business leaders about the success mindset.Related: 'You Don't Need to Knock Out Your Competition to Win': Inside the Professional Fighters League's Strategy for Success


How it all startedI was first introduced to Bill Simpson of Simpson Racing at the paddock at the Long Beach Grand Prix. He built and sold Simpson Racing and another company called Impact Racing that made protective equipment. He was working on a football helmet company with former race car great Chip Ganassi. They had helmets on Dwight Freeney and Jeff Saturday in the NFL, but they just couldn't get it to grow. Bill had been in an NFL owners' meeting and they weren't interested. So, using some colorful language that basically told them to go to hell, he walked out. He said to me, ""Listen, I don't want this concept to die, but I'm getting too old to push it forward. Do you want to, do you want to give it a run?"" So through a confluence of events, we took ownership of the assets at the end of 2018. We quickly spun it up, got a proof of concept, and sold a couple thousand helmets.Rough TradeThings were looking great. We had investors lined up — First Trust Bank, Richard Green who is part owner of the Philadelphia Eagles — and then the pandemic hit and the market tanked. Now, I was tempted to roll around on the floor with a bottle of whiskey, but we regrouped. We found twelve of the leading neurologists and trauma doctors, like Michael McDermott, who runs Baptist Health in Florida, Peter Cummins, who runs TB12 for Tom Brady and Tal David, who was a Chargers lead physician. We had them work with our engineers here in San Diego. San Diego is home to about half of the Navy SEALs, so we were able to combine military and auto-racing tech with this helmet. Now, we obviously didn't sell anything during the pandemic, but once we came out of it, our product was so strong that we made about $2,000,000 in revenue and ran out of inventory.Related: Sports Legends Laird Hamilton and Gabby Reece Want to Power You Up With Tastier and Cheaper Superfood Drinks. Who's Thirsty?The science of lightnessOur helmets weigh three pounds. Our competitors' helmets weigh five to six pounds. You see players getting concussed over and over, and it's not about head-to-head collisions. Those kinds of hits are not gone entirely, but they're greatly reduced because of rule changes. These concussions have a lot to do with heads hitting the ground, all of that energy hitting an immovable object — which is the earth. So by reducing the weight of the helmet, we're reducing the kinetic energy and that secondary impact. The energy equation is half the mass times the velocity squared. So If I reduce the mass by 50%, I'm in essence reducing that kinetic energy of my head hitting the ground.


Barriers to entryWe've got some neat people involved in this, including Jordan Palmer, who's Carson Palmer's brother. Jordan is kind of the quarterback whisperer who privately coaches guys like Josh Allen, Trevor Lawrence and Joe Burrow. So we've got him, Navy SEALs, scientists and all of these pieces lined up where we're right at the precipice of this becoming a very visible company. We're in 14 NFL locker rooms, in 20 college locker rooms and a couple hundred high school locker rooms. But having said all of that, the barriers to entry in this space are huge. For the NFL, there is a litmus test that you have to go through. They hire a consultant who has a kind of a ""living test"" that changes slightly as they learn more about the product and injuries. And if you pass that hurdle, which is very difficult — there may only be 15 models of helmets that pass that test — then each individual equipment manager for each franchise will make their own determination. Do they want to bring that vendor and that model into their locker room? If they do, then your helmet goes on a helmet tree, which looks like a Christmas tree. And the players come in when they're going to start the season and choose what they want. Colleges and high schools don't have those kinds of tests. They look to the NFL and also continuing research done by Virginia Tech, which is like the Consumer Reports for helmets. And if it meets their criteria, they'll buy.The Big Game PlanThe total addressable market is about 5 million players in the United States — just over 6 million globally. Right now we're the smallest in the field, but there are only four competitors: Riddell, Schutt (who also owns Vicis), Xenith and LIGHT. By the end of this year, I am very confident that we'll be number three and by the end of 2025, we'll be number two.Our next target is going to be hockey space. If you look at a game from the 1980s you'll see that not much has changed. And these advanced materials we're using can also expand into lacrosse, flag football — any game that requires protective headgear. Now take one step away from sports and you have the construction helmet space. You've got a guy driving a $100,000 Ford Raptor, he's got a $200 Snap-on hammer, and he's wearing a $15 plastic construction helmet. Now, there are 25 million construction helmets sold a year, globally. It's a huge market. And what do construction guys watch? Football, hockey, lacrosse. So if I can build a brand in football, which is the most scrutinized helmet on the planet, and I can win the day there? The possibilities are truly massive.Pep TalkI think anybody looking to take the leap into entrepreneurship has to have a lot of grit. I mean, you have to be crazy enough to try something like this and smart enough to make it work. That's number one. Number two, you need to have the wisdom and the resilience to step back and reassess. There is a great Jocko Willink phrase that I think about a lot when it comes to problem-solving: Take a step back, detach from your emotional reaction, find out what is really going on, and then make calm, logical decisions based on the reality of the situation. Remember, if this were easy, everyone would do it. You're trying to do something that no one else has done. And when you are not just trying to make money, but following a true passion and wanting to do good in the world? You're unstoppable.

85,"Did You Mess Up? Use This Astronaut's ""30-Second Rule"" to Feel Better and Refocus","Dec 5, 2023",Mike Massimino,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/did-you-mess-up-use-this-astronauts-30-second-rule-to/464146,"
As a NASA astronaut, I've had the opportunity to do amazing things — and to screw up in big ways. To get through the losses, I've adopted something called the Thirty-Second Rule.For me, the rule goes like this: When you make a mistake, give yourself 30 seconds of regret. Take a time-out. Feel miserable. Berate yourself. Beat yourself up. Say all the horrible things to yourself that you want to say — only, you know, do it silently in your head so you don't scare the people sitting next to you.Because regret is natural. Disappointment is natural. It isn't healthy to suppress those feelings or deny they exist. You need to let yourself have them. But keep it to thirty seconds. Then it really is time to move on. After your thirty-second rant, let it go. Leave the regret in the past because it will not help you in the future. It's time to move on with the task at hand and with the mission in general. Your team needs you totally engaged and back in the game to help solve whatever problem you're tackling.



Learning that lesson from fellow astronaut Megan McArthur was especially important for me, too. Megan was one of those astronauts I put up on a pedestal. She'd been accepted into the Astronaut Program on her first try, when she was only twenty-eight, which is almost unheard of. NASA chose her before she'd even finished her PhD — that's how badly they wanted her. Megan is brilliant, capable, and terrific to work with. She's the kind of person you look at and say, ""I could never do what she does. She's perfect.""But she's not perfect. She's just found the best tools to manage her imperfections, and the Thirty-Second Rule is one of them. Once she taught it to me, I got much better at dealing with and moving on from my mistakes. I wasn't wasting a week, or even a day, when I messed something up. Which was good, because I'd soon make a huge error — breaking the Hubble Space Telescope way out in the bottomless void of space.


This happened during a 2009 flight called STS-125. I stripped the screw on the handrail in an attempt to repair the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on Hubble. That was a big problem.After I reported what I had done to mission control in Houston, and as they scrambled to deal with my screwup, I got hit by a tsunami of shame, guilt, disbelief, and regret. We rarely feel more alone than when we mess up. It leaves us isolated and exposed. It's bad enough doing that on Earth. Now imagine doing it 350 miles up in space.I felt sick. I'd squandered years of planning and dedication by the entire Hubble team. I'd flushed millions of dollars of taxpayer money down the drain. My children would now go through life as the kids whose father broke the Hubble Space Telescope. That would be my legacy.The one overriding thought in my mind was that I needed a time machine. All I needed was to go back. All I needed was a do-over. Of course, once you find yourself thinking that way, that's the moment regret has started working against you. Because time only moves forward, and it's pointless to sit and wish for the impossible. Once you start wishing for a do-over, that's when you know it's time to move on.


Fortunately, I knew how. We may not have had a backup plan to deal with the stripped bolt on the handrail, but while my team on the ground scrambled to figure that out, I did have the Thirty-Second Rule to deal with myself. I paused, looked down at Earth, set a mental timer for thirty seconds, and started my regret.For thirty seconds I let it all loose. I beat the crap out of myself. ""Mike, you idiot. You moron! How could you have messed up something so simple? Why did you not think about this problem before the mission? You were rushing the easy stuff because you got too fixated on what you thought was the harder stuff."" And on and on and on.Then, once the thirty seconds was up, I let it go. I'd had my little wallow in self-pity, and now it was time to leave my mistake in the past and be a good teammate and help come up with a solution. We figured out that ripping the handrail off might work, it did, and the rest of the space walk went right according to plan. The STIS came back to life, and the search for life in the universe continued.Every day, in our professional lives and in our personal lives, we are given opportunities to make mistakes. We don't want to make them, but no matter how much we prepare and how hard we try to be perfect, they're inevitable. The mistakes I used to beat myself up for were actually a very valuable part of my astronaut training, because making them taught me how to recover from making them. I learned that no mistake is insurmountable, but a bad response to a mistake can be fatal.


When you mess up and find yourself feeling horrible about it, remember the Thirty-Second Rule: Beat yourself up. Let yourself have it. Wallow in your regret. But keep it to thirty seconds. Then, no matter how hard it might be, leave it in the past and move on. Concentrate on what's ahead and what you can do to help. Try to stay positive, no matter how badly you messed up, and give yourself an opportunity for redemption.So, what's a good way to spend those thirty seconds? Here are my suggestions:Call yourself names. I'm fond of ""I am so stupid."" Or ""You idiot! How could you have done that?"" ""Bonehead"" works, too.Identify the regret so you'll know exactly what you're mad about instead of being mad about everything. ""I should have thought more about our plan."" Or ""I should've checked the situation more closely before acting."" Or ""Why didn't I think about the consequences before I did that?""As you're coming out of the regret, kick yourself good and hard so you won't let it happen again. ""If I get out of this one, I'll be more careful in the future to never make that mistake again.""And voilà! The thirty seconds of regret are now over. Leave that mistake in the past and move on because your team is going to need you to help solve the problem you just created.This essay is an adapted excerpt from MOONSHOT: A NASA Astronaut's Guide to Achieving the Impossible by Mike Massimino.

87,Why Overcoming the Shadows of Your Past Will Lead to Your Brightest Future,"Dec 1, 2023",Kyle Hermans,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-overcoming-the-shadows-of-your-past-will-lead-to-your/465316,"
If you're reading this, you're probably like me, a high-performing leader with aspirations to excel in all aspects of life. You're likely no stranger to ambition. I'm constantly dreaming, thinking, and strategizing about how to grow in my personal and professional life. How can I be stronger, more kind, more inspiring? How can I be a better father, husband and CEO? How can I be the fittest version of myself? How can I be the best drummer and musician possible?However, you might have noticed that you've encountered self-doubt, obstacles, and possibly that imposter syndrome feeling that has hindered your progress toward realizing your dreams.What's been holding you back on your professional or personal goals?



Mapping your futureConsider what you're currently striving to achieve and manifest in your life. Is it a promotion, starting a family, finding a fulfilling romantic relationship, improving your health, creating an innovative productt or simply seeking ""something more""?When I've asked people in the business community, ""Where do you see yourself in 10 years?"" they typically fall into one of three categories:


#1: ""I have no idea.""#2: ""I know what I want but tend to give up when it gets tough.""#3: ""I see my future clearly, and nothing will stop me.""The most successful and fulfilled individuals share a common trait: a strong sense of purpose and clarity about their life's direction. That would be #3: ""I see my future clearly, and nothing will stop me.""This observation, echoed by Oprah in her interviews with countless accomplished individuals, underscores the significance of purpose and determination in achieving one's dreams.You have to want your goal MORE than the discomfort and toil of achieving it. This applies whether you're working on an invention or a new business or want to improve your physical or mental health by walking or reading daily.Related: Why Self-Doubt Can Be Your Secret Weapon


Why growth requires confronting the pastHaving worked as a high-performance coach for over a decade, I've supported hundreds of individuals in their pursuit of greatness. Throughout this journey, I've uncovered a universal truth:The shadows of your past can cast darkness on your path to a brighter future. And each new level of growth and transformation you achieve necessitates confronting new shadows. I like to call this, ""Every level has a new devil.""We all possess hidden mental barriers that impede our progress, and the magnitude of these inner obstacles corresponds to the scale of our goals or challenges.The bigger your aspirations, the more intense your inner shadows can become.Related:What shadows of the past hold you back?Examine the roadblocks preventing you from achieving your goals. Is it feelings of inadequacy, inexperience, unattractiveness, lack of confidence, or financial limitations? Then, ask yourself, ""When did you first encounter these feelings?"" Many internal barriers can be traced back to when you received negative feedback. As a younger person, you may have often internalized this negativity, accepting it as your truth. The labels and limitations others imposed on you may have shaped your self-identity, dictating what you can and can't do.For instance, a child who frequently hears statements like, ""You're so immature; you'll never handle money responsibly,"" may grow up believing in their irresponsibility. Years later, when this individual dreams of starting a business, those negative voices resurface, discouraging them from trying.


Related: 5 Entrepreneurial Roadblocks You Never See ComingChoosing courage over fearTo conquer the fear you feel in these shadows, summon courage. Everyone has courage inside of them, waiting to be tapped into. And where there is shadow, negativity, and fear, there is also courageous light—they coexist.Ask, ""Where is the courage needed to light my path toward growth?"" and, ""What is my driving force that is stronger than my fear of trying and failing?""Identify the shadows and negative beliefs that hold you back. Uncover the root of these limitations, often stemming from the undue influence of others on your self-worth. You can choose which influences you take to heart and which to discard.


Once you put those old fear-based voices aside, put your focus on who you feel you can be and do.After identifying the shadows, step into the light because focusing on shadows keeps you in the shadows while focusing on ascension naturally propels you upward.Related: 5 Ways to Rewire Your Brain to Be PositiveInner leadership equals outer leadershipOur external world mirrors our internal world. Leaders can elevate themselves to new heights by addressing barriers and confronting shadows. You must intentionally identify and then banish the monsters in your head to clear the way for your best self.


Your transformational power lies in your willingness to confront the past and break free from old programming.As you strive to unlock your future, confront your shadows and illuminate them with courage and intentionality. In doing so, you'll rise above your past limitations and step into the brilliant light of your potential.

88,Ticket Prices for One of America's Favorite Pastimes Are Up 25% Thanks to a Phenomenon Economists Call 'Funflation',"Nov 22, 2023",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/report-sporting-event-ticket-prices-up-over-25/465840,"
If you've noticed an alarming uptick in ticket prices in the entertainment industry since last year, you're not alone.In fact, a new report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics proves just that, as new Consumer Price Index data rolls in for October 2023.According to the CPI, admission prices for sporting events increased an astounding 25.1% from the same time one year ago, making it the category with the highest inflation rate.Related: 'Excruciating': Taylor Swift Opens Up About Ticketmaster FiascoEconomists have dubbed the uptick in entertainment-related costs (like concert and sporting event tickets, airline tickets, vacation rentals and hotel rooms) ""funflation."" Prices are up compared to pre- and mid-pandemic prices when many people were unable or hesitant to participate in such activities.October 2023's CPI also showed a 14.9% increase in prices of food from vending machines and mobile vendors (which would include dining choices made at entertainment venues and transportation locations) and motor vehicle insurance increasing 19.2%, with motor vehicle repair increasing 15.1% — indicating Americans are spending more time on the roads.Related: Restaurants Are Adding 'Inflation Fees' to Customer ChecksAdmissions to concerts, movies and theatres increased 4.5% from the same time last year, while overall admission to entertainment events was up 10.9% year over year.Inflation as a whole was down in October to 3.24% from 3.7% the month prior and a jarring 7.7% at the same time period last year.

89,5 Ways to Sidestep Discouragement and Stay on Track,"Nov 22, 2023",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/5-secrets-to-overcoming-challenges-and-achieving-success/464899,"
When we set out to accomplish monumental things or make big changes in our lives, the road to success isn't always easy. Perhaps you're starting a business, writing a book, training for your first marathon or wanting to exceed your annual sales quotes. Maybe you're in a brand new role at work and looking to establish a brand for yourself.Regardless of the specific goal you're pursuing, you're likely to encounter challenging days where you wish you'd stayed in bed. However, before you consider throwing in the towel on your wildest dreams, make sure you've done (or are doing) the following five things. If you do, you'll be less likely to view quitting as an option, and you may even realize you're doing better than you think.Related: 12 Lessons You Learn or Regret Forever



1. Remember why you startedWhen we stay laser-focused and emotionally connected to the reasons we started down the path initially, it's harder to get discouraged. Remembering our purpose or vision for the end game is a surefire way to boost your morale when you're feeling down. Ask yourself, ""What was it that made me want to do this in the first place? What's at stake here?""Perhaps you'll remember that your goal was to impact the lives of others or make a meaningful difference in the world. When you remember that, it's harder to let a bad day, week or month stand in your way. Instead of thinking about why you can't, you'll remember why you must.


2. Force yourself to stay in motionSometimes, when we get momentarily stuck, there's a tendency to stay stuck. Make sure you don't allow this to happen. Being successful isn't about avoiding failure — it's about turning failures into learning opportunities so we can start again with greater wisdom and new insights. How many times you get knocked down doesn't matter nearly as much as how quickly you can get back up. It's not important that you blew off your goals for a day or a week. What's important is that you get back on track as soon as you can.To ensure maximum productivity and keep yourself focused, I suggest weekly planning. At the start of each week, renew your excitement by making a list of the most important actions you'll take in the coming week — then commit to them by giving them a space to live and breathe on your calendar. Later, if something unexpected comes up and you can't complete one of your actions, no worries. But you have to assign that action item a new spot on your calendar.Regardless of what setbacks you've had, it's hard to fail (in the long run) if you're continually getting back into action. Don't spend time focusing on what unfortunate things happen to you. Instead, always focus on what you can do about them. This will always allow you to be in place of control and power over your time, yourself and ultimately, your life.Related: 5 Acts of Mental Discipline to Maintain the Positive Mindset Success Requires


3. Be choosy about what content you consumeWhen we're pursuing big goals, it's easy to become discouraged. This is why managing our mindset and our mood is mission-critical. It's important we surround ourselves with messages and reminders that we can absolutely accomplish our goals and struggle is to be expected (and normal). Carefully pick podcasts, videos and books that uplift and encourage you; not ones that do the reverse.Do not associate with others who complain, whine, gossip or create drama; this will not help you. Spending time with others who have done what you are trying to do will be especially helpful. Finding a mentor, coach or therapist who can normalize your challenges can be wildly reassuring. Knowing that our experiences are not unique helps give us the courage to forge ahead, even when the road is hard and long.4. Take care of yourself along the waySometimes, when we desperately want to achieve results, we focus on nothing else — then we become drained. If all you're doing with your time is focusing on a singular goal, it's likely you'll eventually burn out and lose motivation to keep going. This will sabotage your success. When we're pursuing greatness, it's critically important to take care of our mental, emotional and physical health. Taking breaks to pursue our favorite hobbies (especially those that allow us to access our creative outlets) is essential to our success. Getting enough rest, drinking plenty of water and exercising daily are helpful tools in making sure we're ready to execute our big goals. Invest some time each week doing the things you love, and/or seeing the people you love, because these are the activities that will replenish your energy.Related: 6 Game-Changing Mindset Shifts I Wish I'd Known About Sooner


5. Find the wins and celebrate your accomplishmentsRegardless of what isn't going well as you approach your goals, it's likely there are some things that are going well. Don't stay so focused on the end result that you forget to acknowledge the small wins along the way, regardless of how minor they might seem. Okay, so you didn't sign that big contract you thought you would. What about the deals did you close this month? Maybe you're experiencing writer's block this week and can't think of a good ending to the novel you're writing. What about all the writing you did get done last week? When all we do is focus on what isn't coming together, we rarely find the motivation to stay in the game long enough to emerge victorious. Be sure to acknowledge your progress, even if its not as rapid as you hoped. Writing these things down can be especially encouraging.Regardless of whatever you want to accomplish, remember this: If it were easy, everyone would do it. Bad days will come. Setbacks are inevitable. But, by following these practices, you're far more likely to have the inspiration and urge to buckle back down and keep your head in the game, even after a tough week. Do that repeatedly, for long enough, and success is inevitable.

90,How Therapy Helped Me Train My Intuition to Make Decisions Quickly,"Nov 21, 2023",Andrew Blackmon,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-trust-your-gut-and-make-decisions-quicker/464695,"
I run a company of 400 people. It's only possible because of a decision I made soon after we launched — even though it had nothing to do with business: I decided to see a therapist.I hadn't set out to be an entrepreneur; I was an English major in college, busy reading Dostoevsky and philosophy. Then I rented a tuxedo to get married, and it was an atrocious process. There must be a better way, I thought. My groomsman, Patrick Coyne (who had the same experience), agreed, and we cofounded The Black Tux in 2013 with the plan to rent well-fitting, high-quality suits and tuxes online — which turned out to be operationally complicated and immediately popular.Related: 4 Reasons Intuition Is an Essential Leadership Skill

91,Thanksgiving Is One of Few Paid Holidays U.S. Workers Have Off. They're Not Grateful for Stingy Vacation Policies — and the Breaking Point Is Near.,"Nov 21, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/stingy-paid-holidays-exacerbate-us-work-life-imbalance/465688,"
The U.S. comes in second on the list of 10 countries offering the least amount of paid vacation time, according to a report from career-resource platform Resume.io. In the private sector, American employees receive 10 days of PTO on average, not including holidays and sick days — a shockingly low number compared to those in other developed nations.In many countries around the world, particularly those in Europe, it's not uncommon for employees to take vacations for months at a time, in many cases due to the European Union Working Time Directive, which requires a minimum of 20 working days of paid vacation in all EU countries, CNBC reported.Related: How to Determine Your PTO Policy



""In the U.S., it is estimated that less than 50% of workers who get paid vacation time use their full allotment each year.""""[The disparity] has largely been driven by American business resisting any kind of mandate to provide paid time off for workers,"" Joe Mull, a 20-year HR veteran and author of the new book Employalty: How to Ignite Commitment and Keep Top Talent in the New Age of Work, tells Entrepreneur. ""For more than 100 years, all proposed national laws guaranteeing paid leave to workers have failed to pass. In nearly every other developed nation on earth, workers are guaranteed paid time off.""


Thanksgiving is around the corner in the U.S., and although 39% of private industry workers nationwide will have the day off, most of them aren't grateful for the stingy vacation policies their employers subject them to year-round. And even those lucky enough to have more PTO at their disposal are tired of being unable to use it.Related: These Are the 10 Countries With the Least Paid Vacation — and Where the U.S. Ranks Might Surprise You""In the U.S., it is estimated that less than 50% of workers who get paid vacation time use their full allotment each year,"" Mull says. ""The most common reason given for not taking vacation time is fear of falling behind at work."" And many other workers feel they must reserve paid vacation time for when ""life happens,"" including issues surrounding childcare and elder care, sickness, transportation and more, he adds.""A functioning society with optimal mental health requires periods of rest and restoration.""What's at stake if the U.S. doesn't catch up? According to Mull, a lot: American employers can expect continuing high levels of burnout (77% of U.S. professionals have experienced burnout at their current job, per a Deloitte survey) and will struggle to attract and retain top talent.""Much of the turmoil in the labor market in recent years has been driven by employees changing jobs in pursuit of better quality of life,"" Mull says. ""So the business case here is that employers reduce employee churn and deliver better products and services to customers when they have a full complement of healthy, engaged employees.""Related: 3 Truths About Unlimited PTO — Why Employees Are Worse Off With Endless Vacation DaysBut there's an even bigger issue at play, Mull warns: ""A functioning society with optimal mental health requires periods of rest and restoration, and our current culture around work and paid time off doesn't support this.""


""It's a symptom of several larger issues related to rising workloads, childcare deficiencies and more.""Mull compares the plight of U.S. workers to an engine that's been racing at maximum RPMs for long periods of time — ""eventually, it gives out."" That's why time away from work, and the restoration it provides, actually makes for more productive employees and better work outcomes, he says.""What's important to note here is that it's not just about offering more vacation time,"" Mull adds. ""Employers must create the conditions that allow employees to actually use it. In many ways, the rate at which we take vacation time isn't the problem — it's a symptom of several larger issues related to rising workloads, childcare deficiencies and more.""

      Key Takeaways    



        Schulz started offering virtual corporate wellness and team events to combat the isolation caused by Covid-19.
      


        Although she's returned to her first love dance, she continues to work on her business alongside it — and has no plans to stop. 
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Danielle Schulz, a ballet dancer at the Metropolitan Opera and founder of The Triangle Sessions, a corporate wellness company offering company retreats, interactive wellness classes and team-building events. She is based in the Greater Philadelphia Area. Image Credit: Devin Cruz.You'd been a dancer with the Metropolitan Opera since 2014 when Covid hit. How did your life and work change in those early days of the pandemic, and when did you know it was time to supplement your income with a side hustle?



When Covid hit, I was in the middle of Die Fliegende Hollander and was slated to perform in Turandot a few weeks later. I had nurtured positions teaching fitness and ballet at New York City studios, which I continued via Zoom to stay financially afloat. However, I was also three months pregnant, and my husband was a full-time student. I had to get creative quickly. One of the first social impacts of Covid that everyone struggled with was isolation. It gave me the idea to start offering corporate wellness and team events to help employees stay connected in the newly virtual workplace.Related: Being an Entrepreneur Means Finding Profit in Your PassionHow did your professional background inspire you to launch The Triangle Sessions? How did that skill set translate to your entrepreneurial journey?I graduated in 2009 from NYU Tisch with a dance degree and a minor in art history. It was a terrible time to graduate, especially with an arts degree. I turned down an apprenticeship with a small ballet company to perform as a dancer on a cruise ship and travel the world. Believe it or not, this was simply the more practical approach at the time. I was able to give up my New York City apartment, live expense-free and save money. This experience served as a crash course in travel and tourism, something that would come into play 10 years later when organizing a large-scale retreat for a national law firm.After my cruise ship contract, I danced with a small contemporary company while waiting tables at high-end restaurants. It was the New York City restaurant scene that provided excellent training in wine, spirits and food pairings. Like the cruise ship, I learned the value of customer service and how to connect with a wide variety of people. Waiting tables still goes down as the hardest job I've ever had, but it was too physically demanding while dancing.Related: Shift Your Perspective From Getting to Giving to Get Unstuck


When I got my break at the Metropolitan Opera, a dream job for years, there was a catch…it still wasn't full-time. So, I had to supplement my income in a way that would be easier on my body. I became a certified yoga teacher, certified nutrition counselor and Ballet Beautiful trainer for celebrity clients. All of these skills allowed me to share a deeper understanding of the human body with a wide range of people. It set me up beautifully for teaching corporate wellness.For years, I continued to perform at the Metropolitan Opera while juggling a slew of part-time work. It wasn't until my aunt, a former ballroom champion and long-time business owner, told me something that I'll never forget: ""Dani, you already have the mentality of an entrepreneur in the way you support yourself. You have multiple income streams. Figure out how to work for yourself, not other people, so that you can share your knowledge on your own terms."" It was a lightbulb moment that got the wheels turning. It took a pandemic and a layoff from the Met Opera to pursue the endeavor full-time. What was your vision for The Triangle Sessions, and what were some of the first steps you took to get it off the ground?I wanted to implement the knowledge I developed in my professional dance career around healthy habits and performing at one's best. I wanted to replicate the camaraderie I had experienced in the dance world through high-quality, purpose-driven experiences and apply it to the corporate world.


When Covid first hit, I offered virtual wellness classes….yoga, meditation, desk stretching, etc., always with some type of social component. No one was interested. People just wanted alcohol and happy hours. I started incorporating educational wine and sake tastings WITH corporate wellness, and suddenly, there was interest! I found a fantastic vendor to help put together high-quality experience kits (and accommodate some of my wacky requests, like combining foam rollers with bottles of Prosecco and gourmet snacks), and I hit the ground running. Related: Side Hustles for These TimesHow did you approach continuing to build, and what does your revenue look like?Initially, the vast majority of business came from my own network, referrals and word-of-mouth. After some time hosting virtual team-building and wellness events, I became a small fish in a large pond. So, I partnered (and still continue to partner) with larger team-building event companies in which my services are offered. They have a dedicated sales team, and it provides steady revenue, all while nurturing my own clients and relationships. Annual revenue for 2022 was $110,000.


What were some of the biggest challenges along the way, and how did you navigate those?The biggest challenge is trying to anticipate the needs of organizations and their employees without straying too far from our own mission. Employee well-being and community are at the backbone of The Triangle Sessions. I keep an open mind and experiment to see where there's interest. In 2020, happy hours were in vogue. This last year it's been all about wellness and creativity. Luckily, I enjoy this process and love having an open dialogue with clients to learn about their needs. Many of our signature events, like our Build-A-Terrarium workshop, which combines plant care with self-care, have been inspired by client requests.Personally, I've struggled to find the balance between running The Triangle Sessions and wanting to continue to dance. Dance is my first love, my identity since I was three years old. I returned to the Met Opera part-time in 2021 and scaled back on the number of productions I usually perform to focus on building The Triangle Sessions. However, keeping my foot in the door at the Met sometimes leads to losing momentum. It's a risk I'm willing to take for now since I have the best of both worlds. Martha Graham once said, ""A dancer dies twice—once when they stop dancing, and this first death is the more painful."" These words ring true, but I'm grateful to be building another satisfying career around community, connectivity and high-quality performance.

Starting a Wellness Revolution.Do you have any advice for other professionals who want to start a side hustle or full-time business?Lean into your strengths. Learn your core values. Reflect on what makes you different. From there, assess how these skills can benefit others and bring out the best in communities. It may take a bit of experimentation and creativity, but the process can be surprisingly satisfying. Sometimes, you just need to start somewhere and see what happens. Celebrate the small wins and run (or dance!) at your own pace.

95,This One Factor in Mindset is the Difference Between Wealthy and Struggling Franchise Owners,"Nov 17, 2023",Scott Greenberg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/mindset-difference-between-wealthy-and-struggling/465297,"
Wealthy franchisees run excellent operations. They rank high in sales, control costs, and win awards. When they're not on-site, you'll still see engaged employees creating great customer experiences. Wealthy franchisees demonstrate consistently high performance that can be easily observed.None of this happens by accident. It's the H factor in this formula: C + O + H = R (Circumstances + Operations + Humanity = Results)Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now and take this quiz to find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.The 'H' FactorTheir mastery of the human elements of their business directly impacts their execution of operations. It's why they're superior. The figure below shows six areas of business operations. Notice the difference in how wealthy franchisees and struggling franchisees approach each one. Clearly, the wealthy franchisee's emotional experience of the business is more pleasant. It's also more lucrative because feelings and attitudes influence our habits, determining not just what we do but also how we do it.



Take marketing as an example. It's mysterious and expensive, and its impact may not be felt for a long time. Two franchisees might decide to run identical campaigns for four weeks. At that point, each must decide if they will continue.One franchisee concludes after four weeks that the ad campaign was a failure. They spent more on the ads than they saw in sales. Corporate is only telling them to advertise because it's not their money. They have other bills to pay, including rent, payroll, and plenty of other nonoptional expenses. Why waste money on something that doesn't work?


Related: The Most Common Problems Franchisees FaceThe other franchisee is patient. They know marketing takes a long time. Many people saw their ad and made a mental note to try the business when they need it. For some, that will be a few months later. Others noticed the ad but won't respond until they've seen it a few more times. Some people will act right away but won't indicate it was the ad that drove them in.This franchisee isn't certain the ad campaign will build their business, but they are certain that not advertising will allow it to perish. They see other thriving businesses constantly marketing, so logic dictates they should do the same. They have researched the percentage of revenue other successful businesses in their industry spend on marketing and earmarked an equal amount, but they won't be passive about it. They'll track progress and make adjustments. It will take consistency, money, and courage. But like all wealthy franchisees, they're in it for the long haul.

What's the latest science on brain health? How can I lose fat after 40? Why am I not seeing results from my workouts? I'm fortunate to have built my career around working with leading health and wellness brands, athletes and experts in the field. Last year, I shared 8 of the best health and wellness podcasts to help us eat better, exercise smarter, and live more optimally.Below, I share 8 of the newer, most reputable and leading books in health and wellness, all of which made the New York Times Best Sellers list. They aim to educate, inspire and offer ""actionable tips"" to level up your health and mental wellness and help you feel, as Dr. Gabrielle Lyon says, Forever Strong.'Outlive: The Science of Art and Longevity' by Peter AttiaPeter Attia asks us, ""Why should we seek longevity?"" Despite being a rigorous yet thorough read, Attia challenges some conventional medical thinking on aging to illustrate a new approach to preventing chronic disease and extending long-term health. Attia shares how he ""rethinks"" mainstream medicine, which, for all of its successes, has fallen short of making progress against the diseases of aging that kill most people: heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes. Dr. Attia explains how we must replace this outdated framework with a personalized, proactive strategy for longevity.



This is not ""biohacking,"" but rather science, and this book offers tools to best personalize our health needs. While Attia has his own podcast, I valued learning more about his daily lifestyle, workout routines and nutrition habits (including a glass of wine or tequila here and there) on this episode of The Him and Her Podcast.Related: 5 Books Every Entrepreneur Should Read Before Starting a Business


'Forever Strong: A New, Science-Based Strategy for Aging Well' by Dr. Gabrielle LyonDr. Lyon has worked with everyone from the military to geriatrics to the strongest athletes in the world and has become my go-to for all things protein and muscle. Since meeting her, I have tried to include 40+ grams of protein in my meals. The results? I am stronger, have fewer sports injuries and have more mental clarity. In Forever Strong, Dr. Lyon teaches us how to reboot our metabolism, build strength, and extend our lives with an actionable guidebook demonstrating muscle's importance for health and longevity.As the Institute for Muscle-Centric Medicine® founder, Dr. Lyon changes the conversation about fat loss and longevity by stating that ""the fat story is about restriction, and the muscle story is about strength."" Lyon explains that 73% of adults are overweight or obese, and outside of smoking, obesity is the leading cause of death. She asserts, ""We are not making progress because these issues are a muscle problem, not a fat problem. We are not overfat, we are under-muscled."" Dr. Lyon focuses on skeletal muscle as the most important organ for longevity, fitness and health.Related: 7 Books Every CEO Should Read'Scarcity Brain: Fix Your Craving Mindset and Rewire Your Habits to Thrive with Enough' by Michael EasterOur world is overloaded with everything we're built to crave and overconsume. Easter starts his book with research on why many of us have a scarcity mindset, left over from our ancient ancestors, who had to constantly seek and consume to survive because vital survival tools like food, material goods, information, and power were scarce. He explains how our caveman wiring can push us to want more than we need and then repeat — specifically with bad choices.


He uses examples like gambling, drinking, binge-watching TV and overeating unhealthy food. Easter then reveals that the solution isn't to aim for less mindlessly but rather to understand why we crave more in the first place, drop our worst habits and make more effective use of what we already have. With a well-organized format, he explains the scarcity loop theory. Then, he empowers us with relatable, direct and useful examples that can lead us to self-discovery and utilizing tools to live a healthier, more satisfying, and fulfilling life. Easter's book is the answer for anyone looking to stop mindless scrolling, constant cravings, and always wanting to overconsume. You can find a thorough episode about Scarcity Brain on The Joe Rogan Show.'Young Forever: The Secrets to Living Your Longest, Healthiest Life' by Dr. Mark HymanKnown as one of the leading Functional Medicine practitioners and teachers, Dr. Mark Hyman focuses his 11th book on the trending topic of longevity. As we've noticed from these New York Times Best Selling books on wellness, doctors and functional medicine experts are finding new ways to modify aging and extend good health. In this book, Dr. Hyman challenges us to reimagine our biology, health, and aging process. He explores the biological hallmarks of aging, their causes, and their consequences—then shows us how to overcome them with simple dietary, lifestyle, and emerging longevity strategies. From reducing inflammation to fortifying immunity, this book offers specifics on supplements that may be best for you, insights on where research on aging is headed and using your food as medicine.Related: 50 Books That Transformed My Business and My Life'Boundless Kitchen' by Ben GreenfieldGreenfield is a long-time friend, and I've adopted many of his health and wellness hacks, which, similar to his recipes, can be wild and ""out there."" Biohacking meets molecular gastronomy in this all-new cookbook that includes 48 inspired recipes for longevity, health and great eating. Greenfield brings his ""mad scientist chef"" approach right into our kitchens and teaches us unconventional kitchen tools and tactics, ingredients both familiar and fringe (such as organ meats and colostrum), and detailed guidance for making food that boosts brain and body health, doesn't taste like cardboard, and is incredibly fun to create.


Within these pages, you'll find a fresh take on ""blue zones,"" principles for clean eating, recipes for plants, meats, fermented foods, drinks and desserts — from Carrot Cake Blender Waffles to Crispy Fish Collars to Ben's Biohacked and Boundless Beef Stew. Including cooking techniques across roasting, sous vide and air-frying, this gorgeously illustrated book is free of diet dogmas. It will change your perception of what healthy eating can be — absolutely enjoyable and delicious!Related: When Will We Finally Put Our Money Where Our Food Grows?'Master Your Stress, Reset Your Health: The Personalized Program to Calm Anxiety, Boost Energy, and Beat Burnout' by Dr. Doni WilsonI first listened to Dr. Wilson on The Big Silence podcast here. Dr. Wilson has focused on stress reduction for years, and in this book, she explains how stress is not one size fits all. It is different for every individual. To recover from stress and burnout, we must first understand how stress impacts us, then utilize her step-by-step guide to help us address the health issues caused by stress and improve our longevity. I respect Dr. Wilson's philosophy that it's impossible to be ""stress-free,"" yet we can learn to give ourselves and our bodies what we need to be healthy even while stressed.'Next Level: Your Guide to Kicking Ass, Feeling Great, and Crushing Goals Through Menopause and Beyond' by Dr. Stacy Sims15 years ago, I was honored to help Dr. Sims launch and promote a hydration product inspired by her TEDx talk entitled, ""Women Are Not Small Men,"" explaining how sports nutrition studies were conducted on men and the results were assumed to be the same for women. Dr. Sims was resolute about how this presumption was incorrect. She went on to research physiology and how women responded differently from men to all things nutrition, exercise, supplements and naturally, hormones. Amongst other books and published studies around women's physiology and performance, Dr. Sims' latest book revolves around Menopause, where most women battle new symptoms, from gaining weight, losing endurance and strength, and taking longer to bounce back from workouts than before. Once you understand your physiology, you can work with it—not against it—to optimize your performance.


In Next Level, Sims shares science-backed advice about training, nutrition, sleep and recovery and supplements, sample exercise routines, meal plans, macronutrient planning charts, and case studies from real women she has coached through the transition. I have seen benefits in my own workouts, having applied her research about how women over 40 need more strength than cardio.'Gut Feelings: Healing the Shame-Fueled Relationship Between What You Eat and How You Feel' by Dr. Will ColeOne of the country's leading functional medicine experts and integrative medicine doctors, Dr. Will Cole started one of the world's first functional medicine telehealth centers. In his third New York Times Best Selling book, Dr. Cole explains the relationship between our physical and emotional health, providing a framework for us to understand the gut-brain connection and influence that connection for the better. He illustrates how stress and shame can cause gut inflammation and sabotage your health in a process called Shameflammation, which can be the reason for chronic health conditions such as autoimmune disorders, leaky gut, IBS and other GI disorders.From recipes to mindfulness and better sleep techniques, Dr. Cole offers holistic tools to help you re-evaluate your relationship with food and your body, getting you back in touch with your gut feelings. His specific 21-Day Gut Feeling plan helps you bridge the gap between your emotions and your health.Longevity is the current common thread woven amongst these books and other titles I'd add to the list, including The Blue Zones by Dan Buettner, Glucose Revolution by Jessie Ichauspé, How To Help Your Child Clean Up The Mental Mess by Dr. Caroline Leaf and Genius Kitchen by Max Lugavere. I enjoy keeping on top of the science and welcome continuing to experiment with my own health and wellness routines.


I hope you seek to become the best version of yourself and, through education and experimentation, find what works best for you. Every body is different, and nutrition, fitness and mental health routines are not one size fits all. I encourage you to find what tools help you be your absolute best in your career, your family and most importantly, yourself!

97,College Coach Gets Staggering Amount of Money After Being Fired,"Nov 16, 2023",Jonathan Small,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/college-coach-gets-staggering-amount-of-money-after-being/465474,"
Texas A&M sacked head football coach Jimbo Fisher last Sunday, but not before buying out his contract for a stunning $76 million. The decision is part of a shocking turn of events that's shaken the sports world.""Although this is a major, major financial decision that comes with many consequences, we have a plan, and we will not let this impact the performance or the culture of our entire athletics program,"" said Texas A&M athletics director Ross Bjork.Related: Colorado's Football Team Was Robbed at the Rose Bowl, and Coach Deion Sanders Wants Reimbursement



High hopes come crashing downFisher took over at Texas A&M in 2018, signing a 10-year contract through the 2031 season. He started his tenure successfully, leading the team to three bowl games, including an Orange Bowl win in 2020. But since then, the team's fortunes have fumbled, leaving management no choice but to let Coach Fisher go.Big buyoutLuckily for Fisher, his contract included a substantial buyout clause, and now the university owes him a stunning sum. According to The Associated Press, Fisher is owed between $75 and $77 million, making it the largest known buyout ever given to a fired head coach. This hefty amount will be paid to Fisher regardless of whether he finds a new coaching job.


Bjork said $19 million (25% of his salary) is due within 60 days. The remaining balance will be paid in several installments, with the first installment of approximately $7 million due within 120 days.To fund these payments, the university plans to use unrestricted contributions within the 12th Man Foundation (a Texas A&M scholarship program) for the first one-time payment. The remaining portion will be financed from growing revenues and adjusting the annual operating budget of the athletic department.Forward progressBjork says the school has learned from Fisher's contract and that their decision will not impact the overall performance or culture of the athletics program.""We were stuck... something was not working to reach our full potential,"" Bjork said. ""We should be relevant on the national scene.""


Texas A&M beat Mississippi State 51-10 on Saturday, but Fisher's dismissal was based on the overall record of the football program over the past several years. Fisher was 45-25 in six seasons at Texas A&M.As the Texas A&M football moves forward, the university hopes the decision to fire Fisher will turn the program around. But the financial repercussions of his contract will be felt for years to come.

98,He Started a Side Hustle in His Dorm Room With 'a Bunch of Ingredients From Amazon and a Crockpot' — Now It's a $56 Million Brand in Walmarts Nationwide,"Nov 15, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/dorm-room-side-hustle-turns-into-56-million-aftercare-brand/465365,"
Oliver Zak, co-founder of tattoo aftercare brand Mad Rabbit, was at his third tattoo appointment when the alarm bells started to go off: Guidance was seriously lacking around the proper way to care for fresh ink, and the oft-recommended petroleum jelly solution didn't work for him — in fact, it only made his scabs worse.""For tattoos, scabs are pretty bad,"" Zak tells Entrepreneur. ""The ink gets lodged in the scab, and when the scabs fall off, your tattoo that you just spent tons of hours and pain and money on can look pretty rough after, as soon as week two. It was that initial pain point that drew me to wanting to formulate a more natural, clean and vegan solution for tattoo healing.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Mad Rabbit. Oliver Zak, left; Selom Agbitor, right.



It was 2019, the second semester of Zak's senior year of college, when he and Mad Rabbit co-founder Selom Agbitor got to work. With the help of Zak's mother and her apothecary knowledge, the duo created an all-natural moisturizer that was ""kind of a test"" to see if a natural brand in the tattoo space would resonate with people.""That product ended up being product that we ran with for the first two years.""""So we ended up ordering a bunch of ingredients from Amazon and a crockpot and trying recipe after recipe after recipe,"" Zak recalls, ""going off of the feedback of my mom's apothecary experience. That product [a spot moisturizer for tattoos with a shea and cocoa butter base] ended up being the product that we ran with for the first two years.""The summer after graduation, the co-founders focused on transitioning the side hustle out of Zak's kitchen and into a full-fledged venture. They flew to Los Angeles to interview manufacturers and doubled down on Facebook ads and brand-building through paid media. Within two years, Mad Rabbit's single balm product brought in nearly $3 million in revenue, Zak says. At that point, Zak and Agbitor knew they ""had something really special.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Mad RabbitThe hit product convinced them to expand, and in 2020, they were invited to appear on Shark Tank. Zak calls the experience ""a dream come true"" — growing up, he'd watched the show with his family every Friday. Ultimately, after 10 days of preparation in a Covid-bubble Las Vegas hotel room, Mad Rabbit struck a deal with Mark Cuban: $500,000 for a 12% stake in the company.


Related: How ZinePak Built a Growing Publishing Empire on the Back of Bieber Fever""Not only did [Shark Tank] help us with general brand and household awareness, but it was also a helpful opportunity for us to hop on the venture capital train and raise a proper seed round from a venture-backed firm,"" Zak says.The weekend after the co-founders' Shark Tank appearance, Mad Rabbit did an additional $500,000 in sales and rode that momentum into introductions with other venture capitalist groups, ultimately stumbling across Acronym Venture Capital, led by general partner Joshua Siegel.""He's just very founder-friendly,"" Zak says of Siegel. ""I like to think of him as a visionary because he got in very early on something people [overlooked]. People just assume tattoos are taboo and the market's too small for any sort of venture backing, but we ended up finding a fantastic partner as a result who is excited about the momentum that we've built [and] the progress that we've made.""


Image Credit: Courtesy of Mad Rabbit""It was a bit of an uphill battle as far as us really proving out that tattoos are a big thing, and they're here to stay, literally.""In March, Mad Rabbit announced a Series A investment of $10 million led by Lucas Brand Equity with Mark Cuban, Acronym Venture Capital, H Venture Partners and others, quadrupling the brand's valuation to $56 million.Like every business, Mad Rabbit faced its fair share of challenges throughout its founding journey, Zak notes. But one of the most recent — and ""exciting"" — ones? That would be securing the brand's place in retail. It's ""pretty easy for a brand to represent itself online,"" Zak says, but there's an additional hurdle when it comes to landing coveted space on physical shelves, especially if some view it as ""taboo.""

Now She's Helping Kids Launch Big Ideas of Their Own.""It was a bit of an uphill battle as far as proving that tattoos are a big thing, and they're here to stay, literally,"" Zak explains. In 2012, around 20% of adults had at least one tattoo in the U.S.; now, that number sits around 32%, according to Pew Research Center. ""So there's been massive cultural adoption of art that is permanent on bodies,"" Zak says.But the co-founders finally got retail giant Walmart on their side. The retailer took seven of Mad Rabbit's products nationwide, effectively rolling the brand out as the ""tattoo destination of mass America"" over the past few months, Zak says. Now, Mad Rabbit's ""tripling down on Walmart"" — collaborating with the retailer on ""a kind of tattoo roadshow,"" where the team travels to Walmarts across the U.S. to ""get people excited to come get tattooed, hopefully in the parking lot.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Mad Rabbit


""I always say that college is the lowest-risk time you could possibly learn some lessons — you don't have a full-time job to worry about.""Mad Rabbit also continues to ""invest pretty heavily"" into influencer and celebrity partnerships and ""go deeper"" within the tattoo artist community, which Zak credits with facilitating the growth of tattoo culture.""It's increasingly important for us to not only win them over as kind of the aftercare recommendation to replace that petroleum jelly pain point that I shared earlier, but we're also at the point where we're innovating on products that they use in their tattooing process,"" Zak says, ""so focusing on the professional channel and creating better products for the artist to use as well.""Related: How This High School Dropout Got Mark Cuban's Attention and Disrupted an Industry


And for other emerging entrepreneurs who hope to turn their side hustles into successful full-time businesses, Zak has a perhaps unexpected piece of advice: ""Keep it a side hustle as long as you can.""""Especially for those considering starting something in college,"" Zak explains. ""I always say that college is the lowest-risk time you could learn some lessons — you don't have a full-time job to worry about. You most likely don't have a wife and kids and a house to pay off.

99,This Fitness Leader Tripled His Revenue in Two Years. Here's How He Did It,"Nov 10, 2023",Jon Bier,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/this-fitness-leader-tripled-his-revenue-in-two-years/465036,"
The fitness space is crowded, challenging, and dominated by big brands. But the upstart brand AARMY has carved out a growing niche, with revenue up more than 200% in the past two years.How is it growing so fast? By making fitness as personal as possible.AARMY is a gym headquartered in lower Manhattan, and offers in-person workout classes along with a plethora of online classes. But the real differentiator is AARMY's philosophy: Founder Akin Akman says he wants his company's coaching to reach beyond the walls of the gym and ""reverberate through lives.""



""If I can help one person, if I can build one person up, I'm good,"" says Akin Akman. ""Some of my proudest moments are when people will come and tell me, 'I lead my team differently because of you. I talk to my kids differently because of you.'""And in turn, those people become the company's most powerful advocates — helping to grow a community of devotees in a way that's hard for a big brand to replicate.


I recently sat down Akman to discuss his foundational mindset on my One Day podcast. You can listen to our conversation here:Below, I break out the four key principles that Akman has used to build AARMY — and that any entrepreneur can use to propel their brand.1. Fit it to Your Pre-Existing PassionsAARMY wasn't just a business opportunity for Akin. It flows naturally from his life story. He was sent to an intensive tennis academy in Florida at the age of seven, and has been training with and coaching others ever since.""A lot of the [AARMY] programing comes from how I grew up training,"" he says. ""Recovery and prehab and rehab from my injuries and just knowledge that I have acquired over the years.""


After his tennis phase, Akin became a coach at Crunch and Soul Cycle — and grew a devoted following before using all those skills to strike out on his own. Some lifelong passions might be easier to slot into a successful business model than others, but finding that intersection can be well worth doing.2. Know Why People Come to Your Brand""Build it and they will come,"" as the old saying goes — but they don't always come for the reasons you'd expect.Akin learned this himself. When he first started coaching, he assumed his clients would be, as he says, ""athletes like myself that missed that daily hustle, that camaraderie, that team that works diligently to sharpen your skills.""But his actual client base became much wider. ""It can be for everyday use,"" he says. ""It can be for sports. It's functional training. It's also PT, it's longevity. So there's all these ways to get people to see the benefits of the movement.""


By being open to a wider variety of customers and motivations, he was able to build a larger and richer community than if he'd stuck to a narrower idea of who would want to train with his methods.3. Uniformity is PowerfulEvery sports team, from soccer to tennis, boasts a uniform that binds its members together. Akin embraced this tribe concept for AARMY, drawing upon his background in tennis and his days at Soul Cycle.He envisioned a brand where people felt connected through a shared sense of identity and belonging. Because ""a soccer team has a uniform, you know what team they play for,"" Akin says. To reinforce the identity, everyone who works out at AARMY wears the same gray, black, or camo-green colors during workout classes. (He sells AARMY-branded clothes, but people can also bring their own.)By embedding a unique visual identity into the culture of his brand, he creates brand loyalty and instills pride and camaraderie among his members. That can have tangible and immediate effects on the bottom line too, with swag and merch making up nearly 10% of AARMY's revenue.


4. Combine the Digital With the PhysicalWhich is better — a brick-and-mortar experience, or a digital platform? There are pros and cons to either, which is why Akin wanted to give his clients options. The trick was finding a creative way of blending the two, combining the best elements of each.On the one hand, technology can undeniably remove obstacles, and be more convenient. ""I like to get all the excuses out the door because people always have excuses. So having an app or being able to do it online also cuts that out. You can literally do it anytime, anywhere. You just have to want to do it,"" Akin said.But in-person workout classes can foster a stronger community and create more intense experiences, so the way Akin sees it is you can work out at home or while you're traveling to ""get that extra credit work and then come in person and execute at a higher standard.""There are times when you have to pick a lane, and times when it's all about blending the different models, and creating a hybrid that makes sense for the specific goals you're setting out to accomplish.

Tipico


In this ongoing series, we are sharing advice, tips and insights from real entrepreneurs who are out there doing business battle on a daily basis. (Answers have been edited and condensed for clarity.)Who are you and what's your business?I'm Adrian Vella, CEO of Tipico, a global sports betting and iGaming operator. I'm originally from Malta, one of the smallest European countries, but from a young age, I envisioned something bigger for myself. I lived all over Europe, from the U.K. to Switzerland, and worked my way up by learning all areas of the sports betting business, from finance to data analytics.



I began my journey at Tipico in 2014 and moved to the United States in 2019 specifically to spearhead the launch of the Tipico U.S. platform. Since our initial launch in New Jersey, we have been active in four states, taking a hyperlocal approach to drive first-time platform deposits and establish long-term customer loyalty. We are the only online casino and sportsbook in the U.S. market that has built its proprietary greenfield tech stack from scratch.Related: When He Tried to Buy and Develop a Distressed Shopping Center in Baltimore, He Found an 80-Year-Old Legal Covenant That Banned Black Ownership. Here's What He Did Next.


What inspired you to create this business? What was your ""aha moment""?When the U.S. Supreme Court struck down its federal sports betting ban in the spring of 2018. We had witnessed explosive market growth and the industry's cycles of maturity in Europe, and we foresaw the United States was on a similar trajectory. We also recognized that many players were scaling rapidly to acquire customers with white-label technology. We took a different approach, taking the hard steps to localize our technology as we had done in Europe. We had to act fast, but we also wanted to do things the right way by strategically entering certain states and developing our technology in-house. This philosophy of balancing speed and strategy in an unwavering commitment to the customer is one we still swear by today. For us, it's a marathon, not a sprint.What has been your biggest challenge and how did you pivot to overcome it?Moving from Malta to London was a difficult decision. It was a leap of faith, and at the time it was impossible to feel fully convinced I was doing the right thing. But I realized having this appetite for risk and making the necessary sacrifices would change my life. I overcame the uncertainty by embracing the discomfort, building strong working relationships, creating some semblance of work-life balance, and convincing myself this was my purpose. All my past experiences helped me transition and prepare for my new life in the U.S. This is a completely new culture and business landscape, but I'm adapting well!


Related: He Left a Steady Corporate Job and Turned His Music Passion Into a Thriving Audio Tech CompanyWhat advice would you give entrepreneurs looking for funding?Emphasize to investors exactly what problem you're solving and what aspect of society you are improving. Highlight your niche and why you are different from the rest. Know your numbers — your revenue and growth and P&L figures — like the back of your hand. If you are in your early, pre-launch stage, give investors something they can feel and experience in your product or service, like a prototype or beta version.What does the word ""entrepreneur"" mean to you?


Many things. It means being an innovator. You're a risk-taking, problem-solving, and passionate individual with an idea who wants to drive it forward and present it to the world. It means leading and inspiring people with your unique vision. It is not for everyone, and you need a thick skin and the ability to embrace failure and work through the ups and downs. Even before Tipico, I've always had an entrepreneurial spirit and that compelled me to take on the CEO role.Related: How the Founders of SpaceIt Are Re-Building the Way Real Estate Brokers Do BusinessWhat is something many aspiring business owners think they need that they really don't?I've seen many aspiring business owners who are convinced they need to start with an enormous sum of money for security to back them up. But it could have been easier if they started by putting something into the market in an agile way. I also see people with so much potential to be great, and a desire to put their ideas out in the world, but they never do because they assume an incredible idea will just hit them like a lightning bolt. This is rarely how the journey manifests itself. Failure is part of the process, and I would encourage aspiring business owners who are on the fence about taking the leap to think less and do more.


Is there a particular quote or saying that you use as personal motivation?""Knowledge without action is meaningless."" — Abu BakrThis quote deeply resonates with me. I am a proactive individual who thrives on continuous learning and nurtures an unyielding sense of curiosity. I'm always the guy asking a million questions when I'm trying to absorb new information. I firmly believe that the true value of knowledge is unlocked when it is coupled with action.


Tipico has seen years of success and market share growth in Europe, but we did not stagnate. We took what we learned and brought it to the booming, crowded U.S. market. Our perspectives remain futile unless we transform them into tangible outcomes through the process of learning from our failures and, most importantly, taking purposeful actions based on that knowledge. At work and in my personal life, the only regrets I have are from the times when I didn't put things into action — when I didn't go for it.?is>

101,Build Confidence and Get Over Imposter Syndrome by Focusing on 3 Areas,"Nov 3, 2023",Scott Greenberg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/how-to-build-confidence-and-get-over-imposter-syndrome/464789,"
For many franchisees, the problem isn't an abundance of confidence (i.e. massive egos) but a shortage. The spectrum ranges from shyness and minor self-doubt to social anxiety and major self-loathing.A little insecurity is normal. For most people, it's an unpleasant inconvenience, but when it starts to impede your life and work, it becomes a problem. You need to believe in your ability in order to realize it. To develop that resolve, we'll focus on three areas that require your attention: mind, body, and environment.Your MindBy now you should understand how important your thoughts are to your business. Optimizing your mind will not only make you more effective at running your franchise, but it'll also allow you to enjoy being who you are. So monitor your thoughts. Notice which ones weaken you and learn to replace them with positive affirmations. They're truer and more useful. Be as forgiving of your own faults as you are of your loved ones' faults. Don't beat yourself up for what you can't do or don't know. There's room for error. Related: Explore great opportunities on the Franchise 500You're so great in so many ways that your strengths will compensate for any shortcomings. At the same time, keep working to improve. Never stop learning. Most powerfully, practice gratitude. That means wanting what you have and loving who you are, rather than getting what you want and changing into someone you're not.Your BodyYour body and mind are connected. When you're sad, you cry. When you're stressed, you ache. Fear, excitement, and arousal all manifest in physical ways. Our brain creates hormones and chemicals based on thoughts and feelings, and vice versa. Changes in our physiology directly impact our thoughts and feelings. In other words, physical health boosts your mental state. So exercise, eat well, and take care of your appearance, which includes grooming and dressing for success. When you look good, you feel good. A lot of franchisees neglect their health—it's easy to do when you get busy. But I've observed that wealthy franchisees tend to make it a priority.



Your EnvironmentYour environment is the world around you, and it affects how you feel about yourself. Physically, keep your spaces tidy and organized. Keep your car clean, and keep your desk and all flat spaces clear. Socially, expose yourself to positive people and cut loose the dead batteries. You know who they are. Everyone in your life should make you feel better about yourself. Make it your mission to boost the mood of everyone you come into contact with. Improving the world around you will improve the emotional world within you. Related: Discover 5 Top Retail Franchise Opportunities to Invest InAll three of these areas deserve an entire series written about each of them. My main point is that confidence is something you can actively build. Your business (and your life) will be better for it.Impostor SyndromeSometimes confidence problems manifest as impostor syndrome. Ever feel like you're faking it? Like you're pretending to know what you're doing? That's impostor syndrome. I get franchisees talking about this all the time at my presentations, often for the first time. They're surprised by how many of their colleagues share these feelings. It goes beyond the negative self-talk many of us engage in. It's the belief not just that you're inferior, but that you're a fraud altogether. You're only an impostor if you're representing yourself as something you're not.Being a franchisee doesn't mean you understand everything about the business—in fact, it means you want to learn more and are paying someone to help you. Outsourcing the expertise is smart. You still need to learn as much as you can and work hard, but you don't have to pretend you know more than you do. Have a question? Raise your hand. Need some help? Make a call. That's what you're paying for.


And don't let other franchisees in your system intimidate you. Wealthy franchisees are always happy to help or answer a question. Plenty of people helped them. You're not an impostor. If you've signed the papers and paid the fee, you're a franchisee. Own it. In the end, it comes down to focus. The more you focus on yourself, the less effective you'll be. The more you focus on others, the wealthier you'll get. You might be an amazing person or you might be terrible.Related: Here Are 4 Big Franchising Trends You Should Know AboutEither way, no one cares—they're too focused on their own issues. So don't even worry about it. The sooner you realize your business isn't about you, the sooner you can do the work that will fast-track you toward success. Wealth is a result of what you put out into the world. So accept your imperfect self, know that wealth is within your reach, and go get it by focusing on your team and your customers. There's no better way to build your business.

The University of Colorado Buffaloes lost more than just a football game last Saturday. The players and coach say thieves went into their locker room during the action and stole a ton of valuable jewelry.""Our kids got robbed during the game last week. I think that's a travesty,"" said head coach Deion Sanders at a press conference earlier this morning.

Multiple players returned to the dressing room to find that personal jewelry left in there had disappeared. Several pieces of personal and football items were also taken. The Pasadena Police have launched an investigation into the incident, according to the LA Times.

""I would expect the NCAA to do something about that. This is the Rose Bowl,"" he said. ""The granddaddy of 'em all, right? I'm sure Granddaddy has some money. Grandpa should have some money to give these kids.""Sanders said that the kids had received instruction on managing their finances, but the lessons did not include insuring their items. ""We slipped, and we didn't educate them on that.""He asked his players to give him a tally of the stolen items.""I'm gonna have a list made out from these young men, and I know they're going to be truthful about what they lost, so we can try to get that back for them. We need to reimburse them.""

103,The Founder of Lululemon Is Spending $100 Million to Try to Beat the Super Rare Disease That's Destroying His Muscles,"Nov 1, 2023",Lakshmi Varanasi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/lululemon-founder-chip-wilson-invests-100m-on-rare-disease/464730,"
This article originally appeared on Business Insider.Chip Wilson, the founder of Lululemon, has been living with a rare muscular disease for the past several decades, and he's funneling $100 million of his multibillion-dollar net worth into finding a cure.Wilson was given the diagnosis of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, or FSHD, in 1987 when he was 32 years old, Bloomberg reported. The disease causes the progressive loss of skeletal muscle and affects a little under 900,000 people worldwide, according to FSHD Society. Wilson has an even less common form named FSHD2 that affects just 5% of those with the disease, Bloomberg noted. In other words, he's one of about 43,000 people with FSHD2.



For years after the diagnosis, Bloomberg reported, Wilson maintained a pretty active lifestyle. But he told the outlet he had a ""wake-up call"" decades later when he was signing a deal with China's biggest athletic-apparel maker, Anta Sports Products, to buy a stake in the Finnish sports company Amer Sports and found himself struggling to walk.By 2022, he had launched a venture philanthropy fund named Solve FSHD, which aims to develop a cure for the disease by 2027, according to its website. Solve is particularly focused on finding new therapies for FSHD2 and has so far deployed close to $31 million into biotech companies working on various interventions, its website says.


Wilson seems to believe that ultrawealthy entrepreneurs can be powerful catalysts for medical innovation because they have the funds to attract talent and take a more results-driven mindset to research than charitable or government organizations. He told Bloomberg that capitalism had ""created everything good in the world.""Bloomberg reported that in the meantime, Wilson was also resorting to experimental procedures and testing several longevity and wellness treatments. He was undergoing electroacupuncture; going for IV drips of NAD, which is an enzyme that plays a critical role in healthy cell function; taking weekly doses of the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin; and taking daily doses of testosterone, the outlet reported.Solve FSHD did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider.

104,How to Turn Self-Doubt Into a Superpower,"Nov 1, 2023",Scott Greenberg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/how-to-turn-self-doubt-into-a-superpower/464444,"
Some people are motivated by their insecurity. They respond to these negative thoughts as a challenge. When your mental heckler (that's what I call that doubting voice inside you) brings out your best, you can go along with it. But when it paralyzes you, you need to manage it. Related: Explore great opportunities on the Franchise 500For some, the mental heckler is totally debilitating. For most of us, it's just an annoying distraction that makes us work harder. I don't know how to stop it, but I do know how to make sure it doesn't stop you. By managing it, you can free up your brainpower for more important tasks. Here are some effective tips to help you do that, and allow you to run your franchise with a clear head.



Expel the Heckler from Your HeadLike a shark that never stops swimming, the mental heckler is always ready to strike. But a shark is only dangerous in the water. Get it out of the water, and it flops helplessly. The mental heckler does its damage in your head. Get it out of there, and it, too, loses its power. There are a few ways to do this. First, try writing down what it says.You might also try sharing your mental heckles with someone else: a friend, a colleague, a therapist, or anyone else you trust. Speaking your insecurities aloud allows you to hear them outside your head. Here, too, they can sound silly. Discussing them with someone else also allows you to get an outsider's perspective, which can often be more accurate than your own.Use the Fact vs. Feeling TestOne woman I coached had a relentless mental heckler. She was a graduate student only three writing assignments away from completing a required course. But that might as well have been 10 years of hard labor because her heckler told her she couldn't write. Her mental block was so strong that she couldn't even sit down at the computer. She finished with an incomplete, and eventually, she received a letter from the dean advising her to leave the program. When I asked her why she couldn't get her work done, she said there were a million reasons. When I told her to list them all, it turned out there were only eight. These reasons included: ""My ideas are too crazy,"" ""I'm not smart enough,"" and ""Everyone can do it but me.""


To coach her through this block, I used a technique I call ""Fact. vs. Feeling,"" a simple method for determining if your mental heckles have merit. See this sample worksheet.Whenever you feel inadequate, unqualified, or in trouble, ask yourself if your conclusion is based on a fact or just a feeling. A fact is something that can be objectively verified. Its existence can be demonstrated to the point where there can be no debate. It just is. A feeling, on the other hand, is subjective. It's an interpretation of reality based on a perception that may or may not be accurate. Compared to a fact, it's unreliable. For each of the mental heckles you listed in the left-hand column, determine whether it's based on facts or just your feelings. In other words, are you objectively stating what the situation is, or are you throwing in your own interpretation?Example 1: Your business is losing money. You owe three years of back taxes. You have no savings, and the bank is foreclosing on your home. So you think, ""I have money problems."" This conclusion is based on facts. No one would argue with you—there's a set of real financial problems here you need to address. You probably have some feelings to go with these facts, but the facts themselves are undeniable.Example 2: Business is slow, and you have a lot of debt. You still have to get your kids through college. You think to yourself, ""I'll never be able to afford retirement."" This conclusion is based on feelings. It might turn out to be true, but without a crystal ball, there's no way to know how your circumstances might change. Many people have overcome their financial problems and prospered. Your conclusion could be correct, but so far there are no facts to suggest it's necessarily true. Related: Discover 5 Top Retail Franchise Opportunities to Invest InIf your problems are based on facts, they're real and require your attention. This is actually good news. Real problems can be looked at objectively and have tangible solutions. For example, debt can be overcome by consolidation, negotiation, and increased income.But chances are most of your problems are based on feelings because the mental heckler is giving you an incorrect self-assessment. In a court of law, you're innocent until proven guilty. In your life, you're doing well until proven otherwise. If the mental heckler argues that something's wrong, demand proof. Get the facts and then make an informed assessment of your situation. You'll probably find you're doing better than you realized.Join a GroupWhether it's a goal group, a mastermind group, or a support group, there's tremendous value in working through this stuff with others. Many franchise brands actually help enroll their franchisees into performance groups with colleagues from around the system. Not only can you get outside perspectives on your issues, but you can also listen to their unfounded insecurities and begin to recognize the patterns of mental heckler thinking.I was in such a group in college, and I remember noticing how obvious the solutions were to everyone's problems but my own. Somehow I didn't have the same clarity when it came to my own life. But others assured me I was no different from the rest of the group, which was comforting. I began to perceive how my issues sounded like everyone else's. When everyone was complaining about the same mental heckles, we could laugh at them for what they were—common insecurities. These conversations validated our feelings while stripping them of power. Once it's exposed to other intelligent people, your mental heckler doesn't stand a chance.Restate Subjective Feelings as Objective FactsOften our feelings are judgmental interpretations of the facts. Think about weight, for example. Scientifically speaking, our weight is an objective measurement of the gravitational pull of the Earth on our bodies. When you step on a scale, it gives you a number without judgment. It doesn't say ""fat"" or ""skinny."" It simply provides data. But when you interpret that data and assign an opinion about it, that's when your emotions kick in. You might feel elated that you've reached the weight you believe is attractive or depressed about some added poundage. Maybe you'll feel guilty about eating that extra bear claw for breakfast.


Related: Here Are 4 Big Franchising Trends You Should Know AboutThe mental heckler notices information and then interprets it to generate feelings. These feelings are distractions. They're counterproductive. We need to undo them by distilling our thoughts back to the objective information. Notice the difference between the following pairs of statements:""My business is failing"" versus ""My business is down 15 percent.""""There's no way I can learn this computer system"" versus ""I need to learn this software.""""There's nothing I can do"" versus ""I don't know what to do.""While the second statement in each pair might generate some emotion, it's still more useful. It accurately describes what's happening or what needs to happen. The first statements are absolutes. They're unhelpful and probably wrong. That's why writing down your thoughts is so useful. It makes it easier to see where you're infusing them with judgment and clouding your perspective. Get back to the facts and nudge your mind back to objective thinking.If you sometimes doubt yourself or feel abnormal, it means you're normal. It means you're just like the rest of us. And you're just like wealthy franchisees. But wealthy franchisees manage their heads well. They don't let negative self-talk stop them from taking the action needed to grow their business. Feel your feelings, but continue to do the work. Don't let your inner critic stop you.
"
105,How to Silence Your Inner Critic,"Nov 1, 2023",Scott Greenberg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/how-to-silence-your-inner-critic/464442,"
Our culture breeds insecurity. Each day we're exposed to thousands of messages about how we're supposed to live. We're surrounded by beauty magazines, fast cars, and fancy houses. We celebrate celebrities, adore athletes, and worship the wealthy without having any idea how happy they really are. We mimic their hairstyles, buy their perfumes, and wear their signature sneakers. But those feeling aren't just about our personal lives. They bleed over into the franchises we run as well.Insecurity in FranchisingCloser to home, we monitor our franchise colleagues, notice how they're doing, and then compare our accomplishments to theirs. One franchisee is clearing six figures from his store. You barely make half that. Another franchisee just opened her third location. You still only have one. Before long, everything good we see in others turns into self-criticism. Franchisors mean well when they celebrate top performers onstage at their conventions. They're hoping these high performers will inspire everyone else, but for many, seeing others succeed has the opposite effect.Related: I'm a Franchise Consultant — These Are The 5 Franchise Warning Signs To Look Out ForThe mental heckler also echoes criticism we've received from real people. Every insult makes its mark. Sticks and stones will break our bones, but words do permanent damage. This is especially true when they come from people who matter to us. Our parents, our coaches, our teachers—they may have the best intentions, but often their ""help"" cuts deep. I'll never forget my high school geometry teacher telling me I could never get into Stanford. He may have been right, but I'll never know—thanks to him, I didn't even apply.



But in the end, we are responsible for our own insecurities. We choose to play the game and set our own goals and standards for success. We decide whether to honor our own values or those we see on TV. We choose whether to listen to the opinions of others. And when we look outward to measure our progress, we hear the feedback of that critical inner voice.The mental heckler points out the gap between who we are and who we think we should be. For some, this is motivating, but for most of us, it's horribly discouraging. We believe the heckler's criticism and don't attempt to prove it wrong. Related: Explore great opportunities on the Franchise 500But what if it is wrong? What opportunities have we missed out on? How much unnecessary pain have we felt? And how much is our business suffering as a result? Most of the time, the mental heckler misses the mark. Its opinions are completely without merit. Why should it be credible? It's no more educated or experienced than we are, and it has no more information than we do.Silencing Your Inner CriticI wish I knew how to quiet my mental heckler for good. I've spent decades helping people overcome this stuff, but my own inner cynic still occasionally speaks up. Sometimes I'll see someone in my audience with a sour look on their face, and the mental heckler starts chipping away at my confidence. Often, when I'm done, those people are the first ones in line to buy my book. Intellectually, I know I can't accurately read an audience member. But intellect can't compete with feeling. While promoting the movie The Hours in 2003, Oscar-winning actresses Julianne Moore, Nicole Kidman, and Meryl Streep confessed their insecurities to Oprah Winfrey during an interview. All three admitted to trying to back out of parts they'd been offered, and Oprah asked Meryl Streep why. ""Because I say to myself, 'I don't know how to act—and why does anybody want to look at me on-screen anymore?'"" she said. Julianne Moore and Nicole Kidman echoed similar feelings.Related: Here Are 4 Big Franchising Trends You Should Know AboutHere were three of Hollywood's most accomplished actresses, admitting they still worry that each movie will be their last as if the world is going to realize they've been faking this whole time. No number of Academy Awards could compete with their mental hecklers. Maybe their success is a result not just of having talent, but of having the grit to do their work in spite of their insecurity. That's why I respect all franchisees. Lots of people would love to open a new business, but few actually do. It takes guts to defy your self-doubt. That's the true meaning of courage—to feel fear but go for it anyway. That leap of faith is an enormous step toward wealth.The Mental Heckler CaresOne exercise I do with franchisees is a role-playing scenario in which I ask them to play the part of their own mental heckler. I speak directly to it and ask why it so brutally discourages the franchisee. After a little discussion, invariably it comes down to this: The mental heckler cares. It worries about the franchisee and wants to protect them from failure.


Often the mental heckler will admit it's doing more harm than good and agree to disengage. It's just a game, but for the franchisee, it can be an empowering shift in perspective. It's easier to coexist with a concerned friend than an enemy. Think of C-3PO in Star Wars or Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter books. They're not negative—they're cautious. They're the first to suggest retreating. They can be annoying at times, but they mean well. You can decide how you'd like to perceive your heckler. Hate it, hug it—whatever makes you feel powerful. Just don't let it hold you back.

106,How to Stay Calm and Get Clarity During Stressful Times,"Nov 1, 2023",Scott Greenberg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/how-to-stay-calm-and-get-clarity-during-stressful-times/463896,"
Many franchisees evaluate circumstances based on how they feel, looking at just a few data points and interpreting them through an emotional prism. Rarely do these feelings yield accurate information about what's really happening.Most corporate field representatives working directly with franchisees will tell you that much of their job is psychology. Their mandate is to ensure compliance with company standards and help franchisees build sales and profit. But the best among them know there are days when the franchisee is not in a good place to go through the operational checklist. Sometimes they need a different kind of help. However, we can't always rely on our franchise corporate team for mental support. We have to manage our own mind as much as we have to manage our own business.Related: Here Are 4 Big Franchising Trends You Should Know AbouThis mental discipline is essential for good leadership. It's also the key to becoming a wealthy franchisee. You're going to feel your business, but you need to understand that your emotions are often a reflection of your state of mind, not the state of your business. That's why you must be self-aware.



MetacognitionMetacognition is the practice of building awareness of how your mind works. Simply put, it means thinking about how you think. It's not a perspective many franchisees consider. Most are too busy—they just want to work. But being more aware of your thoughts will allow you to take control of them.Wealthy franchisees are human, and they too experience the triggers, interpretations, and emotional responses (see diagram below.) But their self-awareness allows them to disrupt the process before they react. They insert an additional step between step three and step four: reflection. They pause, calm down, and reclaim their objectivity before reacting, which leads to more constructive responses.


When you feel a strong emotion, think of it as an alarm. Stop what you're doing and stop what you're thinking. Take a quick moment to reflect on where your head is and regain control of your thoughts because that space between your emotional response and your reaction is where wealth is built or lost.Cognitive DistortionsMetacognition makes it easier to identify the inaccurate thought patterns that may be clouding your reality. Psychologists call these patterns cognitive distortions. These are the subjective ideas that lead you away from the truth. Cognitive distortions infect your brain as viruses do computers. They stop you from operating correctly. When you unload your mind of this stuff, you start to see things as they really are, allowing you to make better decisions. But you can't manage them if you don't acknowledge them.Deliberate ThinkingThe hardest part of controlling your thoughts is stopping them altogether. Great practitioners of meditation can empty their minds. By concentrating on one focal point, such as a sound, a mantra, or their breathing, they completely clear their heads, allowing them to be fully present in the moment. This is difficult. Most people who meditate spend lots of time having to refocus their wandering mind. Related: Discover 5 Top Retail Franchise Opportunities to Invest InMeditation may sound like New Age nonsense, especially in an article about business. But make no mistake—all franchisees meditate constantly without even realizing it. They just have different focal points. Some focus entirely on improving their business. Others obsess over the competition. Many can't get their mind off the bills. If you have a franchise, I'll guarantee you spend more time thinking about your business than a monk does about his breathing.


The idea is to be deliberate about your concentration to ensure maximum productivity. Learn to control your thoughts, because thoughts lead to feelings, which lead to behaviors, which lead to wealth— or bankruptcy.Clarity vs. PositivityClearing your head doesn't mean being optimistic. A positive attitude is not a business plan—and neither is a bad attitude. Positivity and negativity are just two extremes on the denial spectrum.I'm not about positivity or negativity. I'm about clarity—seeing things as they are. That's the most useful perspective in business. That doesn't mean I don't expect good things to happen—but when I do, I have data to back up my prediction. Related: Explore great opportunities on the Franchise 500Feelings matter in business and in life. Emotion is what distinguishes us from machines. Pathos defines and connects humanity. It's what makes all this business and busyness worthwhile. Later, when we talk about customer service, we'll focus on creating experiences with emotional resonance, something a computer could never do. The cold, logical Mr. Spock was a great science officer, but you wouldn't want him greeting your customers.


Clarity is about taking in information with as few filters as possible. We need to get an objective lay of the land. Only then can we take meaningful action.Leading with CourageCourage doesn't mean you never feel fear. It means you're afraid but do what you have to do anyway. It's a choice, and wealthy franchisees make that choice. In a way, all franchisees do at some point. I can't tell you how many of my friends have expressed an interest in franchising but were too scared to pull the trigger. Opening a business is a risk. If you've decided to buy a franchise, you've already demonstrated more courage than most. That willingness to move through the fear and step toward the risk is the key to greatness.CatastrophizingCatastrophizing is the act of exaggerating adversity. It's when we take our problems and infuse them with our fear, stress, and imagination. We blow them way out of proportion. We create the darkest possible perception of our circumstances, making our problems seem bigger and more meaningful.Typically, catastrophizing happens in two ways. The first is to make a problem seem much worse than it is. The second is to make a dire prediction about where your circumstances will lead. Either way, it's a major distortion of the facts.There's a good reason behind the human mind's tendency toward catastrophizing: It's a survival mechanism. In each hemisphere of our brain is an almond-shaped structure called the amygdala, which is associated with emotion, fear, and self-preservation. It becomes most active when we perceive imminent danger. Think of it as the brain's fire alarm. When triggered, it begins to release a flood of adrenalin, cortisol, and other stress hormones into our body, heightening our alertness, triggering our ""fight or flight response,"" and helping to keep us alive. If you hear a loud bang, your brain doesn't want your first response to be curiosity. It wants you to duck. Safety first, then understanding.But activity in the amygdala also blocks the neural pathway to our prefrontal cortex, which disrupts executive function, decision-making, planning, logic, and other important cognitive functions. In other words, it disables the part of the brain we need to calm down and solve our problems. It's like having a fire block the path to the fire extinguisher.


These days, most of us are rarely in physical danger. Instead, we react to the mental dangers all around us. The threats we imagine are far worse than the real ones. Few children have been attacked by a monster in their closet. It's the monster in their mind that keeps them awake. Unexpected events in our business can activate our amygdala and cause us to feel threatened. These events may include:Falling salesLosing key employeesLegal problemsNegative press/reviewsNew competitionPandemicsLots of franchisees catastrophize. That doesn't make them weak— it makes them human. Anyone can overreact when a high-stakes investment is threatened. But just because it's normal doesn't mean it's OK. Catastrophizing isn't good for business. It leads to impulsive decisions and can make you do what feels best rather than what is best. You can't allow your need to relieve stress to influence your actions. There's a lot you can do to regain your perspective when things get tough. It always starts with reflection and clarity. Disrupt the trigger to trouble pattern, and then take action. In the next article, I will cover a few ideas for how to do that.

107,10 Things You Can Do to De-Stress and Refocus,"Nov 1, 2023",Scott Greenberg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/10-things-you-can-do-to-de-stress-and-refocus/463901,"
In life and in business, it is crucial to maintain your perspective when things get stressful. (And that will happen a lot when you are running a franchise.) You need to have a clear picture of the problem before taking action. Otherwise, you run the risk of wasting time and energy — or making the problem even worse.Here are a few ideas for how to clear your head, gain clarity and keep your perspective.1. Manage Stress Before ProblemsYour inclination may be to act immediately to relieve your stress, but knee-jerk reactions lead to bad decisions. Your choices should be driven by the desire to grow your business, not your need to feel better. Stress will cloud your judgment and distort your understanding of what's really happening. No matter how bad things seem, always start with your head and work your way outward toward your problems. This isn't just about emotions—it's also about brain function. You want to calm your amygdala (the part of your brain associated with emotion, fear, and self-preservation) and engage your prefrontal cortex as quickly as you can. A calm brain is an efficient brain. Related: Explore great opportunities on the Franchise 5002. Clear Your HeadIt's hard to get perspective on all those irrational thoughts swimming around your noggin. Anything you can do to get them out of your head will make things easier to manage. One way is to write down your worries. Pen and paper are powerful tools for purging your mind. You could do it journal-style, recording every detail about your situation and your feelings. (Make sure to include the latter.) Related: Discover 5 Top Retail Franchise Opportunities to Invest InOr, if you're like me, make lists. Whenever I feel like everything is going wrong, I list ""everything"" on paper. Usually, it's just a few issues coalescing into a perfect storm. The act of writing can be cathartic enough to re-center you. It's also easier to find solutions on paper. I like to list my concerns in a column. Next to each one, I'll add a few more columns to make notes that help me regain my perspective. My page might look something like the figure below. You'll notice I left some boxes blank. Sometimes the answers come and sometimes they don't. But my immediate priority isn't finding solutions—it's clearing my head. Organizing my thoughts on paper helps me do that.You can also try talking through your thoughts with someone else. That might mean getting professional help or just calling a friend, a franchise colleague, or your field support representative. Discussing your feelings out loud will help you hear when they are irrational and allow others to give you additional information and/or a fresh perspective. Remember, if you're catastrophizing, you're probably experiencing cognitive distortion, and it might be better to trust an outside perspective rather than your own.3. Avoid HyperboleThis is easier when you write down your thoughts. Notice where you use exaggerated language. Look for words such as ""everyone"" vs. ""some people"" and ""always"" or ""never"" vs. ""sometimes."" If you're speaking in absolutes or drawing big conclusions, chances are your thoughts are distorted.4. Notice Feelings But Focus on FactsFacts provide better insight into your circumstances than emotions. Get the data and study the measurables. Do you think your business is failing? Prove it. The data will back up your conclusion if it's true. Your franchisor knows what metrics to look at and can provide context based on their global perspective. Have them run reports and help you interpret the data. If things are better than you think, they can help you see this. If not, they can intervene and help you turn things around.



Related: Here Are 4 Big Franchising Trends You Should Know Abou5. Practice MeditationCountless CEOs and heads of industry meditate as part of their daily routine. Research indicates it's not just good for their health, but also good for business. It enhances creativity, boosts emotional intelligence, helps us focus, and strengthens relationships. We know that business problems cause cognitive distortion. Improving your ability to center yourself will help you counteract that. Having said that, I'm not good at meditation. It works for some people, but I find myself spending too much time noticing that I'm not concentrating. If you find that it doesn't work for you either, there are other relaxation methods you can try.6. Take a WalkI can't focus well on my breathing when I try to meditate, but I can concentrate on the flowers, the trees, the buildings, and the life going on all around me when I take a walk. Walking among them charges my brain and distracts me from my fears. I can't tell you how much material for speeches I've written while taking the dog around the block. Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche once wrote, ""Only thoughts that come by walking have any value."" He was describing what Stanford University researchers Marily Oppezzo and Daniel L. Schwartz would conclude 125 years later in their 2014 paper ""Give Your Ideas Some Legs: The Positive Effect of Walking on Creative Thinking."" They wrote that the physical act of walking actually increases creativity, both during the stroll and even for some time afterward.The perspective you need might be found outside. To get out of your head, try getting out of your business.6. WaitSometimes your attempts at calming down just don't work. In that case, do nothing and let time work its magic. Being patient is different from being passive. While you're waiting to calm down, more information and solutions may present themselves. You want to act, not react.7. Focus on the Here and NowPart of catastrophizing is making dark predictions about the future. While you need to prepare for tomorrow, you can't let it distract from today. Today is tangible. It's right here, and it's real. You can handle that, but you don't know what will happen tomorrow. And there are a lot of tomorrows—trying to think about all of them is overwhelming. The best way to prepare for the future is to make the most of today and give it all you've got. Solve the problems in front of you. Serve your customers, inspire your employees, and pay any bills that are due. Try to learn something that you can bring to your work the following day. You can't predict what the future will look like, but it's safe to assume it will be different. New things will happen. Many of them will be good. Just get through today. Then do it again tomorrow.


8. Anticipate AdversityThis doesn't mean you should expect the worst. But the path to wealth is riddled with potholes, and you're going to face some unexpected challenges. That's part of what you signed up for. Knowing this in advance will make them less shocking when you encounter them.9. Prepare for AdversityDon't make predictions, but do make plans. Real catastrophes are easier to deal with when you have made contingency plans. Don't wait until your house is on fire to figure out your safety plan: What will you take with you, and how will you get out? Your business should also have a ""fire plan."" What if business drops off or your company fails to grow? What if another pandemic shuts you down or quarantines your customers? What will you need to survive, and how will you adjust? How much capital can you save up to get you through the tough times? Figure all this out before you're in the middle of a crisis. Not only will this give you a smart operational and financial backup plan, but it'll also protect you emotionally.10. Help Others Who Are CatastrophizingJust as you must learn to regulate your emotional reactions in business, you need to teach your team to navigate through their own stress. I used to get phone calls all the time from panicked employees at my Edible Arrangements franchise, reporting on a crisis: The delivery van broke down. The lights went out. A customer was upset. I appreciated their concern, but I wanted them to handle the problem. That was their job. I had a rule for my manager, Jennifer, that I didn't tell her about for many years. When she'd call, I wouldn't answer my phone. Instead, I'd listen to the message she left. If it was a small issue that could wait, I'd get back to her when it was convenient. If it was a bigger problem, I still waited 90 minutes to call her back. Nine times out of ten, that was enough time for her to calm down and solve the problem herself.I wasn't shirking my responsibilities—I was trying to foster her independence. It's easy to ask for help when it's readily available, but I wanted my team to help themselves as much as possible. Allowing them to figure it out on their own was better than simply telling them what to do.The best way to keep your team calm and functional when there's a problem is to appear calm yourself. The expression isn't ""Never sweat."" It's ""Never let 'em see you sweat."" Your employees take their cues from you. If you remain composed and confident, it will give them a sense of stability. Never tell anyone to ""calm down"" or ""take a deep breath."" As good as this advice is, saying it when someone's upset will only anger them. Instead, model calm behavior and validate their feelings. If appropriate, make a joke. Confidently express your certainty that the situation is manageable—even if you're not actually feeling it in that moment.Related: I'm a Franchise Consultant — These Are The 5 Franchise Warning Signs To Look Out For


Calm minds have clear perspectives. You'll build wealth more easily when your decisions are based on data. Catch yourself when you feel yourself giving into your emotions. Reject any dark predictions inspired by fear or unreasonable expectations based purely on excitement. You're running your business to shape your future. That will work best when you have an objective handle on what's really happening right now.

108,These Are the Real Risks of Owning a Business,"Nov 1, 2023",Scott Greenberg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/these-are-the-real-risks-of-owning-a-business/463600,"
I am a speaker who helps franchisees think, lead and serve at a higher level. Part of my due diligence before giving talks at franchises is to survey the brand's franchisees. I collect their responses anonymously so they can answer freely. Here are some actual comments from a variety of brands that reflect the answers I typically get to this question: ""What has been your emotional experience of running this franchise?""""The feeling is one that the whole enterprise is held together by 'string' and it requires an enormous effort by the user to hold together. Mentally, it is tiring.""""Excited, anxious, nervous, and wondering if I will bankrupt my family before the business turns the corner of profitability.""""Where do I begin? Way too much mental stress between managing staff and financial issues. Dealing with people, both members and employees, is a HUGE drain physically and emotionally. We expected if we worked hard, success was imminent. We are working our heads off and really barely making it.""""I was told this business would cost me about $500,000 to get to breakeven. It was nearly three times that amount. For quite some time, the worry about making the next payroll was oppressive.""""Given our financial situation going into it, it has been much more challenging and stressful than I anticipated. The work combined with the financial stress has been very difficult to deal with at times.""I also get responses from people who express excitement and gratitude. But everyone is feeling something. Deeply. If there's anything I've learned from working with franchisees and owning one myself, it's that running a franchise is an emotional experience. And these emotions directly impact the way business is handled. Related: Explore great opportunities on the Franchise 500



I was an Edible Arrangements franchisee for ten years. When Edible Arrangements International started talking about running its first national television campaign, one of my fellow franchisees objected. That made no sense to me. We were still a new company, and most people had never even seen a floral arrangement made with fruit. We desperately needed more brand awareness, so I asked him why he was against it.""There's already too many Edible Arrangements franchises in Southern California,"" he responded. ""If we go on TV, it'll make even more people want to open franchises out here, and there'll be more competition.""His idea for marketing our brand was to keep it a secret. This was a highly intelligent guy with a graduate degree who owned multiple locations. His perspective wasn't based on data. It was based on fear.


I tried for several years to start a local marketing cooperative among franchisees in Southern California. We were the densest territory in the company, so logic dictated that we pool our marketing dollars. The company already had some functioning marketing co-ops, and they were working well. But too many people were scared to commit the money. One highly educated but struggling franchisee told me he couldn't afford to advertise. He didn't see marketing as an investment, just an expense. It didn't matter that he was smart. He was too afraid.The Real Risks of Owning a BusinessStatistics about small-business failure abound. Some sources will tell you that half of all businesses fail in the first year, while others say the failure rate is closer to 90 percent. Some stats cite the rate of SBA loan defaults: From 2006 to 2015, about 17 percent of SBA-backed loans defaulted. It's really hard to nail down the actual batting average of rookie small businesses, but all you really have to do is drive down the street and watch the changing storefronts to draw the conclusion that starting a new business is tough. That makes it an intensely emotional experience. Related: Discover 5 Top Retail Franchise Opportunities to Invest InA franchise is a minefield of psychological dangers. It's so tempting to take your enterprise personally and associate your business performance with your self-worth. In one 2015 joint study by researchers at University of California, San Francisco, University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford University, 72 percent of entrepreneurs surveyed reported experiencing mental health concerns. In another 2019 study by the Canadian Mental Health Association, 62 percent of entrepreneurs reported feeling depressed at least once a week. It's not clear if the stress of owning a business causes depression, or if entrepreneurship attracts those who are predisposed to depression.I experienced a wide range of emotions as a franchisee. On the high end was exhilaration, and on the low end was total despair. There were stressful times I felt completely trapped, hating the business but unable to escape it. I remember days when my expenses were rising so quickly that it seemed like the walls were crashing in around me.


It would be helpful if more franchisees acknowledged these feelings. But emotion has always been taboo in business. Vulnerability is seen as a sign of weakness. There's no crying in baseball, and there's none in business, either. If anything, we practice the opposite, what psychologists call impression management. This is the process by which a person tries to influence other people's perceptions of their image. Think of someone wearing expensive clothes or driving a flashy car to project an air of success. Impression management is everything we do to make others think we're stronger, saner, and less human than we are.There's no doubt people are attracted to perceived success. But the price we pay for that external image is internal neglect, and eventually, it catches up to us.Wealthy franchisees aren't immune to the emotional challenges of running a business—they've just learned to navigate through them. That's their advantage. Fortunately, franchises are a little less mysterious than other new businesses. If a company is franchising, chances are they've had some success and know how to replicate it. They've done the market research and product development and negotiated with vendors. They've tried and erred and learned.Related: Here Are 4 Big Franchising Trends You Should Know AbouA franchised business comes with a lot of data, and that makes it a safer bet. But what the franchisor can't tell you is how you will run the business, just as an auto dealership doesn't know how you will drive and maintain their car. You're the X-factor. You are the most important variable that distinguishes your franchise location from all the others. So maybe you should take your business performance personally. Maybe you're the source of your problems—or your prosperity. Whatever is happening in your business is on you. Don't let the statistics about failing businesses scare you. Those businesses weren't run by you. If you invest in a proven concept and operate it intelligently, there's every reason to believe you're going to thrive. But you're going to have to manage your head as well as you manage your operation.

This article originally appeared on Business Insider.Richard Miralles, born in 1924, is one of the dwindling living members of ""The Greatest Generation"" — the demographic cohort that experienced World I, the Great Depression, and World War II.The 99-year-old told Insider that he felt ""lucky and blessed to be as old as I am"" when so many of his peers have died. His wife, Joy, is 91 and eight years his junior.



The couple is defying statistics since, in general, women live much longer than men. The life expectancy for women in the US is 79 years old, while it is 73 for men, according to the CDC.The Population Reference Bureau reported in 2001 that scientists attribute the life-expectancy age gap to biological differences. Estrogen appears to combat harmful conditions such as high cholesterol, and scientists believe women have stronger immune systems than men.


Meanwhile, a study featured in Neuroscience News this year found that men are more likely to take risks than women. For example, statistics show that men are far more likely to die in car accidents.Mirelles celebrated his 99th birthday earlier this year - Courtesy of Kathy Olsen via Business InsiderMiralles, who was born in 1924, lived through the Great Depression, served as a gunner aboard planes during World War II, and battled forest fires during his 30-year career as a forester.


He told Insider that these experiences gave him the determination to live as long as possible.The great-grandfather of four shared some insights into his longevity.His childhood was happyMiralles credits much of his positivity to being raised in a loving family.He was fostered as a baby along with his two siblings — one of whom turned 100 last year. ""It was during the Great Depression, and we didn't have much money,"" he said, adding that it didn't really matter because his childhood was mostly about fun.


His daughter, Kathy Olsen, said she reveled in his stories about panning for gold in the stream behind his house.""The kids used to take the flakes of gold to a store where they exchanged them for things like movie tickets and popcorn for 25 cents,"" Olsen said.""We knew it was a rip-off, but we didn't care,"" Miralles, who prides himself on being a ""laid-back"" character, said.He found purpose when he joined the navyMiralles was still in high school when American ships were bombed in Pearl Harbor in December 1941. The surprise attack spurred him to enlist in the Navy. He lied about his age, telling recruiters that he was 18, not 17.


He said he wanted to serve the country, but he was also in search of ""excitement."" It took him away from his one-room schoolhouse in rural California.Nevertheless, he said that the armed forces made him more disciplined — a quality he maintained his whole life. Olsen said it helped her father recognize that the decisions he made would have lasting consequences for his family and his future.""He always had a plan,"" Olsen said.World War II made him a realistThe horrors of war made him realize there were many things in life he couldn't control, Miralles said.He recalled returning from one mission when he was the gunner in a dive bomber.""Another plane landed,"" he said. ""The gunner was sloped forward. We checked on him, and he was dead. One bullet had gone right up through his seat and killed him. """"I counted at least 80 bullet holes on our aircraft, and his only had one,"" he said. ""It taught me a lot.""Mirelles worked as a forester after World War II. - Courtesy of Kathy Olsen via Business InsiderThe former forester — who tackled forest fires during his 30-year career — said he became a realist that day.""I thought, 'Well, if I'm going to get it, I'm going to get it,'"" he told Insider. ""That was all there was to it. I thought there was no point in worrying.""Miralles, who wrote the self-published book ""War and Fire,"" said he lived in the moment and dealt with things as they came.


He seized the day and retired earlyMiralles, who went to college after the end of the war, joined his friend on an epic motorbike trip across Europe after he graduated.""We were going to buy two, but we couldn't afford it,"" he said, referring to the vehicle. ""I told him that I'd been riding a motorbike my whole life, which wasn't true. So I rode on the front, and he rode on the back.""He said they spent 5 ½ months on the road.""We drove through 15 countries and spent 5 ½ months in places like Norway and Switzerland,"" he said.""He has always been a 'live-for-the-day' person,"" Olsen added.Miralles was ""lucky enough"" to be able to retire at the age of 56.That left him free to travel across the US and to Mexico in an RV for months at a time with his wife.The 71-year-old said her parents are active residents of their retirement home, The Village at Heritage Park in Sacramento, California.


He followed his doctor's adviceMiralles was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in his late 50s. It was a shock, his daughter said, especially since he played golf and watched what he ate.Mirelles and wife, Joy, who is aged 91. - Courtesy of Kathy Olsen via Business InsiderFast food had never been on the menu, she said, and meals were sit-down affairs.""It would be a protein, a starch, and a vegetable or salad,"" Olsen said.Miralles took his doctor's advice seriously after his health scare and avoided snacking and high-sugar foods. ""He showed a lot of willpower — and still does,"" Olsen said.
