      Key Takeaways    



        Despite a US housing shortage, Florida and Texas have too much supply, Redfin said.
      


        The states accelerated construction to take advantage of pandemic-era demand.
      


        But many are now priced out, while Florida's rising insurance costs are pushing down demand.

A housing development in Orlando, Florida.


 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. A lack of U.S. housing has fenced off most would-be buyers, but two states are dealing with the opposite problem — an overflow of homes.According to Redfin, Florida and Texas have properties stagnating on the market, as demand is shifting away from these areas.Cape Coral and North Port, Florida saw the country's biggest surge in homes for sale, with volumes up around 50% from a year ago in March. The number of homes also jumped 25% in McAllen, Texas, Redfin reported on Thursday.



Both states have been building more homes than in any other part of the U.S., in a race to make room for pandemic-era newcomers.""Two years ago, the North Port metro was one of the most competitive housing markets in the country because it was affordable for remote workers and there was a shortage of homes for sale, but none of those things are true today,"" local Redfin sales manager Eric Auciello said in the report.Instead, buyers are now finding themselves priced out, and price growth has slid as a result. Of the country's top 10 metros where sellers were most likely to slash listed prices, seven are located in these two states.""Out-of-town homebuyers no longer see Florida as a place to get amazing value. Now they're moving to North Carolina or Tennessee to get a good deal. Many local blue-collar workers have been priced out of homeownership, too,"" Auciello noted.


Adding to Florida's headwinds is a rising insurance crisis, with close to three-quarters of the homeowners noting rising insurance costs or changing coverage.This has become a growing concern for the national housing market, as worsening climate risks amplify costs to insurance providers. A September study from First Street calculated that, amid hiking premiums and the loss of coverage in certain areas, home values could significantly erode.""We're at an inflection point. A hefty insurance bill isn't always a big deal for a luxury buyer, but it can be a really big issue for someone buying a waterfront home on a smaller budget,"" Auciello said.Both markets are also exposed to the same strains as the wider housing environment. High mortgages, now at around 7%, are keeping many homeowners from upgrading to a better home.


Nationally, the stubborn mortgage highs have caused new listings to fall 6% month-over-month in March, marking the biggest drop since January 2022, Redfin said.Meanwhile, a shortage of homes has pushed the median US sale price 5% year-on-year, to $420,357. That's only 3% off the record-high price of $432,496.

WWE wrestler and Prime Hydration co-founder Logan Paul has found himself in the middle of two class-action lawsuits that allege (separately) that Prime Hydration energy drinks contain more caffeine than advertised and that the beverages contain PFAS aka ""forever chemicals.""This week, Paul responded to the accusations on TikTok saying the lawsuits are based on ""zero evidence.""Why is Prime being sued?In an April 8 lawsuit filed in New York, Paul and Prime Hydration LLC co-founder KSI were accused of ""deceptive, and misleading practices"" after testing commissioned by the plaintiff's attorneys found that the 12-ounce cans of energy drinks contain between 215-225 milligrams of caffeine, instead of the 200 milligrams advertised.



The lawsuit states that the plaintiff purchased several of the blue raspberry-flavored Prime drinks in August 2022 and that she never would have done so had she known the true caffeine content. She's seeking $5 million from Prime.In a separate lawsuit filed in August 2023 in California, Prime is accused of containing PFAS, which are synthetic chemicals used in cleaning products, toiletries, and stain-resistant sprays that are not FDA-approved for consumption.


Per the lawsuit, PFAS was found through third-party testing that the grape flavor of Prime contains these chemicals. The plaintiff is seeking $5 million.How did Paul and Prime respond?In a TikTok video posted to Paul's account late Wednesday, which has since garnered over 15.3 million views, the influencer slammed the allegations and denied that any Prime products contain any non-FDA approved chemicals or substances.Paul clarified in the clip that the PFAS being referred to in the lawsuit are regarding the bottle that Prime is packaged in, not the actual liquid itself.

""We use the top bottle manufacturers in the United States. All your favorite beverage brands... they use these companies. If the product is served in plastic, they make a bottle for them.""He then doubled down and called the lawsuit ""absolute bull"" and claimed that the third-party testing was invalid.


""They're claiming that Prime has 0.06 (parts per trillion),"" Paul said regarding the testing. ""But that's interesting because the EPA says anything under 1.1 (parts per trillion) can not be deemed as reasonably accurate. They don't have the right tools or resources to even prove what they're claiming.""Prime Hydration LLC did not immediately respond to Entrepreneur's request for comment on either lawsuit.Prime's products are manufactured and distributed by Congo Brands, which is based in Louisville, Kentucky.

2,ByteDance Would Rather Shut Down TikTok in the U.S. than Sell It: Report,"Apr 26, 2024",Sherin Shibu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/bytedance-would-rather-shutter-tiktok-in-the-us-than-sell-it/473305,"
Just after a bill that could potentially ban TikTok in the U.S. became law, the platform's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, publicly stated that it has no plans to sell.The law, which President Biden signed on Wednesday, gives ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok to an American buyer, with a possible three-month extension in the case of a pending sale. If ByteDance does not comply, TikTok could be removed from app stores by January 19, 2025.ByteDance made it clear on Thursday that if legal routes to fight the new legislation fail, it would rather shut down TikTok completely in the U.S. and remove the social media platform from app stores than sell it.



""Foreign media reports that ByteDance is exploring the sale of TikTok are untrue,"" ByteDance posted in a statement to Toutiao, a news aggregation app it owns. The post refutes a report by The Information that said the company was exploring options to sell, and ByteDance even attached screenshots of The Information's article in its rebuttal.Shou Zi Chew, CEO of TikTok.

ByteDance does not publicly reveal details of its overall financial performance, nor disclose how units within it like TikTok are doing financially, but sources close to the company told Reuters that ByteDance's annual revenue rose from $80 billion in 2022 to $120 billion last year.Though the U.S. contributed to a quarter of TikTok's overall revenue in 2023, TikTokers in the States only made up 5% of ByteDance's daily active users worldwide, per the same sources.Those insiders claim that shutting down TikTok in the U.S. wouldn't noticeably impact ByteDance's business.Related: Kevin O'Leary Wants to Buy TikTok — But Says It's Worth Much Less Than Last Year's ValuationThe TikTok ban bill passed due to national security concerns, which TikTok has long denied.TikTok's execs are turning first to the U.S. legal system to circumvent a possible ban, calling the law ""unconstitutional.""@tiktokResponse to TikTok Ban Bill♬ original sound - TikTok""The facts and the Constitution are on our side and we expect to prevail again,"" TikTok CEO Shou Chew stated Thursday in a TikTok.""Our community is also filled with seven million business owners who have built their livelihoods on TikTok,"" he added.

Sage Vegan Bistro in Los Angeles (not pictured) is rebranding to include non-vegan food on its menu.


 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. The chef of a Los Angeles vegan restaurant has announced that her restaurant is rebranding and transitioning to serving meat, dairy, and eggs.The chef, Mollie Engelhart, said that she thought a vegan diet was best when she started Sage Vegan Bistro but that she'd now changed her mind.Renamed the Sage Regenerative Kitchen & Brewery, the restaurant is instead set to focus on supporting regenerative farming practices, as Engelhart said in an Instagram video.



""That means that we will be shifting from an all-plant-based menu to a high-quality protein from only the highest-quality, most-integrity regenerative farms,"" she said.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Sage Regenerative Kitchen & Brewery (@thekindsage)The restaurant, which opened in Echo Park in 2011 before launching branches in Culver City and Pasadena, has cultivated a legion of plant-loving customers.But the Los Angeles Times reported that the revamped menu would soon feature ingredients such as beef, bison, fried eggs, and other non-vegan products, starting at the end of next month.


""To some, this may seem shocking or upsetting, but if you look at the last seven years of my life, and as I moved into regenerative farming to serve the highest-quality food to my customers, I started to learn so much about soil and nature,"" Engelhart said in the Instagram post.She told the LA Times, ""I think that the next step forward is regenerative agriculture, and for that to move forward, it needs to be in the zeitgeist, it needs to be in our everyday conversations.""""This is my way to contribute to that, to give people options,"" she added.Regenerative farming aims to address the climate crisis by restoring degraded soils and sequestering carbon, though opinions on its environmental impact vary.


A 2022 academic review by William H. Schlesinger, a former president of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, found that practices associated with regenerative farming weren't likely to lead to a ""large net sequestration of organic carbon in soils.""Schlesinger also noted that some practices even resulted in their own carbon-dioxide emissions to the atmosphere.Engelhart told the LA Times that she was being ""vulnerable"" in announcing the move and that she had braced herself for the ""vitriol"" to come.That pushback came quickly.


PETA, the animal-rights charity, accused the restaurant in an Instagram post of ""serving greenwashed and humane-washed meat, dairy, and eggs"" and described the shift as a betrayal to animals.""On Earth Day, no less!"" the post added.Jayde Nicole, a vegan restaurateur, described the shift as ""horrifying"" in a comment on Instagram, while Hannah Weseloh, a vegan influencer, likened the announcement to ""mourning a death.""Engelhart defended her choice and said she timed the announcement for Earth Day because ""we're doing this shift for humanity and the earth.""


She also told the LA Times that financial considerations influenced her decision, with the newspaper reporting that the restaurants had not been profitable since 2020.""My restaurants have been really struggling, like so many restaurants post-pandemic,"" Engelhart said.The LA Times reported that several formerly all-vegan restaurants in LA had shifted to incorporating meat in recent years, citing financial factors, with many others closing their doors entirely.Sage Regenerative Kitchen & Brewery didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

4,"'Americans Just Work Harder' Than Europeans, Says the CEO of Norges Bank, the World's Largest Wealth Fund","Apr 26, 2024",Sherin Shibu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/norges-bank-ceo-nicolai-tangen-americans-just-work-harder/473262,"
The world's largest wealth fund has more than half of its equities invested in the U.S. and intends to stay invested.The reason? ""Americans just work harder,"" said Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norway's $1.6 trillion oil fund Norges Bank.Tangen told The Financial Times on Wednesday that the fund is heavily invested in American businesses because there's a different business mindset and work ethic in the U.S.



""You go bust in America, you get another chance,"" Tangen told the FT. ""In Europe, you're dead.""Nicolai Tangen, chief executive officer of Norges Bank. Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images""I should be careful about talking about work-life balance, but the Americans just work harder,"" he said. Tangen also noted that Norges Bank would ""stay invested"" in American companies for the long term.Related: Samsung Makes 6-Day Workweeks Mandatory for Executives, Company Enters 'Emergency Mode'U.S. workers do clock in longer hours than employees in Norway, where Norges Bank is based. According to the latest data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the average number of hours worked annually in the U.S. was 1,811 in 2022, nearly 400 hours more than Norway's 1,425 average hours worked over the same period.


U.S. employees also outworked employees from the U.K., France, Germany, Ireland, and many other countries, veering higher than the overall average.But working longer hours might not be something to boast about. A 2021 study from the World Health Organization and the International Labor Organization showed that working long hours could impact long-term health — and pose more of a danger than occupational hazards.The study found that working more than 55 hours per week led to a 35% higher risk of stroke and a 17% higher risk of heart disease.Related: Elon Musk Slams Twitter Employees With Ultimatum: Prepare to Work 'Extremely Hardcore' or Leave by Thursday


Moreover, working extra hours may not lead to increased output: A University of California-Berkeley study conducted over five years found that job performance tends to plateau after reaching a 50-hour workweek threshold.""Think about the profound implication of these findings: the whole entire premise of the world's work ethic—that harder work equates to better results—is basically wrong,"" the study's author wrote.Tangen also noted in the FT interview that American companies are creating and growing technology quicker than their European counterparts, a trend he called ""worrisome.""Heightened innovation could be a byproduct of longer hours or other factors, like U.S. culture, its population, and the systems it has in place to support innovation.

Southwest Airlines is well known for its chaotic boarding process, thanks to the company's policy of not having passenger seat assignments — but that could soon change.On Thursday, the airline's CEO, Bob Jordan, told CNBC about potential changes coming to the airline after a rough Q1 2024 earnings report that has the airline slashing growth plans after posting a loss of $231 million.""We're looking into new initiatives, things like the way we seat and board our aircraft,"" Jordan told the outlet.

Is a human speaking behind the camera or an AI clone? A startling innovation from a unicorn startup backed by Nvidia makes it almost impossible to tell the difference.AI startup Synthesia, which achieved unicorn, billion-dollar-valuation status last year, released new technology on Thursday called Expressive Avatars; the world's first AI digital clones capable of producing human facial expressions and the right tone of voice from written prompts.The technology starts with an AI avatar, which can be customized to reflect real faces.Photo Credit: SynthesiaThe AI makes a digital copy of a person based on footage recorded through their webcam or at a certified studio. It can also clone the person's voice to infuse into their digital likeness.



Those wary about creating an AI avatar that takes on their face and voice can opt instead for one of the more than 160 preloaded AI avatars that Synthesia has in its database.Related: 'This Is a Serious Problem': Mr. Beast Slams AI DeepfakesOnce a user creates or selects an AI avatar, they just have to do one more thing: Write what they want their digital selves to say.In a demo seen by CNBC, a user wrote ""I am happy. I am sad. I am frustrated."" and had the AI-generated digital clone read the text. The avatar conveyed facial expressions and tone associated with happiness when speaking the text prompt ""I am happy"" and changed its inflection appropriately when saying ""I am frustrated."" The tone matched the words.


With an AI clone and a written prompt, a free user can generate 36 minutes of personalized videos in more than 120 languages every year. Paid plans go up to $67 per month for up to 360 minutes of video per year or unlimited minutes of video for businesses that opt for an enterprise plan.Synthesia is a startup that major companies are using behind the scenes. Zoom, Xerox, Microsoft, and Reuters are all internally using Synthesia's programs. Synthesia CEO Victor Riparbelli told the MIT Technology Review that 56% of the Fortune 100 were using the technology.Synthesia markets the technology as a way to create expressive digital avatars for corporate training and presentations. For example, Zoom designers created sales training videos in Synthesia in 90% less time than it took human beings to create the videos.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors that it will take time for its AI bet to pay off.


 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Despite posting record revenue for the January-March quarter, Meta's stock is being bogged down on Wednesday by the company's increasing investments in AI.Meta reported a 27% year-over-year increase with $36.46 billion in sales for Q1, beating analysts' forecasts.Yet, shares for Meta tumbled about 16% after trading hours on Wednesday following the company's first-quarter results.



Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, forecasted that its revenue for the second quarter will fall in the range of $36.5 billion to $39 billion. Analysts estimated the company would see revenue closer to $38.24 billion.A second aspect of Meta's report that's clouding the first-quarter performance results is the company's massive investments in AI, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg said will be necessary before the company can expect to see major returns.Meta said that it expects capital expenditures for 2024 to fall in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, which is higher than the $30 billion to $37 billion expectation, as it continues to invest in infrastructure for artificial intelligence.Zuckerberg told shareholders during the Wednesday earnings call that Meta's stock volatility is par for the course for any new project or feature the company was working on that wasn't immediately generating revenue. Meta's investment in AI is no different, Zuckerberg said, but the CEO cautioned that the returns for artificial intelligence will take some time.


""Historically, investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us. And the initial signs are quite positive here too,"" he said. ""But building the leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps and this is likely going to take several years on the upside once our new AI services reach scale.""In the lead up to the first-quarter results, Meta launched its latest version of its chatbot, Llama 3, which will power the company's new AI assistant, Meta AI.Zuckerberg said that the AI assistant will be integrated into many of Meta's products, including Instagram and Facebook.Meta said that Llama 3 is the ""most capable"" open source model out there, but as Business Insider's Hasan Chowdhury reported, the tool has yet to beat ChatGPT 4, OpenAI's language model that was released last year.

Out of the mist, a four-legged robot comes crawling — and it's got a flamethrower strapped to its back.That isn't the premise of a dystopian novel, but rather a new product released this week by Ohio-based company Throwflame.Thermonator, advertised by the company as the ""first-ever flamethrowing quadruped robot dog,"" blasts fire on demand in a 30-foot range. With WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity, the robot can remotely project flames wherever its owner tells it to, with the user's smartphone acting like a remote control. It has an hour of battery life.



Thermonator uses lidar, or laser pulses, to map its surroundings and navigate around obstacles.Related: Apple Is Reportedly Eyeing the Home Robot Space After Scrapping Its 10-Year Electric Car ProjectBut why would anyone need a flamethrowing robot dog? Throwflame says that Thermonator can remove ice and snow, control and prevent wildfires, and help agricultural management efforts.While a fire-blasting robot helping mitigate wildfires may seem counterintuitive at first, the National Park Service describes a method of wildfire management called prescribed burns, or smaller fires planned in advance to reduce the impact of larger ones, that Thermonator could help with — in theory. Throwflame has not yet disclosed how this robot has been used, or if it will be used, by public agencies.Throwflame also listed ""entertainment"" as a possible use in the robot's product description.The bar to purchasing the robot is financially high but legally low: The robot costs $9,420 but is legal to own in 48 U.S. states, according to Ars Technica.Boston Dynamics' robot dog Spot, which got a generative AI update in October but has been in the public eye for close to a decade, seems to be the precursor to Thermonator in form. But while Spot can chat with people and take them on office tours, Thermonator's purpose seems to be centered on setting things on fire.Though flamethrowers are only outright banned in one U.S. state (Maryland) using a flamethrower for fun, or ordering one at all, could have legal and safety repercussions.


Related: Jeff Bezos, Microsoft, and Nvidia All Decided To Invest in a $2.6 Billion Humanoid Robot StartupThrowflame first advertised Thermonator last year, but Elon Musk's The Boring Company marketed flamethrowers even earlier, selling 20,000 flamethrowers in 2018 for $500 apiece.Buyers felt the legal heat: More than 1,000 purchasers had their devices confiscated and had to pay fines, while others faced more severe legal consequences.There's no news yet if Thermonator purchasers will face state-specific fines or other legal penalties for using the robot.There weren't any security checks in place to safeguard purchases of the robot at the time of writing.

      Key Takeaways    



        Walter Biscardi runs his travel business remotely from cruise ships for three months each year.
      


        He said WiFi reliability has improved, but video calls and finding power outlets can be challenging.
      


        Biscardi recommends Virgin Voyages for remote workers because of the spaces to work and the WiFi.

Walter Biscardi on the Oceania Sirena in December 2023.


 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Walter Biscardi, a 59-year-old travel agent based in Orlando. The following has been edited for length and clarity.



I used to work in film, television, documentary, and marketing, and I ran two creative agencies in Atlanta for 25 years.A few years ago, my wife and I turned my second passion, travel, into ""Where's Walter Travel."" We specialize in travel planning services for cruises, group vacations, theme park tours, and company retreats.


We live in an Orlando rental, but I run the travel-planning business from a cruise ship for three months out of the year.We started taking advantage of our remote working situation after the pandemicIn a few short years of working on cruise ships, I've noticed that more and more people are starting to do the same thing.We predominantly cruise the Caribbean. Last year, our three months were spread over six different trips on the Royal Caribbean, Oceania, Virgin Voyages, and Carnival cruise lines. If it were up to me, I'd be at sea for six months a year, but my wife prefers three.This year, we'll be back on Virgin Voyages in June and on the Sun Princess in October. We're planning a few more, too.


WiFi speed and reliability onboard ships have been game-changersWorking remotely on the Sky Princess. Walter Biscardi via BII don't always look for speed but rather consistency and reliability.Even though the WiFi is reliable on most ships, it's still not perfect, and you need to manage your expectations. The WiFi on ships is satellite-based, so the signal will be slower if there's a lot of cloud cover. Rain may also temporarily cut it out completely.


The WiFi signal in rooms can be weak. When I get on board, I walk around public places, look at the ceiling, and find the repeaters, which amplify the router's signal. I park myself under a repeater to work, so at least I know I'm getting the fastest signal.Video calls can be dicey, but voice calls over WiFi work wellMost of my work is using emails, social media apps, and a web browser, so I don't tend to have problems. The upload speed is the most difficult thing about working on a cruise ship.Working from a cruise ship might not be for you if you're required to upload a video to YouTube or be on video for 100% of your Zoom calls. Zoom with video turned off works well. I post TikToks all day, but uploading to YouTube will fail almost every time.Turn off your cell service on the ship, even if you have unlimited roaming overseas. Phones use satellite maritime cellular, and it's ridiculously expensive. I've heard of people who have come home with $1,000 cellular bills because they didn't turn off their roaming.


I can typically make most of my calls over WiFi, but you won't be able to on some ships. Texting from ship to land usually works well if you're using the same type of phone as the person you're messaging, but when you're texting cross-platform, sometimes it doesn't work.Finding power outlets can be challengingOutlets on the Scarlet Lady. Walter Biscardi via BITypically, if you need to put in a full day of work connected to power, you need to stay in your room. One tip to finding power when you're looking around public areas is to see where they plug in the vacuum cleaners.


I strongly recommend bringing a powerboard with multiple USB sockets. I have one with 10 USB connections, so I can charge my phone, GoPro, and other devices simultaneously.Virgin Voyages ships are the most friendly for remote workersThe galley on a Virgin Voyages ship is set up like a coffee shop, with easily accessible power and USB sockets at the table. There are dozens of outlets, as they're inviting people to bring their laptops and work from the ship.I usually upgrade to the premium WiFi option, which can cost anywhere from $19 to $39 per day on most lines, but Virgin only charges $10 per day to upgrade.I work in an office at home, so working on a cruise is a big changeI operate at sea as I do on land, with the same office hours available to my clients other than when I know we're going on an excursion.


Cruise ships are comparable to remote working spaces, but they offer so much more. On a cruise, almost everything is included: breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffee, entertainment, and most amenities.If I want to take a break from work, I go to the pool. When I finish for the day, I'll go to the theater to see a show.Meeting places are usually free on a cruise ship. Generally, all you have to do is reserve a conference room. AV facilities are usually included too, although you may have to pay a setup fee.Remember to be respectful — many people are on board for a vacation. I've been out by the pool and seen people taking business calls on speakerphone, which is ridiculously annoying.


I suggest picking at least one port on every cruise and make it a 'ship day'About 75% of people will get off the ship at any port, so staying on board feels like you have the whole place to yourself.Activities like the pools will still be open, and the spas will often discount their services by 20-40% on port days.Of course, I still recommend getting off and exploring as much as possible — that's what cruises are for.

        Millennials' wealth saw historic growth from 2019 to 2023, according to a new report.
      


        Despite the pandemic recession, millennial wealth increased due to factors like a robust labor market.

 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. After years of killing off brands, languishing with student loans, and splurging on avocado toast instead of buying houses, millennials might finally be emerging on top.



A new report from the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, looks at how wealth changed for different age cohorts from 2019 to 2023 by analyzing data from the Federal Reserve's Distributional Financial Accounts.The analysis found good news for the much-beleaguered millennial generation: Their wealth grew at a historic clip.


Per CAP's analysis, from the end of 2019 to the end of 2023, the average wealth of households under 40 grew by 49% — a $85,000 increase from $174,000 to $259,000. That rate of rapid wealth growth has never happened before in the data series' history, per the analysis, and it comes after wealth growth remained relatively stagnant for young Americans pre-pandemic.Here's the whopper: Wealth gains were even higher when looking just at millennials, who were ages 23 to 38 in 2019; they saw their wealth double from the end of 2019 and 2023.To be sure, a cohort entering their prime earning years is expected to see a big wealth gain as its members buy houses and begin to invest in earnest. Indeed, housing wealth rose, and more households under 35 owned property in 2023 than in 2019; at the same time, credit card and student loan debt fell.But the most surprising piece of the findings is that those gains came during and after the pandemic recession — a type of contraction that, historically, has meant far worse economic outcomes for the younger workers caught up in its wake.


""Millennials weathered the pandemic recession much better financially and with an improved financial security outlook than Gen X and the Baby Boomers did when they experienced recessions at similar ages,"" report authors Brendan Duke and Christian Weller write.For instance, during 2007's Great Recession, Gen X was between 27 and 42 — similar to millennials heading into the pandemic. But their real wealth only grew by 4% in the four years following that recession. Similarly, baby boomers were 26 to 44 during the 1990 recession and saw their real wealth grow by 46% in the four years after their recession started. All of those pale in comparison to how well millennials made out.The wealth gains come after millennials also weathered the Great Recession early in their careers and have borne a substantial brunt of the student loan crisis. It's yet another data point showing how the pandemic economic recovery diverged from past contractions and may have chipped away at the tough odds millennials were facing down.Why millennials are faring so well in the wake of the pandemic recessionYou might be able to chalk some of millennials' gains up to the robust labor market that pandemic-era stimulus birthed.


""The pandemic and unprecedented support we gave families—including young people—through cash payments, student loan pauses, and more helped drive the initial surge in wealth for younger Americans,"" Duke, one of the report's authors, told Business Insider. ""We have sustained this wealth boom with a historically strong labor market that is pulling in younger workers and delivering strong inflation-adjusted wage growth at the beginning of their careers.""Other research has unearthed similar findings. As BI's Noah Sheidlower previously reported, Americans under 35 saw their real median net worth grow by 143% from 2019 to 2022; that's per the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, which mostly recently tracked wealth and net worth data through 2022. This data, as the authors of the CAP analysis note, suggests that wealth gains weren't just reserved for the top-earning millennials since both median and average wealth grew.""This suggests that the strong wealth growth for younger Americans is broad-based and not the result of strong growth of a handful of wealthy younger households,"" the authors write.However, the wealthiest Americans, on the whole, saw their net worth grow at higher rates, per SCF.


Meanwhile, the Liberty Street Economics blog at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that Americans under 40 saw their real wealth grow by nearly 80% from the first quarter of 2019 through the last quarter of 2023. As that report notes, financial assets were a major component of younger Americans' wealth growth.And so, it might finally be time for millennials to shine. They still might not be able to buy houses, though.""We need to keep this robust labor market going and Congress needs to set its sights on younger Americans' greatest affordability challenge: housing,"" Duke said.

The U.S. Senate passed a multi-billion dollar package on Tuesday that included foreign aid alongside legislation that forces TikTok to separate from its Beijing-based parent company within a year — or face a national ban. President Biden made the law official, signing it on Wednesday.Prompted by national security concerns, the bill gives TikTok's owner ByteDance nine months to sell the popular social media platform, which boasts over 150 million users in the U.S. ByteDance could get an additional three months to complete the order if a TikTok sale is in progress, bringing the maximum time that TikTok has to be sold or be banned to a year.TikTok is still guaranteed to be available throughout this year's election cycle; January 2025 is the earliest that a ban could start.TikTok supporters outside the US Capitol in March.

That version only gave TikTok six months to comply with separating from ByteDance.

President Biden indicated that he would sign it into law and did so Wednesday.TikTok has long denied that it is sharing American data with China and is already preparing to counteract the bill on free speech or First Amendment grounds.


""At the stage that the bill is signed, we will move to the courts for a legal challenge,"" wrote Michael Beckerman, TikTok's head of public policy for the Americas, in a memo sent to employees on Saturday obtained by The Associated Press.

On Tuesday, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) voted 3-2 to ban employer non-compete agreements — a contract that employers require some workers to sign stating they can not work for a competing business for a specified amount of time after their employment with the company has ended.About one in five workers — or 30 million people — are currently under a noncompete, according to the agency.""Noncompete clauses keep wages low, suppress new ideas, and rob the American economy of dynamism, including from the more than 8,500 new startups that would be created a year once noncompetes are banned,"" said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan in a company release. ""The FTC's final rule to ban noncompetes will ensure Americans have the freedom to pursue a new job, start a new business, or bring a new idea to market.""



Related: FTC Proposes Banning Non-Compete AgreementsIf you're currently subject to a noncompete, it will no longer be enforceable for most U.S. workers starting on the rule's effective date, which is 120 days after publication in the Federal Register.


The exception, however, is senior executives who are locked into existing noncompetes, though employers are not permitted to enforce or enter any senior executives into new non-compete agreements.Senior executives are defined as ""workers earning more than $151,164 annually and who are in policy-making positions,"" per the FTC's new ruling.Employers will now also have to alert any existing employees with noncompetes who are not senior executives that they are no longer locked into their agreements.The commission originally outlined a proposal to ban the contractual agreements in January 2023, defining noncompetes at the time as a contract that ""has the effect of prohibiting the worker from seeking or accepting employment with a person or operating a business after the conclusion of the worker's employment with the employer.""


By banning noncompetes nationwide, the agency estimates that new business formation will increase by 2.7% annually, the average worker's annual earnings will increase by $524, and healthcare costs will plummet by $194 billion in the next 10 years.""Noncompetes are a widespread and often exploitative practice imposing contractual conditions that prevent workers from taking a new job or starting a new business,"" the FTC said in a statement. ""Noncompetes often force workers to either stay in a job they want to leave or bear other significant harms and costs, such as being forced to switch to a lower-paying field, being forced to relocate, being forced to leave the workforce altogether, or being forced to defend against expensive litigation.""Related: What to Know About These Tricky Employment AgreementsAfter the rule is effective, employees who believe they have been subject to a violation of the enforceable law can report their current or former employer by emailing noncompete@ftc.gov.

 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. The dizzying rise of Nvidia stock in recent years has produced extraordinary gains for many retail investors, especially those who got in before the chipmaker became an artificial intelligence superpower.



The stock's steep climb — up over 1,500% since 2019 — has transformed the lives of some of Nvidia's long-term retail investors, resulting in comfier retirements, new cars, and gains worth millions for some.Tom, a 48-year-old retail investor in New Jersey, first bought Nvidia in 2011, when the stock was valued at just about $5 a share. He put in $12,000 at the time and then another $50,000 in 2022. His total stake is now worth $3 million, according to brokerage statements he shared with Business Insider.


His fortune, which remains mostly invested and untouched, was a matter of research and good timing, he said.""They were the original creators of the GPUs,"" he said. ""I'm not even much of a techie. I'm not a computer person at all, but I knew that the GPUs would be worth something one day.""Nvidia went from a gaming icon to an AI superpower seemingly overnight. In the early days of the pandemic, its stock climbed as gamers, with time on their hands under COVID-19 lockdowns, scrambled to upgrade their computer rigs with the latest Nvidia GPUs.Then, in November 2022, the debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT fueled a run of stunning growth for Nvidia as its GPUs were the only game in town when it came to powering such AI programs. The stock has essentially gone parabolic since.


According to Vanda Research, Nvidia has become the top stock among retail investors, surpassing retail portfolio concentrations of Apple, Tesla, and SPY, the most popular S&P 500 exchange-traded fund.Daily net inflows into Nvidia stock driven by retail investors7-trading-day moving averageTom said his Nvidia stake was worth about three times what he had in his 401(k) and that he felt more comfortable that he'd be able to live well in retirement, a concern that loomed over him before he went in on Nvidia.


Generational wealthKiana Danial is the 40-year-old founder of Invest Diva, a company that helps women take control of their financial future and create generational wealth.Danial hadn't heard of Nvidia before 2015 when she married her husband, who was a gamer in his free time. Danial said she liked to invest in products she uses, but when she heard her husband talk about how much he loved Nvidia, she decided to buy the stock.She first bought Nvidia in June 2016. She purchased 10 shares and shortly after continued setting new buy orders every month.""The investments started growing pretty rapidly,"" Danial said.


Nvidia shares tumbled by more than 30% in 2018. During that time, Danial continued adding to her positions and started adding Nvidia to her Roth IRA and a Roth IRA she set up for her daughter.Danial sold the bulk of her shares in February and March 2023 to help partially cover a large down payment on a second home.The pool in Kiana Danial's home. Her Nvidia investments helped fund a down payment. Jeff Roberts Photography via BIDanial sold 800 shares over a six-week period for about $188,795, bringing her total number of shares down to 323.""I'm obviously kicking myself,"" Danial said about selling the stock. ""But we bought our dream house and it's beautiful.""The stock she still owns has left her with $202,940 in gains. She doesn't plan on selling her shares anytime soon and intends to buy more.Danial's daughter recently turned 6, and the account Danial set up for her has grown 568% and is worth around $11,000.


The investors Business Insider spoke with piled into Nvidia early on because of its renown among PC gamers, but today, the company's chips are the lynchpin of the AI revolution — and there is virtually zero competition.The company's dominance has made it hard to find anyone willing to give the bear case, though some analysts have recently sounded more hesitant about further gains after the stock's meteoric rally.New financial security Rick, a 36-year-old retail investor in Texas, started buying Nvidia in 2009. The stock caught his eye because, at the time, the company seemed like the future of gaming. He invested $600, which he described as a wild-card bet.""And so $600 turned into $140K,"" Rick said.


With Nvidia, Rick said he felt he had a safety net to fall back on. He's spent only a small portion of his gains so far: $15,000 to flip a car he worked on, a hobby he said he wouldn't have gotten into without the Nvidia money. For his 10th anniversary, he and his wife packed their bags for a $14,000 getaway in Costa Rica.""I had zero stress about it. It was like, 'We can spend as much as we want on this trip,'"" he said.That sense of security that such a windfall provides was the top theme among the Nvidia investors BI connected with.It's a similar story for Chris Downs, a 66-year-old who lives in rural Missouri and retired from his job as a math teacher three years ago.


He's been investing for a while, but his interest in Nvidia began when he bought a new computer for video editing at the start of the COVID-19 quarantines. Downs said he splurged on an Nvidia graphics card for his setup and was impressed.He bought 112 shares in March 2020 for $79 each.In July 2023, he sold 28 shares of Nvidia at $436 apiece to offset losses from other investments. Now he has 84 shares left, worth over $65,000 based on Monday's prices, in addition to other stocks.He said he would probably sell some of his Nvidia shares closer to the election, but he's planning to invest the proceeds for his four children, as his parents and grandparents had done for their kids.


Downs said his lifestyle wasn't lavish but that he tried to travel every month. Places he's been to include Bolivia, Paris, and Mexico City, and he plans to go to Spain at the end of April.He said security was the biggest perk of his investment, as well as knowing that he could cover unpredictable financial mishaps.""It's nice in retirement not to have to worry,"" Downs said.

One week before National Small Business Week, a new study examines some surprising things that the millions of small businesses across the U.S. have in common.A Pew Research Center Survey released Monday delved into Census Bureau data points associated with 33 million small businesses across the U.S. The study defined ""small business"" as a firm with less than 500 workers, with at least one location.In the report, small businesses overwhelmingly shared one major commonality: they rarely had employees. In fact, 27 million, or about 82%, did not have any workers, and about 3 million businesses with employees only had one to four people on their payroll.



Still, small businesses employed 56.4 million people in 2021 and achieved more than $16.2 trillion in revenue. Larger businesses with more than 100 employees scored bigger pieces of the revenue pie, though they made up less than 1% of the overall picture.Related: How to Go From Side Hustle to 7-Figure Business and Beyond, According to 3 Women Who Did It


Also, most small businesses are not mom-and-pop shops, according to the survey. One in 10 businesses in the U.S. were equally owned and operated by spouses, and just 27% were family-owned overall.It's also not usually franchises. The majority of small businesses (95%) reported that they did not fully or partially operate as a franchise.A majority of the businesses surveyed, almost three in five, have been running for at least six years, and 15% were operational for over a quarter of a century.Related: They Designed One Simple Product With a 'Focus on Human Health' — and Made $40 Million Last Year


Small businesses also share a positive public perception. Most Americans (86%) indicated that small businesses positively impact the country in a separate Pew Research survey conducted in January. In contrast, only 53% thought positively about tech companies and colleges.A Constant Contact survey released Monday presents a global picture, showing that over 80% of the 1,300 small businesses surveyed in the U.S., Australia, the U.K., and Canada expressed concern about how the economic climate will affect their business this year.Pew Research reports that the number of U.S. business applications has trending up, with almost 1.8 million applications filed last year.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is challenging Kroger's acquisition of Albertsons and Kroger, and now the two stores have offered up another compromise to curb concerns about the merger's approval.Now, the two grocery store chains have agreed to sell an additional 166 stores to C&S Wholesale Grocers (which owns 24 Piggly Wiggly and Grand Union supermarkets) in a divestiture deal set to be worth an estimated $2.9 billion. The total number of stores sold to the retailer is now 579. The additional grocery stores sold to C&S will ensure that no storefronts close, no employees lose their jobs, and no employee benefits change upon the merger's completion, Kroger's CEO Rodney McMullen said in a company release.

The merger, which was announced in 2022 and worth an estimated $25 billion, is under scrutiny by the FTC. The agency claims that the new combined chain would limit competition and have disastrous implications for employees, customers, and food providers at large, from unfair prices to lower employee wages and beyond.The FTC originally sued to block the merger in February and was joined by eight states and Washington, D.C.""This supermarket mega-merger comes as American consumers have seen the cost of groceries rise steadily over the past few years. Kroger's acquisition of Albertsons would lead to additional grocery price hikes for everyday goods, further exacerbating the financial strain consumers across the country face today,"" said Henry Liu, director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, earlier this year. ""Essential grocery store workers would also suffer under this deal, facing the threat of their wages dwindling, benefits diminishing, and their working conditions deteriorating.""Related: Mark Cuban Shares His Hack for How to Get Cheaper Groceries


Additionally, Kroger has now agreed to sell the Haggen name to C&S, while C&S will operate the Albertsons name in California and Wyoming and the Safeway name in Arizona and Colorado.The FTC has not yet commented on whether or not the revised divestiture deal would affect its decision to allow the merger to proceed.

18,A New AI Chatbot Is Revolutionizing Business School Curriculum and Accreditation — Here's What It Could Change,"Apr 23, 2024",Sherin Shibu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/how-ai-is-changing-business-school-curriculum-accreditation/473114,"
The Haub School of Business at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia is running a pilot AI program called ChatSDG, and last week at the world's largest business education conference, professors, deans, and administrators from other business schools were all ""flocking"" to test it, Bloomberg reported.ChatSDG evaluates how well scholarly articles and journals align with the UN's sustainable development goals, which include everything from ending poverty to ensuring sustainable consumption. This alignment is necessary for business schools to obtain accreditation from AACSB, an international organization founded in 1916. According to Indeed, AACSB accreditation is one of the most rigorous and prestigious accreditations in higher education.When a school submits research to ChatSDG, the AI chatbot acts like a peer reviewer and creates a custom report that answers the question, ""What is the societal impact of your journal article?"" It gives each journal or article a score from zero to five, with five being the most aligned with UN goals.



If the article hasn't been published yet, the bot includes ways for researchers to improve it. For articles that are already out, ChatSDG suggests how the research could be used by people in the real world.""It's going to revolutionize the [business school] curriculum,"" Haub Dean Joseph DiAngelo told Bloomberg about ChatSDG. ""It's going to revolutionize how faculty members do research, and it's going to revolutionize how schools provide their metrics for the accreditation process.""


Related: I Attended an Ivy League University's Most Popular MBA Leadership Class and Learned How Steve Jobs Became a Better Leader in 10 MinutesChatSDG could slash the time that business schools have to expend to obtain and keep their AACSB certification, which has only been awarded so far to one-third of business schools in the U.S. and 6% globally. Obtaining the certification can take six years, according to Bloomberg, and currently requires countless hours of human evaluation and reports.ChatSDG ""satisfies AACSB's accreditation requirement to show evidence of societal impact,"" the AACSB confirmed.Using ChatSDG to rate articles could put business schools on the fast track to accreditation and cut down the time it would have taken human reviewers to do the same thing.


Related: Business Schools Are Adding AI Education Into The CurriculumThe Haub school joined forces with Cabells Scholarly Analytics to create the AI chatbot, which, per Bloomberg, has been piloted in 10 AACSB-accredited business schools over the past 18 months.AI has increasingly become framed as a business tool, with an October Harvard Business School study finding that consultants who used AI for certain tasks completed their work more quickly and produced a higher-quality output.The majority of business schools in the U.S. are incorporating AI into their curriculum already, including the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business and Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.

If you're a fan of Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh delivery, Amazon's new grocery subscription might make things a little cheaper.U.S.-based Amazon Prime members, who already pay $15 a month for a Prime membership, can now access an added $10 grocery subscription that makes deliveries on orders from Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods, and local grocery stores free for orders above $35.The subscription covers specialty stores like Rite Aid and Pet Food Express. Depending on the area, the delivery could arrive within an hour at no extra cost.



Prime subscribers can already get food delivered through Amazon — but without the added grocery subscription, they have to pay $9.99 in delivery fees for every Amazon Fresh order below $50 and $7 in fees for orders from $50 to $100. Amazon Fresh deliveries above $100 are free. Whole Foods grocery deliveries usually cost around $10 in fees per order.The new service can help Prime members save money if they order groceries more frequently and if their orders would usually cause them to pay added fees.


Amazon pitched the subscription as something that ""pays for itself after just one delivery order per month from Whole Foods Market, or one delivery order per month from Amazon Fresh for under $50."" Using either option would cost around $10 an order.Members can also get 30-minute pickup times on orders, no matter how big or small, and have priority access to recurring grocery orders.Related: FTC Sues to Block $25 Billion Grocery Merger Between Kroger, AlbertsonsNon-Prime members with an EBT (electronic benefit transfer) card can access the same subscription for $5 per month, without paying extra for a Prime membership.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is suing to block a mega-merger that would unite luxury fashion brands, Michael Kors and Coach.Coach's parent company, Tapestry (which also oversees fashion brands Kate Spade New York and Stuart Weitzman) is attempting to buy Michael Kors' parent company, Capri (which also oversees Versace and Jimmy Choo), in a deal that was set to cost an estimated $8.5 billion.But in Monday's filing, the FTC claims that the merger would eliminate competition between the fashion houses and could potentially reduce employee wages and benefits.

The new mega-company would have an estimated 33,000 employees globally.Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat told Reuters that the FTC was ""fundamentally misunderstanding"" the fashion marketplace of today, arguing that competition for talent goes beyond just the fashion industry.""Capri Holdings strongly disagrees with the FTC's decision,"" Capri asserted in a statement.

Taylor J. Swift said he has to work to get people to take him seriously in his political job but he likes his name.


 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Taylor J. Swift, a 30-year-old at the POPVOX Foundation in Washington, DC. It has been edited for length and clarity.



I was 15 when I heard about the singer Taylor Swift for the first time. At first, I thought, no big deal, she's a singer with a hit song or two, this won't impact me — but I was wrong. As time continued, I started to find it frustrating.I was just a kid trying to live my life, and I was now sharing a name with a big singer. Additionally, I had just moved back to Ohio to live with my dad, so I was the new kid at school, with the name Taylor Swift. To top it off, I had a Justin Bieber haircut, I had glasses, and I was on the debate team, it wasn't a fun time.


Similar to most kids, I was trying to figure out who I wanted to be, but a couple of high school bullies and a choir teacher who would make jokes about my name didn't help. When it came time to go to college, and I was getting ready for a fresh start, I knew I had two choices. I could change my name, or I could start fresh and embrace it.It took a lot of self-realization, but after a while, I decided I'd run with Taylor Swift instead of choosing the name TJ, an abbreviation of my first and middle name. I remember thinking, I was given this name for a reason, and I'm going to grow, and become who I'm meant to become with it.Even though my name comes up in every social interaction, including in my political career, I've decided to embrace it, have fun with it, and see it as an overall positive. I like my name and I think it has helped me more than it has hurt me, even at work.My name helps me stand out at workAs someone who works in the congressional advocacy space, where I help advocate for things like better wages, pay benefits, and technology, it helps to have a name like mine because people usually remember it. When I introduce myself to new staffers, new constituents, new lawmakers, or interns, they'll remember me for weeks, and sometimes even months later. That's a good thing.


When you're in my line of work you meet a lot of people. At some point, it feels very transactional. So, it's good to have something that helps you stand out — for me, it's my name. When people remember my name they also remember the ball I'm trying to push forward, and that's what's important.I use my name to make conversations more light-heartedWith my work, we host an event where we onboard our congressional interns in Congress. With this event, our main goal is to help reduce their anxiety when it comes to networking, and we try to show them their work as interns truly matters. At the event, when my name comes up on the big screen in front of roughly 350 interns, people in the crowd start to chuckle. Then they think, maybe I shouldn't laugh.It's weird to laugh at someone's name — I get it. To make them feel less weird about it, I pause, grab the microphone, and say, ""Yes, my name is Taylor Swift. Please feel free to make jokes, I'll just shake it off, later,"" a Taylor Swift reference. Then everybody laughs and they become more comfortable.When at work, I'll use other song lyric references, like, ""I know this project has been hard, but 'we're not out of the woods yet'"" and ""I know, this mistake was my fault. 'I'm the problem. It's me.'""


Political work can be stressful, so if making a joke about my name makes someone laugh, smile, or remember me, I do it.Getting people to take me seriously takes workAt first, people may think, who is this person? How can I trust someone with the name Taylor Swift? With that said, I have to work to get people to take me seriously.In the past, I think my name has thrown people off a bit. But, then as I engage in conversation with them, or if I'm briefing a member of Congress, or holding some sort of meeting, they see I'm serious about the work we're doing. I very much take pride in the work that we do, and after a minute, or two, people see how dedicated I am to the cause we're working on and my name doesn't take away from that.I use my middle initial to help avoid confusionWhen I do interviews with the press, I ask them to please quote me as Taylor J. Swift, so no one confuses me as the pop singer. This way, no one wonders why Taylor Swift (without the J) is speaking on congressional modernization and oversight. I also include the ""J"" on my business cards or when applying to jobs, to avoid confusion.


Even still, people do wonder. For example, just this past weekend, I booked a dinner reservation for two under the name Taylor Swift. I could tell the hostess seemed a bit disappointed when I showed up. Like normal, they joked about how I wasn't the real Taylor Swift, so I just laughed and said, I hear it all the time but I just shake it off.I now think, that if my name is the biggest struggle I have in life, I'm doing OK. It feels trivial to believe otherwise.

The once bustling workwear retailer Express officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. on Monday.The retailer will close 100 stores across the country, court documents filed in Delaware said. Assets and liabilities listed are estimated to cost between $1 billion to $10 billion.Express' portfolio includes brands such as Express, Bonobos, and UpWest. The company most recently acquired Bonobos, a menswear company, in May 2023 from Walmart Inc. in a joint acquisition with WHP Globals for an estimated $75 million.

""We are taking an important step that will strengthen our financial position and enable Express to continue advancing our business initiatives. WHP has been a strong partner to the Company since 2023, and the proposed transaction will provide us additional financial resources, better position the business for profitable growth, and maximize value for our stakeholders.""


Glendinning said that the company's primary priority will continue to be ""providing our customers with the contemporary styles and value they expect from us"" and that the company will operate business as usual both online and in-store.It's estimated that Express operates 530 Express brand and Factory Outlet stores across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The company has not yet disclosed what locations will be closing.The company will shutter all five of its UpWest locations.Express was founded in 1980 and quickly gained popularity as an affordable destination for office wear for women and men, especially during the peak of the shopping mall era in the U.S.


The move will also place Mark Still as permanent CFO, effective immediately, a position he has been serving in the interim since November 2023.Related: Bonobos CEO Abruptly Steps Down After 3 Months on the JobStores will begin closing on April 23.

Learning how to code? A standard engineering degree might not be enough.In a recent post in the Harvard Business Review, Goldman Sachs Chief Information Officer Marco Argenti said that AI can now write high-quality code, sometimes greater than humans, and the technology is only getting better.So how does an engineer keep up? He told readers the advice he gave his college-age daughter: ""If you want to pursue a career in engineering, you should focus on learning philosophy in addition to traditional engineering coursework.""

Credit: Patrick McMullan/PMC via Getty ImagesHe said that run-of-the-mill engineering coursework isn't enough as AI expands in complexity becasue AI code can be technically correct but not do what it's supposed to do.


If an engineer doesn't get the prompt right, the AI will create code that could be somewhat right in the best-case scenario and outright incorrect in the worst-case scenario. But engineers grounded in philosophy should have the reasoning abilities and first-principle thinking to keep pace.The question for engineers will not be, ""Can you code?"" but ""Can you get the best code out of your AI by asking the right question?""Related: What Is Prompt Engineering, the Hot New Tech Job in AIAI prompt engineering, or communicating with AI in the best words to get the desired output, is an emerging field. Jaime Teevan, chief scientist at Microsoft, wrote in December that communicating with AI is different from telling a team member what to do. AI needs more context and might need rephrasing or examples before it produces a workable output.


PricewaterhouseCoopers partner Robin Stein told the publication CIO that PwC ""realized very quickly we had to upskill our 75,000 people on the foundations of generative AI, how to apply gen AI responsibly, and how to become a prompt engineer.""Related: Two Yale PhDs Are Trying to Make AI Hallucinate 10x Less, So Small Businesses Can Adopt the Technology in Weeks, Not YearsArgenti emphasized that in an era of AI hallucinations, it was all the more important to ask the right questions and employ a philosophical mindset.""Having a crisp mental model around a problem, being able to break it down into steps that are tractable, perfect first-principle thinking, sometimes being prepared (and able to) debate a stubborn AI — these are the skills that will make a great engineer in the future, and likely the same consideration applies to many job categories,"" Argenti wrote.

Microsoft published a research paper this week highlighting a new AI model called VASA-1 that can transform a single picture and audio clip of a person into a realistic video of them lip-syncing — with facial expressions, head movements, and all.The AI model was trained on AI-generated images from generators like DALL·E-3, which the researchers then layered with audio clips. The results are images-turned-videos of talking faces.The researchers built on technology from competitors such as Runway and Nvidia, but state in the paper that their method of doing things is higher-quality, more realistic, and ""significantly outperforms"" existing methods.

The model could also transform artistic photos, take in singing audios, and handle speech in languages that weren't English.The researchers emphasized that the model could work in real-time with a demo video that showed the model instantly animating images with head movements and facial expressions.


Deepfakes, or digitally altered media of a person that could spread misinformation or take someone's likeness without permission, are a risk posed by advanced AI that can generate digital media with relatively few reference points.Related: Tennessee Passes Law Protecting Musicians From AI DeepfakesMicrosoft addressed that concern generally in the paper, with the researchers stating, ""We are opposed to any behavior to create misleading or harmful contents of real persons, and are interested in applying our technique for advancing forgery detection.""The researchers stated that their technique had potentially positive applications too, like improving accessibility and enhancing educational efforts.Google demoed a similar research project last month, showcasing an AI capable of taking a photo and creating a video from it that the user can then control with their voice.

James Clear speaks on stage during Pennsylvania Conference For Women 2019 at Pennsylvania Convention Center.


Entrepreneur attended BetterUp's Uplift summit San Francisco on April 11, where renowned author and public speaker, James Clear, who is best known for his New York Times bestselling book, ""Atomic Habits,"" spoke about the key to building habits that stick.His book, which teaches people the importance of building better habits on a scaleable level and finding success with these newly adopted behaviors, has sold more than 15 million copies. Still, he knows that when people want to make massive changes, it can feel completely overwhelming.""We're so focused on optimizing that we don't give ourselves permission to show up even if it's just a small way.""But Clear said there's one technique that only takes two minutes of your time.Related: How to Develop Atomic Habits



By using the ""two-minute rule,"" you can begin implementing habits into your daily lives, no matter how farfetched (or big) the new habits might be. The strategy can be applied to any habit you're trying to build, he says, in both a professional and personal capacity.What Is the Two-Minute Rule?The two-minute rule is when you take the new habit or task you want to accomplish and no matter how big it seems, break it down into a short task that can be done in two minutes or less.""Take whatever habit you're trying to create and scale it down to something that takes two minutes or less to do,"" Clear explained. ""So 'read 30 books a year' becomes 'read one page' or 'do yoga four days a week' means 'take out my yoga mat.'""Clear says critics have raised issues with this strategy because they are consciously aware that they are trying to trick their brains, which makes it harder to implement. But Clear says to take a step back and just begin — the hardest step is usually the first one.


""This is a deeper truth about habits that people often overlook, which is a habit must be established before it can be improved,"" he said. ""It has some standard in your life before you can scale it up and optimize and turn it into something more.""Clear compared this to going to the gym and knowing that your initial habit-building step might just be putting on your workout clothes and walking out the front door, not starting with a 5-mile run or an intense exercise class.""At some point, planning becomes some form of procrastination.""""And I don't know why we do this. But we get very all-or-nothing about our habits a lot of the time,"" he said. ""We're so focused on finding the best workout program, the perfect sales strategy, the ideal diet plan — we're so focused on optimizing that we don't give ourselves permission to show up even if it's just a small way.""


Sometimes deciding to start instead of planning to start is the shift you need, he said.""The two-minute rule kind of pushes back perfectionism, fear, and this tendency to over plan or over research,"" he said. ""Planning and preparation can be useful. But if you're planning and research and preparation are substituting for actions that you should be taking, now it's kind of outlived its usefulness and become a crutch — at some point planning becomes some form of procrastination.""Related: EntrepreneurTV Is Now Streaming – And It's Free!

29,Taylor Swift Is Making Vinyl Cool Again — and Profitable. Here's How Her Surprise Double Album Is Bringing Back the Old-School Medium.,"Apr 19, 2024",Sherin Shibu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/taylor-swift-is-making-vinyl-records-cool-profitable-again/472973,"
Taylor Swift's highly anticipated new album ""The Tortured Poets Department"" (TTPD) hit streaming services at midnight ET on Friday. At 2 a.m. ET, Swift revealed that TTPD was actually a double album, releasing 31 total tracks under ""TTPD: The Anthology.""While Swift has made headlines for her expansive Eras tour, billionaire status, and impact on the economy, one aspect of her brand has contributed to a resurgence in an old-school medium of music: Vinyl.During the promotion for TTPD, vinyl took front and center. Swift announced new record variants at tour stops across the world, with titles like ""The Bolter"" and ""The Albatross."" Buying a vinyl was marketed as a way to access to the original 16-track album and an exclusive bonus track.

By releasing the deluxe TTPD album at 2 a.m., Swift was able to fold in the exclusive bonus tracks available separately on each vinyl into ""The Anthology"" — so fans who didn't buy records could stream the songs.Related: Taylor Swift Children's Book Surpasses 1 Million Sales MarkChecking out a $35 vinyl through the Taylor Swift store reveals that fans who bought it before ""The Anthology"" dropped only have access to 17 tracks — an incomplete picture of the overall 31-track album.Vinyl yields more revenue than streaming for Swift, reports The New York Times.


""Some are willing to pay to have more variants on the wall,"" music industry analyst Dan Runcie told the publication. ""It's no different from sports fans paying up to have rookie cards.""File Name: The Albatross ?Pre-order the new edition of THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT with exclusive bonus track ""The Albatross""on my website nowhttps://t.co/BAtr2MpPIs?: Beth Garrabrant pic.twitter.com/62Bmrc5zs5— Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) February 23, 2024That could be okay though: Fans may not be buying Taylor Swift records just for the music.Each vinyl on Swift's site emphasizes uniqueness and collectability over even exclusivity. ""The Manuscript"" edition of TTPD, for example, includes unique replicas of Swift's lyrics, handwritten by the artist, and collectible album sleeves with unique photos. Swift handwrote a note for select fans who purchase TTPD records at some record stores.


Related: Taylor Swift Just Filed a Trademark That Could Mean Even More SalesTTPD isn't the first album that Swift has brought to vinyl. In 2016, Swift began issuing her early albums on vinyl. 2020's ""Folklore"" had nine vinyl editions and 2022's Midnights had four different colored editions that made a clock when put together.One in every 15 vinyl records sold in the U.S. last year was by Swift, for a total of close to 3.5 million records sold. The Recording Industry Association of America stated in a report that vinyl records outsold CDs for the second year in a row since 1987 in the U.S., with 43 million records sold in total in 2023.It's not just the U.S.: ""1989 (Taylor's Version)"" took the top-selling vinyl spot in the U.K. over The Rolling Stones' ""Hackney Diamonds"" and Lana Del Rey's ""Did You Know Know There's A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd,"" which took second and third place, respectively.


Related: Taylor Swift Is Officially a Billionaire — Here's How She Did It and Where Her Net Worth Comes FromNot all artists are fans of the vinyl strategy though, with Billie Eilish telling Billboard in an interview last month that releasing different versions of the same vinyl to increase sales was ""wasteful.""""It's irritating to me that we're still at a point where you care that much about your numbers and you care that much about making money,"" Eilish said.She later clarified that she wasn't singling anyone out.It's not just artists: Not all of Swift's fans like the limited edition records, with some taking to social media to critique the multiple variations.Related: Taylor Swift Reportedly Pays All Restaurant-Goers' Checks to Clear Out Restaurant For Her and NFL Star Travis KelceAndrew Mall, an associate music professor at Northeastern University, told Northeastern Global News that many artists do the same thing as Swift and release different versions of the same record, with variations in things like bonus tracks and covers.""Completists will go out and buy a dozen different copies because it's important to them to have every copy that's been produced,"" Mall told the outlet.


Swift officially hit the billionaire mark in October 2023. TTPD will not be her biggest money draw this year though, vinyls and all — the Eras tour will be, according to Business Insider.

      Key Takeaways    



        Some people are making six-figure incomes by secretly working multiple remote jobs.
      


        But some critics aren't sure job juggling is ethical since remote roles are in high demand.
      


        Six people who've benefited from ""overemployment"" described why they don't feel guilty.

Some people are making six-figure incomes secretly working multiple remote gigs. They don't feel guilty about it. None of the workers in the story are pictured.


 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. If you could double your income by secretly working multiple remote jobs, would you do it?What if it required keeping a secret from your bosses and coworkers? What if you landed a second job over someone who was looking for their first?Would you feel bad?""Overemployed"" workers have a resounding answer: No.Over the past year, Business Insider has spoken with more than 10 job jugglers who used their six-figure earnings to pay off debt, plan for an early retirement, and afford expensive vacations and weight-loss drugs. But not everyone is a fan of the overemployed.Some critics have questioned the ethics of job juggling, arguing that employees shouldn't be doing work for one company when they're being paid by another. While some employers may be OK with their workers taking on another role, doing so without approval could be a fireable offense if a worker is caught.There's also the question of what it means for someone to be taking a second remote job when the market for these roles is so competitive.



The share of U.S. remote job postings on LinkedIn fell from over 20% in April 2022 to about 10% in December 2023. LinkedIn said that despite the decline, remote roles accounted for 46% of all applications in December.Remote jobs have grown particularly competitive in the tech industry, a common field for overemployed workers. In 2023, tech companies including Amazon, Meta, and Google laid off close to 263,000 employees, according to Layoffs.fyi. Roughly 50,000 tech workers have been laid off since the start of this year.Business Insider asked six current and former overemployed workers whether they felt guilty about their job juggling. They shared their experiences via email on the condition that pseudonyms would be used, for fear of professional repercussions. BI has verified their identities and earnings.If companies can lay off workers on a whim, workers should be able to seek out extra job securityJoseph, a Gen X network engineer, told Business Insider he earned $344,000 in 2022 secretly working three remote jobs. He said the extra income allowed him to pay off the remaining $129,000 on his mortgage.


At first, Joseph said, his wife was not a fan of his job juggling because she thought he was taking a job away from someone who needed one. But last year, he said, they both learned the value of having multiple gigs.Joseph was laid off from two of his jobs — he said that it wasn't for performance reasons and that his job juggling was never exposed. If he hadn't had three jobs, he could have been left with no job at all.This made it hard for him to feel very guilty about being overemployed. ""It's huge that I still have this third job,"" he said.Joseph isn't the only overemployed worker who values job security.


Robert, a Gen Xer living in Florida, told Business Insider he earned roughly $335,000 last year juggling multiple jobs — he said the extra income helped him pay for a roughly $20,000 cruise.Given that layoffs across the tech industry have left some workers scrambling to find new roles, Robert said no one should be blamed for trying to protect themselves.""If companies can so easily cut you off like many have these days, then shouldn't you have the ability to be resilient and resistant to layoffs and cuts in protecting the best interests of your family?"" he said.If CEOs can work for multiple businesses, employees should be able to as wellJohn, a millennial IT professional in California, told Business Insider he was on track to earn over $300,000 last year across two remote jobs.


He said that he'd saved roughly $150,000 since he started job juggling in 2021 and that he spent roughly $9,000 on a three-week honeymoon across Asia last year.John said he didn't feel guilty about having multiple jobs because he wasn't violating any labor laws or employment contracts, adding that his company was happy with the work he was doing.He also thinks there's a double standard in the corporate world.He said it's not uncommon for CEOs like Elon Musk, for instance, to juggle roles with multiple companies, whether as an executive or part of a board.""No one ever thinks that's wrong,"" John said. ""I'm the same. I am the CEO of my own labor, and I choose to spend my labor on multiple projects.""William, a Texas-based tech worker in his 30s who told Business Insider he earned over $500,000 in 2022 secretly working multiple remote roles, agreed with this line of thinking.""I knew plenty of high-level executives that also had consulting business or other ventures as well,"" he said.While there has been some pushback against CEO job juggling, the practice is still generally accepted in the corporate world. People with the money and resources of Musk, for example, may find it easier to multitask than the typical white-collar worker.


If you do your job well and efficiently, you should be able to have other jobs on the sideSteven, a UK-based project manager in his mid-20s, told Business Insider he was earning roughly $90,000 a year secretly working two full-time hybrid project-manager jobs.He said overemployment was the only way he could start paying down his debt. As of late last year, he had roughly $30,000 worth of credit-card debt and $50,000 in various loans.Steven said he didn't feel guilty about job juggling because he was still able to complete all the duties and tasks assigned to him. He argued that if an employee can get their work done with plenty of time to spare, they should be able to pursue other job opportunities.""What if an employee supposedly working a 40-hour week, for example, only has actually 20 hours of work to do?"" he said. ""What would they do then? Sit in front of the computer waiting for something or wasting time on their phone or emails? Is that better in any way than my choosing to fit a second job in and get some benefit out of all this otherwise dead free time?""


Other job jugglers described similar sentiments.""In a salaried position, you are paid based on objectives, not by time,"" William said. ""Based on that, there is not a situation of double billing, and overemployment is not too different than picking up the extra slack from another coworker.""Perhaps counterintuitively, workers having extra jobs could actually benefit some companies, said Justin, a Gen Xer who told Business Insider he earned over $300,000 in 2022 secretly working three full-time remote IT-engineer jobs.Justin said he didn't feel guilty about job juggling because he was a top performer in all his roles — and having multiple jobs gave him experience that added value to all his employers.


""Having the 'same job times three' helps me increase knowledge to be a better worker everywhere,"" he said.

31,Samsung Makes 6 Day Workweeks Mandatory for Executives as the Company Enters 'Emergency Mode',"Apr 18, 2024",Sherin Shibu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/samsung-6-day-workweek-for-execs-company-in-emergency-mode/472937,"
Four-day workweeks might have all the buzz, but one major tech company is going in the opposite direction.Samsung is implementing a six-day workweek for all executives after some of the firm's core businesses delivered lower-than-expected financial results last year.A Samsung Group executive told a Korean news outlet that ""considering that performance of our major units, including Samsung Electronics Co., fell short of expectations in 2023, we are introducing the six-day work week for executives to inject a sense of crisis and make all-out efforts to overcome this crisis.""



Lower performance combined with other economic uncertainties like high borrowing costs have pushed the South Korean company to enter ""emergency mode,"" per The Korea Economic Daily.Related: Apple Is No Longer the Top Phonemaker in the World as AI Pressure and Competition IntensifiesExecutives at all Samsung Group divisions will be affected, including those in sales and manufacturing, according to the report.Samsung had its worst financial year in over a decade in 2023, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that net profit fell 73% in Q4. It also lost its top spot on the global smartphone market to Apple in the same quarter, though it reclaimed it this year.Though employees below the executive level aren't yet mandated to clock in on weekends, some might follow the unwritten example of their bosses. After all, The Korea Economic Daily reports that executives across some Samsung divisions have been voluntarily working six days a week since January, before the company decided to implement the six-day workweek policy.Entrepreneur has reached out to Samsung's U.S. newsroom to ask if this news includes executives situated globally, including in the U.S., or if it only affects employees in Korea. Samsung did not immediately respond.


Research on the relationship between hours worked and output shows that working more does not necessarily increase productivity.A Stanford project, for example, found that overwork leads to decreased total output. Average productivity decreases due to stress, sleep deprivation, and other factors ""to the extent that the additional hours [worked] provide no benefit (and, in fact, are detrimental),"" the study said.Related: Samsung's Newest Galaxy Gadget Aims 'To See How Productive You Can Be'Longer hours can also mean long-term health effects. The World Health Organization found that working more than 55 hours a week decreases life expectancy and increases the risk of stroke by 35%.


The same 55-hour workweek leads to a 17% higher risk of heart disease, per the same study.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.


 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Meta's large language model and AI assistant are getting upgrades.



On Thursday, the company released the first models of Llama 3 in two sizes, 8B and 70B parameters. They've also been integrated into Meta AI, the company's AI assistant.""With this new model, we believe Meta AI is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday in an Instagram post.


Meta said in a blog post Thursday its newest models saw ""substantially reduced false refusal rates, improved alignment, and increased diversity in model responses,"" as well as progress in reasoning, generating code, and instruction.""With Llama 3, we set out to build the best open models that are on par with the best proprietary models available today,"" the post reads. ""This next generation of Llama demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of industry benchmarks and offers new capabilities, including improved reasoning. We believe these are the best open source models of their class, period.""Though Meta bills Llama as open-source, Llama 2 required companies with more than 700 million monthly active users to request a license from the company to use it, which Meta may or may not grant.In the near future, Meta hopes to ""make Llama 3 multilingual and multimodal, have longer context, and continue to improve overall performance across core LLM capabilities such as reasoning and coding,"" the company said in the blog post.


So what do the changes mean for Meta AI now?The AI assistant can help with tasks like recommending restaurants, planning trips, and making your emails sound more professional.Using Meta AI's Imagine feature also now produces sharper images faster: They'll start to appear as you're typing and change ""with every few letters typed,"" according to a press release issued Thursday.Meta AI is available across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and on browsers. The company says multimodal Meta AI is also coming to its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses soon. It's rolling out in English in over a dozen countries outside the US.


As for what comes next, Meta says it's working on models over 400B parameters that are still in training.""I don't think that today many people really think about Meta AI when they think about the main AI assistants that people use,"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told The Verge in an article published Thursday. ""But I think that this is the moment where we're really going to start introducing it to a lot of people, and I expect it to be quite a major product.""Meta AI, of course, faces stiff competition from better-known AI assistants, including the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, and Anthropic's Claude.

Country star Jelly Roll, 39, is having a banner year, but a lawsuit filed last week in Pennsylvania court claims that his past reputation is causing a local band ""irreparable harm.""A wedding band based in Chadds Ford, Penn., a town just outside of Philadelphia, called ""Jellyroll"" is suing the country musician for trademark infringement and ""unfair competition.""The band, which has been around since the 1980s, claims that it owns the trademark for the name and has sent Jelly Roll (the country singer) and his team a cease-and-desist letter to change his stage name.



Jelly Roll's team responded via email to discuss, according to the suit.""Several conversations ensued and at one point Defendant's counsel inquired as to whether Defendant really was in competition with Plaintiff,"" the suit states.But the conversations did not work out, and the 80s wedding band is claiming that Google search results about Jelly Roll's past are harming their business. ""Defendant's unapologetic continued infringing acts and conduct, unless enjoined by this Court, will continue to cause consumer confusion, mistake, and deception,"" the lawsuit, which was obtained by FOX Business, alleges. ""Because of Defendant's troubled past, which includes a felony conviction and imprisonment, such association as averred above has caused additional harm to Plaintiff among the public and trade.""Jelly Roll was in and out of jail for 10 years starting at age 14 for a number of charges including aggravated robbery, drug possession and shoplifting.It's noted in the lawsuit that Jelly Roll (the singer) has a space in his name while the band has their name as one word.

A new report released on Wednesday by Ameriprise Financial found that a majority of Gen X and young Boomer couples have delayed taking action on retirement.The financial services company surveyed 1,500 U.S. couples within 10 years of retirement, between the ages of 45 and 70. The goal was to understand how couples of a certain income bracket think about money: Nearly three out of four couples surveyed indicated that they had been together for at least 20 years and all couples had at least $100,000 in investible assets.The study found that a quarter of couples hadn't yet agreed on how much money they needed to save for retirement or spend on children and grandchildren both now and as part of their estates.



Related: Here's One Thing Americans Would Take a Pay Cut For — Besides Remote WorkMeanwhile, two in five couples did not have a financial plan in place, with nearly the same amount admitting that they had yet to figure out how to make the same amount of money as their current paychecks in retirement.


The report also found that 51% of couples had not set up an estate plan, which is a collection of documents that includes a will but adds in additional protections that apply while a person is alive, like a letter of intent, healthcare power of attorney, and guardianship designations.The advantage of an estate plan, according to Find Law, is that it establishes what the person wants to happen if they become unable to communicate their wishes on their own and require someone to take care of them.""Our research shows couples trust one another and share the same dreams for retirement, but that doesn't necessarily mean they've mutually agreed on how they'll spend, save, and give away their money when the time comes,"" said Marcy Keckler, senior vice president of financial advice strategy at Ameriprise. ""Some couples avoid discussing these topics because they feel overwhelmed – especially knowing that unexpected events can happen at any time – but putting it off can lead to challenges down the road.""Interestingly, some respondents said that they had money saved away that their partner didn't know about. One in seven of the 3,000 people surveyed said that they had a secret account, and half of them said that the balance in that account was more than $10,000.


Nearly a quarter of respondents with secret accounts had balances of $50,000 or more.Related: The No. 1 State to Retire in Might Not Even Be on Your RadarStill, the survey found that 94% of U.S. couples say they're honest with each other about finances, and 91% have the same retirement goals— but most have delayed taking action.Longstanding couples, who had been together for at least 20 years and who comprised 72% of the survey respondents, said that their top three pieces of advice were to communicate openly about financial goals, find healthy ways to resolve financial disagreements, and choose a financial advisor together.

Elon Musk is continuing his upheaval of the platform formerly known as Twitter.On Monday, X's owner said that the platform will start charging new users to post in an attempt to get rid of bot and spam accounts.In response to an X post that claimed Musk was initially testing the new policy to ""improve the experience for users overall,"" Musk replied that initiating a ""small fee"" was the ""only way"" to get rid of bots on the platform.



Unfortunately, a small fee for new user write access is the only way to curb the relentless onslaught of bots.Current AI (and troll farms) can pass ""are you a bot"" with ease.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 15, 2024He also alleged that new AI technology has the capability of surpassing prompts that are meant to curb bots.


In a second post, Musk responded to a user concerned that charging new users would make the platform less ""special,"" Musk clarified that the pay plan would be short-lived — new users would only have to pay the fee for three months before they could post freely.That is way harder than paying a tiny fee.This is only for new users. They will be able to do write actions for free after 3 months.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 15, 2024Musk did not elaborate on how much the fee would be nor when it is set to be implemented. It remains unclear whether or not Musk's comments this week mean that users worldwide will face the fee or if the company will be testing it in select markets.Related: Elon Musk Says X 'May Fail' Amid Competition, Ad LossesLast October, Musk began charging all non-verified users in the Philippines and New Zealand a $1 fee to post as a part of X's ""Not a Bot"" subscription model.Users who agreed to the policy and paid the fee were able to continue posting as they wished on the platform, while those who opted out were placed in a ""view-only"" account mode that does not permit posting or re-posting but allows users to read posts, watch videos, and follow new accounts.At the time, X did not say when, if ever, the policy would roll out to other countries.Related: Elon Musk's X Will Starting Charging Unverified Users $1 to Post on the Platform

38,"Days After Layoffs, Tesla Pushes Stockholders to Approve Elon Musk's $56 Billion Pay Package","Apr 17, 2024",Sherin Shibu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/tesla-to-shareholders-approve-ceo-musks-record-high-pay/472850,"
Weeks after Tesla reported its first year-over-year delivery drop since 2020, and days after an internal email from CEO Elon Musk confirmed that the company was laying off more than 10% of its workforce, Tesla is asking shareholders to vote yes on Musk's record-setting, multi-billion-dollar pay package.Tesla filed a proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday asking shareholders to approve a $56 billion compensation package for Musk at its annual June 13 meeting.The package was first approved by 73% of Tesla shareholders in 2018, giving Musk the chance to buy hundreds of millions of Tesla shares at a preset price if the company hit certain high financial targets under his leadership.



Related: Elon Musk Informs Tesla Staff That Layoffs Will Affect at Least 14,000 Employees — Read the Leaked EmailThe compensation package would have been the highest in U.S. corporate history, according to The New York Times. But some shareholders were against it, including Pennsylvania resident Richard Tornetta, who sued Musk in 2018 over the pay deal.


Tesla did achieve its financial milestones, but Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick ultimately sided with Tornetta and overturned Musk's pay package in January, deeming it ""an unfathomable sum.""Elon Musk on April 13, 2024. (Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic)McCormick started the 200-page ruling with the question ""Was the richest person in the world overpaid?"" By the end of the document, her answer was yes.McCormick wrote that Musk ""dominated the process that led to board approval of his compensation plan"" and that his attorneys ""were unable to prove that the stockholder vote was fully informed because the proxy statement inaccurately described key directors as independent and misleadingly omitted details about the process.""


After McCormick's ruling, Musk simply posted on X, formerly Twitter: ""Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware."" Another matter up for a vote at Tesla's annual meeting happens to be moving Tesla's legal home to Texas from Delaware.Related: Some Tesla Factory Workers Realized They Were Laid Off When Security Scanned Their Badges and Sent Them Back on ShuttlesTesla framed the Delaware ruling as the court ""second-guessing"" the decision of shareholders.""Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value,"" the proxy statement read. Musk did sell $23 billion in Tesla stock in 2022 and has about 238 million of his 411 million Tesla shares pledged to secure personal loans.


Tesla claims that shareholders are more aware of the conflicts of interest and process undertaken to arrive at the 2018 pay package because the legal case in Delaware publicized these details.Tesla's annual meeting will happen on June 13 at 3:30 p.m. Central Time.

A 3D printer already in use at Microsoft, Ford, and NASA is now commercially available — and it runs on some 3D printed parts itself.Formlabs, a 3D printing company with a unicorn valuation of $2 billion, launched its first new printer in five years on Wednesday: the Form 4.A Formlabs rep told Entrepreneur that the new printer can churn out up to 400 models every hour and that anyone can learn how to use the printer in 15 minutes. Formlabs CEO and co-founder Max Lobovsky positioned the printer as a leap ahead for ""the entire 3D printing world"" because of its accuracy and ease of use, which beta testers at major companies have verified.

A Formlabs spokesperson confirmed to Entrepreneur that the company incorporated ""several"" 3D printed parts into the final design of the Form 4. These parts were 3D printed on a previous generation of Formlabs printers: the $2,500 Form 3+.Formlabs put Form 4 to the test against the standard manufacturing process and found that the 3D printer produced more plastic goods in slightly less time — with no observable difference in the end.The fast production time means that the printer could more easily expand the current use of 3D printing, taking the technology from prototypes and small parts to mass-produced sellable goods like toys and kitchenware that consumers could buy in stores one day.A vegetable peeler printed by the Form 4.

Dentists, meanwhile, are using it to create retainers for patients.Mark Honschke, prototyping lead at Microsoft, said that Form 4 was Microsoft's ""go-to"" for engineering projects because of its output and speed.Formlabs' major competitors are BigRep, Shapeways, and Markforged, according to CB Insights. BigRep collaborated with carmaker Audi to create a 3D-printed car seat and Shapeways secured major contracts in the automotive and transportation industries last year.Startups have already begun using 3D printers in the real world to create everything from homes to shoes, with construction company Icon creating the world's largest community of 3D-printed homes in Texas.Related: I Designed My Dream Home For Free With an AI Architect — Here's How It WorksNike is using the technology to create prototypes of custom sneakers, the company confirmed last week.Footwear startup Zellerfeld, which recently collaborated on a 3D-printed sneaker with Louis Vuitton, has made ""no factory, no waste"" 3D-printed shoes the core of its business.The Form 4 working on a print.

The New York Times tested the Bambu Lab X1 Carbon ($1,200), the Bambu Lab P1P ($700), and the Prusa MK4 ($1,100) and found that they were all able to print faster than expected.The $169 Ender 3 was the most popular 3D printer sold on Amazon at the time of writing.The Form 4 can be purchased through Formlabs starting Wednesday. Packages start at $4,500 and go up to $8,700.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent employees a memo about the layoffs late Sunday evening.


 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Tesla told staff it was laying off more than 10% of its workforce on Sunday night, but some workers didn't realize they were laid off until they showed up at the company's facilities, five current or former workers told Business Insider.



The cuts impacted engineers and production associates alike. At Tesla's factory in Sparks, Nevada, workers faced a roughly two-hour line to get into the facility on Monday morning as a result of badge checks, one worker said.At the factory, the security team was scanning the badges of workers coming out of the shuttles that ferry people between the factory and nearby parking lots, said two current Tesla workers who requested anonymity since they weren't authorized to speak about the matter. Typically, security guards inspect workers' badges at the site, but they don't usually scan them directly, the two workers said. On Monday morning, the officials picked out the workers who'd been laid off and sent them back in separate vans, the two workers said.


Three other former Tesla employees said workers at the Fremont factory were told by security that if their badges didn't work, they were no longer employed.Tesla employees who were terminated received notice via their personal emails on Sunday night, and their access to Tesla systems was revoked, four workers said. The companywide email that Elon Musk sent announcing the cuts was delivered shortly before midnight PT on Sunday, according to a time stamp on the memo viewed by BI.""We have done a thorough review of the organization and made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount globally. Unfortunately as a result, your position has been eliminated by this restructuring,"" read a separate email notifying impacted employees they'd been laid off, according to a copy viewed by BI.The email sent directly to laid-off staff said the cuts would be effective immediately and workers would receive information regarding their severance within 48 hours.


The same day Tesla announced layoffs, at least two executives resigned from the company. The senior vice president of powertrain and electrical engineering, Drew Baglino, and the vice president of public policy and business development, Rohan Patel, said on X they had left Tesla as of Sunday.A spokesperson for Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment. Ahead of the layoffs, Tesla employed more than 140,000 workers globally, including over 3,000 at its factory in Nevada.Tesla workers aren't the first to unceremoniously discover they've been terminated while trying to access their former place of work. Last year, some former Google employees told BI they learned they'd been laid off when they couldn't badge into the office.

Despite many employers mandating that employees come back into the office, some workers who experienced remote work during the pandemic are never going back.Now, many of these remote workers are taking the opportunity to move to places better suited for the work-from-home life.A new report from global HR platform Remote.com examined 100 popular remote cities across the globe, ranking them based on factors including the quality of life they provide residents, safety level, internet infrastructure, current economic factors, and more.



Only one U.S. city cracked the top 10 — Portland, Maine.""Immigrant populations have increased diversity of a traditionally hard-to-reach region, so international visitors may feel more at home here than in the rest of Maine,"" the report states. ""Housing costs are on the rise in this coastal town but are still below the national average.""


The next U.S. city comes in at No. 19 (Honolulu, Hawaii, for its ""legendary beaches"" and welcoming remote work policy), followed by No. 20, Des Moines, Iowa, for its ""reasonable housing costs"" and a plethora of breweries (that close early, the report notes).New York City came in at No. 21.The No. 1 city worldwide for remote workers is Madrid, Spain, according to the report, which is ""ever-welcoming"" thanks to its low-income tax rate and ""generous expat visa options"" meant to attract freelance and remote workers.The average cost of living for a single person in Madrid without rent monthly is around $804, according to the most recent data from Numeo. The city is an estimated 49.5% cheaper (without rent) than New York City.

43,Renowned Psychologist Adam Grant Says This 3-Step Leadership Method Will Help Fight Employee Burnout,"Apr 16, 2024",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/adam-grant-these-3-steps-will-help-fight-employee-burnout/472803,"
Let's face it — U.S. workers are burned out.Research from Aflac on the stress levels of U.S.-based workers found that over 50% of respondents experienced burnout in 2023, and nearly 75% reported having moderate stress levels at work.But organizational psychologist and bestselling author Adam Grant, a go-to expert for mindset and organizational habits, says that leaders in the workplace are to blame, not burned-out employees.



Adam Grant onstage during a panel at the 2022 Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Summit (Brian Stukes/Getty Images)""I think about burnout as a sense of emotional exhaustion that's both persistent and impairing, meaning it's not just a blip — it sticks. It also interferes with your ability to function,"" Grant told Entrepreneur at BetterUp's Uplift conference last week. ""It's a structural and cultural problem if you have more than one person burning out. That is a challenge to tackle in your organization that leaders need to be responsible for.""


Related: 5 Ways Leaders Can Fight Burnout CultureAs the issue of burnout continues to plague employees and their employers, Grant, a Wharton professor, said the solution is to focus on what he calls the ""demand, control, support"" method of leadership that can help employees find meaning and motivation in their work — and tackle burnout in the process.Grant broke down his strategy for us below using data from Return to Office Insights researched by BetterUp Labs.DemandGrant says leaders need to examine what the demands are that are causing burnout in the first place.


""That has to do with overload, that's having too much work, it's having work that doesn't have clear expectations, it's being expected to be on 24/7,"" Grant says. ""Those kinds of demands are taxing. We need to figure out if there are pockets of people who are burning out with similar kinds of work — that's a sign to me that the demands are excessive.""Reducing demands can mean anything from hiring more staff to delegating responsibilities, but the end goal should always be to make employee demands ""more manageable.""ControlBut sometimes demands can't be eliminated. For example, if you work at a startup and customers are placing orders from all around the world, eliminating hours might not work. Instead, Grant says companies can give employees more control over their day.""What we can do is to try to give more choice and more freedom around how you manage those demands,"" Grant explains. ""We want to give people control over what they're working on, when they do it, who they do it with how they get it done. And those sources of autonomy tend to make demands more manageable is the general finding."" 


Grant also said that today's employees prefer controlling their office hours and want to have a more flexible work environment. Offering this control back to the employees could be effective in mitigating burnout.""There's been a lot of discussion about where we work as a form of flexibility. My read of the evidence is that people want discretion over when they work more than where they work,"" Grant explained. ""So if you give people the flexibility to set their own hours, they are very happy to come to the office, if that's a tug of war.""SupportGrant says ""support"" is about ""giving people the tools that they need to cope with demands"" in the workplace and making mental health a priority.""It's also about building a culture where [employees] feel that they can be candid about their emotional well-being and seek help if they need it,"" he said.But telling employees that you prioritize mental health and actually making them feel comfortable talking about it are two different things, he says.The most effective way to combat this, he says, is when a leader sets an example and is open about needing to take time off for mental health reasons and fostering an open dialogue amongst employees when they're struggling.""I think modeling that makes it clear to people at all levels that this is not just lip service, we're not just claiming that you can take care of yourself, we're actually demonstrating through our own behavior that it's acceptable and encouraged around here,"" Grant says. ""It's been frustrating to watch a lot of companies say, alright, we have a burnout problem, we're going to give you mindfulness training or we're going to teach you stress management skills as if this is not a psychological problem.""

44,The 'Silver Tsunami' Meets 'Golden Handcuffs' as Past Low Mortgage Rates Lock in Homeowners — Whether They Like It or Not,"Apr 15, 2024",Sherin Shibu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/low-rate-mortgages-form-golden-handcuffs-around-homeowners/472717,"
The silver tsunami, or the expected increase of homes on the market as baby boomers downsize, could be slowed by golden handcuffs.The New York Times reported on Monday that by the end of last year, there was more than a 3% gap between rates on new home loans and the average fixed rate on existing mortgages.About 70% of homeowners had mortgage rates of around 4%, according to The Times, which is significantly lower than the current market rate of about 7%.Related: A 'Silver Tsunami' Is About to Upend the Housing Market, Says Analyst Who Accurately Predicted the 2008 Financial CrisisThe gap between the current rate and the average incentivizes homeowners to hold on to their properties, locking them in with ""golden handcuffs"" or a financial reason to stay.



The effect is noticeable: The Federal Housing Finance Agency found that the mortgage rate lock-in stopped 1.33 million home sales from happening from mid-2022 to the end of 2023, reducing home sales by 57%. The shortage of supply, combined with population growth outpacing construction, has led to a 7.2 million home shortage, per Realtor estimates.Boomers, who were expected to start downsizing their living spaces as early as this year and flood the housing market with homes in a silver tsunami, are instead holding onto their larger residences.""We just don't want to pay that much in interest,"" finance professor Bob Wood, 66, told CNBC. Wood and his wife are in the 10th year of a 3.125% 15-year fixed mortgage on their 5,000-square-foot Alabama home.Another couple, both over 70 years of age and empty nesters, told CNN Business that they're ""staying put"" in their 3,000 square-foot, 5-bedroom California home.


Related: Barbara Corcoran Says 'Now Is the Best Time' to Buy as Home Prices Will Soon Go 'Through the RoofA Realtor survey from last year showed that 82% of homeowners who wanted to sell their existing home and buy a new one felt locked into keeping their homes because of the difference in mortgage rates. More than half said they were waiting for rates to come down before selling.""One positive aspect that came out of the pandemic was historically low mortgage rates – and many people took advantage of this opportunity to buy their first home, upgrade to a more expensive home, or refinance the home they were in,"" said Realtor Chief Economist Danielle Hale in the report. ""Unfortunately, this comes with a bit of a catch-22, as homeowners who locked in a 30-year fixed rate in the 2-3% range don't necessarily want to give that up in exchange for a rate in the 6-7% range.""The locked-in homeowners were also less willing to relocate for work, with Bloomberg highlighting last week that manager recruits based in the Midwest were turning down jobs in the South with salaries of $250,000, in part to hold on to their low-interest mortgages.

As post-pandemic travel continues to ramp up, airports are booked and busy.In fact, a new report by the Airports Council International released on Monday found that 2023 saw a total global passenger footprint of roughly 8.5 billion people, up 27.2% year-over-year and a recovery rate of 93.8% from pre-pandemic rankings in 2019.The report revealed the preliminary rankings of the busiest airports in the world for 2023, and a new international hot spot has worked its way up to No. 2.



After gathering data from over 2,600 airports in over 180 countries and territories, the No. 1 busiest airport in the world is still Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Atlanta has held down the top spot for over 20 years, thanks to high passenger volume and Delta Airlines being headquartered in the city, catering to over 104.6 million passengers this past year.Related: What Are the World's Busiest Airports?

Less than two weeks after Tesla announced its first year-over-year delivery drop since 2020, CEO Elon Musk sent an internal email to staff stating that the company would cut at least 10% of its global workforce.Musk's memo, sent at close to midnight PST on Sunday in California, explained that ""there has been duplication of roles and job functions in certain areas"" and that the layoffs would happen ""for cost reductions and increasing productivity.""Tesla executives, including senior vice president Drew Bagliano and policy chair Rohan Patel, also announced on Monday that they were leaving the company. Patel told TechCrunch that he chose to leave because of ""[b]ig overall changes"" at Tesla.Elon Musk, owner of Tesla and the X (formerly Twitter) platform.

Tesla employees shared rumors of layoffs as high as 20% with Electrek on Sunday.Musk's email confirmed that the percentage was ""more than 10%"" without specifically stating how many employees will be affected.Tesla had 140,473 employees globally as of December 31, according to its 2023 annual report, meaning that at least 14,000 people will be impacted.Related: Tesla Sales, Deliveries Drop for First Time Since 2020Bloomberg reported in February that Tesla asked managers if each of their employees' jobs were critical to the company, sparking layoff fears. Tesla also decided not to give merit-based stock bonuses last year.Tesla last laid off 27 employees in Buffalo, New York in February 2023.Related: 'Next Tesla' Electric Car Startups Hit Speed Bump: 'Investors Want To See Demand'The layoffs follow Tesla's report in early April that deliveries declined 8.5% year-over-year because of factors like factory shutdowns.

With this rapid growth there has been duplication of roles and job functions in certain areas. As we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity.As part of this effort, we have done a thorough review of the organization and made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by more than 10% globally. There is nothing I hate more, but it must be done. This will enable us to be lean, innovative and hungry for the next growth phase cycle.I would like to thank everyone who is departing Tesla for their hard work over the years. I'm deeply grateful for your many contributions to our mission and we wish you well in your future opportunities. It is very difficult to say goodbye.For those remaining, I would like to thank you in advance for the difficult job that remains ahead. We are developing some of the most revolutionary technologies in auto, energy and artificial intelligence. As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, your resolve will make a huge difference in getting us there.Thanks,Elon

The extension only applies to the filing, not to the balance — so even with an extension, taxpayers still have to pay what they owe by the April 15 deadline or face added late fees and penalties.The IRS predicted that about 19 million Americans will file for an extension this year.Related: 'It's Time': Mark Cuban Is Leaving 'Shark Tank'

This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Squatters have taken over one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants in London.At least six people are residing in York & Albany, an eatery connected to the eponymous hotel in Camden Town, according to The Sun and BBC.York & Albany is temporarily closed while Ramsay, 57, finalizes a new lease, The Sun reported.It's unclear when the squatters first arrived. Metropolitan Police told Business Insider they ""were made aware of squatters at a disused property"" on April 10 in Regents Park, where the restaurant is located.



The outlets reported that the group had locked themselves inside the building, boarded up the windows, and are threatening legal action against those attempting to remove them.Photo of York & Albany in London. Google Maps via BIPhotos obtained by the outlets showed a ""legal warning"" taped to one of the restaurant's doors. It was signed by ""The Occupiers.""


""Take notice that we occupy this property and at all times there is at least one person in occupation,"" the notice reads. ""That any entry or attempt to enter into these premises without our permission is therefore a criminal offence as any one of us who is in physical possession is opposed to such entry without our permission.""The legal warning said the group will take legal action against those who ""enter by violence"" or ""threaten to enter by violence.""The notice read, ""LASPO does NOT apply,"" referring to the 2012 Legal Aid, Sentencing, and Punishment Offenders Act. Under LASPO, occupying a non-residential building is not a crime. So the squatters are claiming the law allows them to be there.Ramsay called local authorities about the property but has so far failed to have the squatters removed, the outlets reported.Metropolitan Police in London told Business Insider that this issue ""is a civil matter and so police did not attend as an emergency call out.""""However we in the process of identifying if any subsequent offences have occurred, and will take action where appropriate,"" it said.Gordon Ramsay in April 2024. Stu Forster/Getty Images via BI


While it's unconfirmed what the group intends to do with the space, BBC reported that two Instagram accounts — Autonomous Winter Shelter and Camden Art Cafe — have described it as a ""new squatted community space.""In a statement posted on the Camden Art Cafe Instagram account, the group said that they plan to open the doors regularly to visitors.The group said that Camden is one of the areas in London with the biggest wealth disparities, ""so it seems only fitting that £13 million properties that most locals would never be able to afford to visit should be opened up to all.""""At a time when Camden market has been bought out by a billionaire and many longstanding local businesses are being evicted from their units, it's even more important that we all band together in all the forms of resistance that we know and can,"" it added.


Camden Art Cafe's Instagram appeared to share photos of the restaurant's interior.""An autonomous cafe in the heart of Camden committed to providing free food and creating a space for the community,"" its bio read.Gordon Ramsay on ""Kitchen Nightmares"" in June 2023. FOX/Getty Images via BI


Ramsay became attached to the property in 2007 when director Gary Love leased it to him on a 25-year term with a yearly rent of £640,000, or about $797,000, the outlets report.Ramsay tried to get out of the lease in 2015 but lost the legal battle.The property was listed in late 2023 with a guide price of £13 million, or more than $16 million, according to the outlets.Representatives for Ramsay and York & Albany did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BI.Other stories about squatters have made headlines this year.In New York City, a couple cannot move into the $2 million home they purchased because of a squatter who refuses to vacate the property. The couple sued the squatter to evict him, but he countersued for harassment.Outlets reported later that month that squatters had lived in a Beverly Hills mansion for five months. The group was evicted but did not face any criminal charges.

A new survey from Empower, the second largest retirement provider in the U.S., found that of 1,000 Americans surveyed, nearly two-thirds think the current economy will impact their ability to retire — and nearly half of respondents (46%) were willing to take a pay cut or give up a raise for more retirement benefits.In comparison, 50% of respondents said they would do the same for remote work options, and 37% said they would for more paid time off.Rising inflation and correspondingly higher prices for everyday goods and services have the majority of Americans (70%) feeling uncertain financially, according to the report.

The Masters is arguably the most-anticipated of golf's four Majors, and tens of thousands are expected to fill the crowds this week at Augusta National in Georgia to take in the experience and revel in the tournament's atmosphere.The tournament's food is also famous, and prices have remained the same for decades — shocking, considering the sky-high concession prices at other sports venues.And though talks of inflation had many nervous about potential price increases, it looks like inflation has yet to hit the tournament.Related: The Masters Merch Scene Is a Feeding Frenzy Unlike Anything I've Ever Seen BeforeThis year, attendees of the Masters 2024 have been happy to find that the beloved Pimento Cheese sandwich is still priced at $1.50 and beers only increased a dollar to $6 a pop, according to Golf Week.

      Key Takeaways    



        The Masters is this week. You know what that means: an opportunity for attendees to buy merch.
      


        Items with the Masters logo have become elite status symbols.
      


        If you went to the Masters and didn't buy a mountain of swag to show off, did you truly go?

Patrons at the Masters lug around multiple bags of merch, which can include the hottest item of them all: the Masters garden gnome.


 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. When the Masters golf tournament started this Thursday, those watching on TV were treated to the usual assortment of visuals: lush green grass, immaculate flower beds, and the world's greatest players putting on a show.



But an even fiercer competition will be raging behind the scenes: the battle for authentic Masters merch.Sure, seeing superstars like Tiger Woods and Scottie Scheffler in person is cool. But so is loading up on gear emblazoned with the Masters' famous yellow logo, which has become a cultlike beacon of status.


I had the good fortune of attending a Monday practice round for the Masters and could see the merch fervor up close and personal.When I showed up at Augusta National Golf Club with my family (shout-out to my dad, who secured the tickets after a decade-plus of lottery attempts), I quickly noticed the number of people already heading for the exit. They each had six to eight bags stuffed with shirts, hats, and towels, and many had the most highly sought-after item of them all: the Masters garden gnome.A close-up of the highly sought-after garden gnome. Christian Petersen via BI


The tournament allows for one reentry a day, so it's possible those people were going to drop their merch off in their car. But it wasn't lost on me that they might be part of a legion of resellers who make thousands marking up and flipping authentic items. To get an idea of how lucrative that can be, check out this 2023 Masters gnome listed for $1,200 on eBay. (Original price: $50.)Once we made our way further up the entry path, we saw the start of the line. It stretched back 50 feet from the actual entrance, which was followed by a series of winding metal gates reminiscent of a TSA checkpoint. Directly in front of the entrance, there was a sea of people standing shoulder to shoulder, trudging along, trying to make their way to the actual course. It reminded me of going between stages at a music festival. I would've snapped a picture of the hubbub, but the Masters' no-phone rule made it difficult to document the journey.Being in the main line feels a lot like waiting for a ride at Disney. Once you enter the building, there's a huge room and corridor with gates snaking around. The line seems to extend at every turn. What's another 20 minutes when that sweet merch is within grasp?After roughly 45 minutes, we made it to the actual shop. The final step is to wait for about five minutes in an entryway before they let in a new flood of shoppers.


Once you're inside, the mania is overwhelming. There are separate alcoved sections for men, women, and kids. A giant houseware display sits in the center of the store. Countless shirts and hats are displayed on the wall and busy workers rush to fetch items from bins stacked high with various sizes.There are several checkout lines, each with at least five registers on either side. The cashiers crank through piles of merch, run credit cards, then move on to the next. It's an impressive assembly line of capitalism.I ended up purchasing a polo shirt, a T-shirt, a hat, and a cup. Compared to almost everyone else around me, it felt like a meager haul, and I wound up toting around just a single bag for the rest of the day.A sea of people near the entrance of the Masters golf shop on Tuesday. Ben Jared via BIThe whole experience left me feeling like the Masters has become a retail juggernaut that just so happens to put on a golf tournament. And the numbers bear that out: The 2022 tournament raked in $69 million in revenue from merch, per Forbes, which was far more than it made from tickets and concessions.Attendance figures aren't made public, but the consensus is that about 40,000 people attend the tournament each day, which works out to each visitor spending an average of $246 at the merch store.But that assumes endless supply. A guy I met at my hotel said that last year, the store had to stop selling merchandise by Friday because of depleted inventory. It's also possible people are less merch-obsessed from Thursday to Sunday when the actual golf tournament is going on, so the Monday-through-Wednesday practice-round crowd could be driving up that average.


It seems more likely that the typical patron is ponying up even more than $246 — the people carrying six bags were surely toting five figures worth of swag.So in the end, what's it all for? The answer is pretty straightforward: street cred and status. Golf is already an expensive sport largely played by the affluent. For one to stand out in that already elite crowd, extreme measures must be taken. Lines must be waited in, and hundreds (thousands?) must be shelled out.Now if you'll excuse me, I need to head to the store wearing my new Masters hat.

On Friday, Bloomberg reported that Adobe's AI image generator Firefly included AI images from competitors in its training data — a case of AI learning from AI.The report brought a new dimension to Adobe's claims of Firefly's ethicality. In public-facing articles, Adobe differentiated Firefly from competitors like DALL·E 3, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney by emphasizing Firefly's ""commercially safe"" training data.""Adobe has established the AI ethics principles of accountability, responsibility, and transparency,"" Adobe wrote in one post.Related: Getty Images Has Started Legal Proceedings Against an AI Generative Art Company For Copyright InfringementFirefly drew from licensed Adobe Stock images, the company explained, plus images in the public domain. Adobe even created a bonus compensation plan for artists whose work went into the first release of Firefly.



Some of those artists submitted images generated by Midjourney and other rival AI, and were compensated by Adobe for their input, according to Bloomberg's report.Symbol of an ouroboros, or serpent eating its own tail, generated by Adobe Firefly in response to Entrepreneur's prompt: ""A snake is eating its own tail in an infinity symbol against a background with mountains, trees and cloudy sky."" Credit: Adobe FireflyThough the artists had to note that their work was created with AI, they did not have to tell Adobe which generator they used.


This means that, even if Firefly isn't actively scraping the Internet without permission, AI image generators like Midjourney might be. And Firefly could be trained on those Midjourney images.Related: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Says AI Could Impact 'Every Job'Multiple Adobe employees told Bloomberg about an internal clash over the ethics of training Adobe's AI with AI-generated images from rivals. Even in the early stages of developing Firefly, some employees disagreed with the company's decision to include AI images in Firefly's training data.In Adobe Stock, the database used to train Firefly, 57 million are labeled AI-generated, per Bloomberg. That's 14% of the total images in the database.Adobe responded to the claims by stating that only 5% of the images used to train Firefly came from AI images created by other platforms.""Every image submitted to Adobe Stock, including a very small subset of images generated with AI, goes through a rigorous moderation process to ensure it does not include IP, trademarks, recognizable characters or logos, or reference artists' names,"" a company spokesperson told Bloomberg.Related: OpenAI Reportedly Used More Than a Million Hours of YouTube Videos to Train Its Latest AI ModelThe race to develop the next big AI has intensified the pressure companies face to find new sources of training data.

The Jaxenor prefabricated home was priced at around $35,000 earlier this year but dropped to $11,550 as of Thursday.The tiny home, which comes folded neatly in a box and expands outward, weighs nearly 8,000 pounds and requires that the buyer prepare a crane to unload it.Related: Barbara Corcoran Says 'Now Is the Best Time' to Buy as Home Prices Will Soon Go 'Through the Roof'Advertised as a possible backyard guest house, office, or workshop, the home was listed at the time of writing as Amazon's No. 1 bestseller in garden houses.Jaxenor Tiny Home.

The design incorporates multiple windows and folds back up if the buyer wants to move the unit.With home prices on the rise and inflation increasing faster than expected, potential home buyers are expressing interest in tiny homes.Youtuber Unspeakable, who has 17.2 million subscribers, posted a video two months ago where he and his friends unboxed an Amazon tiny home.Last week, he documented spending 24 hours in the tiny home and found that even when a tree fell on the house, the house still stood, though the tree created a dent in the roof. The house did not seem to be fully waterproof though, with leaks forming when the Unspeakable team blasted it with snow.Unspeakable's unboxing video of the home also received over 13.6 million views on both YouTube and X, now Twitter, inspiring reactions such as, ""This is just about the only house I will ever be able to afford.""Their home, which is listed as the Chery Industrial Expandable Prefab House, was $18,000 with a $1,000 coupon on Amazon at the time of writing — a drop from its $40,000 price tag in January, according to Keepa statistics pulled by Entrepreneur.

Holding a phone is so last year.Humane's Ai Pin, a wearable smartphone alternative that works as an AI personal assistant, is now widely available in the U.S. starting Thursday.The Pin has generated a lot of hype, promising an AI smartphone alternative that helps users be more present. It was one of TIME's best inventions of 2023.



The futuristic wearable fastens magnetically onto clothing and becomes a voice-activated AI assistant, like a faster Siri or Alexa, that can make calls, send texts, take notes, and find answers to complex questions.It costs $699 or $799 depending on the color and requires a $24 per month service plan through Humane, in partnership with T-Mobile's 4G network. The plan includes unlimited talk, text, and data with a dedicated phone number.

Photo Credit: Angel Garcia/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesHumane's husband-wife co-founders, Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno said the Ai Pin is the first step to a screenless future.""We like to say that the experience is screenless, seamless, and sensing, allowing you to access the power of compute while remaining present in your surroundings,"" Chaudhri said during an April 2023 TED talk that's been viewed 3.5 million times.It's powered by technology from ChatGPT-creator OpenAI and backed by Microsoft's cloud computing services.


Chaudhri, who worked as Apple's director of design for over 20 years, and Bongiorno, who was Apple's software engineering director for over 8 years, began conceptualizing the Ai Pin in 2017.Related: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Says AI Could Impact 'Every Job' in Annual Shareholder LetterInstead of a screen, the Ai Pin beams a Laser Ink projection on a user's palm, which they can then control with a series of hand gestures.A built-in camera on the device helps users capture moments and even get calorie estimates for food right in front of them. If a user asks ""What am I looking at?"" the Pin's camera will look at the scene and identify objects in it, which could be useful for sightseeing. Right now the Pin can also take 15-second HD videos.

It also noted that asking about the weather required listening to an audio response before the Pin projected more details and that typing out a Wi-Fi password was ""not only a pain but near impossible"" and required extra steps.The Washington Post pointed out that texting was tricky on the Pin, with some messages not going through as intended, and wrote that the device tends to overheat.But Bongiorno is optimistic.""As with all gen 1 products, this is just the starting point,"" Bongiorno posted on X on Thursday.Related: OpenAI Reportedly Used More Than a Million Hours of YouTube Videos to Train Its Latest AI Model

      Key Takeaways    



        Daniel Bennett is a self-proclaimed ""personality hire.""
      


        When applying for his first job, he focused on making his interviewers like him rather than trying to impress them. 
      


        Personality hires are important for building company culture, he says.

Daniel Bennett explains why personality hires like himself are so important for companies.


 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Daniel Bennett, the 28-year-old founder of DX Creative, a social consulting agency, and a former advertising account manager. The following has been edited for length and clarity.



I was a ""personality hire.""When I was interviewing for my first corporate job at a giant advertising agency in LA called TBWA\Chiat\Day, my goal going into it was to make the interviewers like me — that was it.


I wasn't there to impress them or show them that I could learn or whatever. I thought, ""If I can make them laugh and smile and have a good time, that's going to be more memorable than someone who can recite all of their accolades.""Because it was an ad agency in LA, there was a basketball court in the office, and their first question was, ""Did you see the basketball court behind you?""My opening line in the interview was, ""Yeah, I was taking warmup shots for this interview before you guys came. Am I sweaty?"" They loved that; they were laughing their asses off.I ended up beating out two people with three or four years of experience, even though I had zero experience.


Difference between a personality hire and a good personalityThere's a difference between a personality hire and someone who just has a good personality.Imagine walking into work with your coffee, and the personality hire says, ""You're never going to guess who I ran into this weekend!""A normal person might keep that information to themselves, but a personality hire will want to entertain the office with their hilarious story of running into an ex.We can get away with doing less workAs a personality hire, you can get away with not being as competent and doing half of your job. (I'm not that kind of person, but there are personality hires like that.)


Does that mean that someone else picks up the slack? Probably. But that's up to the company's discretion to decide whether they keep you.There are certain people who perhaps don't crush tests or can't build a marketing rollout but are very successful in their roles because they're street smart. Maybe a personality hire has a lot of connections and always ""knows a guy"" who can get you into a restaurant that's booked out for six months, which could result in closing a deal. But maybe that person doesn't know how to write a brief.Those ""know a guy"" skills really come in handy with careers that are built around relationship management, which is more meaningful than being good at sending emails.Still, if you're just a personality hire and do absolutely no work, you will get fired.Despite being a personality hire, I still worked hard; I worked 60 hours a week and was up until 1 a.m. so we could finish a commercial.In those instances, personality hires' positive attitudes help. Cracking jokes with your coworkers at 1 a.m. on a deadline makes it much more bearable than everyone being miserable.Being a personality hire allowed me to call in favorsIn the office, I was the one who said, ""Guys, we have an hour in between meetings. Let's go walk and get lunch!"" Or ""Let's go grab a smoothie."" Or, ""This place is having happy hour after work. Are you coming?"" It's those little things that some companies would call team bonding.As a low-level account assistant, I did all the grunt work, like organizing files and picking up hard drives.


But I was always good at walking around the office and talking to different people to build relationships; instead of sending a Slack message or an email, I would go up and ask them.I've always thought that if I need a favor from someone, they're way more likely to help me out if I've gone up to them and said hi, rather than just sent them an email and never talked to them.The world runs on favors, and you don't do favors for people that you don't like.If I needed a quick edit on a design or a billboard, I could call in a favor to a designer, and they'd be willing to work with me on it on a tight deadline.


Companies need personality hires to build their company cultureCompanies that take pride in having ""disruptive"" and different work cultures need personality hires because otherwise, who's going to build that culture?It may be controversial to say, but employees without outgoing personalities aren't going to build your company culture — non-personality hires aren't as fun at parties and don't provide office gossip. For Gen Zs and millennials, there are other motivators for going to work than just doing the work.Personality hires can also help companies attract good talent by providing the energy that makes other people want to come work at your company.Personality hires play an important role in building company culture, Bennett says. Daniel Bennett via BIRelationship-building is extremely important in industries such as entertainment, sales, and consulting. Making money is often dependent on people having a mutual likeness.In these industries, personality hires could bring more value than employees who just do the actual work.As a boss, I try to hire people with good personalitiesAfter two years at TBWA\Chiat\Day, I quit and went on to launch DX Creative, a social agency helping artists, celebrities, and brands with short-form content and consulting, in 2021.


When I'm considering who to bring onto my team, I'm way more likely to extend an offer to someone if I like them.Because we work directly with talent and celebrities, we need people who can be friends with them. There's a lot of travel involved, so imagine traveling with someone that you don't like. That would piss people off, so we need people who will vibe with the artist they're working with.We look for people with good personalities who either can be taught in a very short time or have the experience we can mold into what we need.Ultimately, being a personality hire doesn't mean you're bad at your job; it just means your personality helped you get hired.

60,The Franchise Industry is on The Verge of Massive Change With Private Equity's Potential $8 Billion Acquisition of Jersey Mike's,"Apr 11, 2024",Alicia Miller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/private-equitys-potential-8-billion-acquisition-of-jersey/472394,"
Private equity has successfully cherry-picked most top franchise brands with enough scale to attract professional investors. Jersey Mike's and Subway are two high-profile holdouts. Last year, Subway announced it would be acquired by Roark Capital for an expected $9.5 billion, but the deal still hasn't closed and has attracted Federal Trade Commission scrutiny. Rumors are now swirling that Jersey Mike's is also considering a sale to PE firm Blackstone for a possible $8 billion.Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now to find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.Could Jersey Mike's sell?Jersey Mike's is a growth story with strong unit-level economics. There is plenty of untapped growth in the US market and the international plan has yet to come together. Its owner, Peter Cancro, remains heavily involved in the business and has built an admirable customer following and entrepreneurial culture. Whereas Subway is being sold by the estates of the shareholders, Cancro is making the very personal decision about whether to bring in a partner. We can probably credit the sale of Jimmy John's to Roark in 2019 for getting Cancro's mental gears turning about PE valuations. Jersey Mike's is the second largest sub-style sandwich brand. According to Technomic, its sales have tripled since 2019 reaching $3.3 billion in 2023. Cancro still has ambitious growth goals for Jersey Mike's. Will a big PE firm such as Blackstone get to participate in that next growth wave?Cancro's ambivalence about a PE transaction is apparent via his press interviews. He's avoided PE for years. The culture he's built is personally very important to him. And Jersey Mike's doesn't need PE investment to grow. Great cash flow has already supported $980 million in whole business securitization. According to Jersey Mike's 2024 Franchise Disclosure Document, distributions of $215 million (in 2023), $173 million (in 2022), and $143 million (in 2021) were paid in just the last three years. Cash flow could instead be used to fund acquisitions.



Related: Find Out Which Brands Have Ranked on the Franchise 500 for Longest, Earning a Spot In our New 'Hall of Fame'Jersey Mike's: The culture questionIs it worth Cancro giving up majority control now? An $8 billion valuation is certainly tempting. Today many new franchises are launched to quickly ""flip"" the business to private equity. Jersey Mike's is one of the remaining large-scale, as-yet-unaffiliated brands built during a time when culture came first. That Cancro appears to be seriously contemplating a PE transaction is therefore more of a watershed franchising moment than Subway's estate sale to Roark. When PE takes majority control, the culture changes. Sometimes that change is good for franchisees, employees, vendors, and customers, and sometimes not. Culture isn't much discussed in the Subway acquisition. But the culture question looms large over Cancro's decision about whether to let in a partner.Rumors have been swirling about Jersey Mike's potentially making brand acquisitions to give franchisees more expansion options. Cancro has the entrepreneurial drive and proven ability to grow iconic brands. My gut tells me that if Cancro brings in a PE partner now, the story and intention will be about more — such as building a platform — rather than just a big equity sale.


It is heartening to see a founder wrestle with this decision. Many smaller brands today rush into the arms of private equity as fast as they can find a buyer. Jersey Mike's presents an example of admirable entrepreneurial spirit in the face of undeniable change now that PE is so active in franchising.Related: How Immigrating From Argentina to the Bronx at 11 Prepared Her For Life as a FranchiseeSubway and RoarkSubway is still a major fix-it project. It has a known global brand and lots of room for growth but, especially in the US, franchisees are fed up with low profitability. Subway's franchisee association recently hired a well-known attorney to push management on a slew of issues of concern to franchisees. If Roark is having second thoughts about paying billions for this fix-it project, it hasn't shown — yet.If Roark follows through, it's betting on a turnaround. First, it will keep management focused on engaging top franchisees, pushing remodels and improving operations, marketing, and menus to drive same-store sales growth. Next, I anticipate them opening as many international units as possible to offset hundreds — if not thousands — of closures yet to come in the US market. Roark, one of the most prolific users of whole business securitization (debt backed by royalties and rebates), will also immediately put up to $5 billion of debt on the business and partially repay investors via big distributions.Subway's management is aggressively pushing the costly remodel issue again with franchisees. The message lands with a predictable thud, especially in the face of massive shareholder wealth about to be created via the PE transaction. Corporate also has plenty of cash (an estimated $725 million annual EBITDA) to help fund improvements, whereas many franchisees operate on razor-thin margins.While I expect the Subway/Roark transaction to close, I also wouldn't be surprised if Roark walks away, cuts the price offered, or demands a larger earnout to cement the deal. Roark has more franchising experience than any other PE firm, especially in the restaurant sector. But there's a fine line between bravery and overconfidence. Roark is protective of its reputation and avoids public disagreements with franchisees.


It will be difficult for Roark to stifle public displays of franchisee discontent and ongoing closures will speak for themselves. Since Roark seldom exits its investments, this could end up an uncomfortably visible quagmire, especially if Roark puts too much debt on the business and new units don't open fast enough to offset closures.

The U.S. consumer price index, which measures the cost of goods and services, increased faster than expected in March at an annual inflation rate of 3.5%, according to a March CPI report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on Wednesday.The prices for necessities have gone up, with the average U.S. household paying $227 more per month for goods compared to one year ago.The annual inflation rate recorded in February was lower, at 3.2%.



The agency attributed more than half of the monthly increase in inflation to rising energy and housing prices.

Ozempic seems like a wonder drug that's changing people's lives and could have profound effects on the entire economy.It also seems like it has generated at least a million dollars for David Paton.Paton, it turns out, is one of the two men who wrote ""Magic"" for his band Pilot in 1974, when it became a Top 10 hit. And now a new version of ""Magic"" has become the theme song for Novo Nordisk's Ozempic rollout in the U.S., which is blanketing TV and the internet with this earworm:



Novo Nordisk originally ran a version of Paton's song recorded by someone else but has since leaned into the idea that 70-something Paton is the cheerful face behind its cheerful jingle.Here's a video of Paton strolling into Abbey Road Studios in London to record his own version of the ad:


Paton got paid for both the cover of his song that someone else recorded and the one he did. And Paton isn't the only winner from the Ozempic boom: Novo Nordisk also paid the estate of his former bandmate who cowrote the song, and Sony Publishing, which administers Paton's songwriting catalog.None of them are saying how much money is involved, but The New York Times said it polled music-publishing executives who estimated the campaign was ""most likely worth seven figures to Paton.""All of which illustrates why investors and music companies continue to bid meaningful amounts of money on back catalogs by artists who haven't put out hit music for a long time. That includes deals for superstars you've heard of, like Bruce Springsteen (a reported $500 million), and grab bags of rights to songs from the likes of John Lee Hooker, Pat Boone, and Ricky Nelson ($470 million).This stuff got particularly expensive during the pandemic boom, where all kinds of assets saw their value inflated — at least $5 billion worth of songs traded hands in 2021 alone. But it has kept going post-pandemic.


A big part of the reason is the overall growth of streaming, which has created a new revenue stream for the music industry — if you think streaming volume will increase, then it stands to reason that songs you buy today will be worth more in the future as more people access them.But Paton's story illustrates another reason: Song owners can find ways to monetize their work in movies, TV shows, and commercials. The odds that someone is going to have their song plucked to sell a Big Pharma Wonder Drug aren't very high — because there aren't very many Big Pharma Wonder Drugs, by definition — but if it happens, it's a very big payoff.

66,Those Super Bowl Dunkin' Tracksuits Still Haven't Shipped: 'Communication Has Been Nonexistent',"Apr 10, 2024",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/dunkin-customers-are-still-waiting-on-their-tracksuits/472449,"
The Super Bowl commercial was a hit, with Boston heroes Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Tom Brady stealing the show as a boyband called the ""DunKings"" in Dunkin'-branded tracksuits.Naturally, fans rushed to get their hands on a tracksuit of their own. The matching sets sold out in 19 minutes on the day of Super Bowl LVIII (February 12) and went back on sale again the next day.Customers were told their new swag would ship eight to 10 business days after purchase. But now, it's April, and customers are complaining that the tracksuits have not arrived.

The Google Android equivalent of Apple's Find My network has officially arrived.Google published a blog post on Monday revealing the new, crowdsourced Find My Device network that can help Android users find their devices, including phones and tablets, even offline.The network includes over a billion devices, according to Google, and started rolling out to Android users in the U.S. and Canada on Monday on devices running Android 9+. Google plans a global rollout.

Powerful tech leaders and other public figures have been sounding the alarm on the potential dangers of AI technology for years, including Elon Musk, who has never been silent about the issue.Now, the multi-CEO is alleging that the technology will soon be able to outsmart even the most intelligent of humans.In a livestream interview on Monday on X, which he owns, the billionaire spoke with Nicolai Tangen, the CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, about the potential advancement of AI technology.

Musk also stood alongside fellow tech titans including Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last September at a U.S. government AI summit to discuss the need for regulation.""There's some chance – above zero – that AI will kill us all. I think it's low but there's some chance,"" Musk told reporters following the session. ""The consequences of getting AI wrong are severe.""Whether or not this comes to fruition in the next year will remain to be seen.A recent survey by Tata Consultancy Services of 21 corporate futurists shows that superintelligence is not where most see AI going.


Futurist and author Bernard Marr told CNBC earlier this week that, while we are ""a very long way from AI becoming sentient, if ever,"" AI technology has become ""very, very good at doing things that in the past only humans could do.""

In an interview with CNBC last week, Disney CEO Bob Iger said that a Disney+ password-sharing crackdown will begin in June in the U.S. and in September in other countries.Meanwhile, after streaming rival Netflix began its enforcement of password-sharing restrictions last spring, there was a jump in signups, CNN reported, and 100,000 new accounts signed up in the first two days, per data from Antenna.""Netflix is the gold standard in streaming,"" Iger said in the CNBC interview. ""They've done a phenomenal job and a lot of different directions. I actually have very, very high regard for what they've accomplished. If we can only accomplish what they've accomplished, that would be great.""



Original story from Feb. 1 below:It's the end of an era for Disney+ and Hulu password moochers, as Disney has announced it is going to begin cracking down on password-sharing among subscribers.


On Wednesday, Disney issued a letter to Hulu subscribers stating that it would begin ""adding limitations"" on ""sharing your account outside of your household"" starting March 14.The company also quietly updated its Subscriber Agreement on January 25 to include information about account sharing.Related: Disney Combining Hulu, Disney+ Streaming Platforms""Unless otherwise permitted by your Service Tier, you may not share your subscription outside of your household,"" the new policy states. ""'Household' means the collection of devices associated with your primary personal residence that are used by the individuals who reside therein.""


If subscribers are found in violation of the rule, Hulu ""may limit or terminate access"" to the account.Disney+ and ESPN+ have also updated their Subscriber Agreements to say the same, but there is no date on record of when the document was updated. Disney+ began banning users from password sharing outside of the same household in Canada last October.Related: Disney+ Is Beginning to Crack Down on Password Sharing — in CanadaDisney took operational control and a majority stake in Hulu in 2019 when it acquired 21 Century Fox's assets and began merging Hulu and Disney+ content in May 2023.

""We certainly have established this as a real priority. We actually think that there's an opportunity here to help us grow our business.""Streaming rival Netflix infamously barred password sharing outside of the same household in March 2023, much to the dismay of loyal subscribers.The Walt Disney Co. was down just over 11.3% in a one-year period as of Thursday afternoon.

Spirit Airlines revealed on Monday that it would be furloughing roughly 260 pilots and deferring the delivery of aircraft from Q2 2025 through 2026 until at least 2030 to save money after a rough fiscal year.The airline estimates that the furloughs will help increase the company's liquidity value by $340 million through 2026.

Affluent travelers could have a pretty cushy vacation on Royal Caribbean's giant Icon of the Seas cruise ship.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Are you looking to ball out on your weeklong vacation aboard the world's largest cruise ship? Get ready to pay $200 for dinner and $100,000 for a cabin.Vacations-at-sea can be a fairly affordable vacation option. With most cruise lines, your base fare already includes accommodations, unlimited food, endless activities, and the opportunity to see several destinations in one go.



But as more ""pay-to-play"" amenities show up on board, the more pricey these floating vacations could become. And there's likely no better example of this than Royal Caribbean's new world's largest cruise ship.Forget tiny interior cabins and dinners at the buffet. On the 9,950-person Icon of the Seas, affluent travelers could have a vacation that rivals even the most luxurious small-ship cruise.


Guests interested in luxuriating in one of Icon's 179 suites will be paying a minimum of $4,614 per person for a weeklong sailing.Suites are furnished with high-end toiletries from Malin and Goetz. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderThe mega-ship's high-end suites range from 402 to 2,523 square feet, balconies included.Some come with sweeping views of the AquaTheater. No need to scramble for the best seats when you can watch the show's divers, synchronized swimmers, and aerialists from your couch.


Others, like the floor-to-ceiling window-lined Icon Loft, are spread across two floors.The Icon Loft, shown in a rendering, is 656 square feet, not including the balcony. Royal Caribbean InternationalGuests in the most luxurious suites also get Starlink WiFi, laundry services, the best seats for on board shows, and a ""Royal Genie"" to help plan their trip.But few compare to Icon's most expensive cabin, the 2,523-square-foot Ultimate Family Townhouse.The Ultimate Family Townhouse can accommodate up to eight guests. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderGuests in the three-floor floating mansion get to wake up to sweeping ocean views and coffee on one of the three balconies.The bottom floor has an open-air patio that opens into Icon's Surfside neighborhood.The two bedrooms — one with a bunk bed — are back inside on the top floor.Looking to watch a movie or flex your karaoke skills? Slide down to the second floor, where you can do just that at one of the several lounges.A spokesperson for Royal Caribbean told Business Insider that travelers have been 'quickly' reserving the giant cabin for an average of $100,000 a week.The townhouse's balcony wraps around the living room. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderBut a cruise ship worker stationed at the Ultimate Family Townhouse in January told BI that some guests have been snatching up the multilevel townhouse for a whopping $200,000 a week, noting that the playground-like cabin was mostly booked for 2024.


The keycards to these plush suites also open up another exclusive side of the ship: the Suite Neighborhood.Guests who've booked a suite have access to the ultra-exclusive Suite Neighborhood, shown in a rendering Royal Caribbean InternationalOnly guests staying in suites can access the 60,924-square-foot retreat and its two restaurants, sundeck, hot tub, pool, and bar.The list of exclusive restaurants doesn't end there, of course.Affluent travelers could splurge on grilled lobster, fish, and shrimp at restaurants like Hooked Seafood. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderMore than half of the Icon of the Seas' 28 eateries come at an extra cost.Some are more affordable, like Izumi at the Park's grab-and-go sushi window. For $10, hungry travelers can pick between seaweed salad and edamame, plus two choices of sashimi, nigiri, and rolls.Cruisers craving a formal, upscale dinner could instead reserve the rabbit-slinging $200-per-person Empire Supper Club.Empire Supper Club features live music and a cocktail pairing. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderThe price is comparable to high-end, on-land Michelin-starred restaurants.Empire Supper Club's American fare dinner flexes eight courses, a cocktail pairing, and live jazz. Appetizer options include butter-poached langoustine with Osetra caviar. For the main course, the aforementioned rabbit leg and loin could be a bun-tastic choice.The latter will be paired with a New York Sour — not a hoppy beer.


There are 18 other places to drink on the ship. As usual, none are complimentary.Caffeinated cocktail-slinging Rye and Bean is located next to the AquaTheater. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderExpect to front New York City prices without a beverage package: The popular Rye and Bean bar serves coffee and tea-infused cocktails ranging from $12 to $14.Looking for a pampering? Like alcohol, spa treatments are rarely complimentary on cruise ships.Travelers can rent one of the colorful casitas for a day. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderVacationing can be stressful. At the mega-ship's spa, guests can unwind with an almost $150 25-minute facial or a nearly $180 50-minute Swedish massage.Or, book one of the exclusive casitas to relax with unobstructed ocean views.A spokesperson for Royal Caribbean did not immediately respond to BI's request for casita pricing on Icon of the Seas. But for context, a casita on the cruise line's older Symphony of the Seas mega-ship can cost about $360 per day during a sea day.


Amenities like the six-slide waterpark and mini-golf course are complimentary to all guests.Crown's Edge is not for travelers with a fear of heights. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderBut the same can't be said for Crown's Edge, one of the ship's most distinctive amenities.Travelers must don a bulky jumpsuit and harness before they face their fear of heights at the thrilling agility course.The half-walking, half-ziplining route, which leaves its sweaty-palmed participants dangling 154 feet above the ocean, could be completed in a minute or so.That's $49 down the drain in one minute.And why stop there when you can splurge during port days too?Royal Caribbean has invested $350 million into Perfect Day at CocoCay. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderIcon of the Seas will dock at Royal Caribbean's Perfect Day at CocoCay private island for all 2024 sailings.As expected, the Caribbean getaway is full of upcharged activities.Travelers with young children might want to drop $100 per head for an afternoon at the waterpark.Royal Caribbean launched Hideaway Beach, the new adult-only section of its private island, Perfect Day at CocoCay, in January. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderMeanwhile, those without kids can pay between $39 to $89 per person for a boozy day at the adult-only Hideaway Beach.Nearby, the more exclusive beach club could be almost triple that cost.A weeklong trip on the new world's largest cruise ship could quickly become an ultra-luxurious vacation.Amenities like the six-slide waterpark are complimentary. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderBut even travelers looking to spend modestly might be shocked by the new ship's prices.Jason Liberty, president and CEO of Royal Caribbean Group, told investors in 2023 that Icon's inaugural season had commanded more bookings at ""materially higher rates"" than any of its previous ship launches.Patrick Scholes, a lodging and leisure research analyst at Truist Securities, told BI in late 2023 that new cruise liners generally command a 20% to 50% pricing premium.Icon of the Seas is sailing out of Miami throughout 2024. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderThree months before Icon of the Seas' launch, he estimated the new vessel was priced at a premium of ""at least 50% if not more.""At the time, the least expensive 2024 itinerary had started at $1,820 per person for an interior cabin.Pricing has since increased by $17. That's $262 per person, per day, for a windowless stateroom.And no, it doesn't come with access to the Suite Neighborhood.

Several of these firms have faced layoffs and implemented hiring freezes over the past year as demand for consulting services has waned. Still, they're a good bet for anyone looking to land a six-figure job straight out of school.Business Insider analyzed the US Office of Foreign Labor Certification's 2023 disclosure data for permanent and temporary foreign workers to find out what PwC, KPMG, EY, and Deloitte paid US-based employees for jobs ranging from entry-level to executive roles. We looked through entries specifically for roles related to management consulting and accounting.

Meta blocked all posts from The Kansas Reflector on Thursday after the nonprofit newspaper called out Facebook, which Meta owns, and other forms of social media in an article.The article, titled ""When Facebook fails, local media matters even more for our planet's future,"" directly calls out Meta and Facebook for suppressing posts related to climate change and highlights the role of local media in stepping up to the plate.""We are getting along OK without the promotional help of Facebook, but it does seem problematic that a behemoth such as Meta can dictate the terms of our communications,"" documentary producer Dave Kendall wrote in the opinion piece.

Andy Stone, communications director at Meta, apologized for the mistake on Thursday and said that the error ""had nothing to do with the Reflector's recent criticism of Meta."" He stated that the mistake had been corrected.On Friday, Facebook had brought back all the posts that linked to the Kansas Reflector's stories — except for anything that linked to Kendall's article, which was still down for a period of time.By Friday night, the issue had been completely resolved and users were able to link to and view Kendall's article.Related: Meta Is Suing a Former VP Who Left the Company for a Competing AI Startup

      Key Takeaways    



        Syed Lateef left finance to start an Airbnb business that he's grown to over 300 rental units.
      


        Lateef's business model includes both buying his own properties and utilizing rental arbitrage.
      


        Since 2017, he's grossed $35 million in revenue and he made $1.4 million in profit last year.

Syed Lateef runs his Airbnb business in Chicago.


 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Syed Lateef, a 36-year-old Airbnb Superhost in Chicago. It's been edited for length and clarity.I'm the CEO of SyedBnb, a short-term rental company with over 300 units and 100 employees.After dropping out of college for one year before returning to get my degree, I started working in finance, but I didn't aspire to have the lifestyle of the company's VPs. I wanted wealth, exotic cars, luxury vacations, time, and freedom, so I pivoted to real estate.



I started my business in 2017, and in 2023, we made $11.5 million in revenue and $1.4 million in net profit.Real estate was the key to the life I wantedAfter being let go from my first role as a financial analyst, I landed a job at Allstate. I was promoted three times within five years, but the salary increases weren't meeting my expectations.I realized that the people I knew in my community who were wealthy and had nice homes or cars were involved in real estate, which made me believe that was one of the main drivers of wealth.I started listening to the ""BiggerPockets"" podcast and read ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad,"" which motivated me to pursue financial freedom. I expected it to take me 15 years to replace my salaried income through real estate, but I was determined.


In 2016, I purchased my first multifamily building in Chicago using savings from my finance job and a loan on my 401(k). I put one of the units on Airbnb with a goal to make double the rent in one month that I could expect from a long-term tenant.I hired cleaners and virtual assistants to do the admin work and implemented pricing software from the outset (I use PriceLabs).Within four months, I made three times the expected market rent for a long-term tenant. I realized what an incredible opportunity this was and converted all the units in my building into Airbnbs. I was addicted and wanted more.Three to four months into my side business, even though my family and friends encouraged me to keep my salaried role, I gave my notice to leave. I was now a full-time entrepreneur.


Since its launch, I've scaled the business to over $35 million in revenueOne of Lateef's units in Chicago. Courtesy of Syed LateefI became an Airbnb Superhost in 2018, which means my average reviews are above 4.8 out of 5.In the second year, I expanded into rental arbitrage (renting units from landlords and subleasing them on Airbnb) after realizing it was an easier way to grow my business. After furnishing my units, I lacked the cash to buy more rentals. I now own 13 apartments and arbitrage 320.


My revenue hit $2.8 million in 2019. 2020 was a down year due to COVID-19. By 2022, I had my first eight-figure year, reaching $10.5 million in revenue.I only work a few hours a weekWith the help of my employees and the implementation of author Gino Wickman's guiding principles of the EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System), my workweek hovers around two hours.EOS is a set of concepts and tools for entrepreneurs to have people in the right seats, track scorecards, document processes, identify issues, and get traction on their business. Weekly leadership meetings using the EOS system help me achieve a two-hour workweek, but those two hours are intense meetings.I also handle my landlord relationships and business growth, but that's periodic, as well as the occasional proverbial fire.


The biggest mistake I made was growing too quicklyThe biggest mistake I made was being too optimistic about growth in the winter before the pandemic. I started scaling and ran out of cash, but I didn't expect COVID-19 to hit me with a knock-out punch. My revenue went to zero. Airbnb refunded all my future guests. I didn't have the money to pay the landlord's rent.I negotiated with all my landlords to allow me to stay in business. I purchased assets from bankrupt companies and was able to scale significantly. For example, I bought furniture for $250 per apartment from a bankrupt company.Here's my Airbnb adviceMy best advice to other aspiring Airbnb Superhosts is to learn from other hosts' experiences. Get in the Airbnb Facebook forums and connect with others. Attend networking events. Hire a coach or purchase a course to help you start the business.Then, take action. If you can't afford a property, consider rental arbitrage. So many people get stuck in the learning and planning process. Inevitably, you'll learn while being in the actual business.


When I got started, I asked my sister, who's into interior design, to help me furnish my first Airbnbs. For guests' needs, we modeled hotels to see what items created a good stay. I learned everything myself through experience.Let's put you on the fast track to success. Accelerate your business growth with our all-inclusive subscription.

      Key Takeaways    



        Millions of tourists are expected to boost economies in Texas and New York during the eclipse.
      


        Hotels, an eyeglasses manufacturer, and even skydiving companies are preparing for increased business.
      


        One study predicts that the eclipse could benefit the US economy by nearly $1.6 billion.

A map shows where the moon's shadow will cross the US during the April 8 total solar eclipse.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. As millions of Americans get ready to watch the total solar eclipse on Monday — an event NASA has described as rare and ""spectacular"" — the phenomenon also stands to lift local economies.Various industries are poised to benefit from the millions of tourists flocking to cities in Texas, Ohio, and New York, which are on the eclipse's ""path of totality"" and offer the best views of the ring around the sun.



According to NASA, this year's eclipse is set to last three to four minutes, longer than the last solar eclipse in 2017. People who miss this one will not be able to see another in the contiguous US until 2044 or 2045, the agency said.Up to 3.7 million people are slated to travel to the path of the eclipse, joining the 31 million people already living along the stretch, according to predictions by eclipse-tracking website Great American Eclipse.


Visitors are expected to spend big: They'll shell out up to $1.6 billion on lodging, activities, food, and gas, Texas-based economic consultancy Perryman Group estimates.Here are some of the industries seeing big boosts from Monday's eclipse.Hotels and Airbnbs book outThe budget hotel chain Super 8 has over 300 locations within the path of totality, per the New York Times. About 100 of these hotels are sold out for Sunday or Monday, according to the hotel chain's website.One two-star Super 8 branch in Grayville, Illinois, is advertising rooms between $765 and $949 from Sunday through Tuesday. On most days, the rooms typically cost $80, the Super 8 website shows.


Higher-end hotels are also seeing similar spikes. A JW Marriott in Dallas listed a standard room for $1,039 for Sunday night. It typically costs between $355 and $482, the website said.Visitors are flocking to Airbnbs, too. As of March 25, occupancy rates for April 7 soared to 88% across 110,000 active listings on the path of totality, according to vacation-rental data company AirDNA.The biggest glasses manufacturer has sold outPeople can permanently damage their eyesight by looking straight into the sun during an eclipse, so NASA recommends specific solar-filtering glasses.Former President Donald Trump looked up at the solar eclipse without glasses during the last eclipse. Jabin Botsford for The Washington Post via Getty ImagesThe eye-protection guidelines translated into huge sales for some glasses manufacturers.Tennessee-based American Paper Optics, the country's largest producer of protective eclipse eyeglasses, has seen a big jump in sales, compared to the last total eclipse in 2017.The company started taking eclipse orders two years in advance, John Jerit, the company's founder, told NPR on Friday. The glasses sold for $1.50 to $2 a piece.


""We've shipped already about 70 million glasses, and I suspect I'm going to approach right at 75 million by the time next week comes,"" Jerit said.American Paper Optics sold out of glasses this year, after producing about 30 million more glasses than it did for the total solar eclipse in 2017, according to a sales figure on the company's site.Eclipse skydiving attracts thrill-seekersSome adrenaline junkies seeking a novel vantage point are planning to jump during totality to enjoy the darkness from the sky.A group of 30 skydivers plans to jump in northern New York on Monday, Fox News reported. Tickets for the dive, hosted by local company Skydive the Falls, sold out in seven minutes after they went live in January.


""We're going to jump one minute prior to totality, so we can enjoy totality in full under our parachutes,"" Jason Berger, the co-owner of Skydive the Falls, told Fox News.A similar event in Dallas sold out its $249 eclipse skydive tickets, too.For sun observers on the ground, restaurants are making the most of the celestial phenomenon with eclipse menus and specials. Establishments like Smoothie King, Applebees, and Sonic are offering special eclipse-themed smoothies, margaritas, and ""blackout"" drinks to mark the occasion.

81,Amazon Is Trading Its 'Just Walk Out' AI Technology For 'Smart' Carts — And AI Reportedly Needed Humans to Do the Job Right,"Apr 5, 2024",Sherin Shibu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/amazon-swaps-just-walk-out-for-smart-carts-at-fresh-stores/472305,"
Amazon is phasing out its cashier-less ""Just Walk Out"" technology from Fresh grocery stores in the U.S. about seven years after it was first announced.The program enabled customers to check in at an Amazon Fresh store with a credit card, mobile app, or Amazon One palm reader, grab directly from the shelves, and ""just walk out"" with their items.But reports this week indicated that it wasn't actually AI technology doing all of the work.



Though Amazon claims that a system of scanners, video cameras, and generative AI were powering the tech, about 700 of every 1,000 Just Walk Out sales in 2022 had to go through human review by Amazon's team in India, The Information reported this week.The cashiers were off-site, and they watched what U.S. shoppers picked up, put down, and walked out with on video, according to the report.Amazon Fresh store on March 04, 2021, featuring Just Walk Out shopping. Photo by Leon Neal/Getty ImagesHowever, Amazon disputed how many purchases required human review, with Nathan Strauss, an Amazon spokesperson, telling Retail Dive that employees looked into ""a small minority"" of shopping visits if Amazon's technology failed to determine what a shopper left the store with.""The characterization that Just Walk Out technology relies on human reviewers is inaccurate,"" Strauss said. ""The primary role of our Machine Learning data associates is to annotate video images, which is necessary for continuously improving the underlying machine learning model powering Just Walk Out technology.""Related: Amazon Adds New AI For Sellers As It Plans Its First-Ever 'Big Spring Sale'


The Information was the first to report that Amazon is removing Just Walk Out from most of its stores, and instead replacing the technology with ""Dash Carts"" that keep track of what shoppers pick out and show a running total as they move through the store.Shoppers can still skip the checkout line.Smaller Amazon stores and U.K. grocery stores will still have Just Walk Out, according to The Verge.A September Amazon blog post shows that the company characterized Just Walk Out as a combination of computer vision, sensors, and AI — with no mention of human review.


Related: Amazon's $1 Billion Innovation Fund Is Looking to Invest in a Specific Kind of Startup""Customer trust and privacy are paramount to the experience,"" the post reads, emphasizing that Just Walk Out didn't use or collect biometric information from shoppers.As of September, Just Walk Out was available at more than 70 Amazon stores and 85 third-party stores in the U.S., U.K., and Australia.

More tech layoffs are in the works as Apple and Amazon are letting go of hundreds of workers.Apple announced on Friday that it's laying off over 600 workers in California, effective May 27, according to a state filing.This is the first major round of layoffs for Apple since the pandemic, something that CEO Tim Cook said was a ""last resort"" in May 2023.Related: Apple Is Reportedly Beginning a Small Round of Layoffs""Mass layoffs is not something that we're talking about at this moment,"" Cook said at the time. ""We're continuing to be extremely prudent on hiring. We're continuing to hire, just at a lower clip level than we were before. And we're doing all the right things of challenging the things that we spend, and we're just finding a few more ways to save on it.""



The layoffs follow Apple's decision to cancel its 10-year-long project to create an electric, self-driving car. Workers tasked with the project were on a team called the ""Special Projects Group.""Friday's filing didn't mention the group by name, but the layoffs affect one of Apple's satellite offices and not its headquarters, which means the cut roles could be from a special project.Amazon, meanwhile, announced on Wednesday that it was cutting hundreds of jobs in its cloud computing division, AWS.""These decisions are difficult but necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers,"" said Amazon spokesperson Duncan Neasham in a statement per NPR.


The cut roles oversee technology in physical storefronts and sales, marketing, and global service organization inside AWS.Related: Amazon Lays Off Hundreds of Staffers at Prime, Twitch, MGMThe job cuts come just days after Amazon announced that it was nixing its ""Just Walk Out"" checkout options at its grocery storefronts.According to data collected by TechCrunch, the total number of tech layoffs in 2023 was around 262,735 — up 59% from the year prior.

MyCity, New York City's first citywide AI chatbot that launched in October 2023, promised to save entrepreneurs ""time and money"" with immediate answers to questions, including ones about compliance with city regulations.But six months and more than $600,000 later, the bot, which is still in beta but widely available, is reportedly spitting out wrong answers to key questions about the city's minimum wage, if employers could take workers' tips, and if businesses had to tell staff about schedule changes, per The Markup.Following the chatbot's advice could have led to trouble for business owners who used it and failed to fact-check answers.Related: I Tried 3 AI Headshot Generators and There Was a Clear WinnerBut New York City Mayor Eric Adams is defending the AI chatbot, Reuters reported on Thursday.Adams defended the experimental nature of the chatbot this week, telling the outlet that ""it's wrong in some areas, and we've got to fix it.""""Any time you use technology, you need to put it into the real environment to iron out the kinks,"" Adams said.When Entrepreneur tested the chatbot Friday, it had corrected its answers to some of The Markup's queries. But when we asked the MyCity chatbot what the minimum wage was in NYC, it said $15 per hour.The correct answer is $16 per hour.The chatbot wasn't able to tell business owners the correct minimum wage to pay employees. Photo by EntrepreneurThe bot also wrote that ""store owners in New York City are allowed to go cashless,"" even though NYC's consumer and worker protection policies state that ""beginning November 19, 2020, stores must accept cash… They cannot charge more for paying in cash.""Questions asked by Entrepreneur also yielded inaccuracies, specifically on new policy changes in NYC that took effect this year.For example, when we asked if businesses have to post the total price of an item, inclusive of the credit card surcharge, before checkout, the chatbot incorrectly responded no. Legislation that went into effect in February makes the correct answer yes.

The city's Office of Technology and Innovation spent over half a million dollars ($600,000) to build the basis of the AI, according to ABC.

      Key Takeaways    



        About one-third of hiring managers in a survey admitted bias against Gen Zers or older candidates.
      


        Forty-two percent of managers consider job seekers' ages when reviewing résumés, per Resume Builder.
      


        Some career advisors suggest removing the year you graduated from a résumé and LinkedIn profile.

This article originally appeared on Business Insider. If you're looking for a job and you're a Gen Zer or an older worker, you might be out of luck — at least with some hiring managers.That's because, according to a survey from Resume Builder, 36% of hiring managers said they were biased against Gen Z candidates. And 34% admitted they had it in for older candidates.



Oof. Ageism isn't new, of course, though the survey findings are a reminder that even in a strong job market, it can still be tough to land a new gig. Having people discount your abilities because of how young or old you are doesn't help.""You need to be aware of pitfalls like age bias,"" Stacie Haller, chief career advisor at Resume Builder, told Business Insider. ""You have to know the landscape you're in.""


Resume Builder surveyed 1,000 hiring managers in March and found that 42% consider the age of job seekers when going over résumés. To determine a candidate's age, hiring managers tally years of experience, look for the year someone graduated, and even look for a photo, according to the survey.Delete the year you graduated.Some candidates might choose not to put the year they graduated on their CV, thanks to worries about recruiters doing the math. In the survey, six in 10 hiring managers said job seekers should ""always"" include the year they graduated, but about four in 10 said candidates sometimes shouldn't or should never include the year.Some TikTokers who focus on career advice encourage people to delete their graduation year so that young candidates avoid getting dinged for not having enough experience and older workers don't get dumped for having too much.That's something Haller endorses. ""It matters that you got the degree. Does it matter if you got it last year or 20 years ago? It shouldn't,"" she said.


Haller added that recruiters determined to weed out groups they don't like can often still find a way, even when job applicants strip their résumé and LinkedIn profile of indicators like graduation dates. ""If you're somebody who really is biased against folks, those people go to Facebook to check you out,"" she said.Of course, there are federal laws designed to protect workers over 40 from age discrimination; some states also have provisions meant to shield younger members of the workforce, according to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency. But proving bias based on age can be difficult, as BI has previously reported.The Goldilocks generation.So why are some hiring managers not down with younger or older workers? One reason could be because those looking to bring on workers are often of a different generation, Haller said. More than six in 10 survey respondents were between 25 and 44 years old. It's an indication, she said, that these managers — perhaps in their first role leading others — ""seem to be biased against everybody younger than them and older than them,"" Haller said.Among the hiring managers who admitted to bias against Gen Z job seekers, more than three-quarters cited younger workers' lack of experience. About six in 10 managers pointed to what they saw as a tendency among Gen Zers to job hop. And a similar proportion of respondents pointed to an unprofessional attitude among members of the youngest slice of the workforce.


Among older workers, the indictments were likewise nothing new. Three-quarters of respondents were concerned an older worker might soon retire. Nearly two-thirds were worried older candidates would experience health problems, and almost half of all hiring managers identified worries that older workers didn't have sufficient experience with technology.Showing up to an interview and looking too old can also be a problem for job applicants. In the survey, four in 10 hiring managers said if a candidate has an ""elderly"" appearance, they would be less inclined to consider the applicant. And 36% of hiring managers said candidates over age 60 should take steps to look younger in interviews.That's advice that Shark Tank's Barbara Corcoran, a septuagenarian, has given, according to BI's prior reporting.Some hiring managers surveyed also had advice for those with a youthful visage: Look older. A fresh-faced glow was a turnoff for 19% of hiring managers. More than one-third of hiring managers recommended that candidates aged 18 to 27 ""try to appear older during interviews,"" according to the survey.


Haller said while bias works against a range of job seekers, Gen Z has a specific challenge because many young people were sidelined early in their careers by the pandemic and were ill-prepared to enter the workplace. Some started their jobs remotely, making it harder to build skills and nail basics like how to dress for the office.Yet, she added, one generation dumping on another is nothing new.""Every generation gets talked about. The millennials, at one point, were entitled. Nobody wanted to hire them,"" she said. ""And now they're the age group that's biased against everybody else.""

      Key Takeaways    



        A company poached Amanda Nielsen from her job and then let her go 60 days later.
      


        Nielsen took several steps to land good job leads, including her current role.

Amanda Nielsen via Business Insider
Amanda Nielsen was let go from her job two months after she was poached from another company.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amanda Nielsen, a partnerships manager based in Denver. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified her employment history.I have worked in partnerships my whole career.



I was at a company in the software space for four years when the company did a round of layoffs. I survived the cut, but a lot of my team was let go, and the job didn't feel the same. I was opening up to the idea of new roles when the perfect opportunity presented itself.A manager from another company in the same industry reached out and made me a job offer I could not refuse.I took the offer. Shortly after I joined, new leadership was brought in at the C-suite level.In October 2023, close to my 60-day mark, the company laid off a significant part of its staff. My entire team, including my manager and I, were let go.It was a shock because the company had put in so much effort to poach me, make an attractive offer, and spend time onboarding me.I felt naive and silly. I had just announced my job move to my whole network and told them all about my new responsibilities. There were practical worries, too: I had just set up my insurance and had asked for my 401(k) to be rolled over. My entire team being fired also made me question my abilities and how this looked from the outside.


Job-search strugglesOnce I had collected myself, I went on to LinkedIn and let people know I had been let go and was looking for new opportunities. I also began applying for jobs online.Even though I was open-minded about roles and had a solid résumé and network, I struggled with my job hunt.One thing that had changed since my last job search four years earlier was the pandemic and the rise of remote work. Suddenly, I was competing with people from around the US and the world.In the past, I felt that cover letters and personalized applications got me through the door. But this time around, that wasn't working for me.


Strategies that worked for meI took a step back and tried a couple of other strategies.I landed a job within three months. I currently work as a partner sales manager at Box, a job I landed in February. I credit it to some of the initiatives I took after my layoff:Being honest on LinkedIn about my journey: Once I put up a post on LinkedIn about being let go, I had tons of people reaching out and wanting to help. I joked that my calendar was just as full during my job search as when I was working full-time. I also continued to post content about my job-search journey, which can feel embarrassing and uncomfortable, but it helped people learn that I was still on the market.Asking people in my industry for coffee chats: I began going to in-person networking events and asking people in my industry for coffee chats. It improved my connection with them. Getting out of the house also kept me feeling productive.Asking for referrals: When I found out that cover letters were not working as they had in the past, I looked into how else I could stand out. Once I applied, I would send a thoughtful note to the hiring manager or ask another employee working if there was any way they could help. I also tried my best to get referrals before applying, even if it meant contacting ""loose connections"" with whom I had not worked directly.Freelance work: I allocated more time to my side hustle, a small e-commerce platform where I sell merchandise and offer freelance consulting. While I was not ready to pursue my own business, freelance gigs helped me expand my network and get feedback on my skills. After two layoffs, it also showed me the importance of multiple income streams.These steps kept me occupied and helped me find job leads, including my present role.When my current boss was looking for people to expand his team, he reached out to his network for recommendations. My frequent posting and constant networking had kept me on top of people's minds, and I was recommended to my boss by several people.


In retrospect, despite how painful it was, I'm grateful for the layoff because of the opportunities it opened up for me.

87,Trader Joe's Accused of Copying Smaller Brands in New Report: 'Reminds Me of the Fast Fashion Model',"Apr 4, 2024",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/trader-joes-accused-of-ripping-off-smaller-food-brands/472228,"
Trader Joe's has mastered the art of developing a cult-favorite brand, thanks to its low prices and quirky food selection.The chain is known for creating fresh, frozen, and packaged meals and snacks under its own Trader Joe's brand, with some products being an obvious riff on popular name-brand selections.But a new investigation by Taste found that making Trader Joe's branded items may have a darker side than just reproducing big company favorites — some small brands are claiming that Trader Joe's has copied their ideas and purposely cut them out of deals.



Related: Trader Joe's Increasing Price of Bananas After Two DecadesTo offer such cheap prices, Trader Joe's will buy products directly from the supplier and rebrand the product under its own name — for example, if the company wanted to buy Sabra hummus, instead of selling it to customers in Sabra packaging, the grocer will buy directly from Sabra's distributor and repackage it.


However, several smaller companies told Taste that Trader Joe's copied their recipes and packaging after reaching out to the smaller companies and asking about their products and distribution process.""Their product line looked incredibly similar to ours in terms of color choices, patterns, borders, and font,"" said the founder of an ethnic food brand that was set to work with Trader Joe's. ""It was kind of uncanny.""The founder spoke to the outlet anonymously due to a non-disclosure it had signed with the grocer.Another founder named Auria Abraham of Auria's Malaysian Kitchen alleges that she was approached by the grocer about privately labeling her Lime Leaf Sambal. After unclear financial terms were discussed and calls were sent back and forth, she says the deal went dead.


Then, Trader Joe's allegedly released its own Thai-style Green Chili sauce, which was nearly identical to Abraham's.""It reminds me of the fast fashion model,"" said Jing Gao, the founder of Fly By Jing, a brand of Sichuan chili crisp. ""Trader Joe's is like the food version of Zara or Shein. The way that these big houses keep up with so much innovation so quickly is by copying independent designers.""Related: Trader Joe's Mini Tote Bags Are Fetching Hundreds on eBayTrader Joe's reportedly approached Gao about replicating the recipes.Trader Joe's did not immediately respond to Entrepreneur's request for comment but told Business Insider that it does not buy recipes or product concepts.""Our common practice is to deal directly with producers or growers rather than purchasing through brokers, distributors, sales agents, or other middlemen,"" the grocer said. ""In our search for new products, we meet with many producers to determine who can best deliver on food safety, production capacity, quality, and price.""

With the rise of remote work and the gig economy, the line of when work truly begins and ends has become blurry, with some people feeling like they're perpetually logged on.This can lead to work messages and emails that arrive outside the standard 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. hours, which may be burdensome to employees who seek a better work-life balance.Now, a new law proposed in California is hoping to put a stop to that.Related: 7 Ways To Find A Work-Life Balance This SummerAssembly Bill 2751 was introduced in February by Assemblyman Matt Haney of San Francisco and aims to ""require a public or private employer to establish a workplace policy that provides employees the right to disconnect from communications from the employer during nonworking hours, except as specified.""Under the proposed bill, workers and employers must set designated ""nonworking"" hours and grant employees the right to ignore messages during these hours. Should the employer not comply, the company can face a $100 fine.""This bill has a lot of flexibility to make sure that it works for all California businesses and types of employment, including those sectors that may require on-call work or longer hours,"" Harney said. ""We've crafted it in a way that addresses the recent changes to work brought on by new technology, but to also be pro-California business. California businesses will be more competitive for desperately needed workers as a result of this law.""The bill would make California the first-ever U.S. state to implement such a law and follow suit of the 13 other countries that have already enacted similar ""right to disconnect"" rules, including France, Italy, Mexico, and Spain.The new bill would apply to both public and privately owned companies.The proposed legislature comes at a time when many Americans are struggling to log off from work.According to a 2023 study by ELVTR, one in five Americans has been requested to log on or finish a work task while on vacation or PTO.Related: Stop Splitting Yourself in Half: Seek Out Work-Life BoundariesOf 2,300 workers surveyed, 28% said they are bothered by work emails during their vacations and 25% are interrupted by work-related text messages.There is no set date for when AB 2751 is set to be brought to the vote.

90,I Turned My Layoff into a Learning Lesson and Became My Own CEO — Here Are the Lessons I Learned Along the Way,"Apr 4, 2024",Randy Boldyga,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/from-a-layoff-to-ceo-lessons-i-learned-along-the-way/471653,"
In my late twenties, I worked as a government contractor at a subsidiary of Black & Decker. Without much warning, my division's contract was terminated, and I was given two choices: either work for the new employer at their proposed rate or leave the contract jobless.Rather than leaving us out in the cold, the leaders at Black & Decker showed compassion. They provided me and my colleagues with other opportunities and assigned an HR manager to help us search for positions at other locations and companies.Decades later, that experience has stayed with me. Amid industry-wide tech layoffs, I reflected on it often — particularly how I've woven the lessons learned from that difficult situation into the company I've spent the last 25 years building. Caring — not just empathy and compassion, but actually prioritizing the needs and well-being of employees — is something that I've tried to instill in my executive team and will serve you well when navigating layoffs as an employer.



Related: Poor Leadership Is Going Viral on Social Media Amid Mass LayoffsHire for fit and long-term growthMy company initially operated out of a basement as a bootstrapped start-up; now, it is an established name in the ambulatory healthcare technology landscape. Fortunately, in our 25-year history, we've never had to conduct mass layoffs. One of the ways I managed this is by hiring with a conservative and strategic approach. Here's what I mean:


Financial Prudence: We operate with a financially conservative approach, ensuring we have a buffer to weather economic downturns and support our team's development even during slow periods. This financial responsibility minimizes the risk of layoffs and shows our team we're invested in their long-term success.Don't Hire Too Quickly: We are committed to a strict policy not to expand the team unless we have the financial security to support those new hires. This approach ensures we avoid unnecessary employee turnover, which wastes valuable time and resources and deteriorates trust in our decision-making.Prioritize team Fit: We believe in finding the right fit — individuals who possess the necessary skills and align with the values, passion, and drive we bring to our work. This reduces turnover and fosters a more stable, engaged workforce that knows they can trust their colleagues and leaders to deliver.Focus on Long-Term Potential: We look beyond resumes and qualifications to assess an individual's potential for growth personally and within the company. Someone with aspirations and a desire to learn can make a far more significant impact than someone who just has the hard skills. These hires can evolve as our company does.Related: 3 Benefits of a Better Thought-Out Hiring ProcessBe an empathetic leaderWhen you care, your employees can feel and see it, and your culture will thrive because of it. Empathy is of paramount importance. The recent wave of layoffs across the technology landscape is a stark reminder of the human cost associated with financial decisions. The economic landscape will always be uncertain, but leaders who care about their employees will navigate hard decisions and challenging times by prioritizing emotional intelligence and empathy.While downsizing is difficult for many businesses, a strategic approach focused on empathy can significantly lessen the blow. Remember that empathy isn't just about grasping another's pain — it's about translating that understanding into action. It's also about recognizing the human element in everything we do.Losing the contract at Black & Decker was difficult, but it took just a little effort to help point my colleagues and me in the right direction, and that shining example has stuck with me for almost 30 years. As leaders, remember that our teams rely on us for direction and genuine support. Our team is our greatest asset, and empathy is the fuel that keeps them running at their best and can help soften the blow if a company has to navigate a downsize.


Related: 3 Prudent Hiring Practices to Acquire the Best TalentNever forget the value of your teamMy experience at Black & Decker left an indelible mark, shaping my approach to leadership and employee relationships today. While replicating their extraordinary efforts may not be universally feasible, the core message remains: empathy is a strategic advantage, not just a nicety. This lesson has become a cornerstone of my leadership philosophy, influencing every decision and interaction within the company. It taught me that leading with empathy creates an environment where employees feel valued and understood, fostering a priceless sense of belonging and commitment. Similarly, by being financially prudent, prioritizing long-term growth through strategic hiring practices and fostering a culture of trust, companies can minimize the need for layoffs altogether. This strategic blend of financial foresight, empathetic leadership and a commitment to the well-being of employees lays the groundwork for a resilient and thriving organization.This approach enhances employee loyalty and attracts top talent, who increasingly value corporate ethics and company culture when choosing a new position. Your employees are the foundation of your success — let's strive to create a business landscape where hiring for success and acts of compassion become the norm.

91,I Was Told I Was Too Old for a New Tech Job. Now I'm Fighting Back.,"Apr 4, 2024",Tim Paradis,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/recruiters-ageism-goes-viral-tech-applicant-starts-company/472208,"
This article originally appeared on Business Insider. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Vern Six, 58, who has worked in tech for over three decades. After getting laid off from a contract job, he updated his LinkedIn profile to indicate he was open to work. A recruiter contacted him and expressed surprise at how long Six had been in tech. Six, who lives near Waco, Texas, with his wife, posted about his experience with what he saw as ageism. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.I've been in tech as a developer, a senior engineer, principal software engineer — whatever you want to call it — for 37 years. My career has ranged from three-month to four-year engagements. I'm almost always hired as an independent contractor.



After I got laid off, I got a phone call from a recruiter, which happens a lot. He said, ""Hey, I've got your résumé. Can you spare a few minutes?"" I said, ""Sure.""So, he went to pull up my LinkedIn profile. He goes, ""Oh, wow, you've been doing this for a long time."" It was like he'd never read my résumé, which was 12 pages long and listed every project I ever had.


Then he goes, ""With 37 years in this business, I'm surprised you're not a CTO."" He said, ""That's going to be a hard sell. I don't even know if I can pitch you to any of my clients. They're all going to wonder why you're not a CTO or at the C-level."" I was like, ""Did you just say that?""I think I responded to him in a way my mom would not necessarily be very proud of. Then I hung up. He was really hateful.After my post on LinkedIn about his call went viral, he begged me to take it down and not be naming and shaming. I probably have no less than 200 emails from attorneys wanting to represent me to go after this guy. But I'm just like, ""I don't need to be a part of him getting bad karma, and I don't need it to possibly come back on me with some bad karma. It's just not who I am.""Other people have also come out of the woodwork. I have more than 73,000 emails in my inbox. In the ones I've gone through, I've gotten, I don't know, 100 invites to date. I've been married for 25 years, so I'm good.


I've had probably 200 hate messages. They're like, ""Just go away, you old goat,"" and stuff like that. Other people have used some very explicit language.The post had over 2 million impressions on LinkedIn, and I've had thousands of connection requests pop up. People wanted me to start a group there, so I created one called Inclusive Futures to fight ageism and discrimination. It already has over 400 members.'Bring the old guy in here.'I didn't see any ageism at my last company. But, before that, I'd seen it. ""Bring the old guy in here. See what he has to say about this."" I can't tell you how many times I've heard that since I was 45-plus. On one hand, it's kind of flattering in that, OK, my opinion is valued. On the other hand, it's damn insulting.It was most prevalent when I was working as a software engineer. At many social events, I was simply excluded. In other cases, it wasn't the right type of event for me. I'm not going to go to an axe-throwing bar in downtown Dallas. They would go play paintball. I'm an old Army sergeant; I can play paintball, but I'm 58 years old. I have broken my back a couple of times, and I'm not exactly going to do those things anymore. If they want to go out on my bass boat and we go fishing — let's go.


But in my experience, over 37 years, women have gotten a much worse run over the coals than what occurs with ageism. I've heard hundreds of people comment about women in tech — which can be career-ending discussions — and they're just talking lackadaisically in the middle of the boardroom or cubicle or whatever. Discrimination, in general, just kind of pisses me off.Going for coffeeThis is the first time in my career that I've ever had more than 24 hours that I have not been employed somewhere. I'd been on this work project for four years. I've always been an independent contractor; I've had a great career. I have been building web apps mostly for the last 26 years. And I'm a former CTO.My wife and I recently bought more than 30 acres next to us. We went to the closing at 3 p.m., and at 4:20, I received a phone call from my client that my contract work was being suspended because they'd had a problem at the company. I was just like, ""Holy smokes. I just made myself cash-poor and don't have an income.""We're former full-time missionaries. Before that, we had been kind of serial entrepreneurs. We owned a chain of indoor amusement parks. We sold that, went and lived in Guatemala, helped build an orphanage, and financed all of that through the sale of the amusement center business and my tech work. I've worked wherever I can plug in my computer. I've been in 92 countries and earned an income in every one of them.


In 2021, a friend and I were discussing how we could really make an impact in the world. So, my wife and I started this fundraising company called Purpose Brew Coffee. We wanted to focus on helping projects raise money. The basic model is that we white-label our coffees. And we create a website — because I'm a tech guy, right? — and brand our coffees for the organization doing the fundraising. They promote it to their supporters, and we ship the coffee to the customer.The seller of the coffee earns a percentage for each bag sold. It's a huge share. Thirty percent of the retail dollar goes to each organization. If you sell popcorn, cookie dough, or chocolate bars, they often get at most 2% to 4%.So when the layoff happened, my wife and I looked at each other and said, ""Well, maybe it's just time."" Then she said, ""Nobody can do our tech better than you. Let's stop paying the contractors and have you take over."" So we went down that path. We've doubled the number of partnerships — just in the last few weeks — because I'm doing it full-time now.But even though I love the coffee business, I am still looking for another tech role.


After the LinkedIn post, I've been getting a couple hundred calls a day from recruiters. I would take a project that lasted from a few months to a few years. But, for now, the coffee business is growing. It's going to be a cool, cool deal. I think it's really going to take off. It will not support us at the moment. We're living off of savings. But within two months or so, I think the business will support us.

92,Mark Cuban's Startup Is Sending Its First Batch of Essential Meds to Hospitals Facing Shortages,"Apr 3, 2024",Sherin Shibu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/mark-cuban-cost-plus-online-pharmacy-sends-meds-to-hospitals/472143,"
The startup that billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban co-founded to disrupt the pharmaceutical industry is shipping the first drugs it manufactured to two hospitals that need them.Bloomberg reported that starting Wednesday, Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Co. is sending out its first batch of allergy medication, epinephrine, and blood pressure drug, norepinephrine, to 10 hospitals in Texas and Pennsylvania.Both drugs face nationwide shortages and Cost Plus began producing them at its Dallas facility last month, according to Bloomberg. Epinephrine injections are currently in shortage, according to the FDA drug shortages database at the time of writing.

Related: 'I Was Young and Should Have Known It': Mark Cuban Says This Is the 1 Thing He'd 'Do Differently' in LifeThe startup has an ambitious mission, to sell medications safely and at the lowest possible price point, which it strives to accomplish with transparent prices. According to a letter Cuban wrote on the startup's website, every drug that the company sells is priced the same way: Cost Plus takes the base price of the medication that it has to pay, marks up the price by 15%, and then adds on the actual cost that the pharmacy charges them to prepare the medication.So a drug like Albendazole, for example, which treats ringworm and costs around $113 according to Drugs.com, would be $35 for customers through that pricing method with Cost Plus, as per the letter. Cuban wrote that the cost the startup had to pay for the medication was $26.08.""Many people are spending crazy amounts of money each month just to stay healthy,"" Cuban wrote. ""No American should have to suffer or worse - because they can't afford basic prescription medications.""


Cost Plus also announced on Tuesday that it would be partnering with Price.com to integrate its drug prices into Price.com's AI comparison tool.Customers who use Cost Plus can opt to pick up prescriptions at 5,000 affiliated pharmacies across the country as of last month or opt for pickup at 2,000 Kroger grocery stores as of July of last year.Amazon Pharmacy is another direct-to-consumer online pharmacy platform that recently announced same-day delivery in New York City and Los Angeles, with plans to expand to more than a dozen cities by the end of 2024.Related: 'Don't Follow Your Passion': Mark Cuban Shares the 'Worst Piece' of Business Advice He's Ever Received

As a slew of streaming and subscription-based services continue to raise prices, Spotify is reportedly implementing new pricing plans for its loyal users.On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that the music streaming giant will raise prices this month (between $1 to $2 per month) in five of its international markets including the U.K., Australia, and Pakistan, citing sources familiar with the matter.In the U.S., meanwhile, customers won't see an increase this month, but users based in the states can expect a price hike by the end of this year.Related: JetBlue Is Increasing Bag Fees Based on 'Peak' Flight DaysThe outlet reported that the higher prices of monthly subscriptions are set to offset the cost of Spotify's audiobook feature, as Spotify has to pay publishers to host the books on its platform.



The sources also allege that Spotify will offer a new, cheaper monthly pricing tier, which will give users access to music and podcasts but not audiobooks for $11 a month — the current cost of a premium plan.Spotify has historically offered two plans for users — a paid premium, which offers ad-free listening, and a free option, which subjects listeners to advertisements during their programming.Spotify did not comment publicly on the report.The streaming giant had a strong Q4 2023, with monthly active users increasing by 28 million quarterly and premium users increasing by 31 million quarterly to a total of 236 million globally.


Spotify bumped prices in the U.S. last July by $1 for premium users.Related: Report: Sporting Event Ticket Prices Up Over 25%""So that we can keep innovating, we are changing our Premium prices across a number of markets around the world,"" the company wrote in a post at the time.

Powerful voices are speaking up about the potential danger of advancing AI, and now a prominent group of musicians is joining the chorus in an open letter Monday to call attention to the potential harm the technology can have on the music industry.In a letter written by the Artist Rights Alliance and posted to Medium on Monday, over 200 musicians and songwriters including Jon Bon Jovi, Darius Rucker, and Elvis Costello called for music platforms and streaming services as well as tech companies to initiate a complete cease of AI to ""infringe upon and devalue the human artists.""While the letter admits that AI has the potential to ""advance human creativity,"" it underscores that it only does so when used responsibly, and notes that some platforms and tech developers are using it to ""sabotage and undermine artists, songwriters, musicians, and rights holders.""

If left unregulated, the artists said, AI has the potential to ""degrade the value"" of the work that musicians and songwriters are producing, while simultaneously not properly financially compensating them for it.""Some of the biggest and most powerful companies are, without permission, using our work to train AI models. These efforts are direly aimed at replacing the work of human artists with massive quantities of AI-created ""sounds"" and ""images"" that substantially dilute the royalty pools that are paid out to artists,"" the letter reads. ""For many working musicians, artists, and songwriters who are just trying to make ends meet, this would be catastrophic.""The letter ended with the artists calling the improper use of AI an ""assault on human creativity"" and the stealing of artists' work as ""predatory.""The Artists Rights Alliance's letter comes at a contentious time for AI in the entertainment industry.


On Wednesday, a settlement agreement was reached between the estate of late comedian George Carlin and video company Dudsey, which created an AI-generated one-hour-long comedy special using the comedian's voice and likeness to generate ""new"" material into an audio-only podcast episode.""I understand and share the desire for more George Carlin. I, too, want more time with my father,"" Carlin's daughter, Kelly Carlin, wrote in a statement in January upon the lawsuit filing.

97,7 Jobs That Pay Well and Have a Ton of Hiring Demand Right Now,"Apr 3, 2024",Juliana Kaplan and Madison Hoff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/these-jobs-have-high-pay-high-demand-report/472124,"
This article originally appeared on Business Insider. It's a weird job market right now, one that's characterized by — simultaneously — layoffs sweeping across knowledge industries and other sectors desperately scrambling to staff up.Recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the rate of hires is just a little down from where it was a year ago — 3.7% in February compared with 3.9% in February 2023. Openings for jobs have dropped from a rate of 6% in February 2023 to 5.3% this past February.



Tuesday's news release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics said February job openings ""changed little at 8.8 million"" since January. It added that ""the number and rate of hires were little changed,"" in addition to other areas that didn't see big moves.For some white-collar workers, especially those in tech, it might look like a bleak job-hunting landscape.


However, plenty of jobs are in demand, from accountants to civil engineers. Amid a skilled-trade shortage, there's a plumber deficiency, according to Bloomberg — one shortage among others that are festering.""Job postings and job openings have pulled back from their highs over two years ago, but demand for new workers is still strong in several sectors,"" Nick Bunker, the economic-research director for North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Business Insider in a March statement.BI reached out to career sites to see what demand was looking like. The job-search and -networking site Handshake, a platform largely for college students and recent college graduates, said its roles with the most job postings were powered by employers in government, law and politics, retail stores, energy, and education. Across industries, here are the roles with a multitude of openings, or an urgent need to hire.Construction workersJeffrey Greenberg/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images via BIThe construction industry needs a whole lot of workers to help with the housing crisis and other construction projects, and it has the job openings to match. A January analysis from the Associated Builders and Contractors found that the industry needed 501,000 more workers this year to keep up with labor demand. A news release from the association said that figure was ""on top of the normal pace of hiring.""Tuesday's report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics about the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey said the industry had 441,000 open roles in February, an increase from 425,000 in January.The Associated Builders and Contractors' chief economist, Anirban Basu, said in a press release that after winter's cooler temperatures, contractors anticipated staffing up even more: ""Demand for workers should remain strong through at least the first half of the year.""


Per BLS's Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics, the median hourly wage was $23.72 for construction trades workers, and the median annual wage for these workers was $49,330. That's slightly above the $46,310 for all occupations.HealthcareMoMo Productions/Getty Images via BI""Jobs related to health care and care work more generally are particularly in high demand,"" Bunker told BI in a statement. ""Job postings for Physicians & Surgeons are almost double their pre-pandemic level, while Therapy job postings are up 81%,"" Bunker said of Indeed's Job Postings Index from mid-March. Therapy-sector jobs could include occupational or physical therapists, for instance.


The need for these workers isn't going to decline anytime soon. The shortage of physicians through 2036 is projected to be about 140,000, per the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis.""Since it can take over a decade of education and residency to prepare a physician, the United States should take steps now to address future physician shortages,"" a webpage from the Health Resources and Services Administration said.Costs for this education can also add up. An Association of American Medical Colleges report found the median tuition for first-year students at private institutions for the 2023-24 academic year who were residents was $64,000. The median was $65,059 for nonresidents.But it's not just physicians who could see a shortage. National Center for Health Workforce Analysis projections show registered nurses, dispensing opticians, and pharmacists could be in short supply through the next several years. Registered nurses have a relatively high median annual wage, at $81,220.


LinkedIn data also shows the need for healthcare professionals. The platform pointed BI to its most in-demand jobs on the platform. Care specialist was the position with the fastest-growing demand, based on ""roles with the greatest quarter-over-quarter increase in share of paid job posts"" between the third and fourth quarter of 2023, a LinkedIn blog post said. However, it was just one of six healthcare-related jobs in the top 10. Sonographer and home-health licensed practical nurse are two others that made the top 10.Sign-language interpreterHalfpoint Images/Getty Images via BISign-language interpreters are in demand. Indeed data compiled for BI indicates that just over 60% of sign-language-interpreter roles are hard to fill, meaning they've been on the platform for 60 days or more. According to the BLS, interpreters and translators make a median hourly wage of $25.79 and a median annual wage of $53,640.


The National Deaf Center on Postsecondary Outcomes has said that there's a nationwide shortage of ASL interpreters, even as ""the need for interpreters who have specialized skill and knowledge has increased over the years as more and more deaf students pursue medical and technical fields.""Teacherskali9/Getty Images via BIElementary school teachers, high school teachers, and special-education teachers were among the jobs with the most postings on Handshake over the past year.


It might be a challenge to fill teacher demand as other occupations pay better for young people. ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson, previously told BI that ""wages might discourage"" young people ""when they could make relatively more or see their salaries increase faster in other industries.""The median pay for elementary-school teachers outside special education was $61,690 in 2022, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is above the national median for all jobs, $46,310. The BLS added that the median pay for secondary-school teachers outside special and career or technical education was $62,360, similar to those teaching elementary-school students.Accountants and auditorsThomas Barwick/Getty Images via BIAccording to Handshake, accountants and auditors were two of the roles that had the most job postings on the platform over the past year.That's not a surprise, considering the accountant labor shortage quietly sweeping the country, which could lead to accounting errors across firms, Bloomberg reported.""Accountants and auditors are to business as those people in the black-and-white-striped shirts are to sports. We're the referees of business,"" Steven Kachelmeier, the chair of the accounting department at the University of Texas at Austin, previously told BI's Erica Sweeney. ""Without accounting and without finance, there are no rules to the game.""The American Institute of CPAs found that in the 2021-22 academic year, the number of students earning accounting degrees fell by 7.8%, which could further exacerbate labor shortages. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median hourly wage for accountants and auditors is $37.50 — or $78,000 annually. This type of work is expected to add 67,400 jobs from 2022 to 2032.


""We're still on a downward trajectory for accounting graduates, although it's worthwhile to note U.S. university enrollment and earned degrees collectively shrank during this period,"" Jan Taylor, the AICPA's academic in residence, said in a press release. ""The AICPA remains focused on advocating profession-wide solutions to the talent shortage, and we saw increased mobilization and coordination in these efforts over the past year.""The accountant shortage is already making its mark this earnings season: The lack of accountants is delaying some companies — including Tupperware — from releasing their annual reports.Software developers and engineersPoike/Getty Images via BI


Handshake found that software developers and engineers were also among the jobs with the most postings over the past year. These workers typically get paid well. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for software developers was $127,260. There's already a lot of software developers in the US workforce — 1.59 million in 2022 — and that's expected to rise 26% from 2022 to 2032, per the BLS.Other types of tech workers may be in need of new applicants. Artificial-intelligence engineer ranked No. 10 for LinkedIn's jobs on the rise. Data from Indeed also showed that nearly 70% of Android-developer roles were challenging to fill. Also, 52% of Python-developer roles are hard to fill, per Indeed.Civil engineersilkercelik/Getty Images via BI


Civil engineers were one of the roles with the most job postings on Handshake, according to the platform. And the lack of civil engineers is being felt acutely.According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, firms are trying to lure in new engineers with higher pay, more time off, and remote work. Some were even scouring social media to try to find new recruits. The ACEC Research Institute found that in the first quarter of 2024, just over half of firms had to keep turning down work because of workforce shortages.According to a Boston Consulting Group publication in partnership with SAE International, the US will need 400,000 new engineers annually. Their analysis of BLS data found that from 2023 to 2031 demand for engineering skills would go up by 13%.""Much of the engineering gap expected in the US over the next ten years will involve unfilled positions in software, industrial, civil, and electrical engineering, amounting to a staggering 186,000 job vacancies across the US by 2031,"" the publication said.


The median pay for civil engineers is $43.24 an hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or $89,940 annually.

98,The New 'Magic Number' for Retirement Is $1 Million More Than What the Average American Has Saved,"Apr 3, 2024",Sherin Shibu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/how-much-to-retire-comfortably-heres-the-new-magic-number/472125,"
The magic number for retirement, the number that U.S. adults believe they'll need to save to retire comfortably, has skyrocketed to an all-time high of $1.46 million, according to a new study. That's over half a million dollars more than the $951,000 magic number target reported five years ago.Northwestern Mutual released its 2024 Planning & Progress Study on Tuesday with some key findings on how Americans view retirement — and how that compares to what they have saved.The study showed that the ideal retirement savings number jumped 15% from 2023 to 2024, outpacing the rate of inflation and widening the gap between goals and progress.



Related: Can You Afford to Retire? Here's How Much Americans Spend Daily in RetirementThe average amount that U.S. adults have saved for retirement is now $88,400, which is $10,000 less than the average in 2021. The current gap between retirement goals and average savings is $1.37 million.


""Anxiety about retirement is sky-high,"" Teresa Ghilarducci, an economist at the New School for Social Research, told the Wall Street Journal. Ghilarducci identified the costs of healthcare and long-term care as potential financial stressors.The magic number for retirement varies between generations — Gen Z believes they'll need $1.63 million to retire comfortably, while millennials and Gen X aim for $1.65 million and $1.56 million, respectively.In the report, Boomers said they need to save less than a million dollars ($990,000) to retire.High-net-worth individuals with more than $1 million in investable assets have a retirement goal of almost $3.93 million. This group has also more saved for retirement than anyone else, at $172,100 saved on average — but they also have the biggest gap between their high retirement goals and their current savings.


Related: 'Young People Have Lost Trust in Older Generations': BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Blames Boomers for the Retirement CrisisThe study also noted that Gen Z is starting to save at age 22 on average — 15 years earlier than when Boomers started saving and earlier than millennials and Gen X, who began at 27 and 31 years old, respectively.Gen Z also hopes to retire earlier than older generations, at 60 instead of 65 years of age or older. When compared to responses from older generations, they also believed they'd likely live to be 100.BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told investors in an annual letter last month that politicians and corporate leaders should come together to tackle the retirement crisis.


""As a society, we focus a tremendous amount of energy on helping people live longer lives,"" he wrote. ""But not even a fraction of that effort is spent helping people afford those extra years.""A 2023 survey from the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) showed that only 35% of who people retired earlier than planned said that they did so because they could afford it.Related: There's a Retirement Crisis on the Horizon — See How Your Savings Compare to the Rest of Your Generation's

On Tuesday, electric vehicle giant Tesla reported 386,810 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter, which is 8.5% lower than the same period last year. It's the company's first year-over-year decline since 2020.Analysts who spoke with Bloomberg earlier this week expected Tesla to deliver an average of 449,080 electric cars in the first quarter of 2024, down from the record 484,507 deliveries Tesla reported in Q4.Financial data firm FactSet had set an even higher estimate, at 457,000 deliveries, according to Axios. Tesla produced 433,371 vehicles in the first three months of the year.



In a statement, Tesla noted that the decline in volumes was ""partially due to the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory"" and factory shutdowns resulting ""from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin.""Tesla CEO Elon Musk at the opening of a Tesla electric car manufacturing plant in Germany on March 22, 2022. Photo by Christian Marquardt - Pool/Getty ImagesOn Monday, Tesla also raised prices in the U.S. for its Model Y electric car, which was the world's bestselling car last year according to data collected by automotive business intelligence company JATO Dynamics. It was the first electric car to hold that distinction. The base Model Y now costs $44,990 without a federal tax credit.


Tesla is on the road to a more affordable electric car, with founder Elon Musk telling investors in January that the company was ramping up to create a next-generation EV to appeal to a broader audience. The car could be built as soon as the second half of 2025, according to Musk.Related: Leaked Tesla Pay Data: How Much Elon Musk's Factory Workers Now Make Across the U.S. After Some Got Raises""Once it's going, it will be head and shoulders above any other manufacturing technology that exists anywhere in the world,"" Musk claimed on the January earnings call.Slowing Tesla expectations could be the result of more competitors in the electric vehicle space, declining demand for the cars from the public, rising interest rates — or even founder Elon Musk's reputation, per exclusive industry reports obtained by Reuters on Monday.


Tesla shares were down about 5% Tuesday afternoon.One exclusive report from market intelligence company Caliber showed that Tesla's consideration score among U.S. buyers dropped from 70% in November 2021 to less than half of that (31%) in February. About 83% of Americans connect Musk with Tesla, according to Caliber surveys.Related: 'Next Tesla' Electric Car Startups Hit Speed Bump: 'Investors Want To See Demand'Another survey that analytics firm CivicScience shared exclusively with Reuters indicated an increase in the percentage of buyers who could be steering away from Tesla. The survey found that 42% of respondents viewed Musk unfavorably, up from 34% two years ago.

Starting Tuesday, Costco members in the U.S. have access to a new weight loss program through the company's virtual healthcare platform, Sesame, which will now offer prescription medications like Ozempic.The Costco-only program is priced at $179 for three months of services for Costco members. It includes video appointments with Sesame clinicians who specialize in weight loss, prescriptions for popular drugs, such as Ozempic and Wegovy when appropriate, and support with unlimited messaging and nutrition and exercise advice.However, the program does not include the cost of medications, which can range from $950 to $1,600 per month depending on the drug, or the cost of a lab test, which might be necessary to determine eligibility.

""The number one search term of Costco members seeking primary care on Sesame was around weight loss,"" Goldhill told the outlet.Sesame doesn't accept medical insurance; the platform's bread and butter is out-of-pocket virtual appointments with medical professionals. The company stated that it keeps prices low by working directly with clinicians, who set their own prices and availability.At the time of writing, the Sesame clinicians available for appointments through the Costco-partnered weight loss program had appointments open on the same day.Drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy have exploded in popularity in the U.S. over the past few years, and health insurers are beginning to cover the weight loss drugs.

An idyllic vacation at sea turned into a full-fledged travel nightmare for eight passengers who were stranded on an African island after failing to return to their cruise ship on time — and it left without them.Six Americans and two Australians were left on São Tomé and Príncipe on March 27 after their cruise ship, the Norwegian Dawn, left the dock when the passengers missed the 3 p.m. cutoff time to reboard the ship. The ship continued its cruise up the coast of Africa.According to the stranded passengers, they were on a private tour that returned too late — though the tour operator reportedly notified the ship they were behind schedule. The Coast Guard even tried to assist with getting the late passengers on board, but they were denied entry as their passports had been turned over to local port agents once they missed the deadline, which is protocol.



Related: Carnival Cruise Ship Rescues Stranded Men in Ocean""The lovely people of São Tomé were very gracious, very hospitable. They had reached out as much as they could to help us find hotels,"" Jay Campbell, a South Carolina resident stranded on the island told Today on Tuesday morning, noting the difficulty in arranging transportation with a language barrier and currency issues. ""We were able to get to a tour agency there to arrange flights to the next port of call ... It's one of those 'You can't get there from here.'""


By Tuesday, Campbell, his wife Jill, and the rest of the stranded passengers were able to get to the next port of call in Dakar, Senegal after being unable to board at the prior port of call in Banjul, Gambia on Monday due to adverse weather conditions.The passengers were reportedly required to arrange and pay for their travel accommodations to rejoin the ship's route.""We are considering whether or not we are going to board the ship. It is in dock here in Senegal,"" Jill Campbell told Today. ""After what we witnessed, we truly believe that although there's a set of rules or policies that the ship may have followed, they followed those rules too rigidly. I believe that they really forgot that they are people working in the hospitality industry and really the safety and wellbeing of the customers should be their first priority.""


Norwegian told NBC News that it would be reimbursing passengers for their costs.""We remain in communication with the guests and are providing additional information as it becomes available,"" a spokesperson for the cruise line told the outlet.Norweigan additionally confirmed to CNN that the guests had missed the ""all aboard time"" and that it was their responsibility to have ensured that they were back at the ship at the designated time.""While this is a very unfortunate situation, guests are responsible for ensuring they return to the ship at the published time, which is communicated broadly over the ship's intercom, in the daily communication and posted just before exiting the vessel,"" the cruise line told the outlet.

102,Billionaires Are Getting Ready for Summer With Wildly Spectacular Superyachts,"Apr 2, 2024",Madeline Berg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/billionaires-and-their-superyachts-are-ready-for-summer/472036,"
This article originally appeared on Business Insider. For many wealthy boat owners, a private spa is a must-have on board. A sauna is a nice touch. A Jet Ski or two makes days at sea way more fun. And if you don't have someone on board who can whip up a Michelin-star-worthy meal, you might as well stay on land.In the world of massive yachts, there's no such thing as too much. After all, if someone spends eight or nine figures to design the vessel of their dreams — or at least $500,000 a week to charter one — more is more.



""Yachting. It's not rational; it's emotional,"" Ralph Dazert, the head of intelligence at SuperYacht Times, told Business Insider at the Palm Beach International Boat Show, where dozens of superyachts — often defined as vessels over 30 meters in length — were on display.And while there are certain classic features, such as jacuzzis and bars, what superyacht owners want is evolving, insiders at the show said. That might mean more crew members, more space for helicopters, or more water toys, but might also include manicure salons and putting greens.

Courtesy of Burgess Yachts via BI""The bar of what is the baseline expectation has increased exponentially just over the last four or five years,"" Anders Kurtén, the CEO of brokerage Fraser Yachts, said. Clients are ""spending more time on the boat and really wanting to extend the lifestyle they lead on the shore.""A lot of this can be chalked up to the pandemic. Superyacht purchases and charters spiked as life and luxury travel on land screeched to a halt. While the market has moderated slightly, the number of superyachts on order — 1,166 as of September, according to Boat International's Global Order Book — is still above pre-pandemic norms.


""What the pandemic really showed is that the appetite for being out there at sea, sort of living the marine lifestyle, is still as valid as ever,"" Kurtén said.That means there's a lot of money on the water. The total value of the 203 superyachts over 30 meters delivered last year was $6.4 billion, according to data from SuperYacht Times. New custom builds from the world's most prestigious shipyards — Lurssen, Feadship, Oceanco, Benetti — can run into the hundreds of millions. Even used superyachts at the Palm Beach show cost as much as $75 million.And it's not just traditional buyers like retired wealthy couples looking for a place to relax or celebrities looking for a place to party away from the paparazzi. New clients are often younger and have families, so want areas to work and watch movies. They also want pricey water toys, access to fitness equipment, or even pizza ovens for picky eaters.The gym aboard the Nero superyacht has 360-degree views of the water and a number of cardio and weight machines. Courtesy of Burgess Yachts via BI""This would've never happened in the nineties,"" said Giovanna Vitelli, the vice president of the Azimut Benetti Group, the world's biggest producer of superyachts. ""You would go with your beautiful woman, Champagne — the idea of yachting was much more showing off with your jacuzzi and things like that.""Pure opulence has made room for function.When Benetti's Nabila set sail in 1980, its 50-person crew, gold-and-diamond-encrusted interiors, and lavish parties captured headlines and even inspired the Queen song ""Kashoggi's Ship.""(Seven years later, Donald Trump bought Nabila for $30 million, renaming her the Trump Princess.)""Life on board was considered very formal — big formal dining rooms, boats were high on the water, you would be segregated from the rest of the world,"" Vitelli said, remembering another client who insisted on a replica of the Sistine Chapel above the dining table.


The Nabila yacht, which launched in 1980, was emblematic of a more opulent era of superyachting. Courtesy of Azimut Benetti Group via BIBut the ostentatious, palatial-like interiors that used to be highlighted in yacht brochures have made way for lists of more functional features.Rather than esoteric novelties like an extra-large safe for rifles that one builder had to construct per a Russian yacht owner's request, the superyachts on display at the Palm Beach show featured basketball courts, saunas, and ice baths.


Owners want elevators and luxury gyms. Pampering options, be it a massage room, manicure station, or a professional-grade facial machine, are a dime a dozen. Some bathrooms have fancy Toto toilets, which can cost around $20,000.Sterns (that's the back of the boat) used to be built high to guard guests' privacy. Now, they're built as ""beach clubs"" — an open swim platform.The roomy bathroom of the Triumph, which costs $650,000 per week to charter, includes a steam room. Courtesy of Breed Media via BI


And what good is a massage room if no one on board can give one? Many superyachts can hold twice as many crew members as guests, if not more. One broker, representing a boat that didn't have a masseuse, said it could be quite a ""tricky"" issue because if a charter wants one, they have to find someone who can massage guests and ""pull their weight with the crew.""""It's not uncommon to look for a deckhand who can also mix a martini, play an instrument, maybe entertain the guests with singing, and ideally even give a massage,"" Kurtén said.Of course, a crew comes at a cost. Most are considered full-time employees, requiring salaries and benefits like health insurance. Captains, first mates, and chief engineers often make six figures a year. That's without tips; a charter guest will typically spend six figures on gratuities for the crew who worked during a weeklong vacation.


The Grateful, which costs $15.9 million, exemplifies the open feel of today's superyachts — particularly its ""beach club."" Courtesy of the Azimut Benetti GroupFor the superrich, there must be room for toys.It's not just the onboard amenities that count. What's known as ""toys"" in the industry — water slides, eFoils, Jet Skis, and underwater scuba diving jets — are popular, and costs range from merely hundreds of dollars (banana boats) to millions (submersibles, which are still popular despite the recent tragedy).""Tenders and toys, the sky seems to be the limit,"" Kurtén said. ""More is more.""If you can't fit all those toys in the yacht's storage space, you can just use another boat. Jeff Bezos' support yacht is a superyacht in itself, measuring 75 meters and costing tens of millions of dollars. (His main yacht, Koru, cost a reported $500 million.)


Support yachts are also faster, meaning the crew can get to a destination first and set up the Jet Skis, seapools, and the like, Dazert said. ""By the time the owner arrives on the main yacht, everything's set up, and he can go and have fun.""Modeled after J.P. Morgan's yacht, the Nero is available to charter for about $500,000 a week. One of its custom tenders is also pictured. Courtesy of BurgessEven tenders, the smaller vessel that brings guests from the ship to the shore, are getting glow-ups. The Nero, a 90-meter beauty available to charter for about $500,000 a week and modeled after J.P. Morgan's 1930s ship, has custom-built tenders to match the design. The most expensive ones often cost seven figures. Nero has three.


""It used to be a tender was a tender,"" Jeffrey Beneville, who handles yacht insurance at NFP, told BI. ""Now they're called limousine tenders. Think of an incredibly luxurious gondola that's got a hard top so nobody's hair gets mussed when they're being dropped off at the Monaco Yacht Club.""One thing that clearly hasn't changed in superyachting: showing off. If the boat next door at the marina has an indoor-outdoor cinema, it's natural to want one too. Ditto a wine cellar or helipad.""It's a bit of a celebration of your success in life, of wealth,"" Vitelli, whose company is behind the Lana yacht Bill Gates chartered for a birthday party three years ago, said. ""You push it a little more.""And that's a boon for yacht makers and brokers catering to the super-rich.""Our job is to make clients' dreams come true,"" Kurtén said.

103,An Innovative Financing Technique is Gaining Traction — And It's a Big Factor in the Potential $9.5 Billion Subway Acquisition,"Apr 2, 2024",Alicia Miller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/this-finance-method-is-key-in-the-95-billion-subway-deal/471506,"
If Roark Capital completes its acquisition of Subway for approximately $9.5 billion, the deal will include nearly $5 billion of debt, provided by a group of several banks working together. This will represent one of the largest whole business securitizations (WBS) ever completed. Subway has around $725 million of EBITDA to support debt payments. Roark is perhaps the foremost in franchising WBS transactions, having repeatedly returned to the market using this technique across many of its other holdings to fund expansion initiatives and dividend payouts.Ironically, Subway's CEO, John Chidsey, recently discussed debt in his main stage remarks at the annual Restaurant Finance and Development Conference in November 2023, which I attended. He mentioned that he was grateful for having no debt while the business was privately held because the extra cash flow could be devoted to the business, and he didn't have to worry about debt service.Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now to find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.What is whole business securitization?Whole business securitization is debt supported by operating assets, such as franchise royalties and supply chain rebates. Over the last fifteen years, there has been a massive shift toward this capital structure approach in the largest franchise brands. WBS is an efficient approach to borrowing money because the interest rates can be lower. Royalties are shifted into their own bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity. For this reason, the entity can enjoy a higher credit rating (and thus lower interest rates) compared to the parent company. In addition to being capital efficient, it makes interest payments more predictable, and there is more prepayment flexibility. The market can be tapped again and again as the business continues to grow. The debt is usually portable if there is a change in control.



For these reasons, WBS is now the preferred structure in the largest franchise systems, whether publicly traded, PE-backed, or privately held. While large restaurant franchises are the largest users of WBS, the use of WBS by non-restaurants expanded 75 percent in the last four years, nearly double the growth rate of WBS in the restaurant sector. I cited this statistic, from Guggenheim Securities, in my book, Big Money in Franchising: Scaling Your Enterprise in the Era of Private Equity.Debt in franchisingThe use of debt in franchising has backed off the higher levels previously seen when junk bonds were in vogue decades ago. The market has gotten comfortable with securitization and prefers to see equity investments approaching 50 percent – consistent with PE deals outside of franchising.There are several implications for stakeholders, especially franchisees, in systems using the WBS approach:


Preservation of outlet count is paramount to the franchisor. For turnaround brands like Subway, this means an aggressive bet on international expansion to offset potential closures still to come in the US.Expansion markets will receive investments in support and franchise development to ensure all those new units get open and ramped up.Unless a unit's location is no longer viable, franchisors will generally fight closures and push for transfers instead.The push for transfers instead of closures in most large systems, tends to increase PE consolidators at the franchisee level. But Subway hasn't attracted PE consolidators because of unit level economics. Only improvement in unit profitability will open this potential.Transfer requirements may be more stringent.Development agreements will be more strongly enforced.New development agreements may have smaller unit commitments to ensure follow-through.Franchisors will more aggressively push remodels to preserve and boost royalties.Supply chain rebates will also be protected. Suppliers will find it difficult to make adjustments that negatively impact franchisor income streams if these have already been securitized.PE sponsors can withdraw hundreds of millions of dollars in distributions from large-scale brands often by adding debt to the business. If there is little or no corporate reinvestment in the future of the brand, franchisees must speak up. This is best managed in a professional, coordinated, and assertive manner via the independent franchisee association. Stall outs can and do occur when inertia creeps in and corporate milks cash flow too long. Franchisees must continue to assert themselves via the association to ensure shared reinvestment in the future.Smaller franchisesNote that in smaller franchise acquisitions, debt often isn't used at all. As PE has swept through franchising, there are fewer unaffiliated scale brands available to acquire. The result splits the players and their approaches. In larger deals, lower interest rates recently simultaneously fed price inflation and encouraged the use of debt, including securitized debt.But smaller deals are more likely to be all-cash, especially if tuck-in acquisitions within multi-brand platforms. The larger platform cash flow can always be securitized later when scale is achieved. Emerging brand PE sponsors are thus focused on accelerating growth, adding support infrastructure, building shared platform resources and, eventually, multiple arbitrages to help lift overall business valuation. The use of debt is not a core strategy to create value for the sponsor in these deals. In theory, this creates a close alignment of franchisee and sponsor interests within emerging brands and platforms.Prospective franchisees should assess where a brand is on the spectrum of activity and how much the use of debt is a core part of the value creation strategy for the sponsor itself. As long as appropriate investments in the future of the business are made, there is nothing wrong with the use of reasonable debt in an efficient capital structure. But when parent distributions significantly outweigh new investments in the business in a fast-changing marketplace, caution flags should be raised.

Tupperware says it delayed filing its annual report because of a lack of accountants.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. The accountant shortage is so bad that companies are delaying filing key mandatory reports.On Friday, Tupperware said it didn't have enough accountants to get its annual report out on time. The storage container manufacturer is the latest on a growing list of companies that have delayed their annual reports for a host of reasons. About 70 companies have postponed annual reports this year, up 40% from last year, research company Intelligize tallied last month.



In a regulatory filing, Orlando-based Tupperware blamed the delay on ""significant"" past and present accounting attrition, ""which has resulted in resource and skill set gaps, strained resources, and a loss of continuity of knowledge.""Tupperware added that previous delays in filing its 2022 annual report led to postponement of its quarterly reports, which subsequently pushed back work on its 2023 annual report.


On LinkedIn, the company is hiring for a single accountant, a job in Poland.Once an American kitchen icon, the manufacturer now faces a slew of business problems. In October, its external accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, dropped the company as a client. Almost a year ago, Tupperware warned investors of potential bankruptcy amid greater losses and operational costs.'Accountant staffing issues at Tupperware and other businesses are becoming an operational headache with no signs of abating.Seasoned accountants are retiring while the profession, which has a reputation for long hours and unfulfilling work, has struggled to attract younger talent. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants said that 75% of certified accountants reached retirement age in 2020. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects there will be 126,500 openings for accountants and auditors each year, on average, over the decade.


But many students say they are turned off by the fifth year of college needed for accounting courses. And accountants' average starting salary of about $62,000 looks less appealing than other higher-paying or lower-stress jobs in business.""Accountants and auditors are to business as those people in the black-and-white-striped shirts are to sports. We're the referees of business,"" Steven Kachelmeier, the chair of the accounting department at the University of Texas, told Business Insider last year.""We may not always like the referees, but sports is a free-for-all without them,"" he said, explaining that if shortages of these workers continue, accountability and integrity in business could suffer.This year has seen a slate of high-profile financial reporting errors, some of which caused stock prices to change. In February, ride-hailing app Lyft erroneously reported in its fourth-quarter earnings release that it expects profit margins to increase by 500, not 50 basis points — which led its stock to surge 60%. Electric vehicle maker Rivian and gym company Planet Fitness said they made earnings typos this year.


In a similar move to Tupperware, toy giant Mattel said in a February filing that it was unable to file its 2023 annual report due to ""certain deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting.""The Securities and Exchanges Commission can issue penalties for erroneous filings, including fines for delays and errors in financial reporting.

The U.S. is not an affordable place to own a home these days, and middle-class Americans are feeling the pinch.According to a new study by Bankrate, in 22 U.S. states, and Washington D.C., homebuyers need to have an income of at least six figures to afford a median-priced home.Citing high mortgage rates, rising prices of homes, and low housing inventory, the study found that, on average, Americans need an annual household income of $110,871 to afford the median price of a home in the U.S. which is now $402,343 — a 46% increase from just four years ago.

""The higher the price of a home, the harder it is to come up with the down payment or to qualify for the monthly payment.

What's the most unaffordable state for aspiring homeowners?It's California, of course, where aspiring homeowners must earn at least $197,057 to afford a median-priced house in the state.According to most recent U.S. Census data, the median household income in California for 2022 was $91,905, over $100 less than the median income needed at present time to purchase a median-priced house.The second most unaffordable state in Bankrate's study was Hawaii, with a necessary median household income of $185,829 to afford a median-priced home.Related: Here Are the Top 10 Most Affordable States to RetireLow inventory combined with high interest rates is contributing to the unaffordability crisis in the country, experts say, but some Realtors think despite the rough conditions, the market won't necessarily get better once conditions change.""If rates go down just another percentage point — that's what I'm hoping for by year-end — prices are going to go through the roof,"" said real estate maven and ""Shark Tank"" star Barbara Corcoran in an interview with Fox Business Network last week.

""It was a lot of fun, it's a little bit of escapism.""Related: He Owns 12 Nightlife Venues in NYC. Here's How He Stays OpenStill, immersive escapism is the bread and butter of all of Vanderpump's backed ventures — step into one of her restaurants and you'll feel as if you've been transported to another land of whimsy and magic, or as Vanderpump calls it, ""naughtiness.""For example, Vanderpump à Paris in Las Vegas, which was just voted the 11th most photographed restaurant in the U.S. by Yelp users, is situated next to the slot machines in Caesar's Palace, but once inside you're transported to the streets of France with umbrella chandeliers, marble countertops, and lush velvet finishings.

After all, as her ""Housewives"" Season 3 tagline said, life isn't all diamonds and rosé, but it should be.""Of course, I'm a producer — I want beauty, I want excitement. I want great music, I want extraordinary flowers, I want great tablescapes. But I would want that in my life anyway … It was always like that before the cameras were on,"" she says. ""You have to always bring your style to something, make it yours, and make it different. I don't like corporate things. I like the feeling of unique experiences.""


But life hasn't all been gardens and roses. Viewers watched as her friendships imploded on ""Housewives"" before she left the show, and the Covid pandemic was ""a nightmare"" for Vanderpump's businesses, she says.She had to shutter the doors of her beloved Hollywood hotspot (and first Los Angeles restaurant) Villa Blanca in March 2020 after 12 years in business, while her cocktail garden concept, Pump, shut its doors in 2023.For Vanderpump, being a reality star has led to a built-in customer base for her businesses, but it also comes with the added responsibility of millions of eyeballs on special media and the publicity that comes as a result of her (and her employees) being in the public eye.Sometimes that's to her benefit, and sometimes, not so much.""The competition is so tough out there, it's not for the faint-hearted,"" she said. ""You have to develop a thick skin. That's very, very important.""Still, there are a few rules Vanderpump sticks to when it comes to business. First, you have to love what you do.""I think that if you're really doing something that you love, your passion for that is your motivation,"" she said while adding that sometimes life can be like a game...of tennis.""If you don't like doing something, it's like playing tennis. If you like playing tennis, you're going to run for that ball just because you want to hit it,"" she mused. ""But if you're not motivated, you're not excited by what you're doing, then you don't put the energy into it. Whereas the things I do, I'm excited. I don't care how long I work. I don't care how hard I work. I will get it done.""


But in the end, it's all about staying ""focused.""""If things go wrong, you learn from it. There's the good, the bad, and the ugly, and everything really, isn't there,"" she said. ""Sometimes it's overwhelming ... If you really get going and get on it, you'll be surprised by how much you can accomplish.""

109,Fast-Food Workers in California Now Earn a $20 Minimum Wage — Here's How This Will Impact Franchising,"Apr 1, 2024",Carl Stoffers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/how-californias-20-fast-food-minimum-wage-will-impact/471968,"
In a controversial move that could set a new precedent for the fast-food industry, California has enacted new legislation that will raise the minimum wage for the majority of its fast-food workers to $20 per hour starting today. This significant wage hike, from the previous $16, has been heralded as a monumental step towards financial security for workers in a traditionally low-paying sector. However, the law now burdens business owners with additional labor costs and raises concerns about potential price increases in a state already grappling with a high cost of living.The new law, a product of the state legislature's efforts last year, was created in part to acknowledge that many of the fast-food workers in California are adults who rely on these jobs to support their families rather than teenagers earning pocket money.Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now to find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.The new lawThe new Fast Food Franchisor Responsibility Act applies to fast-food restaurants across California characterized by specific criteria. To fall under this category, a restaurant must operate as a ""limited-service restaurant,"" where there is minimal to no table service, and customers typically order and pay for their food or beverages before consuming them. Restaurants operating inside a grocery establishment are exempt.



The wage increase represents a nuanced compromise between the fast-food industry and labor unions following nearly two years of negotiations marked by confidentiality agreements and strategic concessions. It reflects a significant shift in the landscape of labor rights and economic policy in California and could serve as a benchmark for other states contemplating similar measures.Related: From Coding to Creole Cooking — Here Are 5 Inspiring Success Stories of Black-Owned BusinessesOverdue raise?Proponents of the law argue this wage adjustment is overdue justice for workers, particularly those who played crucial roles during the pandemic by ensuring Americans had access to food. Raising the minimum wage on these historically low-paying positions, proponents say, will give more financial security to workers.


Advocates also claim that it will raise the overall living standards of fast-food workers, with many pointing out that the typical U.S. fast-food worker is not a teenager earning extra money, as in years past. More than 60% of fast-food workers are women, with an average age of 27.3, according to 2021 statistics from Data USA.Related: Is Franchising Right For You?

Franchisees face daunting additional labor expenses, which will likely be offset by increased consumer prices, a reduced workforce or diminished hours — tactics already being adopted. Earlier this year, two major Pizza Hut franchisees in California laid off 1,200 delivery drivers in anticipation of the wage hike.For entrepreneurs and business owners in the fast-food sector, this new law signals a time for strategic adaptation. Balancing the increased labor costs with the need to maintain competitive pricing will require innovation. Moreover, it underscores the importance of understanding and engaging with labor legislation and economic policies that directly impact the business environment in California and beyond.Related: Find Out Which Brands Have Ranked on the Franchise 500 for Longest, Earning a Spot In our New 'Hall of Fame'Fast-food's futureThe industry's response to the wage hike will likely accelerate a shift towards automation. With operational costs climbing, investing in technology like order-taking kiosks, such as the units Dunkin' has recently installed in many stores, or culinary robots, such as Chipotle's ""Autocado,"" becomes an increasingly attractive option for keeping labor costs down and maintaining profitability.


For entrepreneurs, the law could signal a broader trend of raising wages in the fast-food sector, necessitating strategic adjustments in operations and customer pricing strategies. As California navigates these changes, the rest of the nation — and especially the franchise community — will watch closely, pondering the balance between fair wages and sustainable business practices in the fast-food industry.
