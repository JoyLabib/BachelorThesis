0,Fast-Food Workers in California Now Earn a $20 Minimum Wage — Here's How This Will Impact Franchising,"Apr 1, 2024",Carl Stoffers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/how-californias-20-fast-food-minimum-wage-will-impact/471968,"
In a controversial move that could set a new precedent for the fast-food industry, California has enacted new legislation that will raise the minimum wage for the majority of its fast-food workers to $20 per hour starting today. This significant wage hike, from the previous $16, has been heralded as a monumental step towards financial security for workers in a traditionally low-paying sector. However, the law now burdens business owners with additional labor costs and raises concerns about potential price increases in a state already grappling with a high cost of living.The new law, a product of the state legislature's efforts last year, was created in part to acknowledge that many of the fast-food workers in California are adults who rely on these jobs to support their families rather than teenagers earning pocket money.Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now to find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.The new lawThe new Fast Food Franchisor Responsibility Act applies to fast-food restaurants across California characterized by specific criteria. To fall under this category, a restaurant must operate as a ""limited-service restaurant,"" where there is minimal to no table service, and customers typically order and pay for their food or beverages before consuming them. Restaurants operating inside a grocery establishment are exempt.



The wage increase represents a nuanced compromise between the fast-food industry and labor unions following nearly two years of negotiations marked by confidentiality agreements and strategic concessions. It reflects a significant shift in the landscape of labor rights and economic policy in California and could serve as a benchmark for other states contemplating similar measures.Related: From Coding to Creole Cooking — Here Are 5 Inspiring Success Stories of Black-Owned BusinessesOverdue raise?Proponents of the law argue this wage adjustment is overdue justice for workers, particularly those who played crucial roles during the pandemic by ensuring Americans had access to food. Raising the minimum wage on these historically low-paying positions, proponents say, will give more financial security to workers.


Advocates also claim that it will raise the overall living standards of fast-food workers, with many pointing out that the typical U.S. fast-food worker is not a teenager earning extra money, as in years past. More than 60% of fast-food workers are women, with an average age of 27.3, according to 2021 statistics from Data USA.Related: Is Franchising Right For You? Ask Yourself These 9 Questions to Find Out.Layoffs, higher pricesThe business community has been vocal about the financial strain this wage increase will impose. Franchisees face daunting additional labor expenses, which will likely be offset by increased consumer prices, a reduced workforce or diminished hours — tactics already being adopted. Earlier this year, two major Pizza Hut franchisees in California laid off 1,200 delivery drivers in anticipation of the wage hike.For entrepreneurs and business owners in the fast-food sector, this new law signals a time for strategic adaptation. Balancing the increased labor costs with the need to maintain competitive pricing will require innovation. Moreover, it underscores the importance of understanding and engaging with labor legislation and economic policies that directly impact the business environment in California and beyond.Related: Find Out Which Brands Have Ranked on the Franchise 500 for Longest, Earning a Spot In our New 'Hall of Fame'Fast-food's futureThe industry's response to the wage hike will likely accelerate a shift towards automation. With operational costs climbing, investing in technology like order-taking kiosks, such as the units Dunkin' has recently installed in many stores, or culinary robots, such as Chipotle's ""Autocado,"" becomes an increasingly attractive option for keeping labor costs down and maintaining profitability.


For entrepreneurs, the law could signal a broader trend of raising wages in the fast-food sector, necessitating strategic adjustments in operations and customer pricing strategies. As California navigates these changes, the rest of the nation — and especially the franchise community — will watch closely, pondering the balance between fair wages and sustainable business practices in the fast-food industry.

1,4 Actions Start-Up Founders Need to Take (But Often Overlook) to Protect Their Business,"Mar 29, 2024",Kalon Gutierrez,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/protective-guardrails-start-up-founders-need-to-protect/470694,"
Antitrust can be defined as ""a kind of law or rule that protects fairness and competition in business."" On a company basis, issues concerning antitrust are often brought to the forefront during one-off events, such as a merger, acquisition or public offering. However, violations can also occur over a period of time as a pattern of ongoing behavior.To an early-stage start-up, the subject of antitrust may seem like a far-off topic. The notion of preparing for a legal acquisition or not unfairly infringing upon your competition can appear to be ages away, especially as immediate issues like fundraising, market launch and cash burn take precedence. Survival-related endeavors are naturally prioritized.Yet, the reality is that ignoring antitrust efforts at the start can prove detrimental to growth companies down the road when the stakes are much bigger. And in fact, overlooked antitrust issues often reveal critical gaps in the business plan itself. Future violations have been rooted in decisions that were made (or not made) early on and continued over a period of time. When they do come to the forefront, their preventable consequences can exponentially limit a company's ultimate success.



Related: The Legal Lowdown of Starting a New Business: A Startup Lawyer ExplainsWhile early-stage companies remain capacity-challenged, there are critical and manageable practices that can be undertaken in order to reduce the potential for catastrophic violations down the road. There are four key actions that early-stage founders need to take to address antitrust that both help refine a company's goals and vision while also establishing often overlooked guardrails that protect the business long-term. To illustrate more directly, let's use a case study of an entrepreneur who has built a company that creates and sells ""self-cooking hotdogs"":


Imagine an entrepreneur invented a hot dog that perfectly cooked itself at the precise time the customer wants to eat it. No grill or cooking equipment is required; rather, just one push of the button and three minutes later, it is perfectly cooked. Here are the steps this entrepreneur should consider regarding antitrust:1. Determine your core competitive advantageThis is something that your company can do that very few (or no one else) can easily replicate. For the hot dog entrepreneur, this would be the technology associated with the self-cooking capability, for which the entrepreneur should consider applying for intellectual property (e.g., a patent) before it is in market. Any attempt by an existing hot dog maker to replicate this technology would either prove difficult or could cannibalize their existing ""regular hot dog"" sales.2. Highlight how your competitive advantage helps customersIn antitrust, competitive advantages that result in consumer benefits (e.g., price, convenience, quality) are favored and encouraged by the law. On the other hand, competitive advantages that give a business a leg up over competitors but either do not help or harm consumers are where problems can arise. For our hot dog entrepreneur, the core innovation saves consumers' time, money (on power), and potentially the embarrassment of not knowing how to cook a hot dog. Clearly and consistently articulating these benefits across all aspects of branding can help the entrepreneur on both business/marketing and antitrust fronts.3. Execute a plan to overcome the market leaderOne of the most common pitfalls for startups is that the current leader in their respective space has a reputational or other sustainable advantage that it has built up over time that prevents the entrepreneur from gaining significant traction. For example, customers may be prone to the ""if it isn't broken, don't fix it"" analogy. For our innovative hot dog, a primary constraint may be that the cooking process itself provides enjoyment for customers, or there is a natural skepticism to buying a new product to eat from a company that no one has heard of before. To overcome these barriers, the hot dog entrepreneur may need to do a ""blind taste test"" campaign or perhaps partner with another company that is known to offer products used for BBQing. Over time, once the new product gains more mainstream acceptance, it will be easier to gain market share (and perhaps funding) at a rapid pace.

Determine the social benefit associated with successAs a larger proportion of the consuming public is associated with younger generations, a common success tactic has been to convey that your company is not just out to make a buck but rather to improve a global societal issue. The hot dog entrepreneur may focus on the fact that its innovation will reduce expensive and/or harmful forms of heating energy. Or food products can be donated to needy populations who do not have access to heating mechanisms.A focus on antitrust advances all of these efforts, and when successfully implemented, they provide natural and compelling defenses to future issues. Addressing them early on not only guards against future risk, but also better defines a company's competitive advantage today, thereby positioning it more strongly for both short-term and long-term success. While guised as a risk-averted practice, addressing antitrust can actually prove to be a key determinant to paving the roadmap for successful and lasting company growth.

2,How to Avoid These Common Communication Blunders in the Workplace,"Mar 19, 2024",Cynthia Kay,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-fix-poor-communication-in-the-workplace/470928,"
As the owner of a media production and communications consulting company, I see terrible communication firsthand. I want to share a few real stories illustrating three common communication problems, and then provide several ways to improve communication within a company.InconsistencyMany are jumping on the bandwagon of employee storytelling to make people feel like they are a part of the organization. A large furniture manufacturer decided to showcase employees' good work in a monthly video communication that my company produced. The manufacturer reached out to employees to have them submit their story or the story of a colleague. The senior vice president thought it would be fun to interview those selected in a talk show format. We produced a few but stopped because the leader could not find time to do the show.Communication programs that start and then fizzle out leave employees frustrated and skeptical. (Note: I warned the company against using this format. It's great if a leader has the time and is committed to this program. I did not feel it would work here. It did not.)



Another client decided to do customer webinars. They started with two a month but soon discovered that gathering the content was time-consuming and quickly fell behind. After making a big splash about the effort, they suspended the effort. They then started again with a scaled-back offering of once a month. While it did not have a disastrous effect on their reputation, it would have been better to start slowly, build an audience and then expand.Related: Correcting Leadership Communication Mishaps


Poor content and messagingGetting the messaging right is critical for communication to be successful. That means getting input from the right people at the right time. For example, one of my customers had to delay a product launch. The product was ready. However, the team working on the various communication assets failed to include key experts early on. When the marketing tools were submitted for approval, they discovered that the messaging was not on target. Print and videos had to be reworked, which increased costs and caused delays in the launch.Communication that fails to exciteSeveral years ago, a friend of mine worked at a major accounting firm. He had been lobbying to have me come in and work with some of their teams to improve their presentations. He was not successful until this happened:An audit team went in to present to a client and renew the contract for the next year. They were informed after the meeting that the business would go to a competitor. When pressed to understand what happened, the client reported that the audit team's presentation was boring. That's right, boring.I know what you are thinking: ""Audits, albeit necessary, are not really exciting to most people."" That's not the point. The client wanted to be engaged, perhaps even wowed. The team failed to communicate their excitement and desire to work with this client, and they lost the business.


Communication barriersOrganizations have great discipline when it comes to areas such as production or finance, but not when it comes to communication. Some don't recognize or prioritize the need for communication programs. They assume that it will happen naturally. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Over the years, many organizations have become siloed. Everyone has an initiative, but departments have no tools to collaborate and share information.Reliance on voicemail, email, and social media increases miscommunication because people are not talking to each other. Instead of helping us, technology becomes a reason not to communicate. While virtual meetings have exploded, few know how to be effective, whether they are leading or participating. People have gotten sloppy about preparation and presentation.These barriers can cause communication to get sidetracked and negatively impact business results, as my examples demonstrate. Much of the answer to overcoming communication barriers starts with senior executives and others in positions of influence who make it a priority.Related: How to Harness the Power of Communication When Facing Challenges


Three steps to get communication on trackThe first step to improving communication is to put a purposeful communication plan in place. One that is clear, consistent and achievable. Remember my storytelling example above? The plan does not need to be complicated. It does need to consider the entire organization — from those on the plant floor or front lines to those in the field and behind the scenes. What do people need to know? What are the best ways to communicate information so everyone can access it? What is the frequency of communication?The second step is to build an organization of good communicators. Numerous studies report that 86% of employees and executives cite ineffective communication and collaboration as the main cause of workplace failures. Communication is not simply the job of human resources, the communication, or the marketing department. Everyone needs to be engaged. Some people are naturally good at this, but most need help. There are learning opportunities that can be accessed from various sources, but be sure that the level and content are appropriate for the team.The third step is to use the right tools to share communication. This can be an internal portal, system of e-blasts, live meetings or live stream events. There are so many tools that it can be overwhelming. A communication consultant can help you navigate them, but the best advice is to use the simplest technology to get the job done. Finally, the results of the communication plan should be monitored. This can be something as simple as a communication survey.Related: How Effective Employee Communication Boosts Productivity

4,Women's History Month: 5 Powerful Women Who Paved the Way for Others,"Mar 1, 2024",Kelly Hyman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-powerful-women-who-paved-the-way-for-others/469422,"
March is Women's History Month, which, according to the official website, is about ""commemorating and encouraging the study, observance, and celebration of the vital role of women in American history."" While this deserves attention year-round, it still calls for a highlighted celebration.A rising number of prolific women continue to pave the way for others, including those in the legal field. By setting a precedent cemented in law, they've changed the trajectory of cases for the future and left the door open for other life-changing actions and opportunities to take place.Whether they were first in their profession or ruled on a case that changed history, here is a brief look at how women have emerged in the legal field, where they still face challenges and a few of the many women who have made their mark.



Evolution of female attorneys in the U.S.Between 1950 and 1970, women made up less than 5% of attorneys in the U.S. This percentage began to slowly increase over the following decades, though it wasn't until 1991 that women attorneys reached the 20% mark. But, in 2022, the number of women attorneys was still at 38%.The conversation regarding gender diversity has been a harrowing road for females to compete against their male counterparts for wage and partner equity and appointment to prestigious groups and positions. According to a 2019 ABA study, the following was reported:


48% of women missed out on a desirable assignment compared to 11% of men54% of women were denied a salary increase or bonus compared to 4% of men75% of women experienced demeaning comments, stories, or jokes compared to 8% of men82% of women had been mistaken for a lower-level employee compared to 0% of menThese discrepancies make the perseverance of women in law even more admirable, as they've overcome setbacks hindering them from the beginning. And, as the world changes and more women are being admitted to the bar and finding their way to the top of their field, it's inspiring for others to follow suit.Related: The Biggest Challenges Women Entrepreneurs Face1. Ruth Bader GinsburgRuth Bader Ginsburg is heralded for her fight for women's rights and gender equality. She is famously noted for saying, ""Women belong in all places where decisions are being made."" After attending Harvard Law School, she eventually transferred to Columbia Law School, graduating top of her class in 1959. Following graduation, she taught at Rutgers School of Law before becoming a legal partner with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in two gender equality cases, including Reed v. Reed in 1971.Reed vs. Reed was a landmark decision that found the law's dissimilar treatment of men and women was unconstitutional, and discrimination would not be allowed. Ginsburg became the founding counsel of the ACLU's Women's Rights Project and was appointed to the United States Supreme Court in 1993.


2. Sonia SotomayorNominated in 2009 to the Supreme Court by President Obama, Yale Law School graduate Sonia Sotomayor became the first Latinx and third woman to be appointed. For years before the appointment, she served as the Assistant District Attorney in the New York County District Attorney's Office before entering into private practice.One of Sotomayor's most notable cases is Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc. This case involved a disagreement between Major League Baseball (MLB) teams and players over compensation for the loss of ""free agent"" players. Her ruling on the baseball salary cap in 1995 restored the terms of the previous labor agreement and ended the MLB strike by opening day for the 1994-1995 season.Related: 3 Ways to Prevent Imposter Syndrome From Ruining Your Business3. Ketanji Brown JacksonA 1996 graduate of Harvard Law School, Ketanji Brown Jackson was confirmed as the first Black woman and first former federal public defender of the Supreme Court. Before the appointment, she served as a judge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.


Further, during her time as a commissioner for the U.S. Sentencing Commission, she was part of retroactively applying the 2020 Fair Sentencing Act, which allows those with extreme sentences for prior drug convictions to seek reduced sentences.4. Charlotte E. RayIn 1872, Charlotte E. Ray became the first Black female attorney in the U.S. She graduated from Howard University and was the first woman to be admitted to the District of Columbia bar. Though she faced inevitable challenges due to her race and gender, she argued a case in the D.C. Supreme Court in the case of Gadley v. Gadley three years after being admitted to the bar. Through her perseverance, she set a precedent for other female lawyers in other states to be admitted to their respective bars.Related: 5 TED Talks by Powerful Women Leaders That Inspire and Motivate5. Anita HillAttorney and professor Anita Hill likely has the highest notoriety from her 1991 testimony. At the time, she spoke in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual harassment she experienced from then-Supreme Court Nominee Clarence Thomas.


In her testimony, she alleged inappropriate conversations and sexual advances by Thomas during her time as his legal advisor. As a result, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which solidified employee protection against workplace discrimination.

5,5 PR Tips Any Company Can Use to Get Media Coverage,"Feb 12, 2024",Kelsey Kloss,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-hacks-any-company-can-use-to-get-media-coverage/468533,"
Here's a simple truth: Companies like yours have incredible stories and expertise to share — and that's also what makes them so primed for press coverage. In turn, press coverage is incredibly valuable for your SEO, brand awareness, marketing collateral and overall credibility.Here's how to get more visibility for your organization so you can multiply your impact and help more people.Related: Yes, You Can Still Get Organic Media Coverage — and Here's Why You Should



1. Hone in on your specific expertiseThis can be fairly straightforward in some cases: A financial institute will cover all things money-related, while a gym franchise might be the go-to for fitness tips.However, sometimes a little more creativity is needed. For instance, we work with a Tai Chi expert who covers everything from fundamental internal martial arts to stress management tips, productivity at work (the principles of Tai Chi can help with this!) and balanced walking.


Getting creative with the expertise you offer can provide you with more verticals to reach. Typically, a company's mission can be translated into several different pillars of serviceable content for the media.2. Get credentialed spokespeople for your companyFirst and foremost, journalists will look for certain letters behind experts' names. They may be PhD, MD, CPT, CCWS, RDN or a wide range of other credentials.If you're the CEO of a company but don't have specific credentials for a certain area of expertise, pass the media baton onto someone in your company who does — or hire a spokesperson for that purpose. For instance, many fruit and vegetable companies hire RDNs to comment on healthy eating topics.Make sure your spokesperson is well-versed in how to translate complicated science into easy-to-understand terms for everyday media consumers. A journalist won't come back to a source for more interviews if that source's quotes are stuffed with jargon and clunky terms.


Try to strike a balance between conversational and detailed quotes. You want your spokesperson's soundbites to have personality but also to get the core of a topic in a meaningful way. Vagueness makes for weak quotes that are less likely to be published.Related: This is the Biggest Factor Holding Companies Back From Media Coverage — and 3 Ways to Fix It3. Have research to back up your claimsWhen your company's spokesperson makes a claim like ""pine nuts help to improve heart health,"" the journalist will likely look for a specific study to back that up. You can help by providing that research for them.However, ideally, the research should not have any conflicts of interest — meaning it wasn't funded by, say, a pine nut company. It's fantastic that private companies can fund research to contribute to scientific literature, but journalists are generally encouraged not to cover studies sponsored by parties that may have a conflict of interest (or, at the very least, they need to disclose the affiliation in their coverage).


You may also find it helpful to invest in infographics to translate key information your company wants to share. Infographics help translate complex data and give the media a valuable asset to publish, benefiting their readers. At the very least, they'll help a journalist easily understand your key data points so they can relay them in an article.4. Tell your story in vivid colorMany companies have incredible stories about why they launched, usually rooted in a passion for helping others. These can make beautiful long-form features that go beyond expert quotes (a blend of both is great for your company's media portfolio).Your product or service is what a target consumer will purchase, but it's your story that will attract them in the first place — or encourage them to stay a loyal customer.Make sure your PR efforts demonstrate why you set out to make an impact and how many people you've helped as a result.Related: 5 Key Things You Need Before Launching a PR Campaign5. Give journalists a first-hand experienceJournalists are offered everything from free DNA test kits to press trips around the world. This industry typically has many opportunities to sample out services or products.However, connect with the journalist to build a relationship with them first (or hire a PR team to do this for you). Not only can it be expensive to send out samples of certain products blindly, but some may take a bit of trust-building with the journalist before they try it.For instance, if you're offering biological age testing to a journalist, they may not feel comfortable participating unless they know you and your team well already.


Get lunch with them or hop on a video call where you can chat face to face. Public relations is built around relationships, and when you can combine strong ones with your incredible story and expertise, you'll be primed for success in the media.

6,Terminating an Employee? These Are the Legal Ins and Outs You Need to Know,"Feb 7, 2024",Mital Makadia,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/terminating-an-employee-dont-make-these-legal-mistakes/468746,"
Insubordination. IP disclosure. Misconduct. Breach of restrictive covenant.All of these are legitimate reasons to fire someone, but what do HR managers and business owners need to know about the legal technicalities surrounding employment termination?Components of a legal terminationTo avoid legal issues post-termination, it's important to understand the main components of a lawful employment termination.



Make sure you identify any required paperwork to provide to the employee under state or local law. For example, in California, employees must be provided a certain form of Notice of Change in Employment Relationship as well as a pamphlet about unemployment benefits at the time of termination.Check your state's termination paycheck rules. You might have to pay your employee on the date of termination or within a certain time thereafter, despite your normal payroll cycle.Identify any legal risks in connection with the termination. For example, is the employee a member of a protected class? Have they been a whistleblower?If the termination is for performance or other ""cause"" termination, have you documented the performance issues? Has there been progressive discipline of some sort, or will this be a surprise to the employee? These are important questions because firings for performance should not be a surprise to the employee; an employee should be on notice of the performance issues and be given a chance to improve. This protects the company if the employee alleges wrongful termination. It also helps with morale; employees won't want to stay if they think they may be terminated out of the blue.Always have a witness in a termination meeting, which may benefit the company in the event of litigation. In most cases, the witness should not be a lawyer. This is to prevent that lawyer from becoming a witness in the lawsuit, which could present an issue for attorney-client privilege reasons.Related: How to Fire an Employee: 4 Ways to Make the Process KinderWhat not to say during a terminationWhile there's no guidebook for all of the things to say — and not to say — during a termination, there are some guidelines that an HR manager or business owner should heed.


Termination discussions should be short. Less is more in this case.Don't ramble on about the reasons for the termination. Don't talk about other employees; if the termination is a layoff, don't explain whose employment status is safe or why. Don't get into an argument or long exchange. Be respectful but firm.The gray areas of legal terminationA broader, more objective viewHR and legal professionals can have a broader, more objective view of terminations that are important to the company, which can help to mitigate risk. For example, a hiring manager might opt for layoffs or otherwise terminate some employees because those employees are having a harder time adapting to new software. However, this can often end up in terminating mostly older employees. It's important to think about whether there's an age discrimination issue. It's also worth considering whether the manager needs to be counseled on how to better train these employees.


High-risk termination situationsIt behooves HR managers and business owners to protect themselves from getting into high-risk termination situations. Therefore, it's important to have policies in place for documenting employment issues and progressive discipline; this can serve as a written record to support termination. This is especially helpful in situations where an employee in a protected class or situation is to be terminated. For example, you need to terminate an employee who is going on maternity leave. If their performance issues are documented, and if there was a process of progressive discipline, a company will be better prepared for an employment claim.Effective and legal use of severance agreementsSeverance agreements can be invaluable in terms of mitigating the risk of lawsuits, but the law around them changes rapidly. Don't reuse forms, and do be sure to work with a lawyer who knows current employment law at both the state and federal levels.


Related: 11 Tips for Firing an EmployeeRepercussions of unlawful terminationFailure to comply with final paycheck laws can lead to wage claims and penalties.Failure to comply with proper paperwork required by state and local law can lead to fines.Failure to document employment performance issues and engage in progressive discipline can make the company vulnerable to wrongful termination lawsuits. For example, if someone who just asked for a disability accommodation has been terminated, but the HR manager claims it's for performance reasons, a jury is unlikely to believe the manager if those performance problems weren't previously documented.


Failure to identify whether there are risks to termination can lead to making nonoptimal termination decisions. If you see that there is a high chance of an employee bringing a wrongful termination claim, you can better prepare in terms of offering severance or perhaps delaying termination while establishing a better documentation process.The bottom lineAs a business owner or HR manager, it's inevitable that you will have to terminate employees. Keeping these considerations in mind can help to protect you and your company in the long run.

7,This Free Tool 'Poisons' AI Models to Prevent Them From Stealing Your Work — But Some Say It's Akin to 'Illegal' Hacking,"Jan 23, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/free-nightshade-tool-poisons-ai-models-to-stop-art-theft/468693,"
Artists have long sought ways to protect their creative works from unsanctioned use, particularly by AI models that train on vast swathes of internet data, often without permission.Enter Nightshade v1.0: a cutting-edge tool released by computer scientists at the University of Chicago that provides artists with a digital shield to guard their creations against unwanted AI consumption, VentureBeat reported.Related: What Will It Take to Build a Truly Ethical AI? These 3 Tips Can Help.Nightshade is the ""offensive"" counterpart to its predecessor, Glaze — a tool designed to obfuscate an artist's style from AIs.Glaze's changes to works of art are ""like UV light"" — not detectable by the naked eye. ""The models, they have mathematical functions looking at images very, very differently from just how the human eye looks,"" Shawn Shan, a grad researcher at the University of Chicago, told IT Brew.



Similarly, Nightshade embeds pixel-level alterations inconspicuous to the human eye within an artwork — but its tweaks effectively serve as a ""poison"" hallucinogenic for AI, causing it to misinterpret the content entirely, according to VentureBeat. Pictures of pastoral scenes might suddenly be recognized by AI as fashionable accessories — for example, a cow becomes a leather purse.The tool is tailored for users with Apple's M1, M2 or M3 chip-equipped Macs or PCs running on Windows 10 or 11.Related: Google Sues Hackers For Making Fake Advertisements to Download Bard AI TechnologyMany artists, including Kelly McKernan — a plaintiff in the highly publicized copyright infringement class-action lawsuit against AI art firms, including Midjourney and DeviantArt — have welcomed Nightshade with open arms, per the outlet.

Last year, more than 5 million new businesses were established in the U.S. While that may be great news for innovation and the American economy, startup founders face a unique set of legal challenges that could inhibit their success.Some common issues include:Starting a company while still employed elsewhereOffering shares at different prices to investorsNot understanding capitalizationMisusing form documentsIll-documented relationshipsNot paying employees or treating everyone as contractorsImagine the following scenario: Jack and Jill were both employed at BigTechCo, but Jack left several months ago. He contacted Jill and asked her to leave BigTechCo to start a new company, HillCo (Jack may have violated a non-solicitation agreement with BigTechCo by inducing Jill to leave).



Jill says no but agrees to work with Jack on HillCo, which will pursue a line of business competitive with BigTechCo: a SaaS product. Because Jill is still employed by BigTechCo, BigTechCo probably will own any IP she purportedly makes for HillCo while still employed with BigTechCo.Additionally, Jill is probably violating a conflict of interest policy and her duty of loyalty to BigTechCo.Jack and Jill agree verbally to a 60/40 (Jill/Jack) equity split, but they never document it.Related: Ask a Startup Lawyer: How Should You Manage Co-Founder Equity?Jack and Jill copy and paste BigTechCo's terms of service and privacy policy onto HillCo's website. BigTechCo has privacy and security protections that HillCo does not offer, and HillCo is eventually sued in a class action by website visitors.Jack leaves six months into working with Jill. Jack claims he owns 50% of the company, but Jill says he is owed 40%, and only part of that should have vested. But there is no documentation about equity and no agreement on vesting.


Further, Jack says he never signed any agreement with HillCo. He concluded that he is free to use any IP he created; that he's not bound by any confidentiality provision in favor of HillCo; and that HillCo is not authorized to use IP he created.Jill decides to dissolve the entity, as it's too expensive and burdensome to fight with Jack over it.Starting a company while still employed elsewhereFirst, there may be a conflict of interest with Jill's employer and/or there may be an ambiguity as to who owns the IP she created for HillCo while still employed elsewhere. To avoid the issue altogether, Jill should have first reviewed an employee handbook or other moonlighting/conflict policy to see what consent she may have needed from BigTechCo.Reviewing her employment agreement would have enabled Jill to see what scope of IP her employer will own that she created while employed there.


Typically, she'd have been safe if she created the IP outside of work hours; if she didn't use employer facilities, equipment or confidential information in creating the IP; and if the IP is unrelated to her employer's current or anticipated business or R&D.Offering shares at different prices to investorsSome founders try to bring in early investors by issuing common stock at different prices. This can create tax and other problems for the company, as stock cannot be issued for $1/share to an investor and then to an employee for free.The best way to ameliorate this is to use convertible securities (i.e. SAFEs, convertible notes), which avoid tax problems and are simple and cheap to implement.Related: 4 Intellectual Property Mistakes Startups Make and How to Avoid Them


Not understanding capitalizationFounders sometimes do not understand how they will be diluted as they issue more shares or convertible securities.To avoid this, Jack could have used a cap table management platform, where he'd have seen how he was diluted with different instruments. He also could have conducted due diligence on appropriate documents to sign when he issued securities.Finally, Jack could have created a model cap table for his next priced round to see how he would have been diluted by convertible securities.Misusing form documentsWhile the bottom line is always top of mind for business owners, founders sometimes find ways to cut costs, including saving money by using online forms (e.g. copying terms of service or privacy policies). However, without understanding the documents, there may be agreements that cannot be fulfilled. For example, with a privacy policy, they could get sued for misrepresenting their privacy stack.


To avoid this, it's wise for founders to invest in basic forms. A good startup lawyer can draft typical forms and explain how they can be used going forward. This can prevent issues from popping up later.Ill-documented relationshipsWhile drafting contracts may be tedious, it's a necessary precaution. Bringing on co-founders and advisors without a formal agreement in place, for example, can result in disputes over terms; failure to get IP assigned; failure to have people subject to confidentiality obligations; and not actually issuing equity to people to whom it was promised.To avoid this, it behooves founders to research and complete inexpensive templates for advisor agreements, consulting agreements or stock purchase agreements as early in the relationship as possible.Related: Covering All the Bases: How to Set the Legal Framework for Your New Business


Not paying employees or treating everyone as contractorsIn the beginning of a company's life, there are typically insufficient funds to pay early employees a salary. As such, founders often hire everyone as contractors. However, this practice may be in violation of state and federal law, and it can even lead to personal liability on the part of the founders.To prevent this, founders should be judicious by hiring people who they are able to pay. Then, they can gain an understanding of the applicable law regarding wages and who can be considered a contractor.It's important to note that signing a consulting agreement does not mean the signer is a contractor. State and federal law both have standards that override any agreement.Founders should understand the risks associated with not paying people. They should also take it a step further by implementing a separation agreement, even if that employee was considered to be a contractor.


The bottom lineEstablishing a business requires work. It also requires due diligence to prevent avoidable legal issues as the business matures and as founders bring on co-founders, employees and advisors.

9,'They Are Broke or Homeless': 3-Year Cruise Passengers Yet to Receive Refunds Are Pursuing Fraud Charges,"Jan 17, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/life-at-seas-3-year-cruise-passengers-pursue-fraud-charges/468451,"
After the abrupt cancellation of Life at Sea's three-year cruise in November, more than 100 passengers are still awaiting refunds from Miray, the Turkish cruise company behind the venture.Now, they're seeking fraud charges — and navigating dire financial straits, The New York Times reported.Related: People Sold Their Homes to Board a 'Never-Ending' Cruise Around the World. But the Ship Will Never Set Sail — Here's How the Big Dream Sank.



On Tuesday, 78 intended Life at Sea cruise passengers sent a letter to Markenzy Lapointe, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, requesting an investigation into Miray. They allege the company pocketed an estimated $16 million to purchase a new ship it failed to obtain.At the time of cancellation, Life at Sea admitted that the delays and relocations were due to its failure to purchase the AIDAaura from AIDA Cruises, and promised to disburse refunds in monthly installments from mid-December through late February, CNN reported.


Many passengers had to relinquish jobs, liquidate assets and drain life savings to afford what was pitched as the odyssey of a lifetime. Most paid tens of thousands of dollars to reserve their cabins, priced from $90,000 to $975,000 for a suite. But as deadlines for repayments came and went for over a month, only four passengers received partial refunds, per the NYT.""Some people put in everything they had and now they are broke or homeless or wandering from cruise to cruise like tumbleweeds because they have no other place to go,"" David Purcell, a 78-year-old retired lawyer from St. Louis, who sold his house and car to book the trip, told the outlet.Related: I Sold My House to Work Remotely on a Cruise Ship for 3 Years — and I May Stay Aboard Even Longer. Here's What My Life Will Look Like.Miray's ownership's narrative differs, attributing the refund delays to bank blockades resulting from a slew of credit card chargeback disputes. However, many passengers refute this, per the report, claiming that their chargeback requests were a last resort after repeated refund disappointments.

11,How to Make Real Money as An Expert Witness,"Jan 3, 2024",Micah Solomon,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-make-money-as-an-expert-witness/466871,"
Are you interested in pursuing work as an expert witness? I recommend you consider it if you're seeking mind-expanding and wallet-expanding work.Let me start with my own experience because it's the bulk of what I have to go on! Here are the three types of cases to which I offer my expertise: customer service expert witness, hospitality expert witness, and customer experience expert witness.I only take cases I believe in, and I enjoy applying my own experience as a customer service consultant and customer experience consultant in a venue that's so different from where I usually spend my day and my brain cells.



Whether expert witness work replaces your main gig or doesn't (and I think generally it won't because continuing as a practitioner in your field is actually an attraction in getting this kind of work), it's a fabulous source of potential income. Money aside, I predict that you, like me, will find it fascinating to be participating in our country's system of justice.Related: New York Lawyer Uses ChatGPT to Create Legal Brief, Cites 6 'Bogus' Cases: 'The Court Is Presented With an Unprecedented Circumstance'


Do you have what it takes? Do you even want to have what it takes?There are not all that many legal barriers to you entering this field. But do you have the mindset, even the interest, for what this takes? Here are my opinions on this, based on my work and qualifications as a customer service expert witness and customer experience expert witness:• You are up for learning new things. The court system is its own beast, and I find it fascinating, at least in small doses. You may not.• You have good reading comprehension. This might sound very schoolteacher of me, but you're going to need to read the relevant documents provided to you by the firm that retains you, as well as potentially doing a roundup of everything else relevant that is out there.• You are a good and clear writer. Not always, but often, you'll be called upon to create a written opinion. And this needs to be clear and well-reasoned.


• You're reasonably steady under fire. Okay, a courtroom is rarely the scene for dramatic fireworks as you've seen on Better Call Saul or Suits. But you should expect to be badgered by opposing counsel (okay, not badgered, as that's not permitted, but behavior that comes very close to the badgering line) and even the judge.• You're willing to limit the words that come from your mouth. What I mean here is that when you get a question, you only answer within the scope of the question. Sometimes, this is as little as answering ""yes"" or ""no."" It's hard to learn for the more gregarious and passionate among us.• You truly are an expert in your field. Are you, truly? Any law firm that contacts you for this work must be convinced that you are. And then, you need to survive the likely challenges from opposing counsel to both your qualifications and the relevance of all aspects of your testimony.Let's dig into that last bullet point now.Related: Use This Secret Customer Service Technique to Boost Your Customer Retention and LoyaltyWho can be an expert witness?At this point, it's important that I caveat what I'm about to write: I am not a lawyer or legally trained. So do not use the following by itself; augment it (or entirely replace it) with information from actual legal sources, as well as, perhaps, your own reading of the laws and regulations that are relevant.As far as who can be an expert witness, there's good news: the law governing this in federal court — Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 702 — is quite broad and accommodating; it does not restrict the areas of knowledge to just scientific and technical fields but includes all forms of specialized"" knowledge. Furthermore, there are no specific education or background requirements; an expert can, in theory, be anyone who has expertise derived from their ""knowledge, skill, experience, training or education.""And in reality, many types of expert witnesses are needed by the courts. Here are a few of them that may be of interest to you:


• Business Expert Witness • Economic Expert Witness • Financial Expert Witness • HR Expert Witness • Engineering Expert Witness • Construction Expert Witness • Medical Expert Witness • Customer Service Expert Witness • Hospitality Expert Witness • Customer Experience Expert Witness (These last three are the disciplines within I share my own expertise.)Related: An Industry is Booming, But Most Don't Know About ItWhat qualifies as expert testimony?""A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if the proponent demonstrates to the court that it is more likely than not that:(a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods and(d) the expert's opinion reflects a reliable application ofthe principles and methods to the facts of the case.""NOTE: the above includes proposed changes to FRE 702 that may not yet be in effect when you read this.


After reading this, are you intrigued? If you decide to pursue work as an expert witness, I offer you my best wishes. Please be honest and give your best effort. If you do, the rest should fall into place. And remember again: none of this is legal advice, just some insight offered by a layperson.

Apple to Hold September 'Wonderlust' Event Amidst Sales SlumpThe Apple Watch Series 9 and the advanced Apple Watch Ultra 2 will be pulled from the online Apple Store on Thursday and from brick-and-mortar retail locations on Christmas Eve amid an ongoing contention with medical device manufacturer Masimo, which accused Apple of using its patented pulse oximeter technology — a key feature in Apple's smartwatches used to measure blood oxygen levels — without permission.



Apple had two months to strike a deal with Masimo to license its technology or appeal to the Biden Administration for a reversal to avoid a total ban on sales — and chose to appeal. ""While the review period will not end until December 25, Apple is preemptively taking steps to comply should the ruling stand,"" the company said in a statement, per CNN Business.But the legal battle won't impede the sales of other models, like the Apple Watch SE.

13,"The NLRB's Joint Employer Rule Faces a Barrage of Challenges, Fueling a High-Stakes Battle Over the Future of Franchising","Dec 18, 2023",Carl Stoffers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/nlrb-joint-employer-rule-rollout-delayed-amid-challenges/467053,"
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has delayed the implementation of its new ""Joint Employer Rule"" (JER). Originally slated to take effect on December 26, 2023, the revised rollout date is now set for February 26, 2024. This move comes amidst a flurry of legal challenges and political scrutiny, highlighting the complexities and contentious nature of the rule. The delay grants additional time for businesses to understand and adapt to the new regulations while legal and political debates continue to shape its final form.Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now to find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.The Joint Employer Rule's provisionsThe NLRB's updated rule broadens the definition of a joint employer, making franchisors jointly responsible for the labor practices of their franchisees. In contrast, previously, the franchisees were responsible for compliance with labor laws related to their employees. Under this new regulation, an entity could be deemed a joint employer if it controls just one of seven essential employment terms and conditions. This is a departure from previous narrower interpretations, potentially expanding the number of businesses affected. Experts say this change could redefine employer-employee relationships across various industries, not just in franchising.The rule threatens the very nature of the $825 billion franchise system and will lead to increased legal costs and franchisor oversight. It directly impacts franchise operations and businesses with subcontracting arrangements, influencing labor practices and contractual agreements. Franchisors may need to reassess their business models and contractual agreements to mitigate potential liabilities and ensure compliance.

The International Franchise Association, for instance, has vehemently opposed it, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, along with the American Hospital Association and various business groups, filed a lawsuit challenging the rule's legitimacy. They argue that it is not only arbitrary but also exceeds the NLRB's statutory authority.Additionally, political challenges have emerged, including a Senate resolution aimed at overturning the rule. This opposition reflects the broader debate over the balance between worker rights and business autonomy in the U.S. economy.

Res. 98 was introduced in Congress as a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval. Supported by organizations like the National Restaurant Association, this resolution, if passed, could nullify the rule.The resolution emphasizes the perceived negative impact on franchising and the potential for increased liability and operational complexity for franchise operators.Related: Franchise vs. Independent Business? 12 Experts Weigh the OptionsThe historical context of the JERThe joint employer rule has a tumultuous history, with its interpretation swinging between administrations. The Obama administration's Browning-Ferris Industries decision in 2015 broadened the scope of joint employer liability, which was then narrowed during the Trump administration. The current rule under the Biden administration seeks to find a middle ground, though it leans more towards the broader interpretation of the Obama era.Related: He Grew Up in a McDonald's Dynasty Then Swapped Big Macs for Lash Extensions.

Implications for businessesGiven the rule's potential impact, businesses, especially those in franchising or using subcontractors, are advised to review their agreements and labor practices. The rule's broadening scope could significantly change how businesses manage their workforce and contractual relationships. Legal experts advise businesses to closely monitor developments and seek legal counsel to navigate the changing regulatory environment.Related: How to Find a Good Franchise LawyerWhat's next?As the NLRB's joint employer rule faces a dynamic and challenging path ahead, businesses are in a state of anticipation.

Passengers who plan to consume cannabis products on their next cruise vacation might hit some turbulent waters.Amid the growing legalization of marijuana in 24 states and Washington D.C., cruise lines remain steadfast in prohibiting cannabis in all its forms — from flower to edibles — on board their ships, aligning with federal law and the cannabis regulations of popular cruise line destinations, The Wall Street Journal reported.Related: Carnival Cruise Line Bans Woman for Life Who Tried to Bring CBD Gummies on Board



Companies such as Carnival Cruise Line are deploying drug-sniffing dogs and issuing repeated pre-voyage warnings to enforce these restrictions, but inconsistent administration has created a climate of fear and confusion among passengers, per the outlet.In August, a Texas woman received a lifetime sailing ban from Carnival for CBD gummies found in her luggage, and in September, a 25-year-old TikTok influencer was asked to disembark in Jamaica after getting caught smoking marijuana. Despite this, online cruise forums buzz with covert strategies for sneaking substances on board.


Royal Caribbean Group, Norwegian, Virgin and Disney Cruise Lines all prohibit CBD products and recreational and medical marijuana, The Miami Herald reported.The stringent policies aren't just about complying with the law; they may also have a financial undertone. Given that alcohol sales are a key profit stream for cruises — which similarly impose restrictions on how much alcohol passengers can carry on — defense lawyers for those charged with possession contend that the cannabis ban conveniently eliminates competition for on-board beverage consumption, per the WSJ.Roughly 62,000 drinks are consumed during a 7-day cruise, which averages 33 drinks per week, or 4.7 alcoholic drinks per day, per passenger — adding up to more than $20 million in revenue annually per ship, according to cruise review site Cruiseline.Related: Carnival Cruise Is Phasing Out a Ship Amenity That's Beloved By Some — and Completely Unknown to Others

16,The Shocking Claim You've Seen About Organized Shoplifting Isn't True. Here's Why Everyone Believed It.,"Dec 11, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/nrf-retracts-45-billion-organized-shoplifting-statistic/466747,"
The National Retail Federation (NRF) just retracted a startling statistic that's been making headlines for nearly two years.In its initial report, the NRF claimed that half of the retail industry's $94.5 billion in losses in 2021 were due to organized theft, resulting in an astounding $45 billion in losses. Now, the organization admits it was overstating the impact of organized shoplifting on the retail industry, CBS News reported.Related: 'Increasingly Serious' Retail Crime Is Hitting Another Beloved U.S. Retailer Hard — and Its CEO Reveals a Bleak Trajectory



The issue began with the misrepresentation of an inaccurate figure drawn from Senate testimony by Ben Dugan, the President of the National Coalition of Law Enforcement and Retail.Spokeswoman for the NRF, Mary McGinty, told The New York Times that the mistake occurred when an analyst from an outside advisory firm, which helped produce the report, linked to Dugan's quote in the 2021 survey.


Dugan incorrectly cited the $45 billion figure, which was pulled from a 2016 National Retail Security Survey referring to the overall cost of shrink in 2015. Retail ""shrink"" is an industry term for merchandise losses from various sources, such as improper scanning, vendor fraud, and fraudulent returns.Trevor Wagener, the chief economist at the Computer & Communications Industry Association, told the outlet that organized shoplifting is likely responsible for just 5% of shrinkage from 2016 to 2020.New data from the Council on Criminal Justice shows a 16% increase in shoplifting reports across two dozen cities from 2019 to early 2023. This suggests a shift in criminal activity, though when New York City's data is extracted, an opposite trend of a 7% decrease across the other areas emerges.The NRF has retracted the false claim and amended its report, but it continues to assert the severe and pervasive nature of organized retail crime against businesses of all sizes. Some retail giants, like Target and Walgreens, have cited the spike in retail crime as a factor in their decisions to shutter stores.


Related: Major U.S. Retailers Urge Congress to Help Amid Smash-and-Grab Crime SurgeBut some experts have their own suspicions. Investment bank William Blair sees these actions as potential distractions from underlying business issues, per CBS. Retail analyst Neil Saunders backs that perspective, too, arguing that while crime is undeniably an issue, the actual scale remains elusive due to a lack of concrete data. Saunders calls for a better-defined quantification of the problem rather than the prevalent rhetoric.

We view this lawsuit which was filed by the same law firm as a previous claim to be equally without merit. Panera stands firmly by the safety of our products.""


Panera's mobile app now includes a warning: ""Consume in moderation, not recommended for children, people sensitive to caffeine, pregnant or nursing women.""Panera Bread's website currently lists its Charged Lemonade, which comes in three flavors, as having 219 mg to 235 mg of caffeine for a 30oz beverage.However, various previous reports including one from NBC News claim that the drink contains about 260 mg to 390 mg of caffeine, which is near the FDA's 400-mg daily caffeine maximum intake.This means 30 ounces of Charged Lemonade could contain more caffeine than both Red Bull and Monster energy drinks, which have 80 mg and 160 mg respectively.RELATED: College Student's Tragic Death Sparks Legal Battle as Parents Sue Panera Over High-Caffeine 'Charged Lemonade'

The entity managed various trademark, social media and website assets.



Hall is claiming Oates attempted to sell his stake in the venture to Primary Wave Music, a New York company with a focus on marketing estates and song catalogs. Hall's legal representatives sought to stop Oates from advancing any sale, and on November 30, a judge agreed to block the deal until an arbitrator settles the dispute, or until February 17.

The company previously acquired interests from the songwriters Sara and Janna Allen, integral to some of Hall & Oates's most significant works.


Primary Wave, which has acquired some of the biggest catalogs in music — from Kurt Cobain's to Bob Marley's, Whitney Houston's and more — forged a $2 billion partnership with Brookfield Asset Management (with CAA as a strategic partner) to invest in even more catalogs last year, Variety reported.Related: Nelly Is 'Shaking a Tailfeather' All the Way to the Bank.

Colorado could be the next state to pass a landmark law outlawing weight discrimination, or ""fatphobia.""The anticipated legislation, which prohibits discrimination based on weight in housing and the workplace, is expected to come into effect in 2024, per NewsNation.Related: These Are the Most (And Least) Happy States in the U.S. 2023, According to a New Report



Up until 2021, Colorado was the ""thinnest state in the U.S."" with the lowest prevalence of obesity, per The Denver Gazette. That year, its estimated obesity rate jumped from 24.2% to 25.1%, edging just past Hawaii's 25%.Still, Colorado residents remain some of the fittest in the country, due in part to ample access to trails, mild weather, and ""a highly educated population churning and burning more calories at altitude,"" NPR reported.


Colorado's latest move is in line with recent legislative actions in states such as New York, which also enacted a similar anti-discrimination law. But Michigan led the way back in 1976 with the first law that banned weight-based discrimination as well as discrimination based on age and height.Related: These Are the 10 U.S. States With the Happiest (And Unhappiest) Employees, According to a New ReportWith obesity rates on the rise nationwide, the push to protect overweight persons from bias is gaining traction with consideration of related bills in Massachusetts, Vermont and New Jersey.The Obesity Action Coalition hails the move as a critical advancement in combating weight stigma, bias and discrimination, signaling a potential national shift in attitudes toward obesity.

      Key Takeaways    



        The new Joint Employer Rule broadens the definition of joint employment, potentially making franchisors liable for employees they don't directly employ or manage.
      


        The rule is expected to have several detrimental effects on the franchise system, which contributes more than $825 billion to the U.S. economy. 
      


        Under the new rule, franchisors might be held accountable for employment decisions made by franchisees, which could lead to increased centralization and oversight by franchisors.
      


        The expanded joint employer standard could lead to a significant increase in litigation, as franchisors become legally responsible for a wider range of employment issues. 
      












Entrepreneur Magazine Editor-in-Chief Jason Feifer spoke on Wednesday with franchise industry experts and leaders regarding the National Labor Relations Board's new Joint Employer Rule, which threatens to upend the $825 billion franchise market. Included in the discussion were Sarah Bush, General Counsel at the International Franchise Association (IFA), Matthew Haller, President of the IFA, and David Humphrey, IFA Chair and Planet Fitness franchisee.Related: To stop the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)'s action you can write to your representatives in Congress through our link. Just click here and we have already drafted a letter to send. The NLRB's new Joint Employer Rule makes franchisors jointly responsible for the labor practices of their franchisees, whereas previously the franchisees were responsible for compliance with labor laws related to their employees. This threatens the very nature of the $825 billion franchise system and will lead to increased legal costs and franchisor oversight. The main issues discussed in the webinar were:The National Labor Relations Board's new rule expands the definition of a joint employer. Previously, a franchisor could be considered a joint employer only if they exercised direct and immediate control over a franchisee's employees. The new rule broadens this definition, potentially making franchisors liable for employees they don't directly employ or manage.This change disrupts the traditional franchise model. Currently, franchisees operate with autonomy, managing their hiring, firing, and wage-setting practices. Under the new rule, franchisors might be held accountable for employment decisions made by franchisees, which could lead to increased centralization and oversight by franchisors.Related: To learn more about the NLRB's act, please visit SaveLocalBusinesses.com.



The expanded joint employer standard could lead to a significant increase in litigation. Franchisors will become legally responsible for a wider range of employment issues.Negative economic impacts are predicted. This will include potential losses in franchise business activity and job opportunities, increased costs due to compliance and litigation, and barriers to entry for new franchisees.Efforts are being made to challenge and overturn the rule. The International Franchise Association (IFA) is advocating for congressional action through the Congressional Review Act and has also filed a lawsuit challenging the rule. These efforts aim to preserve the traditional franchise model and mitigate the rule's negative impacts.Do your part to save your business! Franchisees, franchisors, and industry stakeholders are encouraged to engage with lawmakers and participate in advocacy efforts. The IFA emphasizes the importance of the franchise community's involvement in influencing policy and legal outcomes to protect the franchising model.Learn more: This New Government Rule Threatens to Disrupt the $825 Billion U.S. Franchise System

21,What Employers and Employees Need to Know About These Tricky Parts of Employment Agreements,"Nov 13, 2023",Mital Makadia,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-to-know-about-these-tricky-employment-agreements/459437,"
You recently established a business and have started extending employment offers. Your new hires will have to complete some paperwork, including payroll, retirement account, employee handbook review and more.But what happens when you give your new hire a non-compete or confidentiality agreement?It's important for employers to understand what these types of agreements — restrictive covenants — mean for employees and employers alike; and what the recourse is if and when one is breached.



Related: 5 Situations That Require a Non-Disclosure AgreementRestrictive covenants: An overviewRestrictive covenant agreements typically refer to agreements entered into by employees upon hiring that prohibit certain actions during and/or after employment. Restrictive covenants can also appear in agreements presented to employees in other contexts.


Separation/severance agreements often have restrictive covenants. Also, if you are acquiring a company, you may (particularly for a key employee with a significant equity stake in said company) ask sellers to sign an agreement with restrictive covenants.The most common restrictive covenants are:Confidentiality: To keep employer information confidential.Non-solicitation: To not solicit or induce certain parties from doing business with the employer. Non-solicits can prevent employees from inducing other employees to leave their employment with the employer and can also prevent employees from inducing customers or vendors to cease doing business with the employer.Non-competition: To not compete with the employer; this can be limited to working for or starting a competitive business. It can also prohibit owning competitor shares.Non-disparagement: To not make statements (or sometimes even act in a manner) that disparage or criticize the employer. Depending on the breadth of the non-disparage agreement, an individual may also be prevented from disparaging the company's directors, officers, employees, shareholders and other agents.Related: Are You Using Non-Disclosure Agreements as Preventive Measures or Backup Plans?Why ask your new hire to sign a restrictive covenant?As an employer, there are clear reasons that you may want to impose these restrictions. If an employee has access to confidential information, you want to ensure your employee is bound to maintain that confidentiality.


Non-solicitation and non-compete agreements ensure that an employee is not at odds with your company's interests. It wouldn't make sense for an employee to compete with you while employed by you — or solicit customers to leave.Non-disparagement is also understandable during employment. Morale is compromised when an employee disparages your company, and the spreading of negative information reflects poorly on both your company and the employee.Upon termination, non-solicitation and non-compete covenants become dicier. On one hand, as an employer, you may argue that you've invested time and resources in training employees and facilitating relationships between your employees and vendors/customers. This becomes more challenging if the employee simply leverages the training and relationships for personal gain after they leave.Conversely, non-competes also make it hard for an employee to carry out their chosen profession. Similarly, non-solicits can make it difficult for an employee to carry out tasks for a new employer.


For these reasons, some states (e.g. California) ban non-competes. Other states and the federal government are considering the same. Many others carefully scrutinize non-compete and non-solicits to ensure they are in effect for a reasonable duration and are of a reasonable scope. Hence, these covenants, if they survive termination, usually do so only for a year or two.You're a new hire and signed a restrictive covenant. Now what?Confidentiality: The recourse depends on the context. Most confidentiality terms in employment agreements are non-controversial. However, it does become controversial if your employer uses a confidentiality provision to stop you from engaging in certain protected activities, like discussing wages and working conditions; whistleblowing; or discussing sexual harassment or discrimination. Provisions that prohibit protected activity may be void, and as an employee, you may be able to sue your employer if such a provision is imposed on you.Non-solicits/Non-competes: In states like California, you can sue your employer if they impose a post-termination non-compete or customer non-solicit on you. In other jurisdictions, with an overbroad non-compete or non-solicit, you can litigate the issue.Non-disparagements: This is a bit of a new frontier. Recent laws in some states limit how broad a non-disparagement can be, in that an employer cannot prohibit an employee from discussing activity in the workplace that is believed to be illegal or exposing sexual harassment or discrimination. The National Labor Relations Board has also taken a stance that would render most non-disparagement provisions for non-supervisory employees unenforceable — except in narrow circumstances.


Related: How to Draft a Non-Compete Agreement That's Actually EnforceableYour employee breached a restrictive covenant or won't sign one. Now what?As an employer, you can sue if an employee breaches a restrictive covenant. You can try to get an injunction and even seek damages. Although it can be costly to litigate such a lawsuit, it is important for employers to protect their interests.There can be other ways for an employer to protect their rights. For example, ensuring future employers know that the employee is subject to restrictive covenants can help mitigate potential issues, as the future employer may be less willing to take a risk in being involved in a violation of contractual obligations. In an employment agreement, the employer can include a provision that requires the employee to disclose the identity of new employers for a period post-termination; and that allows the employer to disclose the restrictive covenant agreement to such future employers.Additionally, in a separation agreement context, there can be additional protections. An employer can have severance paid out over a period of time conditioned on the employee's compliance with restrictive covenants. In that case, if the employee breaches, the employer can cease making payments.


If an employee refuses to sign a restrictive covenant, get legal advice before retaliating against them. Depending on where the employee lives/works, you can get into even more trouble for retaliatory actions.For example, certain states make it unlawful to impose a violative non-compete on an employee, like California, Illinois and Washington state. Additionally, in some states, it is unlawful to retaliate against an employee for complaining about unlawful activity (like trying to impose an unlawful restrictive covenant agreement). Employees might be able to sue for wrongful termination or retaliation if the employer fires, demotes or otherwise takes punitive steps against the employee for such complaints.Moreover, there are even states where post-employment actions (cease and desist letters, lawsuits) against an employee, if brought in bad faith and in retaliation for protected activity (complaining about an unlawful restrictive covenant agreement), can give the former employee the right to sue the employer. Minnesota's Human Rights Act, for example, can impose liability for such post-employment conduct.

22,Former PR Exec Accused of Involving Celebrities in 'Fictitious' Campaigns Pleads Guilty to Defrauding Victims Out of $3.8 Million,"Nov 2, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/ex-pr-exec-pleads-guilty-to-multi-million-dollar-scheme/464776,"
Andrew Garson, 41, a once big-time public relations executive based in New York City, pled guilty in a Manhattan federal court on Wednesday for involvement in a scheme that ultimately defrauded his former employers out of millions.Despite having an established career and earning accolades, including being named a ""40 Under 40"" public relations executive by PRWeek magazine in July 2018, Garson spent years deceiving and causing substantial financial harm to his employers.According to court documents, between approximately 2014 and 2018, Garson held executive positions at two marketing public relations agencies in New York, referred to as PR Firm-1 and PR Firm-2. During his time at the firms, Garson covered expenses from PR Firm-1 by making unauthorized payments from PR Firm-2, causing the latter to ultimately pay for many of the projects and campaigns led by Garson at PR Firm-1. Garson also used his company credit card to buy a luxury watch for $14,000, falsely claimed it was for a client's event production, and later sold it for $4,000 and pocketed the funds personally.



Related: Christian Influencer Found Guilty of Defrauding Dozens, Ordered to Pay Nearly $90,000Furthermore, Garson submitted multiple reimbursement requests for the same expense, causing PR Firm-2 to reimburse him more than once for the same expense. Once his fraudulent behavior came to light, Garson was fired from PR Firm-2, after which he deceitfully obtained more than $5,000 in unemployment benefits from the New York State Department of Labor by providing false information about his separation from the company.


""Andrew Garson betrayed his employers time and time again, causing millions of dollars in losses,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. ""Garson's fraud scheme was multifaceted and manipulative, and he has now admitted to greedily exploiting his employers' trust to line his own pockets.""Garson, who pled guilty to one count of wire fraud, will pay $3,754,068 in restitution to the victims of his crime, and his sentencing is scheduled for February 28, 2024. Wire fraud carries a maximum 20-year sentence; a federal judge will sentence him.Separately, Garson was hit with a $10 million civil lawsuit in November 2020 from one of his former employers, alleging that during his tenure as an executive vice president for sports and entertainment projects, Garson deceitfully acquired $2.5 million. The former employer accused him of manipulating budgets and fabricating marketing campaigns, some entirely ""fictitious.""The lawsuit claims that he convinced celebrities such as Megan Fox and Mindy Kaling to participate in unauthorized projects. When the stars requested payment for their involvement, the firm was hit with ""demands for payment and/or lawsuits"" for ""over budget"" projects that were never approved. The lawsuit is still pending.

On Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and several large brokerage firms were found guilty by a federal jury in Missouri of conspiring to intentionally keep real estate agent commissions high, resulting in nearly $1.8 billion in damages, The New York Times reported.The lawsuit was initiated by nearly 260,000 home sellers in Missouri, Kansas, and Illinois from 2015 to 2022, alleging that the NAR, along with prominent brokerages like Keller Williams, Anywhere, Re/Max, and HomeServices of America, had conspired to inflate the commissions paid to real estate agents, ultimately impacting the cost of home transactions for both sellers and buyers.The plaintiffs argued that the rules set by NAR, particularly the ""cooperative compensation rule,"" mandated that a home seller was obliged to pay commissions to the agent representing the buyer, which sellers claimed led to excessive fees for their agents, limited competition, hindered negotiation, and maintained high commission rates.

The verdict could help overhaul the existing real estate system in the U.S., forcing professionals to reevaluate commission structures and foster increased competition, which could benefit consumers by lowering costs.For example, under the current system set by NAR, a home seller must pay commissions to the agent representing the buyer. However, the verdict changes this by no longer requiring sellers to pay their buyers' agents, allowing agents to set their rates, potentially reducing them significantly.""It's a wake-up call for real estate agents,"" Sissy Lappin, the owner of a real-estate brokerage in Houston, told The Wall Street Journal.Related: Fake Property Manager Allegedly Defrauded Would-Be Renters Over $200,000

24,The Truth About the Support Franchisees Will Get After Opening for Business,"Nov 1, 2023",Scott Greenberg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/support-franchisees-can-expect-after-opening-for-business/463744,"
Franchisees aren't always clear about what their franchisor's role will be. Often their expectations exceed the scope of what's in the franchise agreement. It's important to understand your franchisor's function and limitations so you can plan accordingly. Let's break it down by three factors:CircumstancesIt's reasonable to expect your franchisor to monitor everything impacting the business climate. They should stay current on legislation, the competition, and consumer tastes. But like you, they can't control circumstances. They can only respond, hopefully quickly and effectively. And sometimes even that's not possible.At its peak in the early 1980s, Fotomat had more than 4,000 locations (company-owned and franchised) offering overnight film development in their iconic yellow kiosks. Then competitors entered the market with larger outlets that could offer one-hour service, and digital photos finally put the entire film processing industry out to pasture. Circumstances changed radically and rapidly. Fotomat didn't stand a chance.Related: Why You Should Buy a Franchise Instead of Starting Your Own



Our franchisors can't stop innovation, control the weather, or reduce minimum wage. They don't control what the competition does. We should expect them to keep watch, work hard, and pivot as much as they can. But they're not fortunetellers or magicians. Stuff happens. We assume risk when we sign the franchise agreement. We can't pin it all on them. That shouldn't scare you any more than going into business without a franchisor. At least in this model you have a team of people working on your behalf, who have information and contacts and resources. As they say in the franchise industry, ""You're in business for yourself, but not by yourself."" When circumstances turn against you, your odds are better when you're part of something larger. Just keep your expectations reasonable.OperationsThis is where your franchisor provides the most value. They've figured out a system, and they're handing you the manual. When they improve the system, they give you the updates. They're constantly trying new things and testing them. They're hiring marketing personnel to help you get the word out and negotiating with vendors to get you better pricing. The whole idea of buying a franchise is to have access to a proven system. If you replicate a process that has worked many times in many places, it's reasonable to expect it will work for you, too.Related: Busting the Myths of Franchising


But many franchisees can't resist tinkering with the system. They do things a little differently. They paid for the recipe but swap out an ingredient or two, thinking they'll get a better result. Once they do that, they've raised their risk factor. I met Tim Davis, president of The UPS Store, who had an interesting take on this. He said, ""One of the advantages of buying a franchise is to help mitigate risk. Your investment is safer when put into a proven system. When you deviate from that system, you expose yourself to the very risk you paid to avoid."" But sometimes it sure is tempting, especially for impassioned, proactive franchisees who are natural go-getters. ""There are two sides to driven franchisees,"" Tim told me. ""It's great that they're aggressive about their business, but sometimes that comes with a hunger to go beyond the system and start experimenting.""A good franchisor has a system for franchisees to submit ideas. Most franchisors will tell you some of their best ideas come from franchisees. Once you've really tried their system, it's good to make suggestions. But remember, the whole reason for buying into a franchise is to outsource innovation. Let your franchisor do the R&D. Let them experiment in their company-owned locations and figure it all out for you.Related: How to Be A Wealthy FranchiseeThe wealthy franchisees I've talked to thrive not from innovation but from execution. They strive to exceed brand standards but rarely deviate from them. I had a great conversation about this with Rhoda Olsen, vice chair of Great Clips. This franchisor has been in the hair salon business for decades: experimenting, testing, measuring, making mistakes, and making discoveries. They have an enormous pool of talent at their corporate office and in the field and boast data from thousands of locations. They always listen to franchisees, but generally speaking, they know their business. They've built a system, and it works extremely well for those who follow it. Rhoda tells franchisees, with all due respect, ""Your role is to do it. Our role is to think."" They may as well. That's what they're paying for. So are you.Your franchisor's main job is to create and hone the systems you need to run your business. Hopefully, you examined those systems prior to joining the brand. They should train you on these systems, improve upon them, and support your execution. All you have to do is execute.Related: The One Element Your Franchise Can't Afford to Ignore


HumanityFranchisors understand the need to master the human factors, but it's not part of their daily conversation with franchisees. Franchisors are not psychologists; they're experts in ice cream and home improvement. They know how to profitably sell sandwiches and oil changes. They're brilliant at tutoring and pest control. Franchisors specialize in developing reliable, replicable systems for selling specific products or services. Mindset enhancement is not part of the arrangement. But this is what franchisees need most if they want to build their enterprise. Many franchisors have admitted to me they could do more in this area. Others have said they've tried to have these conversations, but some franchisees aren't open to it. (I guarantee those aren't the wealthy ones.) Some franchisors do provide more of this kind of support and are reaping the benefits. Kitchen Tune-Up CEO Heidi Morrissey noticed a major acceleration in unit growth when she started her daily five-minute motivational ""Stay Tuned"" podcast, which 98 percent of her franchisees listen to. ""Growth is not just about doing more jobs,"" Heidi said. ""Growth starts with you being able to decide that you can do more jobs."" Anytime Fitness founders Chuck Runyon and Dave Mortensen captured their balanced approach to work and franchise support in their book Love Work. Their philosophy for supporting franchisees centers on the four elements of ""people, purpose, profit, play."" They sent me the book before my first presentation for them to ensure I would support this philosophy. They don't just want to train their franchise partners. They want to inspire them.Related: The Most Common Problems Franchisees FaceAnytime Fitness is so big on the human components of their operation that they actually named their parent company Self-Esteem Brands, with a corporate mission of ""Improving the self-esteem of the world."" That starts with their franchisees, and they clearly feel it. The result is more than a love fest—Anytime Fitness is now the largest fitness chain on the planet. One of the real masters of franchisee mindset is Jersey Mike's founder and CEO, Peter Cancro. Though very much a franchisor, Peter has had the wealthy operator mindset since he purchased the original Mike's Subs as a teenager. Peter shared his philosophy with me over breakfast in Laguna Beach. He said, ""I always knew we had so much more than a sandwich shop. We had an opportunity to touch people's lives. That's our mission, 'making a difference in someone's life.'"" And they do, through great customer experiences, support for franchisees and team members, and community involvement. With that focus, Peter's one original shop has grown to thousands of locations that have generated billions of dollars in revenue and tens of millions of dollars for charity and ownership opportunities for deserving store managers. Peter has proved that you can make money while making a difference. Peter personally vets every franchise candidate to ensure they're a cultural fit for Jersey Mike's. Ninety-five percent don't cut the mustard (my pun, not his). Those who do are treated like family. ""I tell my area directors, 'When you show up at a store, don't be a policeman. Be a fireman. Come with care, not a clipboard,'"" he said.These franchisors aren't just cheerleaders. They have rock-solid operations, crunch numbers, and hold their franchisees accountable. But they also realize that their franchisees experience their businesses emotionally as well as financially, and they want to build their confidence along with their competence. This is what franchisees need. Not just knowledge of how to remodel a kitchen, market a fitness center, or reduce food waste. They also need to learn how to manage their emotions and think at a higher level. Ideally, your franchisor will provide both operational and motivational support. But if I had to choose, I'd still choose a franchisor that excels at operational support.You need systems, branding, and a good product or service. You can find plenty of other resources to help you manage the human elements impacting your performance. Just remember to nourish your head as much as your body. Our best time is spent on the factors we can control. There's not much we can do about external circumstances. Operations, of course, is the core of the business. But the internal human factors determine how well we execute those external operations.

Two United Airlines flight attendants brought a lawsuit against the company last week, claiming they were denied positions on a charter flight for the Los Angeles Dodgers because the MLB players preferred ""white, young, thin women who are predominately blond and blue-eyed."" The Dodgers are not named as defendants in the suit.The flight attendants, Dawn Todd, 50, who is Black, and Darby Quezada, 44, of mixed Mexican, Black, and Jewish descent, alleged that they didn't have a ""certain look,"" and claimed the airline denied them roles based on racial and physical biases.""United fosters an environment of inclusion and does not tolerate discrimination of any kind,"" United Airlines said in a statement to Entrepreneur. ""We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.""In the lawsuit filed with the Los Angeles County Superior Court, the flight attendants claim they were discriminated against after originally being chosen for the Dodgers charter flight program — but then taken off the schedule. Todd and Quezada emphasized their 15 years of combined experience with United and are seeking unspecified damages and a jury trial. The lawsuit claims the treatment they received has resulted in lost income and has negatively impacted their health, causing panic attacks, anxiety, sleep conditions, and a decline in self-esteem.Related: United Airlines to Pay $30 Million Settlement to Quadriplegic Man Left in Vegetative State After Flight



The lawsuit references a prior case; United Airlines settled an allegation in 2020 regarding the staffing of flights with attendants who were ""young, white, female, and predominantly blonde and blue-eyed."" The current lawsuit draws from this settlement, noting a change in 2022 when several white flight attendants were ""blatantly selected by United's management…because of how they looked.""The lawsuit claims that, unlike Todd and Quezada, these newly added attendants did not have to interview for their positions, whereas the plaintiffs had to undergo ""extensive"" interviews to secure a position.

Carnival Cruise Line was found to have been negligent by an Australian judge in a class action lawsuit for embarking on a voyage that spread Covid-19 to over 600 passengers. The lawsuit included more than 1,000 people, per Reuters.Per the lawsuit, the Ruby Princess ocean liner, owned by Carnival and its subsidiary Princess Cruises, set sail from Sydney, Australia to New Zealand on March 8, 2020, with 2,671 passengers aboard, despite growing health risks in the early days of the pandemic, per ABC News.On the voyage, 663 passengers contracted the coronavirus and 28 died. What was supposed to be a 13-day cruise ended up returning two days earlier than anticipated due to Australia's closing borders.



RELATED: 'Blood-Curdling Scream': FBI Investigating 'Stabbing' on Carnival Cruise ShipAustralian Federal Court Justice Angus Stewart ruled that Carnival failed to take proper safety precautions and protect passengers from the risks of Covid.


Before setting sail, Carnival had experienced Covid outbreaks on the Grand Princess off California and the Diamond Princess off Japan in February, according to the judge. Additionally, just one day after departing from Sydney, on March 9, Carnival offered free cancellations for all cruises worldwide with no explanation to customers before suspending all cruises on March 13.""The respondents knew or ought to have known about the heightened risk of coronavirus infection on the vessel and its potentially lethal consequences and that their procedures for screening passengers and crew members for the virus were unlikely to screen out all infectious individuals,"" Stewart said, according to the outlet.RELATED: Carnival Cruise Phasing Out Beloved, But Underused Amenity""To the respondents' knowledge, to proceed with the cruise carried significant risk of a coronavirus outbreak with possible disastrous consequences, yet they proceeded regardless,"" he added.


The lead plaintiff in the class action lawsuit, Susan Karpik, sued Carnival for over AU$360,000 Australian dollars ($230,000). She was awarded AU$4,423.48 ($2,823.28) for her medical expenses with the judge noting that Carnival had refunded all passengers' fares. Those who had more severe health issues as a result of the cruise could be entitled to more financial compensation. It is unknown when the total compensation will be announced.Karpik told reporters she was ""pleased"" with the outcome.Following the ruling, Carnival reps said they were considering the details of the judgment in a statement obtained by AP News.""The pandemic was a difficult time in Australia's history, and we understand how heartbreaking it was for those affected,"" Carnival stated.

It alleges that Meta achieved this through algorithmic design, frequent alerts and notifications, and infinite scrolling through platform feeds.""Meta has harnessed powerful and unprecedented technologies to entice, engage, and ultimately ensnare youth and teens,"" the lawsuit states. ""Its motive is profit, and in seeking to maximize its financial gains, Meta has repeatedly misled the public about the substantial dangers of its Social Media Platforms.""



New York, California, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Washington are among the myriad of states involved.Furthermore, the lawsuit asserts that features such as ""likes"" and photo filters contribute to negative effects on teens' mental health, promoting social comparison and body dysmorphia.


Related: FTC Says Facebook Violated 2020 Privacy Order, Proposes More Protections for Teens and ChildrenThe lawsuit argues that Meta's scheme involved creating a business model to maximize young users' time on its platforms, implementing ""psychologically manipulative features,"" publishing ""misleading"" safety reports, and continuing to use harmful features despite evidence of harm while ""downplaying the impact"" on young users' well-being.The suit additionally accuses Meta of violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting personal data from users under the age of 13 without parental consent. The states seek to end the ""exploitative"" and ""harmful"" practices by Meta, which they deem unlawful, as well as seeking penalties and restitution.""Just like Big Tobacco and vaping companies have done in years past, Meta chose to maximize its profits at the expense of public health, specifically harming the health of the youngest among us,"" Phil Weiser, Colorado's attorney general, said in a statement to the New York Times.


A Meta spokesperson told CNBC that the company is committed to providing safe online experiences for teens and their families and has introduced numerous tools to support this goal.""We're disappointed that instead of working productively with companies across the industry to create clear, age-appropriate standards for the many apps teens use, the attorneys general have chosen this path,"" the spokesperson added.Entrepreneur has reached out to Meta for comment.Related: U.S. Government and 17 States Sue Amazon Over Alleged Anticompetitive Practices That Led to Higher Prices for Consumers

28,This 27-Year-Old Harvard Dropout Started a Hedge Fund Out of a Garage — Now She Manages Nearly $1 Billion in Assets,"Oct 24, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/at-just-27-legalists-eva-shang-manages-nearly-1b-in/464152,"
Eva Shang, 27, never envisioned a career in business. As a young adult, she enrolled at Harvard College and imagined a future as a civil rights lawyer. But she'd end up on a different path — leaving the university altogether to start her own hedge fund out of a garage at age 20.Today, the hedge fund Shang co-founded with fellow Harvard undergraduate Christian Haigh is Legalist: An institutional alternative asset management firm using data-driven technology to invest in credit assets at scale, it boasts nearly $1 billion in assets.Entrepreneur sat down with Shang to learn more about her journey building Legalist — and her best advice for other young women who want to break into the hedge-fund space.



Related: Kim Kardashian Was Paid $1 Million for Hedge Fund Event: ReportIt's ""very unusual for college students to start a hedge fund.""Shang met fellow Harvard undergraduate Haigh, who had an interest in data scraping, at a club on campus. ""We came up with this idea to scrape the entire Massachusetts state court website with the intention of kind of repackaging it,"" she recalls, ""and then selling it in some way, shape or form. That part was a little bit unclear.""But the vision would become clearer; Shang and Haigh wanted to use their analytics to save lawyers time. The duo even landed an acceptance at Y Combinator, the technology startup accelerator with headquarters in Mountain View, California. But when they arrived for the program, their idea wasn't exactly met with enthusiasm.General counsel at Y Combinator pulled the co-founders aside to tell them he really didn't like their plan. ""Lawyers are not exactly incentivized to use analytics because their work is based on the billable hour,"" Shang recalls him explaining. ""So, it really doesn't help them at all. On the other hand, you can really use your analytics to figure out which cases are going well and which cases are going to be successful. You should use that to make investments.""Related: A Hedge Fund Manager's Guide to Arbitrage Trading | Entrepreneur


So that's what they did — launching with that idea in 2017. Shang acknowledges that it's ""very unusual for college students to start a hedge fund,"" and the unlikely endeavor came with some challenges. While they were raising their first fund, Shang and Haigh went in for a meeting set up by one of their advisors. Afterward, that advisor received a message: Where did you find the tweens?""At the time, we thought it was really funny that we were referred to as tweens,"" Shang recalls, ""but it was also not great for achieving our actual goals. And there are tons of things like that, where we knew very much how we looked from the outside. And as time has gone on, it's gotten better — I've also gotten older, obviously. But initially, it was definitely an obstacle for us to overcome.""""I think [building] one company for your entire life is kind of a badge of honor.""Fortunately, Legalist attracted enough early investors that did take it and its venture seriously — and Shang says the fund's sophisticated technology played a significant role in that.


""A lot of the early investors that took a chance on our first fund liked the fact that we had this proprietary algorithm that could identify cases that were going well from the court dockets,"" Shang explains. ""Now, of course, actually making an investment is a little bit more complicated than that. And after we raised the fund, we ended up having to figure those out as we went along.""Once the co-founders ""cobbled together"" that first $10 million fund, they saw strong returns — 1.7X net of fees. That track record ""really impressed"" investors and allowed Legalist to raise a second $100 million fund. It raised an additional $400 million in the past two years alone and currently manages almost $1 billion in assets for ""the whole gamut of institutional investors."" The fund's been using ""the technology across different strategies beyond just litigation finance,"" which has also contributed to its growth, Shang says.Related: Citadel CEO Ken Griffin Shattered an Annual 'Rich List' RecordAs Shang looks ahead to Legalist's future, she's excited to see its story continue to unfold — and her own right alongside it. She has no plans to leave the fund any time soon.


""I think [building] one company for your entire life is kind of a badge of honor,"" Shang says. ""And it's kind of like when you see an old couple and they've been married for like 60 years: One, you have to be very old, and two, your marriage has to have been very successful. So that's kind of how I hope my life will be defined — by that endurance and commitment.""""It's easier to be the first outside capital for something that's already in motion — so just get started.""Shang's made a name for herself as a young woman in the male-dominated hedge-fund world — and it's a reality she's had to navigate on multiple fronts, even when Legalist was simply trying to add women hedge fund general partners to its advisory board.Despite asking ""everyone they knew"" for introductions and recommendations, finding women who fit the bill was ""extremely challenging."" ""So people even started recommending folks they had met once,"" Shang says. ""And I would get an introduction, and I'd be like, 'Oh, so how do you know so and so?' And they'd be like, 'Honestly, I don't really know why they recommended me because I've only met them once. I assume they must not know very many female hedge fund managers.'""


Dominique Mielle, a former hedge fund manager, is one of the women Shang recruited to join Legalist's advisory board. Shang contacted Mielle after reading her memoir Damsel in Distressed: My Life in the Golden Age of Hedge Funds, which chronicles her two-decade climb to partner and senior portfolio manager at what became one of the largest hedge funds in the U.S. ""[The book] really gives a good look at some of the structural barriers that prevent women from being successful,"" Shang says.Related: Women in Finance: How to Succeed in a Male-Dominated IndustryShang chalks up some of her own success as a woman in hedge funds to Legalist's ""nontraditional path."" ""That's pretty typical of women who become successful,"" she adds. ""It's very difficult to climb your way through a race that you're structurally disadvantaged to win, but you can arrive at the same destination going your own way.""And how do you set yourself up to cross that finish line? You can't hesitate, Shang stresses.


""Don't wait for permission to get started,"" she says. ""Just start. Start trading or start doing deals. The overall point here is not to wait to raise money, so if you can start on even a small amount of money to start building a track record, that's helpful. It's easier to be the first outside capital for something that's already in motion — so just get started.""

29,College Student's Tragic Death Sparks Legal Battle as Parents Sue Panera Over High-Caffeine 'Charged Lemonade',"Oct 24, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/wrongful-death-lawsuit-targets-paneras-charged-lemonade/464198,"
On September 10, 2022, a 21-year-old college student purchased Panera Bread's Charged Lemonade. Just hours later, she went into cardiac arrest and tragically passed away. Now, the late student's parents are taking legal action against Panera, claiming the restaurant chain doesn't adequately warn consumers of the high caffiene content of the drink.The wrongful death lawsuit, filed in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas on Monday and obtained by NBC, claims the beverage is a ""dangerous energy drink"" allegedly lacking sufficient warning about its ingredients.Sarah Katz, a University of Pennsylvania student with long QT syndrome type 1, a heart condition, had been advised by her doctors to avoid energy drinks. However, when Katz purchased the beverage, it was displayed alongside Panera's non-caffeinated and less-caffeinated options and marketed as a ""plant-based and clean"" drink, the lawsuit states, adding that Katz was ""reasonably confident"" the lemonade contained a ""reasonable amount of caffeine"" that was safe for her consumption.

""She was very, very vigilant about what she needed to do to keep herself safe,"" Victoria Rose Conroy, Katz's roommate, told NBC. ""I guarantee if Sarah had known how much caffeine this was, she never would have touched it with a 10-foot pole.""Related: '100% Should Be Illegal': Woman Exposes Jaw-Dropping Amount of Caffeine in Panera LemonadeA large size of the beverage, which Katz purchased the day of her passing, contains a startling 390 milligrams of caffeine, per Panera's website. It also contains guarana extract, another stimulant, and the equivalent of nearly 30 teaspoons of sugar. The lawsuit emphasizes that 390 milligrams of caffeine far surpasses the caffeine level of a standard Red Bull (148 milligrams) and Monster (86 milligrams) energy drink combined.According to the FDA, ""healthy adults"" can have up to 400 milligrams of caffeine a day. However, it does emphasize that those with certain health conditions should consult their doctor.


Elizabeth Crawford, the attorney representing Katz's parents, told CNN that they intend to make sure the drink has a warning or is ""taken off the shelf.""""It's a dangerous energy drink, and it's not advertised that way,"" she added. ""We want to make sure this does not happen to someone else.""""These unregulated beverages include no warning of any potentially dangerous effects, even the life-threatening effects on blood pressure, heart rate, and/or brain function,"" the lawsuit states.The lawsuit emphasizes the need for clearer warning labels and greater transparency about the contents of products like Panera's Charged Lemonade.


""We were very saddened to learn this morning about the tragic passing of Sarah Katz, and our hearts go out to her family,"" a Panera spokesperson told Entrepreneur. ""At Panera, we strongly believe in transparency around our ingredients. We will work quickly to thoroughly investigate this matter.""Related: Man Sues Maker of Wellness Drink for Allegedly Causing Him to Relapse After 7 Years of Sobriety

31,A Popular Drug Store Chain Is Filing for Bankruptcy Amid Opioid Lawsuits and Financial Woes,"Oct 16, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/rite-aid-nears-bankruptcy-amid-opioid-lawsuits/458134,"
Rite Aid filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday after billions of dollars in debt from lawsuits related to the opioid epidemic mounted.The pharmacy secured $3.45 billion in funding to sustain operations in the bankruptcy phase and plans to maintain its store operations and customer service, The New York Times reported.The chain has been closing stores over the last year and plans to close ""hundreds more"" in the wake of the bankruptcy filing, the outlet added.Original story below: Rite Aid is on the brink of filing for bankruptcy amid mounting federal and state lawsuits regarding opioid-related settlements, which have resulted in increasing debt, The Wall Street Journal reported.



The pending bankruptcy filing follows a period of difficulties for Rite Aid over the past five years, including store closures (145 last year alone) and unsuccessful attempts at mergers with competitors like Walgreens and Albertsons in 2017 and 2018, respectively.Now, Rite Aid is facing over a thousand federal lawsuits, consolidated in Ohio, along with multiple state court cases that accuse the company of contributing to the opioid epidemic. Additionally, the Justice Department has filed a civil lawsuit, alleging negligence in handling opioid prescriptions and violations of the False Claims Act and Controlled Substances Act.Rite Aid has denied the allegations and sought the dismissal of the department's lawsuit. Filing for bankruptcy would pause these legal actions and provide Rite Aid with a means to address them within a single framework, the WSJ added.According to the drugstore chain's last earnings report released in June, Rite Aid's revenue declined by nearly 6% and experienced a net loss of $306.7 million — almost triple from $110.2 million for the same period a year prior.


Related: Purdue Pharma to Plead Guilty to Multiple Federal Charges The potential Chapter 11 filing would encompass Rite Aid's $3.3 billion debt and ongoing legal claims surrounding the allegation that the chain contributed to an oversupply of prescription painkillers, the WSJ added.Rite Aid is among a myriad of retailers (Walmart, CVS, Walgreens) that settled opioid-related lawsuits, paying over $13 billion collectively.  Meanwhile, drug manufacturers Purdue Pharma, Mallinckrodt, and Endo International, have also declared bankruptcy due to opioid-related litigation.


Mallinckrodt, having initially committed $1.7 billion to opioid plaintiffs during its Chapter 11 restructuring last year, is now on the path towards a subsequent bankruptcy, leaving about $1 billion of that commitment unpaid. Similarly, Endo is encountering government opposition to its proposal to gradually pay $450 million to state governments and $119 million to private plaintiffs.Related: CVS, Walgreens Agree to $10 Billion Settlement Related to Opioid CrisisAt the center of the epidemic — and the subsequent lawsuits — is the Sackler family, founders and owners of Purdue Pharma. The Supreme Court has halted Purdue's $6 billion settlement with the Sackler family as it examines potential legal flaws in the Chapter 11 plan, considering whether bankruptcy courts have the authority to approve settlements that protect third parties (like Purdue's owners) from legal claims.

A lawsuit against Wendy's and McDonald's, alleging that the companies had exaggerated the size of their burgers in advertisements, has been officially dismissed by a federal judge on Wednesday, The New York Times reported.The plaintiff, Justin Chimienti of New York, had initiated the lawsuit in 2022, claiming that he purchased burgers at Wendy's and McDonald's locations, but they were significantly smaller than depicted in the ads, and he was ""financially damaged as a result.""Judge Hector Gonzalez of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York ruled that there was no evidence to suggest that the fast-food chains had served smaller burgers than what they advertised or that they had deceived their customers as the lawsuit contended.



In the 19-page ruling, the judge also expressed doubts about whether Chimienti had actually seen the specific ads for the fast food items which he had cited as examples in his complaint.Related: Jack in the Box Employee Shoots at Customer Over Alleged Missing Curly Fries, Family Files LawsuitChimienti argued that misleading advertising harmed customers by providing them with food of lower value than what was promised.While the monetary damages Chimienti sought in the lawsuit are unspecified, he aimed to ""fully compensate"" individuals who felt ""deceived"" after purchasing an ""overstated menu item.""Chimienti's complaint was one of several recent lawsuits targeting fast-food companies for alleged misrepresentation of their products in advertisements.In August, a judge in the Southern District of Florida denied Burger King's plea to dismiss a lawsuit originally filed in 2022, wherein plaintiffs are arguing that the chain engages in ""unfair"" and ""deceptive"" practices in relation to its Whopper size.

In the wake of the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust lawsuit filed against Amazon on Tuesday, the e-commerce giant and its CEO, Jeff Bezos, are already taking a financial hit.On Tuesday, the FTC — along with 17 state attorneys general — filed a lawsuit against Amazon, alleging that the company engaged in anticompetitive practices, unfairly promoting its own products and brands, and stifling competition.Amazon has denied the allegations and defended its business practices, but that hasn't stopped the tech giant from feeling the pinch of the high-profile lawsuit.



On Tuesday, following the announcement of the FTC's lawsuit, Amazon stock fell by 3.28%. As of Thursday afternoon, stocks are still down and stand at about $126 a share, down from $131 on Monday.Related: U.S. Government and 17 States Sue Amazon Over Alleged Anticompetitive Practices That Led to Higher Prices for Consumers

However, with the outcome of the lawsuit still in flux, it remains to be known how much the tech giant and Bezos could lose due to the FTC complaint.


The lawsuit alleges that Amazon has created an illegal monopoly, and engaged in a ""cycle of dominance and harm,"" affecting both consumers and sellers. The 172-page complaint alleges that the company entices sellers and shoppers with the promise of a vast customer base and low prices, but then ""exploits"" them through increased fees, advertising, fulfillment service mandates, and ""punishment"" for selling elsewhere. The FTC argues that the cycle results in a poor experience for users and artificially high prices.In an official statement, Amazon has defended its practices and called the lawsuit ""misguided,"" adding that the lawsuit ""reveals the Commission's fundamental misunderstanding of retail.""

On Wednesday, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against e-commerce marketplace, eBay, accusing the company of ""unlawfully selling and distributing"" over 371,000 products that violate three environmental laws.""Laws that prohibit selling products that can severely harm human health and the environment apply to e-commerce retailers like eBay just as they do to brick-and-mortar stores,"" Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division, said in the release. ""We are committed to preventing the unlawful sale and distribution of emissions-defeating devices and dangerous chemicals that, if used improperly, can lead to dire consequences for individuals and communities.""The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleges that eBay engaged in the sale, promotion, or facilitation of over 343,000 aftermarket defeat devices, which disable motor vehicle emission controls and elevate emissions, including harmful substances such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, thus violating the Clean Air Act (CAA).

Finally, the complaint contends that eBay violated the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) by distributing more than 5,600 items in breach of the TSCA Methylene Chloride Rule, by selling products that contain methylene chloride in paint and coating removal products, which impose ""unreasonable risks"" associated with the products, including fatalities.In a statement, eBay called the lawsuit ""entirely unprecedented,"" and that the company will ""vigorously defend itself.""""We dedicate significant resources, implement state-of-the-art technology and ensure our teams are properly trained to prevent prohibited items from being listed on the marketplace,"" the company added.The complaint is seeking a halt of eBay's practices that broke the CAA, FIFRA, and TSCA laws, as well as calling on eBay to pay civil penalties for CAA violations, which could amount to billions with a penalty of $5,580 for each violation, per Reuters.

Siebert shares decades of experience, insights, and practical advice to help grow your business exponentially through franchising while avoiding the pitfalls. In this edited excerpt, Siebert offers a legal description of a franchise from both a federal and state perspective.Everyone knows what a franchise is, right? It's McDonald's and Jiffy Lube. It's Subway, Massage Envy and Holiday Inn.But many people would be surprised to hear that some of the biggest companies in janitorial services are also franchises. The same holds true for carpet cleaning, wood restoration, lawn care and dozens of other industries. The largest providers of in-home, non-medical care for senior citizens are franchises. And so are many of the world's largest hotel brands. You name it — and chances are, it's been franchised.Related: Considering franchise ownership?

Who is the franchisee?Generally speaking, a franchisee is someone who pays a franchisor for the right to operate a business under the franchisor's name and using the franchisor's business model. The franchisee furnishes all the capital required for opening the business and assumes full financial and operational responsibility for running the business. Generally, the franchisee will also pay a continuing royalty (usually between four to 10 percent of gross sales or sometimes even higher) to the franchisor, and often the franchisee will buy products from the franchisor.Who is the franchisor?The franchisor, for its part, will allow the franchisee to use its trademark and will train the franchisee to run the business according to its standards. Typically, the franchisor will also assist the franchisee during the startup period and provide ongoing support and assistance to the franchisee.The franchisor will allow the franchisee to use its trademark and will train the franchisee to run the business according to its standards.The level, type and quality of this ongoing support will often differ, but for many franchisors, it will take the form of advertising assistance, purchasing power, brand maintenance, financial guidance and ongoing operational support.Legally speaking, what are franchises?The term ""franchise"" has a very specific legal definition within the U.S. and other countries where they are regulated. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission in FTC Rule 436 defines a franchise as a business relationship that has three definitional elements:1. The use of a common name or trademark2. The presence of ""significant operating control"" or ""significant oper­ating assistance""3. A required payment of more than $500 in the first six months of operation by the franchisee (including initial fees, royalties, adver­tising fees, training fees, or fees for equipment)Related: Become a Franchise Owner in 5 Easy Steps


The Franchise Disclosure DocumentIf a business relationship has the definitional elements of a franchise under the FTC rule, the franchisor must provide the prospective franchisee with a Franchise Disclosure Document (or FDD), which makes certain disclosures to the franchisees prior to the sale of a franchise. Along with these disclosure obligations, the franchisor's sales process is also regulated by this rule.An FDD must contain 23 specific items of disclosure in a specific format.An FDD must contain 23 specific items of disclosure in a specific format. In addition, the FDD must include all contracts the prospective franchisee must sign (including the franchise agreement and other ancillary legal documents, such as any financing agreement or an area development agreement, for example) and a copy of the franchisor's audited financial statements. (If you do not have audited financial statements, don't worry. Almost all new franchisors will create a new corporation and simply disclose that corporation's newly audited balance sheet to satisfy the requirement.)Rules when selling a franchiseYou must then follow a fairly simple set of rules governing the sale of franchises, including:You must present the FDD to the prospective franchisee at least 14 days prior to the sale of the franchise (not counting the day you present the FDD or the day on which the contract is signed), or within a reasonable time upon request of the prospective franchisee.You must provide the prospective franchisee with a fully filled-out franchise agreement at least seven days prior to the sale of a fran­chise. (This time can run concurrently with the 14 days discussed above if the agreement is filled out.)You must limit what you say on certain matters (financial performance representations, etc.) to only what you have included in your FDD. If you choose not to do a financial performance representa­tion (previously called an earnings claim), you cannot provide the prospect with any information on sales or earnings. While you can provide them with information on expenses, you cannot do so in a format that would allow them to calculate sales or earnings (so percentages of revenues are not allowed).You must treat all similarly situated prospects in the same way. The material terms of the agreement cannot be negotiated unless you are willing to enter into those same negotiations with all simi­larly situated franchisees and fully disclose both your willingness to negotiate and the range within which you will negotiate (which, of course, is negotiating suicide).While there are other compliance and documentation issues you will need to be aware of, the process is fairly simple.Related: How a Water Leak Turned Into a $1 Million Franchise


States can make franchising more complicatedThis is all made more fun by the fact that, at present, more than half of all states currently regulate either franchises or business opportunities. Many of these states have their own definition of just what constitutes a franchise under their laws.For many, the legal definition involves the use of the trademark, a community of interest or a common marketing plan and the payment of a fee. But in some states (like New York), you can trigger franchise laws even without allowing someone to use your trademark. In others, like Illinois, the triggering element for the required payment is not $500 in the first six months of operation, but $500 throughout the lifetime of the relationship. Moreover, the disclosure exemptions that are recognized at the federal level may not be recognized at the state level as exemptions to registration or filing.More than half of all states currently regulate either franchises or business opportunities. Many of these states have their own definition of just what constitutes a franchise under their laws.The list of complexities goes on and on. Seven states require you to submit your franchise advertising for approval before you use it. While most of these states have similar language regarding the timing of disclosures (having adopted the new 14-day waiting period between disclosure and signing a franchise contract), others continue to operate under the old 10-business-day waiting rule that was originally promulgated under the 1979 version of FTC Rule 436. Likewise, while most no longer require broker registration, again adopting the standards of the new federal rule, some continue to hold on to this cumbersome requirement. Some states, in fact, require franchisors to disclose their prospective franchisees at the first personal meeting (another holdover from the previous version of the FTC rule).Moreover, the situations that trigger the need to register or file your documents will vary from state to state. These include:If the franchisor is physically located in that stateIf the franchisor is incorporated in that stateIf the franchisee is a resident of that state If the franchisee's territory will include territory in that stateIf the discussion of the sale of the franchise takes place in that stateRelated: Is Franchising Right For You? Ask Yourself These 9 Questions to Find Out.


Comply, comply, complyThere are plenty of legal definitions involved in the world of franchising. What is a franchise? How do you define the franchisor and franchisee? Then you have to take in all of the laws, such as what triggers a franchise, practices for selling and timelines regarding disclosures.It can seem overwhelming, but you can work with franchising professionals (consultants and lawyers) to make the process simpler. At the end of the day, the key point to take away is that you must comply with both state and federal laws.

SpaceX, Elon Musk's spacecraft manufacturing company, has initiated legal action against the Justice Department (DOJ) to dismiss the recent discrimination case brought against it in August. The case alleges that the company engaged in practices that discouraged refugees from applying for job positions, subsequently refusing to hire or consider their applications, The Wall Street Journal reported.The DOJ's lawsuit claims that SpaceX incorrectly asserted that federal regulations compelled it to hire U.S. citizens and permanent residents exclusively. However, SpaceX has vehemently denied discrimination against job seekers and has stated that some of its work was subject to national security laws, which restricted hiring foreign nationals.In its complaint filed on September 15, SpaceX emphasized its commitment to hiring the most qualified candidates, ""regardless of their citizenship status,"" and highlighted its history of employing hundreds of noncitizens. In the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, SpaceX has requested the judge intervene and halt the Justice Department's complaint.Related: Elon Musk Sued For Billions Over Running Alleged Dogecoin Pyramid Scheme For 'Profit, Exposure and Amusement'In late August, Elon Musk posted on X (formerly Twitter) that he had been informed that hiring individuals who were not U.S. permanent residents would potentially violate international arms-trafficking laws, leading to hiring limitations in multiple territories.

FTX has filed a lawsuit against the parents of its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, with the aim of recovering millions of dollars that the company alleges were fraudulently transferred and ""misappropriated,"" according to a court filing made late on Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported.The lawsuit, filed in a Delaware bankruptcy court, represents the latest effort by FTX's CEO, John J. Ray III, to recover some of the funds that Bankman-Fried allegedly distributed to family members and associates prior to the cryptocurrency exchange's collapse in November of the previous year. Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried are accused of taking advantage of their connections and influence within the FTX enterprise to enrich themselves.Bankman-Fried's parents, both professors at Stanford Law School, had been serving as his legal advisors during FTX's collapse.Bankman-Fried is set to face trial on October 3rd.

According to the complaint, Bankman played a significant role in FTX's operations, managing tax matters, advising on personnel hires, actively participating in high-level discussions, and referring to FTX as a family business. It also alleges that Bankman received substantial rewards for his work at FTX, including a $10 million gift from Bankman-Fried in early 2022, funded by Bankman-Fried's trading firm, Alameda Research.Related: Who Is FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried and What Did He Do?

Stanford confirmed to the WSJ that it had received gifts from the FTX Foundation and related entities but that the university would return the funds in full.


Attorneys for Bankman and Fried denied the accusations, calling them ""completely false"" and suggesting that Ray's legal team was accumulating fees without benefiting FTX clients, adding that the lawsuit appeared to be an effort to exert pressure on the parents and hinder their child's impending trial.""This is a dangerous attempt to intimidate Joe and Barbara and undermine the jury process just days before their child's trial begins,"" Bankman and Fried's lawyers wrote in a statement, per The WSJ.Federal prosecutors have charged Bankman-Fried with defrauding billions of dollars from customers to finance his expansive business ventures through FTX.

A federal judge in the U.S. District of Manhattan ruled on Monday that Starbucks must face a lawsuit that alleges several of its Refresher fruit beverages do not actually contain any fruit, Reuters reported.Starbucks had sought to dismiss nine out of the 11 claims in the proposed class action suit, but U.S. District Judge John Cronan rejected the company's request, stating that a majority of ""reasonable consumers"" would expect Starbucks' fruit beverages to actually contain the fruit mentioned in their names.The lawsuit, filed in August 2022, alleges that Starbucks engaged in ""false and deceptive"" marketing practices by presenting its Starbucks Refresher Products as fruit-based beverages, but the flavors, such as Mango Dragonfruit and Mango Dragonfruit Lemonade Refreshers, do not contain mango, and similarly, Pineapple Passionfruit and Pineapple Passionfruit Lemonade Refreshers lack passionfruit. Strawberry Acai and Strawberry Acai Lemonade Refreshers do not contain acai, etc.

In response, Starbucks defended itself by claiming that the product names referred to the drinks' flavors rather than ingredients. The company asserted that its menu boards accurately advertised the flavors and that reasonable consumers would not be confused. Additionally, Starbucks argued that its baristas could have cleared up any confusion if customers had questions.However, Judge Cronan disagreed with the chain, pointing out that terms like ""mango,"" ""passionfruit,"" and ""acaí"" are typically understood to represent both flavor and ingredient.Related: Taco Bell Slammed With Lawsuit Over 'Especially Concerning' Advertisements, Allegedly Deceiving CustomersThe lawsuit is seeking $5 million in damages.Entrepreneur has reached out to Starbucks for comment.

42,Google Paid Apple Billions for Access to iPhone Users. Now the Partnership's Under Scrutiny in a U.S. Antitrust Lawsuit.,"Sep 11, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/googles-apple-partnership-under-scrutiny-high-stakes/458851,"
Since 2005, Google has paid Apple billions to be the default search engine on Safari, bringing the two tech giants together in a partnership that has made them both billions.Now, the partnership is under scrutiny in the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust case against Google (U.S. et al v. Google), which alleges that the tech giant unlawfully maintained its search-engine dominance through exclusionary deals with partners like Apple, Bloomberg reported.Established nearly two decades ago, the agreement designated Google as Apple's default search engine, with Apple receiving up to 50% of the advertising revenue generated by Google searches conducted on Apple's Safari browser. In 2016, Apple and Google expanded their agreement to include other Apple features like Siri and Spotlight, further solidifying their cooperation.



Throughout the partnership, Google has benefited from Apple's mobile achievements, resulting in a commanding 90% share of the overall search market. Apple reaped substantial annual earnings from this collaboration, estimated at around $18 billion in 2022, as reported by Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts, per Bloomberg.Google's perspective on the relationship is one of ""co-opetition,"" combining cooperation and competition, Kent Walker, Google parent company Alphabet's chief legal officer, told the outlet.


However, critics argue that such deals effectively stifle competition.""You are not supposed to be able to cooperate with your competitors,"" Rebecca Allensworth, associate dean of research for Vanderbilt Law School, told Bloomberg.The legality and consequences of the arrangement will be under close examination in the trial, which is set to begin on Tuesday and last 10 weeks.In 2012, a Google executive revealed to FTC investigators that the company's search volume could plummet by as much as 50% if Apple were to replace Google Search with Bing, Politico reported.


Related: If You Used Google Anytime Between 2006 and 2013, the Company May Owe You Money—Here's How to CollectApple isn't the only Google partner under examination during the trial. In 2011 Verizon, Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile all entered partnerships with Google wherein the carriers would receive a share of advertising revenue ranging from 15% to 40% generated on the devices they sold to their customers. The strategic move aimed to safeguard Google's Android search distribution from potential competitors like Bing or Yahoo.In a 2011 email cited in court filings, a Google executive explained its philosophy, stating, ""We pay revenue share in exchange for exclusivity,"" Bloomberg reported.Why is the U.S. Suing Google?The DOJ has accused Google of unlawfully leveraging partnerships with phone manufacturers and internet browser firms to exclude rival search engines. Through agreements like that with Apple, the government claims that Google's substantial payments to its partners have hindered other search engines and created a cycle of monopolization, stifled competition and limited consumer choice. As of June 2023, Google has 90.68% of the search engine market share, according to data analysis firm SimilarWeb.


Google's monopoly, the DOJ argues, has significantly impacted the search engine landscape, particularly as it pertains to unfairly harming competitors.Microsoft's Bing, for instance, currently holds just a 6.4 percent share of the U.S. market, and Yahoo, which utilizes Bing, accounts for an additional 2.4 percent, according to StatCounter. DuckDuckGo, a privacy-focused Google alternative, has only managed to capture a fraction of the market, and it attributes this challenge to Google's default search agreements.""Even though DuckDuckGo provides something extremely valuable that people want and Google won't provide — real privacy — Google makes it unduly difficult to use DuckDuckGo by default. We're glad this issue is finally going to have its day in court,"" Kamyl Bazbaz, the spokesperson for DuckDuckGo, told Vox.Google argues these agreements were ""legitimate"" and designed to provide a superior user experience. The trial will determine if Google's actions harmed competition and if its market power outweighed any consumer benefits.


If Google loses, the government will seek an injunction to stop anti-competitive practices, potentially impacting Google's business.Furthermore, the case raises the question of if such monopolies wield excessive control over users' online experiences.

""You can do it. We can help."" One Connecticut man had his own interpretation of Home Depot's well-intentioned tagline.Alexandre Henrique Costa-Mota, 26, of Hartford has been arraigned on charges of conspiracy and wire fraud after he scored nearly $300,000 in Home Depot credit with a fraudulent door-return scheme that spanned stores in several states, AP News reported.Related: Man Accidentally Dyes Home Depot Logo on His Head, Goes Viral



Costa-Mota dressed as a contractor and walked in empty-handed, then put one door or several doors valued at hundreds of dollars onto a cart before heading to the service department and returning them without a receipt, prosecutors allege in court documents.If Costa-Mota was denied a return at one store, he would take the doors without paying and return them to a different location; between June 2021 and June 2022, he racked up 370 fraudulent store credits worth $297,332, according to authorities.


Home Depot's return policy allowing customers to return purchases without a receipt helped Costa-Mota pull it off.""We require a valid driver's license or government-issued photo identification for non-receipted returns and returns generated from purchases made with The Home Depot store credits,"" the company's website states. ""The Home Depot uses a third-party refund verification system.""It appears Costa-Mota used his own ID just once before presenting multiple fraudulent licenses with other names, per court records.Related: Woman Arrested for $60 Million USPS Counterfeit Postage Scam


Home Depot isn't the only big-box retailer with a generous return policy that puts customers first: Kohl's, J.C. Penney, and Walmart also accept purchases back without a receipt, according to NerdWallet.

52,"TikTok Concerned Over Labor Rights Violations After Landmark Court Ruling Against Meta, Leaked Documents Suggest","Jul 21, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/tiktok-worries-over-labor-rights-leaked-memo-reveals/456233,"
In a landmark ruling last month, a Kenyan court declared that Meta was the ""true employer"" of hundreds of moderators working in Nairobi, Kenya — meaning that Meta can be held liable in Kenya for labor rights violations, even though the moderators are technically employed by a third-party contractor. Meta will appeal the decision, TechCrunch reported.Moderators are responsible for filtering out violent, hateful and shocking content on Meta's platforms.Meta previously contracted with a company called Sama, and it now contracts with a company called Majorel. TikTok, the short-form video app, also outsources to moderators in Kenya with Majorel, and leaked memos may imply the company has violated labor rights.



The initial case against Meta was brought forward by Daniel Motaung, a South African moderator who says he was fired in 2019 after attempting to form a union. Motaung claimed that the job exposed him to traumatic and disturbing content, resulting in post-traumatic stress disorder. He was allegedly paid as little as $2.20 an hour for the work, WIRED reported in February.Motaung also claimed that the true nature of the work was never explicitly laid out to him before taking on the role that would ultimately leave him traumatized.


As Motaung's case progressed, in January Meta attempted to sever ties with Sama (resulting in 260 moderators losing their jobs) and move its operations to another third-party company, Majorel (TikTok's partner), per WIRED.After 184 moderators sued Meta and Sama alleging unlawful termination of contracts, the court ruled in favor of the moderators in March, extending their contracts and preventing layoffs until the case is resolved. The court found that Meta was the primary employer, and Sama was ""merely an agent"" overseeing the work on its behalf.The court also ordered Meta and Sama to provide medical, psychiatric and psychological care to the moderators, acknowledging the ""inherently hazardous"" nature of their work sifting through social media content to remove hate, misinformation and violence.Related: 'It Is Incredibly Disheartening, Insulting, and Downright Evil': Designers Accuse Shein of 'Egregious' Copyright Infringement and Racketeering


As for TikTok, leaked documents obtained by the NGO Foxglove Legal and viewed by WIRED suggest that the company is concerned about the potential legal repercussions it might face if the Kenyan court's decision sets a precedent.""TikTok will likely face reputational and regulatory risks for its contractual arrangement with Majorel in Kenya,"" the memo says, adding that if the court rules in favor of the moderators, ""TikTok and its competitors could face scrutiny for real or perceived labor rights violations.""In response to the situation, TikTok is contemplating an independent audit of Majorel's operations in Kenya to address potential concerns regarding labor practices, according to the leaked documents.However, similar moves have been criticized for being performative and not leading to substantial improvements in workers' conditions, Paul Barrett, deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University, told WIRED — a reality TikTok appears to be aware of as the memo stated such audits ""may mitigate additional scrutiny from union representatives and news media.""


Although TikTok has the opportunity to proactively approach the issue, some experts caution the company might merely be trying to mitigate blame rather than genuinely improve working conditions for its outsourced workers.""I think it would be very unfortunate if TikTok said, 'We're going to try to minimize liability, minimize our responsibility, and not only outsource this work, but outsource our responsibility for making sure the work that's being done on behalf of our platform is done in an appropriate and humane way,'"" Barrett told WIRED.Entrepreneur has reached out to TikTok and Meta for comment.Related: 3 McDonald's Franchisees to Pay Thousands in Fines for Child Labor Law Violations

53,Johnson & Johnson Ordered to Pay $18.8 Million in Talc Cancer Suit,"Jul 19, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/jj-issued-188m-talc-verdict-suing-biden-administration/456086,"
On Tuesday, John & Johnson (J&J) filed a lawsuit suing the Biden administration over Medicare's new authority to reduce drug prices, joining Merck and Bristol Myers Squibb in challenging the controversial provision of the Inflation Reduction Act.The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in August 2022, aims to fight inflation, lower the deficit, and reduce carbon emissions, among other goals. It includes reforms to the tax system, investments in clean energy, and allows Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices.The lawsuit argues that the IRA Medicare price negotiations violate the First and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution by ""coercing"" the company into ""agreeing"" that the government is ""negotiating"" a ""fair"" price and compels the company ""to make false and misleading statements,"" according to the complaint.



Additionally, the company believes that the IRA will stifle medical progress.""We believe that the IRA's pricing provisions will constrain medical innovation, limit patient access and choice, and negatively impact the overall quality of patient care,"" J&J wrote in a press release on Tuesday.


The U.S. Health and Human Services Department said it will ""vigorously defend the President's drug price negotiation law, which is already helping to lower health care costs for seniors and people with disabilities,"" per CNBC.How Much Did J&J Pay for Talc Cancer Lawsuit?Also on Tuesday, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) was ordered to pay $18.8 million to a California man who claimed he developed cancer from using the company's baby powder, Reuters reported.Emory Hernandez Valadez, 24, filed a lawsuit last year against J&J claiming he developed mesothelioma due to prolonged exposure to the company's talc since childhood.Related: Johnson & Johnson Ordered to Pay $55 Million in Talc-Powder Trial


Talc is a soft mineral used in various consumer products like baby powder and cosmetics for its ability to absorb moisture and reduce friction. However, its use has also been subject to controversy, particularly with J&J, which has faced thousands of lawsuits alleging its talc-based products are contaminated with cancer-causing asbestos.In April, the company filed for bankruptcy through a subsidiary, LTL Management, with a proposal to settle over 38,000 lawsuits for $8.9 billion. However, most litigation has been halted during bankruptcy proceedings. The reason Hernandez's trial proceeded was due to his terminal condition and the rarity of his form of mesothelioma, setting it apart from the majority of cases against J&J, Reuters added.The jury ruled in favor of Hernandez on Tuesday. While Hernandez was awarded damages for medical bills and strife, the jury did not grant punitive damages against J&J.The company plans to appeal the verdict, maintaining that its products are safe and do not cause cancer, per Reuters.


Erik Haas, J&J vice president of litigation, told the outlet that the verdict is ""irreconcilable with the decades of independent scientific evaluations confirming Johnson's Baby Powder is safe, does not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.""Related: Johnson & Johnson Hit With More Than $1 Billion Verdict on Hip Implants

54,"Tesla Directors Settle Shareholder Claims for $735 Million in Landmark Lawsuit, Agree to Compensation Revisions","Jul 18, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/tesla-directors-settle-overpayment-lawsuit-will-return/456016,"
Tesla's directors have agreed to settle claims from shareholders of excessive overpayment and will return $735 million to the company, according to a court filing in Delaware on Monday, making it one of the largest shareholder settlements of its kind, Reuters reported.The settlement pertains to a lawsuit filed in 2020 by the Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit, a retirement fund holding Tesla stock, which began to challenge the stock options granted to Tesla directors from 2017 to 2020.The directors — including CEO Elon Musk, his brother Kimbal Musk and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison — are accused of granting themselves compensation of approximately 11 million stock options over three years, which is allegedly far beyond the norm for corporate boards.



The case is a derivative lawsuit, where a shareholder sues on behalf of the company, and the settlement amount is one of the largest ever of its kind filed in Delaware's Court of Chancery — a prime hub for shareholder litigation.As part of the settlement, the directors also agreed not to receive any compensation for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023, and the board will revise its compensation determination process.


Related: Elon Musk Accused of Violating Building Codes and Failing to Pay Severance, Lawsuit ClaimsThe directors maintain that they acted in good faith and for the best interests of Tesla's stockholders but agreed to settle to avoid the risk of litigation, according to the filing.The settlement is one of the largest-ever derivative cases in the Court of Chancery, a prominent venue for shareholder litigation.In response to the lawsuit, Tesla argued that the company experienced unprecedented growth, leading to a tenfold increase in its stock price, per Reuters, which, in turn, caused the value of stock options awarded to the directors and Musk to rise significantly. Tesla contended that the stock options were used to align the directors' incentives with investor goals.


The current settlement does not affect Elon Musk's $56 billion compensation package, which is the subject of a separate lawsuit and awaiting a ruling. The complaint, filed by a Tesla shareholder in 2019, claims that Musk's board-approved compensation package from 2018 was excessive and breached the board's duties to shareholders.Related: 'I Make Trucks for Real People': Ford CEO Slams Tesla's Cybertruck

55,A New Jersey Judge Posted Videos on TikTok. Now He Might Be Dismissed From the Bench.,"Jul 5, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/new-jersey-judge-who-posted-tiktok-videos-faces-dismissal/455314,"
From 2021 to March 2023, a judge in New Jersey uploaded approximately 40 public videos of himself lip-syncing lyrics from mainstream rap songs on TikTok under an alias.Now, he's facing the consequences: On Monday, the court system said it had filed a complaint against Superior Court judge Gary N. Wilcox, who will undergo a hearing that could result in a reprimand or dismissal, The New York Times reported.Related: How to Use TikTok to Promote Your Business | Entrepreneur



Some of Wilcox's TikTok videos feature explicit references to violence, sex and misogyny, with ""profanity"" and ""racist terms"" appearing in several recorded in the judge's court chambers, per the state's Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct. Wilcox also donned his judicial robes in certain videos.Fifty-eight-year-old Wilcox, who used the alias ""Sal Tortorella"" to post his videos on TikTok, presides over criminal cases in Bergen County, New Jersey. A Harvard Law School graduate, he was admitted to the state's bar more than 30 years ago and has been a Superior Court Judge since 2011, per the NYT.


TikTok has more than 40,000 ""trust and safety professionals"" who develop and enforce policies regarding explicit content, especially for its users between ages 13-17, per the platform — using AI to bolster its efforts.Related: Blow Up On TikTok By Following These 4 Rules | EntrepreneurThe Wilcox case will likely hinge on free speech arguments and was filed one day after the New Jersey court ruled that police must prove more than basic probable cause to continuously monitor Facebook to investigate crimes, a method likened to tapping someone's phone, according to the NYT.

56,Ron DeSantis Asks Judge to Dismiss Disney Lawsuit: 'Disney Grabbed Headlines By Suing the Governor',"Jun 27, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/desantis-asks-judge-to-toss-disney-lawsuit-claims-immunity/454878,"
On Monday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis filed a motion to dismiss Disney's lawsuit against him and other state officials on the grounds that Disney has no jurisdiction.""Although Disney grabbed headlines by suing the Governor, Disney — like many litigants before it who have challenged Florida's laws — has no basis for doing so,"" the motion to dismiss states, per The AP.The motion also argues that DeSantis has legislative immunity, which prevents legislators from being sued for any action carried out in the ""sphere of legitimate legislative activity.""



Disney is suing DeSantis and other state officials over a bill passed last year that affects the company's special tax agreement that gives Disney governmental control over the Reedy Creek Improvement District (about 25,000 acres in the counties of Orange and Osceola the theme park in Orlando).Disney has not publicly responded to the motion. Entrepreneur has reached out to Disney for comment.


How Did the Disney-DeSantis Fued Begin?The Disney and Ron DeSantis feud began in March 2022 when Disney publicly opposed Florida's Parental Rights in Education Law (dubbed the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill, by some). The CEO at the time, Bob Chapek, announced that Disney would cease any political donations to the state in opposition to the bill.In April, the Florida legislature passed a bill (seemingly in retaliation) that would dissolve Disney's special-tax agreement that allows the corporation to have the legal authority to self-govern the area in and around the park in Orlando.Disney then filed a lawsuit against DeSantis (the one he is now asking to be dismissed) and other state officials because the bill was a ""clear violation of Disney's federal constitutional rights.""A DeSantis-appointed board then filed a countersuit in state court just days later.""Since Disney sued us, we have no choice now but to respond,"" board chair Martin Garcia said at the time, per Reuters.Earlier this year, the bill was signed into law, and Florida took control of Reedy Creek, now renamed the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, with board members appointed by DeSantis.Related: Florida Gov.

57,How AI is Changing Marketing in the Legal Industry,"Jun 21, 2023",Hank Stout,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/ais-growing-impact-on-marketing-in-the-legal-industry/453550,"
The legal space is ultra-competitive. Attorneys and legal professionals will already know this not-so-secret fact. Marketing yourself and your team is vital to attract clients to your firm/organization.Historically, the legal space has been dominated by bombastic personalities taking to television and billboards that line the busy highways of America. While both methods have their positive attributes, a trend has begun to emerge throughout the industry; the rise of AI integration into general marketing.AI's growing prevalence in the industry and the general public has confused many people. So let's start here, what exactly is AI?



Artificial intelligence (AI) is defined by Britannica as ""the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.""Related: Small Businesses Can and Should Consider Investing in AI Technology — With a Cautious Approach


AI has long been a staple tool among professionals in the legal field. Many law firms or legal organizations feature an AI chatbot on their homepage and landing pages. These bots assist with the intake of new clients. The bots are trained to collect relevant information and direct clients to helpful links and pages on a firm's site.AI bots like ChatGPT or Google's Bard primarily sparked the current buzz surrounding AI. Both of these AI bots are conversational AIs. Both have shown to have extensive ability to generate content quickly. Savvy marketers know that content plays a significant factor in converting potential clients and helping drive you up the Google rankings.Some marketing professionals use Bard and ChatGPT to transform how they generate content internally. VentureBeat's editorial director Michale Nuñez recently disclosed that his team is using AI to assist in content generation. The exact details of the full scope of AI-generated content were not fully explained.Deep conversations regarding its ethical framework are emerging with the prevalence of AI-generated content. Concerns regarding plagiarism and misinformation are among the most common points of contention. Is it ethical to eliminate the human element associated with written content? How deep is the oversight on this content before it's published? Can AI show an inherent bias?


The debate on the ethical ramifications is still ongoing and unclear. However, this is not stopping many marketers from dipping their toes into the pool. Beyond Google Bard, the company wants to integrate AI assistance into general searches.Google has been very active in looking to integrate AI into more aspects of its services beyond Bard. In the company's own words, they are ""supercharging"" searches. Through the integration of generative AI, Google is working to simplify searching; one way is by suggesting questions related to the topic.Related: Why AI is Changing the Future of Personal BrandingCurrently, Google is allowing users to experiment with AI in searches. Upon searching a term in the experimental new system, users are given the option for AI to suggest content based on their inquiry.


If a potential client were to look up a search term like ""How much does a personal injury lawyer cost,"" they would likely see a list of local PI attorneys optimizing for that content. The AI-empowered may suggest an inquiry like ""How much does a PI attorney charge?""The AI bot will pull a snippet from a website with relevant inquiry to the search and attempt to answer the question without users having to click the link. In this case, it will be pertinent regarding the cost of attorneys. However, they are encouraged to follow the link if the inquiry is sufficient or need additional information.For marketers working in the legal field, this is especially interesting. Take, for example, a search for a local personal injury lawyer. In the trial, we tested this by searching for a PI lawyer near me. The AI suggested a handful of local attorneys and a follow-up question for the inquiry, which would offer more content.Some marketers may question how different this is compared to already existing searches? In short, they're different. Comparing a search of the same topic in the AI-recommended environment versus the standard search shows two different results in the featured snippet and several ranking pages for the search term.


This isn't always the case, though. Searching for ""PI lawyers near me"" in the AI search generated similar results from the traditional search, which featured the Map Pack at the top.There is concern about whether an AI-powered bot can decipher content to determine fact or fiction. The more these new AI-powered tools are used, the more they will learn and grow.Factual, informative, and educational content may be critical if AI prioritizes learning. The best advice for creating high-converting content may be to write from an expert point of view.Related: What Happens When Self-Driving Cars Crash? The Legal Ramifications of Automation


As AI becomes increasingly integrated into the daily activities of marketing professionals, the narrative and scope of how to optimize content will surely change. Already, AI is being used to optimize content for search engines, moderate chats, create web pages, and even more.

The Federal Trade Commission is suing e-commerce giant Amazon for allegedly enrolling customers in Amazon Prime without their consent and then ""knowingly"" complicating the cancellation process.""Amazon used manipulative, coercive, or deceptive user-interface designs known as 'dark patterns' to trick consumers into enrolling in automatically renewing Prime subscriptions,"" the complaint states.According to the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday, Amazon used tactics wherein the option to purchase an item without subscribing to Prime was ""more difficult to locate,"" and, in some cases, the button that enrolled users in Prime at checkout did not clearly indicate customers were agreeing to sign up for the service.

Additionally, the complaint alleges that Amazon ""knowingly"" made the cancellation process of Prime complicated and claims that company leadership rejected proposed changes to the system that would make cancellation easier ""because those changes adversely affected Amazon's bottom line.""Last month, Amazon settled two complaints from the FTC regarding privacy violations surrounding the company's Ring and Alexa apps, costing the company nearly $31 million.""The FTC's claims are false on the facts and the law,"" an Amazon spokesperson told Entrepreneur.

Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk has filed lawsuits against five spas and clinics across four states, claiming that they are allegedly selling knockoff versions of the drugmaker's weight loss and type 2 diabetes drugs Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus.The lawsuit alleges that the spas and clinics have unlawfully marketed and sold products that claim to contain semaglutide, the main ingredient in Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus.""These unlawful marketing and sales practices, including the use of Novo Nordisk trademarks in connection with these practices, have created a high risk of consumer confusion and deception as well as potential safety concerns,"" the company wrote in a press release on Tuesday.



Traditionally used to treat type 2 diabetes, Ozempic has experienced a surge in popularity over the past year as it has been found to help some individuals lose weight. Prescriptions for the drug have more than doubled since the summer of 2021, according to data firm IQVIA, per the AP. The demand for the drug was so widespread that it triggered a temporary nationwide shortage in August 2022.Novo Nordisk is also the only company in the U.S. that sells FDA-approved products containing semaglutide, and no generic versions of the ingredient are currently on the market or approved by the FDA — which begs the question of what is actually in the so-called Ozempic copycats.


Related: WeightWatchers Is Getting Into the Ozempic And Wegovy Weight Loss Drugs GameWith minimal supply on top of the high cost — which can be upwards of $1,300 a month — many would-be Ozempic customers have likely turned to independent spas and clinics to get ""custom-made"" versions of the drug that contain the active ingredient semaglutide, The Wall Street Journal reported, a manufacturing practice called ""compounding.""Compounding is typically utilized when a patient cannot be treated with the commercial formula of a drug (due to an allergy, for example), so a custom formula is made as an alternative. However, these custom treatments are not approved by the FDA, and Novo Nordisk alleges that the spas and clinics in question have ""unlawfully"" sold compounded semaglutide products that are ""counterfeit.""The company has called for a cease and desist of the five establishments (located in New York, Florida, Texas, and Tennessee) from selling the non-FDA approved drugs as well as required the spas and clinics to disclose that their products are by no means associated with Novo Nordisk.


The monetary amount in damages requested by the company has not been disclosed.Related: A New Weight-Loss Drug Could Be a Complete Game Changer. 'Psychologically, You Don't Want to Eat.'

A California restaurant owner has a lot of atoning to do after forcing employees to confess their workplace sins.Che Garibaldi, who owns two Taqueria Garibaldi locations in northern California, allegedly hired a fake priest to trick workers into confessions to ""get the sins out"" and fess up to any wrongdoing during work hours, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The faux priest reportedly asked staffers several workplace-related questions, including if they have been late for work, stolen from their employer or had ""bad intentions"" toward their boss.An investigation by the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor found that the restaurant violated the Fair Labor Standards Act for denying workers overtime pay. Additionally, the employer illegally paid managers from the employee tip pool and threatened other workers with ""adverse immigration consequences"" for cooperating with the investigation, according to the press release.

Harvard Medical School morgue manager, Cedric Lodge, has been accused of stealing human remains donated to the institution to turn a profit.Lodge, 55, and five others, including his wife Denise Lodge, 63, were indicted by a federal grand jury on conspiracy and interstate transport of stolen goods charges on Wednesday for allegedly participating in a ""nationwide network"" to buy and sell body parts stolen from cadavers.As the morgue manager for the Anatomical Gifts Program at the prestigious medical school, Lodge allegedly stole organs and other remains – including heads, brains, skin, and bones – from bodies donated for scientific research before they were cremated from 2018 through 2022, according to the indictment.



Lodge would then transport the remains to his home in Goffstown, New Hampshire, where he and his wife would sell the parts to resellers Katrina Maclean, 44, Joshua Taylor, 46, and other buyers online – often transporting and shipping the remains across state lines.

Maclean allegedly sold the parts in her store Kat's Creepy Creations in Peabody, Massachusetts, and to frequent buyer Jeremy Pauley, 41.Pauley also purchased remains from Candace Chapman Scott, who would steal body parts from cadavers donated to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences while she worked at a Little Rock mortuary and crematorium.Pauley would then resell the parts to others, including Matthew Lampi, 52. Records indicate that they would often buy and sell from each other, exchanging over $100,000 in online payments.

The ongoing debate over whether or not TikTok parent company ByteDance has access to user data has become less a question of ""Does it or doesn't it?"" and more ""Just how much does it have? And who exactly has access to it?""Yintao Yu, who served as the U.S. head of engineering at ByteDance from August 2017 to November 2018, alleges that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had ""supreme access"" to all ByteDance data, including that of U.S. users, The New York Times reported.Yu, who is suing the company for wrongful dismissal, claims that the CCP had a designated unit at ByteDance's Beijing office — sometimes referred to as the ""Committee"" — and members of the CCP monitored the company and ""guided how it advanced core Communist values,"" per the complaint.



""The Committee maintained supreme access to all the company data, even data stored in the United States,"" the lawsuit alleges. Although members of the committee didn't officially work for ByteDance, the CCP ""played a significant role,"" and the tech giant became a ""useful propaganda tool for the Chinese Communist Party.""Related: TikTok Tracked People Who Viewed Gay Content, Categorizes Users In 'Clusters'

Additionally, there seems to be a debate over Yu's tenure with the company.

Intuit, the parent company of the tax filing software, TurboTax, will pay $141 million in restitution to about 4.4 million Americans.The 50-state settlement, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, alleges that the company ""tricked"" low-income Americans by steering them away from free-tax filing services (for which they may have been eligible) and redirecting them to the paid version of its service, and were subsequently ""unfairly charged.""""TurboTax's predatory and deceptive marketing cheated millions of low-income Americans who were trying to fulfill their legal duties to file their taxes,"" James said in a statement. ""Today we are righting that wrong and putting money back into the pockets of hardworking taxpayers who should have never paid to file their taxes.""



Eligible individuals include those who paid to file their federal taxes with TurboTax in 2016, 2017, and 2018, but were eligible to file for free through the IRS Free File Program — of which Intuit was formerly a partner until about two years ago.Related: TurboTax Owner Intuit Slammed With FTC Lawsuit, Accusations of 'Bait-and-Switch' Advertising

The company attribution its decision due to ""limitations"" in the program and ""conflicting demands from those outside the program.""In a May 2022 blog post regarding the 50-state settlement, Intuit said ""In coming to a resolution on this matter, we admitted no wrongdoing and are pleased to be able to continue our strong partnership with governments to best serve the needs of taxpayers across the country.""

Those affected by the settlement will receive an email, and a check will be sent in the mail through the month of May 2023.

Rosemarie Benter, 81, has called her Victorian condo in San Francisco's Upper Haight district home since 1991. However, when she took out a loan to help pay her property taxes in 2021, she had no idea what would come next: a surprise foreclosure and subsequent eviction notice from a new buyer.Now, the long-time resident is suing mortgage advisor Laura Biche and real estate broker Michael Bruno for allegedly conspiring in a ""deceptive, fraudulent and predatory scheme"" that led to her being evicted from her San Francisco apartment, the San Francisco Chronicle first reported.Benter's attorney, Darren Orr of nonprofit Legal Assistance to the Elderly, told Entrepreneur that the problems started in 2007 when Benter took out a reverse mortgage — a loan that allows homeowners to borrow money based on built up equity in the home and typically bypass monthly mortgage payments, under the condition that they remain on the premises and pay property taxes.



However, when Benter was faced with health issues in 2020, the bills racked up, and she fell behind on property taxes, so she reached out to Biche — a certified mortgage advisor and self-proclaimed reverse mortgage specialist — for help.Benter says she was then pressured into signing a loan with Bruno — whom Biche referred to as a ""friend"" — to pay her property taxes.""It was basically a bait-and-switch setup,"" Orr told Entrepreneur.Benter says she was not informed that her home was listed as collateral under the terms of the loan, and so when she fell behind on property taxes, and received a knock on her door in February that someone was there to repossess her home, it was a shock — to say the least.""I said, 'What do you mean?'"" Benter told NBC Bay Area, ""He said, 'Unless you have thirteen thousand dollars to pay off this debt you had, it's going to be sold in 29 minutes.'""Meanwhile, the homepage of Biche's website reads: ""Let's dispel some reverse mortgage myths."" The first ""myth"" on the list? That the bank can take your home.


""But that's not a myth, that's a fact,"" Orr said. ""Biche knew this, and [Benter] told her why she wanted the money — property taxes — and Biche convinced her to take out about twice the amount that she actually needed.""Both Biche and Bruno declined to comment to Entrepreneur.An 81 year-old woman is suing to keep her $1.4 million condominium in San Francisco's Upper Haight district, saying she fell victim to a ""deceptive, fraudulent and predatory scheme"" that caused her to lose her home.Read more: https://t.co/Bgun1OrGUE pic.twitter.com/gYdqFLZbGg— San Francisco Chronicle (@sfchronicle) April 24, 2023Benter's home was sold in a foreclosure sale to Eugene Gardner for $138,000, who then posted an eviction notice on Benter's door on April 21, informing her she had three days to move out.

Elderly homeowners who are ""house rich, but cash poor"" are especially targeted for this kind of scheme, Orr added.""Financial elder abuse is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, crime of this century,"" he says. ""And a lot of it just goes unnoticed.""According to the FBI's annual report on elder fraud, financial abuse cases are rising — there was an 84% increase of reported losses in 2022 compared to 2021. When breaking down reported cases by state, California takes the lead — by a longshot. In 2022, there were 11,517 elder fraud victims over the age of 60 in California — that's three thousand more than its successor, Florida (8,500 victims), and more than double the third and fourth states with the highest rates: Texas (5,674) and New York (4,239).


For now, Benter is still in her home, and not going down without a good fight. ""I'm a tough bird,"" she told NBC Bay Area.Entrepreneur has reached out to Gardner's lawyer for comment.

Chipotle argues that Sweetgreen's burrito bowl is ""very similar and directly competitive"" with its own. They said the item had similar ingredients, such as chicken, rice, and black beans.Moreover, by using the word chipotle in its marketing, Sweetgreen is ""making prominent use of the famous Chipotle trademark.""Chipotle, the spice, is a Mexican powder made from dried, smoked jalapeno peppers.Sweetgreen said it does not comment on pending litigation.

80,Finding Investors 101: Understanding Securities Law and Legal Compliance Structures,"Mar 21, 2023",Jenny Kassan,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/finding-investors-101-understanding-securities-law-and/447206,"
In my work with impact-focused entrepreneurs who are ready to raise capital to take their businesses to the next level, I find that phrases like securities law and legal compliance can be intimidating. But, while these concepts can admittedly be complex, they shouldn't dissuade you from getting your business funded.Instead, with some education, you can understand enough about legal compliance structures to work with your attorney to make the right decisions. Then you will be equipped with a strategy that will enable you to seek and secure investors in a legally compliant way.What is securities law?Securities law is a somewhat arcane area of law that's been around since the early 1900s. The first securities law was adopted in Kansas in 1911. The story goes that some people were in Kansas from out of state trying to offer investment opportunities, and the Kansas legislature got wind of it. Believing it was better if Kansans kept their money in the state and wanting to protect people from being tricked into investing in out-of-state schemes, the Kansas legislature adopted the first securities law in the nation.



Several other states followed suit and adopted their own versions of securities law. After the stock market crash of 1929, the federal government adopted securities laws as well, but by then, there were already many state laws. Because of this history, we now have to be mindful of complying with both state and federal securities laws.Related: Funding Your Values-Based Business: How to Clarify Your Goals and Values in Preparation for Fundraising


What is a ""security""?When you're raising money from investors, you're offering them a security. Basically, a security means anything you offer another person to invest in, from which they expect to derive profit.The definition is very broad. People often try to set up offers and claim they're not securities — this is happening a lot right now in the crypto space — but if people are putting in money with the expectation of getting a financial return, it's a security.If you're looking for investors, chances are you're offering a security, and you have to comply with securities law.Related: 6 Steps to Finding the Right Investors for Your Business


The basic rule of securities lawA securities offering also is defined very broadly — even just saying to someone, ""Hey, I'm looking for investors for my business,"" can be considered a securities offering. Any time you have any communication that tells another person you're offering an investment opportunity is going to be considered a securities offering.Unless an exemption applies to your situation (more on that later), a securities offering must be registered under federal securities law and the securities laws of any states where the offering is made. A federal offering registration is the process companies go through when they ""go public"" (aka do an IPO). A federal securities offering registration is very onerous and expensive, so if possible, we want to offer an investment opportunity without having to register.If you're offering securities and trying to avoid federal registration, you must identify a federal exemption. You also have to figure out how you will comply with the state laws of any state where you plan to offer securities. Some state-level registrations are not as onerous as federal registrations. But ideally, you're going to identify both a federal exemption and a state exemption in every state where you're offering the investment opportunity.To do this, we consider all of the possible exemptions from the registration requirement, both at the state and federal level and look for one or more exemptions that may fit the situation.


Related: We Can't Rely on Venture Capital Funding to Build a Just and Thriving Entrepreneurial Economy. Here's What to Do InsteadUnderstanding securities regulationsTo help you understand the thinking behind securities regulations, I want to share the thinking of securities regulators so you can understand why certain types of offerings require you to jump through more legal hoops than others.Public advertising of a securities offering: Let's say you go on a radio program and say, ""Hey, these securities are for sale; check out this investment. It's really great."" Security regulators are concerned that this creates a greater risk than a private offering, where you're having one-on-one conversations with fewer people. They are scared that if you publicly advertise an investment offering, a whole bunch of people could jump into it and end up losing all of their money.Offerings to unaccredited investors: An accredited investor is defined under federal law. Generally, accredited investors are people with at least a million dollars in net worth, not including their primary residence, or $200,000 or more in annual income, or an entity with $5 million in net assets. They're a relatively small percentage of the population. Securities regulators believe that if only accredited investors are offered an investment opportunity, there's less chance of significant damage happening because these people have more money and, therefore, can afford to lose their investment.Large offerings: The larger a securities offering, the more damage it could do if things don't work out. If you're raising $100,000, the potential for widespread economic devastation is minimal. But if you're raising $100 million, that can impact many people if they all lose their money.These are the principles behind securities regulations: Private offerings to accredited investors and small offerings are subject to fewer rules than public offerings open to everyone for larger amounts.This doesn't mean we need to be afraid of public advertising, unaccredited investors or large offerings. It just means we need to be aware that these factors must be considered when we choose our legal compliance strategy.


Read More: Regulation Is Coming to the Crypto BusinessChoosing your compliance strategy and exemptionsWhen choosing your compliance strategy and the proper exemptions to use, you will want to work with a securities lawyer who can help ensure you meet the necessary legal requirements. Below is some of the basic information you will need to know to have an informed conversation about the choices with your legal counsel.If your lawyer doesn't know about all of the options available or tries to push you into just one option because that is what they are most familiar with, I recommend looking for a different lawyer.What are the primary federal exemptions?When offering securities to potential investors, you need to identify the right federal exemption to fit your goals (e.g., do you want to be able to advertise publicly, do you want to include everyone or limit yourself to accredited investors, how much do you want to raise, etc.). Here is a brief overview of the most commonly used federal exemptions.


Rule 506(b): This is the exemption most commonly used by securities lawyers working with clients that are high-growth startups looking to raise funding in the venture capital world. Under this exemption,There is no cap on the amount you can raiseNo public advertising is allowedYou can include up to 35 unaccredited investors, but this increases the disclosure requirementsUnless you complete the extra disclosure requirements for unaccredited investors, you need to make sure that everyone you talk to about investing is accredited — this is typically accomplished by requiring potential investors to complete a questionnaire before talking to themThere is preemption of substantive state law requirements, but you must file state notice filings and fees in any state where you have investorsYou must file a federal Form DRule 504: Under this exemption,You can raise up to $10 million in any 12-month periodYou can include an unlimited number of unaccredited investors under federal law, but this will usually be limited under state law because there is no federal preemption of state regulations under Rule 504No public advertising is allowed unless you comply with state-level registration requirementsThere may be state filings and fees required depending on the states where you make your offeringYou must file a federal Form DRule 506(c): This is a relatively new rule that was part of the JOBS Act of 2012. Under this exemption,There is no cap on the amount you can raiseYou can publicly advertise your offeringYou must ensure that all of your investors are accreditedThere is preemption of substantive state law requirements, but you must file state notice filings and fees in any state where you have investorsYou must file a federal Form DRegulation Crowdfunding: This was authorized under the JOBS Act of 2012 and went into effect in 2016. Under this exemption,You can raise up to $5 millionIf you are raising more than $124,000, you must have financial statements professionally prepared by an independent CPAYou can raise from the whole country without doing any state-level filings (although there may be a state filing required for the state where you are located and/or raise the majority of your funding from)Anyone can invest, although there are caps on the amounts unaccredited folks can investExtensive disclosures must be filed the with the Securities and Exchange CommissionYou must use a third-party platform registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and you want to choose carefully as there is a wide range in the quality and service the platforms provide.Intrastate ExemptionThis exemption applies if you are offering securities only to residents of the state where your business is locatedYou must comply with state securities regulationsState crowdfunding options are available, and some of them are pretty easy to comply withNonprofit ExemptionNonprofits can raise funding from investors under this exemption but must comply with state securities regulationsSome states have exemptions for nonprofit securities offeringsFinal points for considerationOne last point to be aware of is the issue of integration. This somewhat complicated topic boils down to one crucial point: You can't do two separate offerings that have different requirements as a way to get around the rules.I'll give you an example. Let's say you did a public offering under regulation crowdfunding, did a ton of advertising and collected the emails of everyone who expressed interest. Then the public offering ended, and you decided to do a private offering under Rule 504. Now you want to send an email about the private offering to this huge list of people who said they were interested in the public offering. That is essentially doing an end run around the rules, saying you can't find private investors through public advertising. So make sure you comply with the integration rules.That's it for now. This article has barely scratched the surface of all the complexities of state and federal securities law. But if you've taken the time to read it, you now know more than 99.9% of entrepreneurs about the rules governing how you can raise money from investors! Be sure to find a skilled security law expert who can coach you on the best compliance strategy for you and help you stay compliant throughout the fundraising process.

82,Online Dating Scammer Steals $1.8 Million from His Victims. Women 'Fed Lie After Lie.',"Mar 14, 2023",Jonathan Small,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/online-dating-scammer-steals-18-million-from-his-victims/447586,"
Look out for people on dating apps who offer investment opportunities too good to be true.That's the message from the District Attorney's Office in New York City, which recently brought charges against a lying Lothario they allege swindled his lovers out of millions.Nelson Counne, who also goes by ""Nelson Roth"" or ""Justin Roth,"" was indicted in a Manhattan court for bilking more than $1.8 million from five women through a series of romance and investment scams.



""He allegedly fed lie after lie to women he falsely claimed to have a romantic interest in, enticing them with investment opportunities that never existed while using their funds to repay past victims, lure in new ones, and fund his lifestyle,"" said District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg, Jr.Related: The Scam Artist Who Robbed Backstreet Boys and NSYNC Blind. 'Some of the Guys Couldn't Pay Their Car Payment.'


Dating for dollarsCounne, 69, met most of his victims via online dating sites, where he posed as a wealthy retired art dealer and investor with homes in London, Manhattan, and the South of France, according to the indictment.In reality, Counne doesn't own any homes and never travels internationally—he doesn't even have a passport. His sole source of income was the money he stole from his lovers between 2012 and 2021.The scam worked like this: After winning his victims' affection and trust, Counne convinced many of them to invest with him. He never shared any details of his business dealing, claiming the investments were in a ""gray area between legal and illegal"" and that he had access to inside information.Some of his phony investments included Alibaba and a start-up purportedly run by a former Google executive, which would provide an online lottery that potential college students could pay to enter for a chance to win tuition coverage.


""Most of the victims were initially hesitant, but Counne persisted until each agreed to invest,"" according to a press release by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.A Ponzi schemeThe DA alleges that Counne ran a classic Ponzi scheme, using the money from one of his marks to pay another. This enabled him to appear wealthy to new victims and repay previous victims suspicious of his fraud.Counne now faces charges of scheme to defraud in the first degree, grand larceny in the second degree, and grand larceny in the third degree.Romance scams like this are not uncommon. In 2021, some 24,000 victims reported losing approximately $1 billion to romance scams, according to the FBI.

83,How to Overcome the Shortage of Tech Talent in the US,"Mar 8, 2023",Roland Polzin,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-shortage-of-tech-workers-can-be-solved-by-hiring-from/446245,"
A peak in the tech job market is coming. The migration and technological adoption that almost all the US industrial sectors undertook due to the pandemic has overstretched the available STEM talent pool in the United States. Tech workers' wages have skyrocketed for some time due to the labor shortage.A close, competitive, and viable allyReports and articles abound confirming growth in demand for STEM jobs linked to the industrial digitization goals of US companies. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, occupations such as Data Scientists, Information Security Analysts, Statisticians, or Web Developers are among the five fastest-growing jobs for the next decade (2021-2031). But domestic talent is not sufficiently available, and employing foreign workers can generate a significant administrative burden for companies. So, hiring engineers and data scientists based in Latin America can be a much simpler, more viable and more profitable alternative than importing talent from other parts of the world.First, the geographical factor is important since Latin American countries have time zones similar to the US, which can improve the coordination of work teams. Also, Latino engineers who graduated from regional STEM faculties are of top-notch quality. According to the 2022 QS World University Ranking list, the University of Chile, the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, the UNAM in Mexico, and the University of São Paulo in Brazil are all producing high-caliber talent.



Although there is no accurate census, according to data consulted from Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, and Colombia, an estimated 165,000 to 220,000 engineers graduate annually from these universities.Related: Why Entrepreneurs Are Looking Towards Latin America for Nearshoring Opportunities


How to access that talent?The impact of COVID-19 in all industrial sectors revealed opportunities in the labor dynamics of which teleworking is here to stay—85% of IT divisions consulted by Deloitte plan to be hybrid or fully remote. However, 82% of US companies could not complete digital transformation projects in the past year due to a lack of resources and skills.The pandemic positively impacted the modernization of remote contracting and payroll administration platforms. Although there are specificities for different countries, there are generally three viable options for hiring remote talent: As an independent contractor, through a local employer (EOR), or via opening a company subsidiary in a specific country.Some platforms specialized in accelerating these processes are strategically located in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, or Peru, such as Skills.tech, Revel or Baires. Those companies and others offer candidate filtering services, skills verification, team management, recruitment laboratories and continued talent education, among other features.Related: 4 Tips for Hiring Employees No Matter Where They're Located


Two potential drawbacksFirstly, companies seeking to outsource talent (of any kind) should include Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies in their work culture. This concept is critical because Latino workers might quickly leave their employers if they do not feel represented or included. This often happens regardless of the team they work with or the professional challenges they face.Another factor to consider is language. Latin America is not particularly known for having the best English literacy in the world. According to the English Proficiency Index de EF (EPI), only Argentina is listed as having at least a ""high"" English proficiency among Latin American countries.The good news is that there is a direct correlation between work experience and the level of English. Better yet, the same EPI recognizes that, as a result of the pandemic, English in Latin America seems to have improved exponentially compared to the rest of the world. The scores show an increase of 16 points compared to the average increase of 3 points for the rest of the world.Related: Interested in Starting a Business Overseas? Keep These 5 Things in Mind


ConclusionHaving the most qualified people is key to competitiveness and growth for most businesses. Hence, US companies have been competing to attract and retain IT professionals. The current demand and shortage of professionals pose a unique and timely opportunity for Latin America, and several startups are starting to capitalize on this opportunity.While directly hiring foreign workers is an option for some companies, leveraging remote talent via service providers can present a simpler and more profitable alternative. The time zones of the USA are similar to those of Latin American countries, and the population of engineers is motivated and well-educated.With special attention to remote and DEI policies, Latin American talent can provide an unparalleled competitive advantage for US companies seeking tech workers.

84,Honeymoon Couple Says They Were Stranded At Sea by Snorkeling Company. 'They Were So Scared.',"Mar 7, 2023",Jonathan Small,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/honeymooners-were-stranded-at-sea-by-snorkeling-company/447032,"
A newlywed California couple is suing Hawaiian snorkeling company Sail Maui for $5 million after being abandoned in the ocean for hours and having to swim to shore.Honeymooners Elizabeth ""Bette"" Webster and Alexander Burckle were on their honeymoon and booked a snorkeling tour off the Lanai Coast.An hour into the excursion, the couple began noticing that the large catamaran they booked was drifting further away. Webster and Burckle swam for 30 minutes to get back to the boat, but they didn't get very far. As the waves swelled between six and eight feet, the couple called for help, according to the lawsuit. They were a half mile from land.



Eventually, the catamaran sailed off to the next snorkeling site, leaving the couple behind.Webster and Burckle had no choice but to swim to shore. They reached the beach exhausted and dehydrated.""If it wasn't a couple that was young and fit, they probably would have drowned,"" their attorney, Jared Washkowitz, told The Washington Post. Alone on the beach with no money or cell phone, Webster wrote ""help"" and ""SOS"" in the sand. They were eventually rescued by two Lanai residents who helped them return to Maui.

Jess Hebert, one of the other 42 snorkelers on the catamaran that day, told the Washington Post that she'd spoken to the couple about the incident. 'They felt like there were going to die,"" she said. ""They were so scared.""Although the incident happened back in 2021, Washkowitz told USA Today that the couple is still traumatized by it.""They're getting psychological treatment and have physical symptoms of anxiety,"" he said.

86,Everything to Know About the Murdaugh Family Murders: From Their Legal Legacy to Multiple Unexplained Deaths,"Mar 3, 2023",Sam Silverman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/murdaugh-family-murders-explained-what-you-need-to-know/438480,"
The story of the Murdaugh murders stems from a 100-year-old family legal dynasty in Hampton, South Carolina, that was put in the hands of fourth-generation lawyer Alex Murdaugh.But what took a century to build came crashing down in June 2021, when Alex called authorities after finding his wife, Maggie Murdaugh, and his youngest son, Paul Murdaugh, shot dead in their 1,770-acre hunting lodge at 4147 Moselle Road in Islandton, South Carolina.These crimes led to a series of revelations about the family, which HBO Max unpacked in the new true crime documentary, Low Country: The Murdaugh Dynasty, that aired on November 3. Followed by another true crime series based on the once-prestigious family Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal which is set to release on Netflix on February 22.

""Murdaugh will not be shackled during the trial, which begins Monday in Colleton County,"" a South Carolina Public Radio reported. ""He faces life behind bars if convicted. Meantime, a portrait of his grandfather that hangs in the courtroom will be taken down.""Keep scrolling for everything to know about the case and the Murdaugh family. Who Are the Murdaugh Family?The Murdaugh family began in South Carolina at the turn of the century and have been prominent lawyers in the state for decades. Beginning with Alex Murdaugh's great-grandfather Randolph Murdaugh Sr., who started Peters Murdaugh Parker Eltzroth & Detrick in 1910, generations of his family have continued to work at the firm, including his son, Randolph ""Buster"" Murdaugh II, grandson, Randolph Murdaugh III, and his great-great-grandsons Randolph ""Randy"" Murdaugh IV and Alex Murdaugh.The firm was successful with personal injury cases by taking advantage of a South Carolina law that allows people to sue in any county and not where an incident may have occurred — which can often result in favoritism and landed Hampton County on the 2004 list of ""Judicial Hellholes"". However, this made the Murdaugh group the ""go-to"" lawyers in the county.Randolph Sr. also became the first elected solicitor, (or district attorney), of the 14th judicial circuit (district) in 1920. Randolph Sr. held the role for 20 years until his death. His son, Randolph ""Buster"" Murdaugh II, was elected to the position next. He worked from 1940 to 1986, until his son Randolph Murdaugh III took over, working from 1986 to 2006. Alex volunteered and worked part-time in the solicitor's office after graduating from USC Law School in 1994 until 2021.


The Murdaugh family were solicitors in South Carolina for 86 years straight; leading criminal prosecutions for their district, and playing a key role in deciding which cases get prosecuted (and when) from 1920 to 2006.What Happened to Paul and Maggie Murdaugh?Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were shot dead on June 7, 2021. Alex Murdaugh called 911 at around 10 p.m., claiming he had discovered the bodies. However, the coroner found that the two had died between 9 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., per NPR, and they had been shot with different weapons — Maggie with an assault-style rifle and Paul with a shotgun.In October 2021, Alex was named as a person of interest in the case, although his lawyer denied the allegations and said he had no motive for the crimes, according to People.According to NBC News, sources close to the investigation said authorities found cellphone video evidence that places Alex at the scene of the crime.


On July 14, 2022, he was indicted by a grand jury in connection to Paul and Maggie's murders. He was charged with two counts of murder and two counts of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Alex Murdaugh's lawyers maintain his innocence.Image credit: Courtesy of Maggie Murdaugh via Facebook.What Other Crimes Were Uncovered After the Murdaugh Family Murders?As investigators looked into the deaths of the mother and son, other unsolved crimes relating to the Murdaugh family were discovered.


Two years before his death, in February 2019, youngest son Paul, 22, had been involved in a boat crash that left his friend, Mallory Beach, dead after being thrown from the boat. Though various witnesses said Paul had been driving the boat while intoxicated, according to a previous NBC documentary on Peacock, key evidence had gone missing in the case.Paul was charged with one count of boating while intoxicated and two counts of causing bodily injury, though people suggested he received special treatment thanks to his family's legacy. He was released on bond and a date for his trial was never set, per People.Additionally, two weeks following the double murders that took place in June 2021, the state reopened an investigation into a 2015 case of a man, Stephen Smith, who had been found dead on the side of the road.While South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) has not revealed what evidence caused them to reopen the case, per NPR, the Murdaugh name kept coming up in relation to the case. Sources speculated that Buster Murdaugh, Alex Murdaugh's eldest son who also worked at the family law firm, had a relationship with Smith, according to the Daily Mail.


Furthermore, although Smith's death was ruled a hit-and-run, he had a gunshot wound above his right eye and his injuries were not consistent with those sustained from vehicle trauma, according to the Daily Mail.Buster has not been named a person of interest in Smith's death.What Happened to Gloria Satterfield?In addition to Smith's death, SLED began investigating another case involving the Murdaugh family. In 2018, the family's longtime housekeeper, Gloria Satterfield, died after Maggie Murdaugh called 911, claiming Satterfield had fallen down the stairs. It was noted that Paul was present during the call.Satterfield was a longtime caretaker of the family, and according to sources featured in Discovery + documentary Murdaugh Murders: Deadly Dynasty, she had told several people that Paul would kill small animals and often disregarded authority.


Her cause of death remains unclear.At the funeral, Alex approached Satterfield's sons and said since the accident happened on his property, he was going to sue himself for wrongful death so the boys can get some insurance money, according to The New York Times.With all legalities handled by Alex, the sons were told to wait for a settlement.Alex and his insurers did reach a $4.3 million settlement in the months after Satterfield's death, but the Satterfield family didn't see a dime.


The Satterfield sons filed a lawsuit against Alex Murdaugh in September 2021, and SLED decided to exhume the body for an autopsy in June 2022, according to South Carolina's WCSC. That same month, Alex agreed to pay the Satterfield family $4.3 million.Where Is the Murdaugh Law Firm Now?The alleged misappropriated funds in the wrongful death suit uncovered various other financial crimes including Alex stealing millions from clients and his family law firm, according to The New York Times.He was then forced out by his partners in September 2021, just three months after the double murders. The firm changed its name to the Parker Law Group, LLP in January 2021, according to WOTC South Carolina.Alex was also stripped from being a lawyer in the state of South Carolina indefinitely, and his name was removed from the firm that was once known as the ""Murdaugh Law Firm.""


What Happened to Alex Murdaugh?The following day, after Alex was forced out of the firm, he was shot in the head while changing a tire on the side of the road. The shot only caused minor damage and he was able to call for help.Days after he was shot, he checked into rehab for opioid addiction. It was there that he admitted to lawyers that he had hired Curtis Eddie Smith to kill him so his son Buster could collect $10 million in insurance money.On Sept. 16, 2021, he turned himself in to Hampton County Law Enforcement in connection to the suicide-for-hire scam, per People.Later, on Oct. 14, 2021, Alex was arrested on felony charges for misusing millions from the Satterfield estate and obtaining property under false pretenses, per NPR, and was hit with tens of charges in the months that followed concerning numerous financial crimes and deaths.


He was indicted on murder charges for the deaths of his wife and son in July 2022.Image credit: Tracy Glantz/The Island Packet/Tribune News Service via Getty ImagesWhere Are the Murdaughs Now?Alex Murdaugh's murder trial began on Monday, January 23. He was found guilty of killing his wife and son and later sentenced to life in prison without parole on March 3.He has pledged not guilty to two counts of murder and two weapon charges in the killings of his wife Margaret ""Maggie"" Murdaugh, and his son Paul Murdaugh. The prosecution's case relied heavily on circumstantial evidence and has called 60 witnesses to the stand.Murdaugh was in prison as he awaited his January trial.


Murdaugh faces a total of 99 charges, many of which include financial crimes such as stealing from the family law firm, money laundering through a drug ring, and committing insurance fraud.As for the rest of the surviving Murdaugh family, eldest son Buster was last reported to be ""not doing well at all"" since his father was arrested for the double murders, sources told People in July 2022.A Murdaugh's trial, Buster remained expressionless when Murdaugh's guilty murder verdict was read according to courthouse photos. The Independent reported that Murdaugh mouthed ""it's okay"" to his son when the verdict was read.Despite previously working at his family's law firm, Buster appears to have no involvement in the rebranded Parker Law Group.Meanwhile, Alex's brother Randy still works as a practicing lawyer at the now-renamed Parker Law Firm. He denounced Alex's actions and claimed he had no involvement in his mishandling of company funds in a statement to People in September 2021.Randy is also suing Alex for thousands in unpaid loans.How Much Are the Murdaughs Worth?It's unclear exactly how much wealth the Murdaugh family once had, but several accounts and properties were found to be worth millions.When Murdaugh was held on a $7 million bond for 51 criminal charges, the court detailed Murdaugh's assets, which included numerous real estate properties and even small islands, according to Greenville News.Additionally, the court found a retirement account worth between $2.1 and $2.2 million, and an IRA retirement fund valued at $350,000 to $400,000.He was also supposed to receive a trust for an undisclosed amount after his father Randolph Murdaugh III's death in June 2021, plus probate assets after his wife's death that same month.Furthermore, the family hunting lodge where Paul and Maggie were killed was listed in February 2022 for $3.9 million.

87,What Happened to Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes? Everything from Her Net Worth to Where She Is Now,"Mar 1, 2023",Sam Silverman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/what-happened-to-elizabeth-holmes-sentencing-net-worth/439137,"
Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the not-so-revolutionary blood-testing company Theranos, has been gripping the headlines for nearly a decade.Although she was once seen as an impressive young entrepreneur, a shocking Wall Street Journal expose in 2015 revealed that her blood-testing technology didn't produce accurate results, giving thousands of people faulty reports.Holmes stepped down as Theranos CEO in 2018 and was convicted of four fraud-related counts in January 2022.The saga was fictionalized by streamer Hulu in March 2022's ""The Dropout"" with Amanda Seyfried, who won an Emmy for her portrayal of Holmes. Image credit: GLENN CHAPMAN/AFP via Getty ImagesWhat Is Elizabeth Holmes' Sentence? Elizabeth Holmes was sentenced to 11.25 years in prison followed by 3 years supervised release after over three hours of testimony on Friday, November 18, per NBC Bay Area's live coverage. She'll be required to surrender at a later date. She was seen walking into court, appearing to be pregnant with her second child, according to a video obtained by The Wall Street Journal.The amount Holmes will need to pay back to investors will be determined at a later date, NBC's Scott Budman tweeted from the courtroom.Holmes spoke at the sentencing, stating, ""I regret my failings with every cell of my body.""



Elizabeth Holmes (through tears): ""I am devastated by my failings. I have felt deep pain for what people went through, because I failed them.""""To investors, patients, I am sorry.""— scott budman (@scottbudman) November 18, 2022Who Is Elizabeth Holmes?Elizabeth Holmes' journey began at Stanford University in 2002, where she had planned to study medicine until she realized she had a fear of needles and blood. Inspired by her own skittishness, she filed a patent for a wearable medical device that could monitor a patient's blood and administer medication as needed, per Business Insider.Just two years later, Holmes dropped out of Stanford and started her company, Theranos, from her basement.Holmes told investors she had proprietary technology that could detect medical conditions like cancer with only a single drop of blood. Additionally, she led investors to believe Theranos offered more than 200 diagnostic tests, although the company was found to be using third-party machines, per BBC.


Based on these promises, she was able to reel in more than $700 million in investments from big names, including Oracle founder Larry Ellison. By stressing the importance of secrecy, she was able to get investors' money without revealing how the technology worked.Along with COO Sunny Sunny Balwani — it was later revealed that Holmes and Balwani secretly dated throughout their work together — the duo ran the company under the false notion that the technology worked, introducing their blood testing machine, the Edison.They continued to rack in millions in funding including several partnerships with major healthcare brands such as Walgreens, where they planned to have Theranos Wellness Centers in locations nationwide, per CNN, and a $350 million deal with Safeway.Through it all, Holmes branded herself as a ""Girl Boss"" and even graced the covers of Forbes and Fortune.Image credit: Photo by Michael Kovac/Getty Images for Vanity Fair sourceHowever, Theranos' chief scientist Ian Gibbons warned Holmes that there had been inaccuracies in the technology and it wasn't ready for public consumption.In August 2015, the FDA began investigating Theranos after finding ""major inaccuracies"" in its testing, and just two months later, the WSJ revealed the company was testing blood samples on traditional blood testing machines after getting inaccurate results from their own Edison machine.In 2016, the company was investigated by the FDA, the SEC, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the latter of which said Theranos' lab was not meeting compliance standards, per CNN and that it determined ""deficient practices of the laboratory pose immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety,"" per a letter sent to Theranos from the agency.


Because of these findings, Theranos voided two years of blood tests and corrected thousands of reports, per CNN, and the agency banned Holmes from operating a blood-testing lab for two years. Walgreens closed its 40 Theranos Wellness Centers. What Happened to Theranos? After Theranos' lab was shut down, Holmes tried to make a comeback with another product called the ""MiniLab,"" which would allow her to bypass the CMS's sanctions by selling the device instead of operating it in its own labs, per CNN.While Theranos tried to focus on the MiniLab and battle numerous lawsuits from investors, the company laid off 155 employees.Then in March 2018, the SEC charged Holmes and Balwani, who left the company in 2016, with ""massive fraud,"" per Business Insider. They were indicted in June with nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.


Since Theranos was a private company, Holmes was allowed to stay on as CEO but had to give up financial and voting control of the company, in addition to paying a $500,000 fine and returning $18.9 million in Theranos stock. The same day Holmes was indicted, Theranos announced she would be stepping down as CEO.In September 2018 the company announced it would be shutting down after 15 years of business.Image credit: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesWhere Is Elizabeth Holmes Now?Despite Holmes' impending legal troubles, her trial was delayed due to the birth of her first child in July 2021.During her trial, Holmes accused Sunny Balwani of abuse, which he has denied, according to The Guardian.She was found guilty on four of 11 federal charges in January 2022, including one count of conspiracy to defraud investors and three wire fraud counts, per CNN.Although Holmes is currently free on a $500,000 bond, she could face up to 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and restitution for each count.Prosecutors have requested a 15-year sentence and $800 million in restitution, per The Guardian, stating it would ""reflect the seriousness of the offenses, provide for just punishment for the offenses, and deter Holmes and others.""


Meanwhile, Holmes' lawyers requested 18 months of home confinement and no jail time.She was sentenced on November 18 to 11 years in prison.Ahead of her sentence, which is supposed to begin in April, it appears she has welcomed her second child according to her appeal request in court filings that cite her two children. ""Ms. Holmes has deep ties to the community: She is the mother of two very young children; she has close relationships with family and friends, many of who submitted letters at sentencing vouching for her good character; and she volunteers with a rape crisis and counseling organization,"" the filing stated, per CBS.


As for Sunny Balwani, he was found guilty of ten counts of federal wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in July 2022.What Is Elizabeth Holmes' Net Worth?When Holmes was 30 years old, Forbes named her the world's youngest self-made woman billionaire with a net worth of $4.5 billion. However, the outlet reevaluated the figure in 2016 when various allegations against Holmes came to light.At that time, experts determined that $800 million was a more realistic figure, but since she only owned half of Theranos' stock and with a bevy of investors to pay back, the outlet determined her net worth to be zero.In 2019, Holmes married William ""Billy"" Evans, who is heir to the Evans Hotel Group, which manages three properties in San Diego and was started by his grandparents in 1953, per Business Insider.


It's unclear exactly how much Evans or his family are worth, but during her trial, CNBC learned the couple had been living in a 74-acre estate in Woodside, California, worth $135 million.

88,How the Feds Could Regulate Crypto (and Why All Is Not Lost for Investors),"Jan 25, 2023",Chad D. Cummings,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-the-feds-could-regulate-cryptocurrency-post-ftx-collapse/440080,"
Each day seems to carry with it a new, ominous headline propounding the imminent demise of cryptocurrency. The death of Bitcoin has been predicted more than 450 times as of this writing. And yet, it seems to have staying power: more than $23 billion of Bitcoin has changed hands in the last 24 hours. Seasoned crypto investors — and their detractors — have weathered ups and downs, and there are doubtlessly more to come. But with each crash (and subsequent boom), the war drum of federal regulation increases in fervor and proximity.In November, following the well-publicized collapse of FTX, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen chastised the crypto world in a threat that sent markets in a steep plunge: ""The recent failure of a major cryptocurrency exchange and the unfortunate impact that has resulted for holders and investors of crypto assets demonstrate the need for more effective oversight of cryptocurrency markets."" The specific areas of concern she identified included ""comingling of customer assets, lack of transparency and conflicts of interest,"" which she claimed ""was at the center of the crypto market stresses observed over the past week.""While a precise federal framework of crypto regulation has not yet been codified into law, she made it clear that the writing is on the wall: ""Where existing regulations apply, they must be enforced rigorously so that the same protections and principles apply to crypto assets and services. The federal government, including Congress, also needs to move quickly to fill the regulatory gaps the Biden Administration has identified.""

It doesn't look like Elon Musk will be getting the keys to the castle anytime soon.The UK's Crown Estate has begun court proceedings to sue Twitter for allegedly not paying rent in its London offices.The commercial property portfolio, which is an independently run commercial business owned by the monarch to generate profits for the public, owns several notable buildings in the London area, including Twitter's office at 20 Air Street.According to CNN, the legal proceedings follow previous contact and ongoing discussions between Twitter and the Crown Estate.However, the Crown isn't the only landlord who isn't receiving rent payments from Twitter.Twitter's San Francisco headquarters located at 1355 Market St. is also facing a lawsuit from its landlord, SRI Nine Market Square LLC, for non-payment of rent. According to the lawsuit, Twitter owns $3.16 million in unpaid rent, per The Wall Street Journal.Additionally, Twitter's Seattle office was reportedly facing eviction, while its New York and San Francisco offices were said to be implementing extreme cost-cutting strategies including layoffs.Musk, who is currently on trial for a class action lawsuit from Tesla investors concerning an allegedly misleading 2017 tweet, has been trying to cut back since acquiring the company for $44 billion in October 2022.Twitter currently has 33 offices around the world.

The Federal Trade Commission has a bone to pick with 'Pharma Bro' Martin Shkreli – again.Despite being banned from the pharmaceutical industry after he notoriously hiked the price of a lifesaving drug from $13.50 to $750 in 2015, in addition to serving five years in prison for securities fraud, the FTC fears Shkreli might be trying to get back into the drug business.Shortly after Shkreli was released from prison in May, he formed a new company called Druglike Inc. in July, however, according to a court filing from U.S regulators, Shkreli has yet to comply with the FTC's request for more information about his latest venture.



In October 2022, the FTC began a new investigation into his ""Web3 drug discovery software platform,"" according to CNN, and he's yet to provide the requested documents and appear for interviews.The FTC also claims that Shkreli hasn't paid his $65.6 million penalty, which he was slapped with in February along with his pharma industry ban. According to CNN, Shkreli was supposed to pay back the funds from his drug price hike by March 2022, and he has yet to do so.

91,The Hot Tech Market is Finally Cooling Off. Or is it?,"Jan 19, 2023",Dmitry Bagrov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-the-demand-for-tech-jobs-will-only-get-stronger/442295,"
In the world of big tech, there have been many hiring freezes and recent layoffs. Many worry that layoffs in this realm signify an impending national economic crisis. Yet, there is hope for tech workers and jobs outside traditional tech giants. Companies outside of big tech are scooping up tech talent to develop their tech infrastructures.All in all, don't expect a slowdown in Information Technology (IT). What you should expect is a redistribution.Related: Why The Consumer Tech World Is Too Focused on Electronics



Current layoffs and ""cooling off"" in IT hiring are a drop in the bucket amid a global shortage of IT talentThree major jobs in the ICT industry are a software developer or engineer, user support specialist and systems analyst. Other positions include project managers, systems engineers, systems administrators and network engineers. High-profile tech layoffs and hiring freezes are masking the job growth and demand that remains in the job market. Many companies outside of the tech sector are hiring tech workers for their digital transformation processes. As a result, the growth rate outside big tech firms is minimally affected.Some tech firms' layoffs, such as those at Stripe and Meta, result from over-hiring. This happened as part of the tech boom that emerged during the COVID pandemic in 2020 and has less to do with the state of our economy. Raising capital is increasingly difficult as these tech firms' public market valuations decrease. Therefore, they're switching from a hyper-growth mode to an efficient growth mode.


Globally, there has been a shortage of tech workers for a while. Management consulting firm Korn Ferry predicts we'll be short over 85 million tech workers globally by 2030. That's $8.5 trillion in lost annual revenue. Since technology is rapidly becoming a fundamental element in every operation within any company, there will always be a shortage of highly skilled tech workers, no matter how many companies hire and pay more.Related: What the Future Looks Like for Fresh Graduates in the Tech IndustryFundamental demand for IT continues to growThere is too much work worldwide to build new digital products, rebuild old systems, take advantage of cloud tech and automate human-dependent processes.Tech job postings are higher by 25% this year as aerospace, finance and healthcare companies are vying to hire tech talent. And since 2020, tech talents worldwide have been finding work in Canada, specifically in Toronto and Vancouver. One reason for this could be the Trump administration's tricky immigration policy. Why jump through hoops to work in the US when neighboring Canada has looser guidelines and available work?


Canada's tech job growth rate has been outpacing that of the United States. This continues even as cities such as Seattle and San Francisco have tech giants hiring masses of workers.Layoffs and freezes will unevenly affect different sectorsWhile big tech firms will slow down, other industries (e.g., travel and healthcare) will take advantage, meaning more resources will come in.Every laid-off tech worker has a job waiting for them in the United States or elsewhere. Remote work, burgeoning since 2020, has extended the job market and made it possible for people to work anywhere.Frankly, some bloodletting is healthyCompensation and perks in big tech and Silicon Valley have reached crazy levels. Many believe that the Valley is losing its unique aura. Silicon Valley talent may not be a good fit for ""Main Street"" and may have little interest in working in such an environment. They will have to adjust, leading to a healthier, adaptable and sustainable tech workforce in the long term. Silicon Valley and New York City, traditional major tech hubs, are cooling down and cutting costs. However, states like Pennsylvania, Arizona, Texas and Florida are seeing tech industry job growth.


It's also important to keep the Eastern European IT picture in mind. What is happening now is that Eastern Europe, which was traditionally considered to be the main competitor, is in turmoil because of the war in Ukraine. Although still working and available, Russia and Belarus are no longer in the picture. Poland, Romania, Serbia and Portugal are becoming more expensive because of war and the reduced talent market. This is benefiting India, which is always a big IT outsourcing hub.ConclusionLabor market conditions are only getting better. Tech is the backbone of every company, whether in consulting, healthcare or aerospace. Displaced big tech workers will turn to companies in other sectors where they'll still be paid well and expected to work similar jobs. IT jobs were hot and still are because of the law of supply and demand.Every company wants to hire the best tech talent. However, there's only so much talent to choose from. It can get pretty competitive when another company can lure away the tech workers that one company has been eyeing. Let the tech talent wars continue.

92,Do I Really Have To Pay My Interns? What Business Owners Need to Know About Internships and Labor Laws,"Jan 17, 2023",Mital Makadia,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-business-owners-need-to-know-about-internships-and/442234,"
Internships are a great way for students to build new skills and gain experience. Although interns are often unpaid, internship programs are still subject to federal and state labor laws. Whether you are a new startup or a seasoned business owner, it's important to know the legalities of labor laws, especially when offering unpaid internships.Fair labor standards act guidelinesOne common misconception among employers about internships is that many think that they do not have to pay interns or can simply hire internship candidates as contractors. This isn't necessarily true. If the internship does not satisfy the test for an unpaid internship, interns must be paid as an employee. However, it's possible that an intern could be deemed a contractor, which is unlikely in most cases.In addition to myriad changes to state and federal labor laws over the past decade, in 2018, the Department of Labor changed its test used to determine whether an internship is unpaid or not.



Related: Paying Interns Is a Good Investment In the Future of Your BusinessThis federal law, known as The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), requires all ""for-profit"" companies (and some non-profit companies) to pay all of their employees. FLSA's test for employers is used to determine whether or not interns should be compensated for their work. Before 2018, the test required that all six elements be met to determine whether or not an intern should be paid.


Today's updated FLSA guidelines are more flexible; not every factor must be met. Commonly referred to as the ""primary benefit test,"" there are now seven non-exclusive factors that may entitle interns to be paid at least minimum wage:The extent to which the intern and the employer clearly understand that there is no expectation of compensation; any promise of compensation, expressed or implied, suggests that the intern is an employee—and vice versaThe extent to which the internship provides training that would be similar to that which would be given in an educational environment, including clinical and other hands-on training provided by educational institutionsThe extent to which the internship is tied to the intern's formal education program by integrated coursework or the receipt of academic creditThe extent to which the internship accommodates the intern's academic commitments by corresponding to the academic calendarThe extent to which the internship's duration is limited to the period in which the internship provides the intern with beneficial learningThe extent to which the intern's work complements, rather than displaces, the work of paid employees while providing significant educational benefits to the internThe extent to which the intern and the employer understand that the internship is conducted without entitlement to a paid job after the internshipWhat are the requirements for an internship?Unfortunately, there is no clear definition of what is considered an internship regarding federal law. However, the broad definition considers paid internship (AKA apprenticeships) as allowing interns to gain practical experience by being tasked with duties typical of the day-to-day work of said profession. In unpaid internships, the responsibilities tasked must be considered adjacent to the work that is regularly done; that is, employers cannot task unpaid interns with assignments in a manner that the intern takes on the role that would have been otherwise assigned to a paid employee.Related: 3 Ways to Make an Internship Invaluable, Regardless of PayWhile a paid intern is simply considered an employee, an unpaid intern is a student working for an employer for educational purposes. The ""primary benefit test"" ensures that the student is the primary beneficiary of the internship relationship. Still, there are some general rules of thumb to follow for consideration:


Is the student getting academic credit? If not, it's a strong indication that the internship should be a paid position.In writing, has it been made clear that the internship is unpaid? Transparency is paramount. Any internship opportunities or employment offers should be in writing, and intentions should be clear. There should be no question as to whether or not the student will be paid.Is the internship flexible? Does it allow the intern to go to classes and attend other academic commitments? It may be hard to argue that an internship is not paid employment if an employer is inflexible with a student's academic commitments.Is the intern performing services that otherwise would be performed by employees? Unpaid Internships are not meant to displace paid work; they are meant to give students ""real-life"" experience in the field.


Most importantly, internships should have clear educational components — not just actionable work. The goal of an internship is to learn and gain experience. It's important to set clear expectations for potential interns. Many may expect their internship to turn into full-time employment, so it is key to explain in writing that there is no guarantee of employment after the internship or after graduation. Like any other employment, you should make clear employment is ""at will.""Related: You Get What You Pay For: Making The Case For Paid Internships

93,Employee Must Pay Back Her Company After Computer 'Bossware' Catches Her Slacking Off,"Jan 13, 2023",Jonathan Small,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/woman-pays-back-company-after-software-catches-her-slacking/442856,"
A Canadian court has ordered a female employee to repay her employer after her laptop's software revealed that she was wasting time on the company's dime.Karlee Besse, who worked remotely as an accountant for Reach CPA in British Columbia, was accused of ""time theft"" and must pay $2,459.89 in returned wages.Besse had initially sued her company for wrongful termination, asking for $5000 in compensation. But in court, Reach CPA revealed that they had been tracking their employees' actions using TimeCamp, which collects information on how workers spend their time.



Through the software, the company proved that Besse had spent more than 50 hours on non-work-related tasks. According to a report in The Guardian, Reach CPA ""identified irregularities between her [Besse's] timesheets and the software usage logs.""Besse argued that she printed out hard copies of documents she was working on, which is why the software didn't track her work. But the company pointed out that the software also monitored her printing activity — and she hadn't printed many documents.

Here's a More Effective (and Ethical) Approach to Tracking Employee Productivity.Bossware is watchingSoftware like TimeCamp is increasingly used by companies wanting to monitor their employees' work. A survey by Digital.com found that 60% of companies with remote employees use monitoring software to track employee activity and productivity.So-called ""bossware"" blew up after Covid when companies looked for ways to ensure their remote employees were as productive and safe at home as they would be in the office. Companies argue that they use the software to help them run more efficient businesses.Companies are also able to catch employees engaged in nefarious behavior. According to Digital.com, 88% of employers terminated workers after implementing monitoring software.


But many workers and labor unions believe the software is nothing more than corporate spying. Last November, The National Labor Relations Board, an independent federal agency that protects the rights of private-sector employees, announced they wanted to ""clamp down"" on companies using bossware.""Close, constant surveillance and management through electronic means threaten employees' basic ability to exercise their rights,"" General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo wrote in the memo.The Electronic Privacy Information Center, a non-profit that has tackled the issue for years, says that bossware goes way beyond just tracking working hours.""Internet monitoring and filtering, E-mail monitoring, instant message monitoring, automatic time tracking, phone monitoring, location monitoring, personality, and psychological testing, and keystroke logging"" are all part of bossware, it says.

94,The Rise of AI: Why Legal Professionals Must Adapt or Risk Being Left Behind,"Jan 11, 2023",Roland Polzin,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/why-legal-professionals-must-adapt-to-ai-or-risk-being-left/441751,"
The legal profession is no stranger to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), and its impact is only expected to intensify in the upcoming years. As businesses strive to reduce costs and increase efficiency, AI is used for various tasks, including contract review, legal research, and drafting legal documents. According to the World Economic Forum, the legal sector will most likely experience AI disruption after the transportation and healthcare sectors.Five years ago, the New York Times reported AI is doing legal work, but it's not replacing lawyers — yet. However, recent developments with ChatGPT underscore how close we are to a reality where this will be the case. AI can now, undeniably, help and replace lawyers for certain types of tasks – from drafting contracts to summarizing complex laws.Related: Princeton Student Builds ChatGPT Detection App to Fight AI Plagiarism



Large language models, such as GPT-3, have recently revolutionized the practical use of artificial intelligence in the legal field. These models, trained on vast amounts of data, can generate human-like text, making them ideal for summarizing legal documents and predicting case outcomes. The recent acceleration of using large language models in the legal field can be attributed to a few key factors. One is the continued advancement and development of these models, which have become more sophisticated and accurate over time. This has made them increasingly useful and practical for various applications, especially in the legal industry.Related: 3 Ways Artificial Intelligence Will Transform The World in 2023


Another factor driving the adoption of large language models in the legal field is the increasing industry demand for automation and efficiency. Legal professionals are under increasing pressure to handle a high volume of work in a short amount of time. Using large language models can help alleviate this burden by automating certain tasks and allowing for more efficient research and analysis.However, deploying AI in the legal sector does not come without difficulties. Cost is a major obstacle to AI adoption in the legal industry. There may be significant upfront costs associated with selecting and putting in place AI systems, as well as potential continuing maintenance and training expenses. The legal sector is heavily regulated, and adhering to these standards can be difficult and expensive.The absence of standards in the legal industry is another problem that can make it challenging to use AI systems. Laws and rules are distinct to each legal jurisdiction, and AI systems must be tailored to follow these criteria. This can be a time-consuming and expensive procedure that may also include hiring specialized staff with knowledge of both AI and law.Related: The Curious Case of AI and Legal Liability


Finally, the legal sector has an aversion to change. Many legal professionals, including lawyers, have reservations about AI's dependability and accuracy and may be reluctant to use it in their job. Another concern is that using AI would drive job losses or decrease demand for human legal professionals.Do these reasons matter, though, to the companies and clients that pay for legal services? Probably not.AI can significantly reduce costs and increase efficiency for business — it's undeniable that the use cases for AI in the law and business are here, and they're not going away. AI can reduce the time and resources needed to execute some jobs by automating them. For clients seeking legal services, this may eventually mean cost savings.The speed at which AI can process and interpret enormous amounts of data is one of its main advantages. This can be especially helpful in legal practice, where it may be necessary to study and analyze documents and other materials quickly. Additionally, AI can eliminate humans in the loop regarding due diligence.


Even online dispute resolution services such as JAMS eliminate the need for in-person court hearings on complex intellectual property matters.It's also essential to consider the growing trust in AI systems. According to a survey conducted by Deloitte, 76% of respondents reported having trust in AI systems to make decisions, and 72% believed that AI could be a valuable addition to their organization. This suggests a growing acceptance of AI within the legal industry, and customers may be more willing to adopt it to achieve greater efficiency and cost savings.However, not everything related to AI is bad for lawyers. AI can give partners at law firms and general counsels new opportunities, even while it may automate low-level jobs. For instance, AI in contract management software can make it faster for lawyers and business teams to author, negotiate and redline initial drafts, freeing up time for higher-value activities that are often valued the most: negotiation and advocacy.As lawyers learn to collaborate with and take advantage of AI systems, it's conceivable that AI usage could lead to new career possibilities. So, will AI replace human lawyers in the coming five years? It's impossible to say for sure, but the trend is undeniable: AI use in the legal sector is expected to grow in the upcoming years, and human attorneys must adapt if they want to stay in demand.

97,Patent Trolls Are Targeting Small Business Innovators — and You Could Be Next.,"Jan 5, 2023",Gary Shapiro,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/patent-trolls-are-targeting-small-businesses-and-you/439620,"
As I walk the CES show floor each year, I'm awed by the world-changing innovations put on display by our country's top entrepreneurs, inventors and businesses. While innovation can happen anywhere and exhibitors join us from around the globe, it's not just our Las Vegas location that brings thousands of American businesses to our halls. But this year, beyond the spectacle and lights, I'm concerned about a quiet but potentially disastrous threat to American innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.The International Trade Commission (ITC) is a little-known but powerful executive agency tasked with protecting U.S. industries — including small businesses and entrepreneurs — from unfair trading practices deployed by foreign companies. That's a laudable goal. However, in recent years, patent trolls — in other words, companies that don't make anything, but manipulate patent laws to extort legitimate businesses — have transformed the ITC into a legal weapon targeting successful companies of every size. These cases have serious consequences, as the ITC often relies on exclusion orders and sweeping bans blocking American businesses from distributing products and using technology as a primary tool to resolve disputes. These extreme bans pose a real danger to American innovation. Just one errant exclusion order could shut down a small business, shutter a growing company or hamstring a successful entrepreneur.Related: 4 Potential Lawsuits to Watch Out for in Small BusinessAmerican entrepreneurs and small business owners spend years creating and investing in innovative products and services to build successful companies. Patent trolls simply prey on others' success. Unfortunately, these bad actors often see small and medium-sized businesses as easy targets, and the ITC's legal forums do nothing to discourage baseless lawsuits. Even the ITC's own data shows that the problem has gotten out of control, with lawsuits filed by patent trolls skyrocketing in the past decade. Now, it's commonplace for business owners to receive threatening letters, which cite absurdly broad or vague patents and offer business owners the choice between huge payments or costly, drawn-out legal action.Even small business owners who avoid direct confrontations with patent trolls can be caught in the crossfire of disputes between bad actors and larger companies. Take, for example, a recent ITC case filed by one patent troll against leading U.S. tech companies over their use of semiconductors. If that case is successful, it would exclude a large swath of tech products. Overnight, smaller businesses could lose access to key components used in their products.While Congress has been slow to address the patent troll problems plaguing the ITC, the issue is starting to gain momentum. Groups like the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) and the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council (SBEC) have led the charge on ITC reform, pushing leaders in Congress to introduce meaningful legislation. The bipartisan Advancing America's Interests Act, for example, would fix some of the most glaring legal loopholes patent trolls exploit for profit – but Congress still needs to pass it.Related: How to Stop a Frivolous Lawsuit From Sinking Your BusinessSmall business owners and entrepreneurs have a critical role to play in pushing ITC reforms over the finish line. Lawmakers in Washington pay special attention to concerns raised by members of their home state's small business community, which means that calling and writing members of Congress in support of the Advancing America's Interests Act and similar legislation can have a real impact.American entrepreneurs and small business owners are spending too much precious time and money fending off bogus lawsuits from patent trolls. ITC reform is needed urgently to stop patent trolls from hijacking American innovation.

98,Twitter Sued for Unpaid Rent at San Francisco HQ Following Musk Takeover,"Jan 3, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/twitters-extreme-cost-cutting-triggers-lawsuit/442141,"
When Elon Musk took Twitter private for a whopping $44 billion in late October 2022, the acquisition triggered a series of changes — both on the platform and for the company.Twitter hasn't had an annual profit since 2019, and Musk voiced plans to increase profitability following his takeover. He started the initiative with widespread cost-cutting to both staff and expenses.Within his first few days on the job, Musk fired top executives and laid off nearly half of the company's employees. However, Twitter's cost-cutting under Musk's reign transcends lay-offs.



The company is being sued by the landlord of its San Francisco headquarters for not paying rent, multiple outlets reported on Monday. Twitter owes roughly $136,260 in unpaid rent, according to the lawsuit.And it's not just the San Francisco HQ facing trouble for ducking out on bills.


News of Twitter's failure to pay rent on its offices first came to light in mid-December when The New York Times reported that the company had ceased paying rent and hoped to renegotiate the terms of its leases.Related: Twitter HQ Is Auctioning Off Hundreds of Items, Including a Kegerator and a Giant Blue Bird StatueTwitter's Seattle office is reportedly facing eviction, according to NYT, and after janitorial and cleaning services were cut off, some employees reported having to bring their own toilet paper to work.Similar measures of extreme cost-cutting have occurred at the company's New York and San Francisco offices, where security and cleaning staff were laid off before the new year.


Neither Twitter nor Musk has commented on the lawsuit filed by its San Francisco landlord. Since he acquired Twitter, Elon Musk has become the first person to ever lose $200 billion.Related: California Judge Says Twitter Employees Must Be Informed of Potential Class Action Suit Related to Layoffs

Velveeta's microwaveable shells & cheese product takes just three and a half minutes to heat—among the quickest of quick lunches. Florida woman Amanda Ramirez claims it's not that simple.Ramirez's attorneys filed court documents with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on November 18. In the suit against Kraft Heinz Foods Company, Ramirez alleges that heating up an individual serving of Velveeta Shells & Cheese consumes more time to prepare than advertised. She seeks $5 million in damages.The complaint says instructions on the packaging are ""false and misleading."" While the label says you should microwave shells & cheese for 3:30, Ramirez's attorneys claim the timing doesn't allow for all the steps required to make the meal. They allege that if you include those—removing the lid and sauce pouch, adding water, heating, then stirring—there's no way the pasta will be ready in just 3:30.The 15-page lawsuit also contends that the claim is merited because Kraft is essentially making money as ""a result of...false and misleading representations.""""The Product is sold at a premium price,"" the complaint says, ""approximately no less than $10.99 for eight 2.39 oz cups, excluding tax and sales, higher than similar products, represented in a non-misleading way, and higher than it would be sold for absent the misleading representations and omissions.""



Ramirez isn't just seeking $5 million in damages but also a new ad campaign that will correct the alleged misinformation.Perhaps predictably, Heinz Foods issued a statement to CNN in which the company dubbed the lawsuit ""frivolous"" and said it ""will strongly defend against the allegations in the complaint.""

101,Elon Says He Was 'Entirely Focused' on Tesla As Court Debates His $56 Billion Compensation Package,"Nov 16, 2022",Gabrielle Bienasz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/elon-musks-56-billion-tesla-pay-under-review-in-delaware/438727,"
A lot of business — and the attendant court cases — flow through Delaware, and it looks like the CEO of Tesla and ""Chief Twit"" at Twitter Elon Musk spent some time there Wednesday.The world's richest man acquired Twitter in late October after getting sued by the company in Delaware's Chancery Court to make him go through with the deal. Now, the same court — and the same judge as the Twitter case, Kathaleen St. J. McCormick — is hearing a different case related to Musk.Musk testified on Wednesday related to issues raised about his executive compensation, particularly as to whether he was devoted enough on Tesla to receive that large of an amount of money.



""I was entirely focused"" on running Tesla, he said, per the Associated Press.The lawsuit that started the court case was filed by Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta, who claims that Musk's board-approved compensation package from 2018 was excessive and breached the board's duties to shareholders. Further, the suit claims Musk has too much on his plate to pull a compensation package that can go up to a value of over $50 billion, per TechCrunch.


The legal documents call it ""the largest compensation grant in human history,"" the outlet noted.Tesla and Twitter are both incorporated in Delaware, as are most very large businesses, due to the state's tax benefits. This is why both cases will be in the state's Chancery Court. It has ""unique competence,"" in the nitty-gritty of business law.The trial will last about a week, and Judge McCormick will probably issue a ruling within a few months, according to the New York Times.What is the Tesla lawsuit about?Musk's compensation (stock options, salaries, and bonuses) as CEO of Tesla (going back to 2009) was pegged to performance, as noted in the 2019 pre-trial opinion from Joseph R. Slights III, who was formerly vice chancellor of the Court of Chancery. (McCormick took over the case from Slights.)


After Tesla met the goals outlined in past compensation packages, the board created a new one for Musk and voted to approve it in January 2018.The new package set a series of 12 performance goals, and corresponding groups of stocks, related to Tesla's ability to increase its market capitalization, as well as revenue and earnings. Upon hitting those goals ""corresponding to each tranche of the Award, options held by Musk representing 1% of Tesla's current total outstanding shares will vest,"" Slights wrote.This means that Musk would earn the equivalent of 1% of the company's total outstanding shares. If he met all of those goals, Slights added, the maximum value of the total stock grant is $55.8 billion. The company has met 11 out of 12 so far, per TechCrunch.Tornetta sued in 2019 saying that the package was too large and did not motivate Musk to focus on Tesla versus his other ventures. Musk, of course, is a busy man. He is the listed CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and now Twitter, at least in the interim.


Related: Elon Musk's Twitter Mass Layoffs Have Begun: 'Has The Red Wedding Started?Musk's legal team has said that a one-of-a-kind, high-powered CEO deserves a high-impact compensation package.""The plan designed and approved by the board was not a typical pay package intended to compensate the ordinary executive for overseeing the day-to-day operations of a mature company,"" a Musk attorney, Evan Chesler, wrote in a filing, per Bloomberg Law. ""That is because Musk is not the typical CEO.""On that topic: In court, attorney for the plantiffs, Greg Varallo, asked Musk about his title at Tesla, ""Technoking.""""I think comedy is legal,"" Musk answered the attorney. Varallo also asked questions about how he manages to run his various companies, from Twitter to SpaceX.The multi-billionaire CEO told Varallo being the leaders of any of these companies was not really the plan and that he likes to be more of an engineer, the AP reported.Musk said that he had at one point debated leaving Tesla. Board member later Antonio Gracias later Wednesday said that it was too hard to find a replacement, per the Times.""We needed him all the way in, all the time,"" Gracias said.


The lawsuit claimed that because Musk is friends with board members including Ira Ehrenpreis and James Murdoch, he generally exerts too much influence over it — despite recusing himself and his brother Kimbal from the compensation discussion — and the decision was not fair, according to TechCrunch.When he testified Wednesday, Musk claimed that the vacations he's been on with some of the board members were not super intimate.""For me, it was email with a view,"" he told the court. Gracias affirmed in his testimony that he has vacationed with Musk.The question of whether or not there was a conflict of interest is part of why the Slights initially denied Musk's attempt to dismiss the suit. Typically, the court would leave executive compensation up to a company, and ""this court's earnest deference to board determinations relating to executive compensation does not jibe with our reflexive suspicion when a board transacts with a controlling stockholder,"" Slights wrote in the 2019 opinion.


Whether to not Musk was operating as a controlling stakeholder (Musk owns the largest stake in Tesla but not the majority, leaving it up for debate) will likely come up again as McCormick hears the case, one expert told Bloomberg Law.Generally speaking, ""this has the potential to be a very important case from an executive compensation standpoint,"" business law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Jill Fisch told the outlet.""It won't get the attention the Musk-Twitter case got from the general public, but it's still important,"" she said.

Many prospective home buyers have found the real estate market frustrating and competitive over the past few years, and some people have taken advantage of that.Adolfo Schoneke, 45; his sister Bianca Gonzalez, 39; and other co-conspirators orchestrated an elaborate real estate scheme and stole nearly $12 million from 750 victims, The Los Angeles Times reported.Related: This Army Veteran and Real Estate Investor Shares His Top Tips



""Playing on the dream of home ownership and seemingly out-of-reach home prices, [Schoneke] figured out a way to 'sell' homes that he did not own and had no business in listing for sale,"" prosecutors stated.Indeed, buying property has been more difficult than ever before for many Americans. According to Redfin data, U.S. home prices were up 7.6% in September 2022 compared to the year prior, with a median selling price of $403,667.


Schoneke and his co-conspirators listed properties they didn't own for sale — even if the real owners had no intention of selling — and advertised them as short-sale opportunities, using that as a convenient excuse when the fraudulent process dragged on for years, in some cases.Schoneke directed office workers to open bank accounts in their names to hide the co-conspirators' involvement and receive down payments and other sums from the victims. Although nearly $12 million was stolen in total, some of the victims were reimbursed; almost 400 people are still out more than $6 million.Related: Former Yale Administrator Stole More Than $40 Million From the University to Fund Lavish LifestyleSchoneke was sentenced to nine years in prison last month after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and his co-conspirators await sentencing.

103,3 Common Legal Mistakes to Avoid When Working on Your Online Business,"Oct 25, 2022",Jessica Abo,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/3-legal-mistakes-avoid-when-starting-an-online-business/437673,"
If you're thinking about starting a business, attorney Berkley Sweetapple wants to help you avoid making expensive legal mistakes. She sat down with Jessica Abo to discuss how she helps clients through her practice and legal template shop.Jessica Abo: Berkley, you are the founder of a legal template shop and of Berkley Sweetapple Law. Tell us a little bit about your business and your practice.Berkley Sweetapple:I have a legal template shop where I offer affordable, downloadable, fill-in-the-blank legal documents, like contracts and website policies, to creative entrepreneurs. I also have a law firm where I work one on one with online business owners. I mostly handle trademarks, contracts, copyright and website policies.



All very important things. Did you always want to be a lawyer?When I was five, my dad, who was an attorney, told me that the only way I would be able to get the pot-belly pig that I wanted as a pet was to become a lawyer and fight the city that I lived in to change the local zoning ordinances.


Did you get the pig?I did not get the pig, but I knew that I wanted to be a lawyer just like him so that one day I could grow up and fight for things like having pet pigs. I went to law school after college but never felt like the traditional law firm path was right for me. After I graduated from law school, I created a lifestyle blog as a side hobby and decided that I wanted to monetize the blog and create a business out of it. I joined online courses and ended up meeting other creative entrepreneurs who needed legal advice about the online business/blog space. I really enjoyed working with entrepreneurs who had online businesses and began to educate myself in that area of the law, while working full-time as a litigation attorney. Seven years after graduating from law school, I stopped practicing litigation to pursue my template shop and law firm full-time. Who are some of your clients and how do you help them?My clients are primarily coaches, online course creators, website designers, copywriters, graphic designers, and other online business owners. My favorite practice area is trademarks, which involves helping business owners secure the exclusive right to use their business name, slogan, or logo in their industry. Because trademark law is federal, I have clients with online businesses in all 50 states.


You've been at this for a while. What would you say is the most expensive legal mistake you have seen someone make?The most common and expensive legal mistake I see business owners make is using a business name without first making sure it's available first. If you're starting a business, it's important to make sure someone else hasn't trademarked the name first, so that you don't get a cease-and-desist letter from their attorney and are forced to rebrand. Changing a business name after you've launched, along with the branding, packaging, and web design that comes with the business name, can be frustrating and expensive. It's also important to trademark as soon as possible so that no one does it before you. If you've been using the name and competitor trademarks first, litigation can get very expensive trying to enforce your rights.And that of course can be a total business nightmare. What are some of the legal boxes entrepreneurs should be checking?First, make sure your business name is available before you invest in any kind of branding or web design, or before you get too attached to the name. Hire an attorney to do a comprehensive trademark search. Make sure it's available and trademark it. Second, have website policies. If you have any kind of website, like a blog or an e-commerce store, you need a couple of legal documents on your site. First, you should have terms of use, which is basically your contract with anyone who comes to your website or purchases from your website. A terms of use will contain necessary disclaimers, your refund policy, and intellectual property clauses. A privacy policy is legally required if you're collecting any kind of consumer data. Finally, make sure you have contracts with your one-on-one clients as well as any independent contractors you hire.


How do you make all of this less overwhelming for your clients?In my template shop, I try to make it as easy as possible. I've created contract templates tailored to different kinds of service providers, that can be downloaded and filled in within twenty minutes. For one-on-one work, I try to make the client experience as easy and efficient as possible. For example, for trademarking, I work on a flat fee model so that clients aren't ever worried that costs will add up. I handle everything in the trademark process, from the application to Office Actions, so that clients don't have to worry about the legal stuff and can focus on doing what they love.

104,This U.S.-Made Pasta Brand Claims to Be 'Italy's No. 1 Brand of Pasta.' Now They're Facing Legal Trouble,"Oct 20, 2022",Sam Silverman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/barilla-pasta-is-embroiled-in-class-action-lawsuit-heres/437610,"
The Barilla pasta brand has found itself in some hot water over the Italian staple's city of origin.Two customers, Matthew Sinatro and Jessica Prost, filed a lawsuit against the company after purchasing several boxes of Barilla pasta under the impression it was made in Italy. However, despite the company's slogan as ""Italy's No. 1 brand of pasta,"" its products are produced in Iowa and New York.With its slogan and the Italian flag on its packaging, the customers accused the brand of misleading consumers with its marketing, stating Barilla is ""further perpetuating the notion that the products are authentic pastas from Italy,"" according to the lawsuit.



However, Barilla discloses on its website that products distributed in the U.S come from its local plants and not overseas, claiming to use the original machinery from Parma, Italy.Barilla Pasta that is sold in the United States is made in our plants in Ames, IA and Avon, NY, with a few exceptions. Barilla Tortellini and Barilla Oven Ready Lasagne are made in Italy. Our Barilla Italy products state ""Product of Italy, Distributed by Barilla America, Inc."" on the packaging.Furthermore, Barilla said its trademark is used to ""invoke the company's Italian roots through generalized representations of the brand as a whole,"" and isn't meant for deception, according to the lawsuit.Despite the brand's transparency online, a judge denied Barilla's motion to dismiss the lawsuit stating the customers suffered ""economic injury"" after purchasing the pasta under the false notion it was made in Italy. In addition to seeking monetary compensation, Sinatro and Prost are asking the court to stop the brand from using Italian likenesses in its branding. ""The most recent decision in the ongoing legal matter simply reflects the Court's early conclusion that the lawsuit can proceed,"" the brand said in response to the ruling in an official statement to Entrepreneur. The statement continued: ""Barilla remains committed to vigorously defend against these unfounded claims, as the wording on the box clearly states: 'Made in the U.S.A. with U.S.A. and imported ingredients.' We're very proud of the brand's Italian heritage, the company's Italian know-how, and the quality of our pasta in the U.S. and globally.""


This isn't the first time customers have sued a brand for misrepresenting its products manufacturing location. A California-based man is suing Texas Pete Hot Sauce, which is made in North Carolina, for false advertising, claiming it is taking profits away from brands that are actually authentic to the region.

105,'Nothing Texas About Them': Man Sues Texas Pete Hot Sauce for Alleged False Advertising,"Oct 10, 2022",Sam Silverman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/texas-pete-hot-sauce-faces-lawsuit-over-where-its-made/436936,"
Texas Pete hot sauce is in hot water.A California-based man is suing Texas Pete Hot Sauce for false advertising because, the lawsuit says, despite its namesake, the sauce is actually produced in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.According to a complaint filed against Texas Pete's parent company T.W. Garner Food Co., Philip White, a Los Angeles county resident, purchased the condiment at Ralph's supermarket in September 2021 believing the sauce was Texas-grown. White claims he wouldn't have bought the product had he known it wasn't authentic to the Lone Star State.



""Defendant has cheated its way to a market-leading position in the $3 billion-dollar hot-sauce industry at the expense of law-abiding competitors and consumers nationwide who desire authentic Texas hot sauce and reasonably, but incorrectly, believe that is what they are getting when they purchase Texas Pete,"" the lawsuit claims, adding that ""there is surprisingly nothing Texas about them,"" including its Louisiana-style hot sauces.Additionally, the product's packaging is ""distinctly Texan"" the lawsuit claims, although a label on the back of the bottle states it's manufactured in North Carolina.


The company's website also discloses where the product is manufactured and states that Texas Pete founder, Sam Garner, named the product after his son and Texas' ""reputation for spicy cuisine.""However, the lawsuit claims, ""nothing would overcome the reasonable impression given by the front label that the Products are indeed made in Texas.""The plaintiffs have requested the court to force Texas Pete to change its name and branding in addition to paying monetary damages.The brand has yet to address the lawsuit at this time.

106,New Cases Before the International Trade Commission Could Harm U.S. Entrepreneurs,"Oct 7, 2022",Hugo Meridad,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/new-cases-before-the-international-trade-commission-could/436267,"
Whether it's President Biden or the U.S. Congress, our government's promise to our citizens is that it will help U.S. businesses and entrepreneurs, spur demand for domestic products and drive American innovation. But to succeed in this mission, our government must do more to address an issue that is threatening to compromise the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit that is the foundation of the American dream.A recent string of cases brought before the International Trade Commission (ITC), a quasi-judicial organization with the power to exclude products from U.S. markets, has transformed the Commission from an organization dedicated to protecting U.S. businesses into an agency that foreign entities and patent trolls are attempting to weaponize against American entrepreneurs and companies.One of the Commission's key principles is that companies must be established in the United States in order to file suit with the ITC. It's a rule that is central to the ITC's mission to protect American companies from unfair trading practices. However, some foreign businesses have found legal loopholes giving them standing to file frivolous lawsuits that target American-made products and services, which in turn targets all of the entrepreneurs who rely on these services.



Related: More Patent Trolls Are Targeting Startups. Here's What You Can Do.Arigna, for example, a foreign company whose name is rooted in an old-English word for ""plundering,"" has filed dozens of suits with the ITC alleging patent infringement against some of the most successful companies in the U.S. — without actually making a single product. One of these cases threatened to block the import of a semiconductor essential in the manufacturing process of Ford and GM's new EV models. Another would have excluded 93% of all smartphones from U.S markets.


While the companies that have been subjected to these baseless ITC cases — Google, GM, Apple and Ford — are some of the most well-known and innovative companies in the country, and entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes would be badly hurt by this lack of access to critical technology. After all, each of these companies once started as scrappy entrepreneurial enterprises.Google reimagined the way we think of the internet by introducing a brand new way for people to quickly and easily sort through and access information. Apple disrupted the tech industry by offering new products, like the iPhone, Mac and Apple Watch that hundreds of millions of Americans use every day. And American automakers like Ford and GM are spearheading research and development in electric technology.However, with a single ruling, the ITC could do irreparable damage to these leading companies in America's most important industries and all of the entrepreneurs who rely on their products and services — from developers of smartphone apps to startups that rely on Google products to find customers.In the U.S., we're supposed to reward smart business leaders and successful companies that disrupt their industries with bold new products, and we're supposed to encourage other companies to follow suit. The idea that the ITC has transformed into an institution used by international businesses trying to gain an unfair edge or with the sole goal of earning a lucrative settlement is un-American, and we have to make a change.


Related: 5 Strategies to Protect Trade Secrets and Intellectual PropertyThe good news is that Congress has a chance to make that change. Senators like Mike Crapo and Ron Wyden and Congressmen like Kevin Brady and Richard Neal, who lead committees with oversight authority over the ITC, can more clearly define the role of the Commission. Additionally, leaders in Washington could pass legislation, like the Advancing America's Interests Act, that would rein in the ITC's power.However, abuse of the ITC is a deep-rooted issue, and it'll require more action and serious commitment from Congress to restore the Commission. Right now, the ITC poses a serious threat to innovation and entrepreneurship, and we need our leaders to take action.

107,"Warner Bros. Inflated HBO Max Subscriber Numbers Ahead of Discovery Merger, Lawsuit Alleges","Sep 28, 2022",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/lawsuit-alleges-that-hbo-max-overstated-subscribers/436229,"
Many people have strong feelings about the idea of an HBO Max and Discovery Plus streaming combo in 2023, the result of a WarnerMedia and Discovery merger.But the Collinsville Police Pension Board, an Illinois-based shareholder of Warner Bros. Discovery stock, which it accepted in exchange for its pre-merger Class C common Discovery shares, has taken it a step further, The Wrap reported, filing a lawsuit in New York. The lawsuit alleges that the media conglomerate overstated the HBO Max subscriber base ahead of the deal.Although Netflix remains the dominant streaming service with upwards of 220 million global subscribers, per IndieWire, it's faced significant challenges this year — including the controversy around its intent to crack down on password sharing — opening up the playing field for other streamers.



Related: What's Going on With Netflix? Everything You Need to Know About the Company's Massive FallAccording to the lawsuit, which names Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav and CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels as defendants and seeks monetary damages for three alleged SEC violations, the merging companies didn't disclose ""adverse information,"" including the real number of HBO Max subscribers.


""WarnerMedia was improvidently concentrating its investments in streaming and ignoring its other business lines … [and] overstated the number of subscribers to HBO Max by as many as 10 million subscribers,"" the lawsuit states, ""by including as subscribers AT&T customers who had received bundled access to HBO Max, but had not signed onto the service.""Discovery shares were valued at $24.78 at the time of the merger; as of Tuesday, Warner Bros. Discovery shares were trading just above $11.Related: AT&T Offloads Media Division, Announces Mega-Merger With Discovery, Inc.More than 700 million shares are in question, the lawsuit claims, meaning ""hundreds of thousands"" of people could be eligible to partake in the federal securities class-action suit.

Back in June, former dogecoin investor, Keith Johnson, filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk, claiming the Tesla and SpaceX CEO ""falsely and deceptively"" promoted the currency, and effectively ""engaged in a crypto pyramid scheme by way of Dogecoin cryptocurrency.""At the time, Johnson asked for $86 billion in damages plus $172 billion for losses incurred trading Dogecoin since 2019.Now, the lawsuit has expanded, Reuters reported, tacking on seven new investor plaintiffs and six new defendants — including Musk's tunnel construction business, Boring Co., and ""not-for-profit"" organization Dogecoin Foundation.Related: 'Frightening And Dangerous Nightmare': Tesla Owner Sues in a Proposed Class Action LawsuitThe amended suit, filed on Tuesday night, claims Musk, along with his companies Tesla, SpaceX, Boring Co., and others, raised the price of Dogecoin for two years by over 36,000%, before eventually letting it crash and profiting at the expense of dogecoin investors.How Much Is Musk Being Sued For?The plaintiffs are asking for $258 billion in damages, and argue that Musk and his companies marketed the currency as a viable investment when in reality it had no value at all.At its peak, Dogecoin was trading for around 74 cents in May 2021.

109,How to Find a Good Franchise Lawyer,"Sep 2, 2022",Jeff Cheatham,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-find-a-good-franchise-lawyer/432617,"
During the franchise investigative process, prospective buyers in the advanced stages will be provided with some very important paperwork. First and foremost is the Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD). Regulated by the FTC's Franchise Rule, it consists of 23 different sections (Items) that cover every aspect of the brand's proposition for franchisees. When the times comes to make an informed decision about purchasing a franchise, both parties will be bound by the franchise agreement. A frequent caveat in the franchising industry is for entrepreneurs to do the requisite amount of due diligence during their investigation of concepts. As for the two paperwork examples provided above, it's highly recommended that prospective buyers enlist the help of a good franchise attorney to review the fine print.If a candidate doesn't take this advice, and undertakes this process alone, it's quite similar to representing oneself in the courtroom. And you know what they say about those who don't seek legal representation – they have a fool for a client. Hiring a good franchise attorney is of the utmost importance, as their job is to review legal documents on your behalf. But the true value comes from the advice you'll receive, as it pertains to your suitability to own a particular franchise. Franchise attorneys also work with franchisors on numerous legal issues related to existing operations, as well as brands exploring the franchise model to expand their business footprint.Related: What Franchises Should Look for in a Law Firm
