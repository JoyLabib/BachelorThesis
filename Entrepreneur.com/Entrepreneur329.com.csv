Serena Williams, tennis legend and founder of Serena Ventures, is entering the beauty space with a new tennis-ball-green-packaged makeup brand.Williams announced Wyn (pronounced ""win"") Beauty on Thursday, with 10 products designed for an ""active"" lifestyle in 91 total shades.""I think active beauty doesn't necessarily mean running a marathon or playing in the finals of the U.S. Open: everyone's life is active,"" Williams told People.Related: Serena Williams Pens Bittersweet Goodbye as She Announces Retirement from Tennis""I'm more active now than I've ever been,"" Williams continued. ""I wake up in the morning around 7 [a.m.] and I want to have a look that can last all day throughout all of my activities. And so it was really important for me to focus on things that could do that.""Serena Williams. Photo credit: Wyn Beauty



The line features a variety of products, from lipsticks to mascara to a skin tint with SPF. The items are vegan and cruelty-free, according to the company, and prices range from $18 to $29.The products are available on the Wyn Beauty website and at over 600 Ulta Beauty retail stores in the U.S. and Ulta.com beginning April 7.""MVP: Most Versatile Pigment"" lip and cheek tint, ""Featuring You"" skin tint with SPF 30, ""Nothing to See"" matte concealer, and ""Glideline"" waterproof liquid eyeliner.

She was able to focus more on Wyn after retiring from the sport in September 2022.""When I would travel to places 20 years ago before 40 shades of foundation existed, I had to be the biggest advocate for my makeup,"" Williams told People.Celebrity beauty brands crossed $1 billion in U.S. sales last year, according to industry tracker NIQ, with sales growth that outpaced the total beauty market.NIQ's report stated that ""given the sheer volume of celebrity Beauty launches, it's important for founders to have a clear purpose for starting the brand.""Successful beauty companies from celebrities are usually ones that clearly explain their ""why"" to customers, according to the report.Related: Serena Williams Calls Out Newspaper For Using Questionable Article Title and Wrong Photo: 'Do Better'

1,Billionaires Are Getting Ready for Summer With Wildly Spectacular Superyachts,"Apr 2, 2024",Madeline Berg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/billionaires-and-their-superyachts-are-ready-for-summer/472036,"
This article originally appeared on Business Insider. For many wealthy boat owners, a private spa is a must-have on board. A sauna is a nice touch. A Jet Ski or two makes days at sea way more fun. And if you don't have someone on board who can whip up a Michelin-star-worthy meal, you might as well stay on land.In the world of massive yachts, there's no such thing as too much. After all, if someone spends eight or nine figures to design the vessel of their dreams — or at least $500,000 a week to charter one — more is more.



""Yachting. It's not rational; it's emotional,"" Ralph Dazert, the head of intelligence at SuperYacht Times, told Business Insider at the Palm Beach International Boat Show, where dozens of superyachts — often defined as vessels over 30 meters in length — were on display.And while there are certain classic features, such as jacuzzis and bars, what superyacht owners want is evolving, insiders at the show said. That might mean more crew members, more space for helicopters, or more water toys, but might also include manicure salons and putting greens.

Courtesy of Burgess Yachts via BI""The bar of what is the baseline expectation has increased exponentially just over the last four or five years,"" Anders Kurtén, the CEO of brokerage Fraser Yachts, said. Clients are ""spending more time on the boat and really wanting to extend the lifestyle they lead on the shore.""A lot of this can be chalked up to the pandemic. Superyacht purchases and charters spiked as life and luxury travel on land screeched to a halt. While the market has moderated slightly, the number of superyachts on order — 1,166 as of September, according to Boat International's Global Order Book — is still above pre-pandemic norms.


""What the pandemic really showed is that the appetite for being out there at sea, sort of living the marine lifestyle, is still as valid as ever,"" Kurtén said.That means there's a lot of money on the water. The total value of the 203 superyachts over 30 meters delivered last year was $6.4 billion, according to data from SuperYacht Times. New custom builds from the world's most prestigious shipyards — Lurssen, Feadship, Oceanco, Benetti — can run into the hundreds of millions. Even used superyachts at the Palm Beach show cost as much as $75 million.And it's not just traditional buyers like retired wealthy couples looking for a place to relax or celebrities looking for a place to party away from the paparazzi. New clients are often younger and have families, so want areas to work and watch movies. They also want pricey water toys, access to fitness equipment, or even pizza ovens for picky eaters.The gym aboard the Nero superyacht has 360-degree views of the water and a number of cardio and weight machines. Courtesy of Burgess Yachts via BI""This would've never happened in the nineties,"" said Giovanna Vitelli, the vice president of the Azimut Benetti Group, the world's biggest producer of superyachts. ""You would go with your beautiful woman, Champagne — the idea of yachting was much more showing off with your jacuzzi and things like that.""Pure opulence has made room for function.When Benetti's Nabila set sail in 1980, its 50-person crew, gold-and-diamond-encrusted interiors, and lavish parties captured headlines and even inspired the Queen song ""Kashoggi's Ship.""(Seven years later, Donald Trump bought Nabila for $30 million, renaming her the Trump Princess.)""Life on board was considered very formal — big formal dining rooms, boats were high on the water, you would be segregated from the rest of the world,"" Vitelli said, remembering another client who insisted on a replica of the Sistine Chapel above the dining table.


The Nabila yacht, which launched in 1980, was emblematic of a more opulent era of superyachting. Courtesy of Azimut Benetti Group via BIBut the ostentatious, palatial-like interiors that used to be highlighted in yacht brochures have made way for lists of more functional features.Rather than esoteric novelties like an extra-large safe for rifles that one builder had to construct per a Russian yacht owner's request, the superyachts on display at the Palm Beach show featured basketball courts, saunas, and ice baths.


Owners want elevators and luxury gyms. Pampering options, be it a massage room, manicure station, or a professional-grade facial machine, are a dime a dozen. Some bathrooms have fancy Toto toilets, which can cost around $20,000.Sterns (that's the back of the boat) used to be built high to guard guests' privacy. Now, they're built as ""beach clubs"" — an open swim platform.The roomy bathroom of the Triumph, which costs $650,000 per week to charter, includes a steam room. Courtesy of Breed Media via BI


And what good is a massage room if no one on board can give one? Many superyachts can hold twice as many crew members as guests, if not more. One broker, representing a boat that didn't have a masseuse, said it could be quite a ""tricky"" issue because if a charter wants one, they have to find someone who can massage guests and ""pull their weight with the crew.""""It's not uncommon to look for a deckhand who can also mix a martini, play an instrument, maybe entertain the guests with singing, and ideally even give a massage,"" Kurtén said.Of course, a crew comes at a cost. Most are considered full-time employees, requiring salaries and benefits like health insurance. Captains, first mates, and chief engineers often make six figures a year. That's without tips; a charter guest will typically spend six figures on gratuities for the crew who worked during a weeklong vacation.


The Grateful, which costs $15.9 million, exemplifies the open feel of today's superyachts — particularly its ""beach club."" Courtesy of the Azimut Benetti GroupFor the superrich, there must be room for toys.It's not just the onboard amenities that count. What's known as ""toys"" in the industry — water slides, eFoils, Jet Skis, and underwater scuba diving jets — are popular, and costs range from merely hundreds of dollars (banana boats) to millions (submersibles, which are still popular despite the recent tragedy).""Tenders and toys, the sky seems to be the limit,"" Kurtén said. ""More is more.""If you can't fit all those toys in the yacht's storage space, you can just use another boat. Jeff Bezos' support yacht is a superyacht in itself, measuring 75 meters and costing tens of millions of dollars. (His main yacht, Koru, cost a reported $500 million.)


Support yachts are also faster, meaning the crew can get to a destination first and set up the Jet Skis, seapools, and the like, Dazert said. ""By the time the owner arrives on the main yacht, everything's set up, and he can go and have fun.""Modeled after J.P. Morgan's yacht, the Nero is available to charter for about $500,000 a week. One of its custom tenders is also pictured. Courtesy of BurgessEven tenders, the smaller vessel that brings guests from the ship to the shore, are getting glow-ups. The Nero, a 90-meter beauty available to charter for about $500,000 a week and modeled after J.P. Morgan's 1930s ship, has custom-built tenders to match the design. The most expensive ones often cost seven figures. Nero has three.


""It used to be a tender was a tender,"" Jeffrey Beneville, who handles yacht insurance at NFP, told BI. ""Now they're called limousine tenders. Think of an incredibly luxurious gondola that's got a hard top so nobody's hair gets mussed when they're being dropped off at the Monaco Yacht Club.""One thing that clearly hasn't changed in superyachting: showing off. If the boat next door at the marina has an indoor-outdoor cinema, it's natural to want one too. Ditto a wine cellar or helipad.""It's a bit of a celebration of your success in life, of wealth,"" Vitelli, whose company is behind the Lana yacht Bill Gates chartered for a birthday party three years ago, said. ""You push it a little more.""And that's a boon for yacht makers and brokers catering to the super-rich.""Our job is to make clients' dreams come true,"" Kurtén said.

2,"Lisa Vanderpump Says If You Want to Run a Business, Get Some Thicker Skin","Apr 1, 2024",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/lisa-vanderpump-is-not-leaving-las-vegas-opening-new-venues/471912,"
You don't have to watch Bravo to know Lisa Vanderpump.Sure, the Bravolebrity debuted as a ""Real Housewife of Beverly Hills"" in 2010 and spent nine seasons ""wearing the crown,"" but she also is a longtime restauranteur who owns and operates five restaurants including two in Las Vegas (Vanderpump Cocktail Garden and Vanderpump à Paris) and SUR Restaurant and Lounge in West Hollywood — the inspiration for ""Vanderpump Rules,"" which premiered in 2013 and is still in production (currently airing its 11th season).She also co-owns TomTom Restaurant and Bar and opened Wolf by Vanderpump in Lake Tahoe last month, which she says is more ""curated"" and ""bespoke"" with a menu crafted and changed for each season. And this summer, she's set to open Pinky's by Vanderpump, a 7,000 square-foot Art Deco-style restaurant in the iconic Flamingo Hotel on the Las Vegas strip.



     View this post on Instagram           A post shared by SUR (@surrules) In addition to the restaurants, Vanderpump also founded the Vanderpump Dog Foundation and beverage brands Vanderpump Wines and Vanderpump Vodka — all of which contribute to a massive Vanderpump empire.""I just have a lot on my plate,"" Vanderpump tells Entrepreneur. ""You know, it's exciting for me, I'm happier that way.""And then there's the Villa. Although the British native has lived in Los Angeles for decades, her latest show, ""Vanderpump Villa,"" which is slated to premiere on Hulu on April 1, takes viewers (and Vanderpump) to France, where cameras roll as the staff of the exclusive and luxurious Chateau Rosabelle, which Vanderpump and her team created at the famed French Château St. Joseph for three weeks, for work (and play) in the middle of the French countryside.


Vanderpump says the show is ""definitely complicated"" because it combines a dozen young people living and working together with guests checking in for their stay.     View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Château Saint-Joseph (Chateau Rosabelle - Vanderpump Villa) (@chateausaintjoseph) ""It's a beautiful show, and it's an immersive experience,"" Vanderpump says. ""It was a lot of fun, it's a little bit of escapism.""Related: He Owns 12 Nightlife Venues in NYC. Here's How He Stays OpenStill, immersive escapism is the bread and butter of all of Vanderpump's backed ventures — step into one of her restaurants and you'll feel as if you've been transported to another land of whimsy and magic, or as Vanderpump calls it, ""naughtiness.""For example, Vanderpump à Paris in Las Vegas, which was just voted the 11th most photographed restaurant in the U.S. by Yelp users, is situated next to the slot machines in Caesar's Palace, but once inside you're transported to the streets of France with umbrella chandeliers, marble countertops, and lush velvet finishings.


     View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Vanderpump à Paris (@vanderpumpparis) ""People don't pay enough attention to ambiance — lighting is key,"" she said.Vanderpump says she does not have an assistant and is ""hands-on with everything"" in her projects.Related: Bethenny Frankel on Her Approach to Business and Negotiating DealsAnother key to her growth is making each venue unique while also making the space an extension of who she is and what she would want for her own place. After all, as her ""Housewives"" Season 3 tagline said, life isn't all diamonds and rosé, but it should be.""Of course, I'm a producer — I want beauty, I want excitement. I want great music, I want extraordinary flowers, I want great tablescapes. But I would want that in my life anyway … It was always like that before the cameras were on,"" she says. ""You have to always bring your style to something, make it yours, and make it different. I don't like corporate things. I like the feeling of unique experiences.""


But life hasn't all been gardens and roses. Viewers watched as her friendships imploded on ""Housewives"" before she left the show, and the Covid pandemic was ""a nightmare"" for Vanderpump's businesses, she says.She had to shutter the doors of her beloved Hollywood hotspot (and first Los Angeles restaurant) Villa Blanca in March 2020 after 12 years in business, while her cocktail garden concept, Pump, shut its doors in 2023.For Vanderpump, being a reality star has led to a built-in customer base for her businesses, but it also comes with the added responsibility of millions of eyeballs on special media and the publicity that comes as a result of her (and her employees) being in the public eye.Sometimes that's to her benefit, and sometimes, not so much.""The competition is so tough out there, it's not for the faint-hearted,"" she said. ""You have to develop a thick skin. That's very, very important.""Still, there are a few rules Vanderpump sticks to when it comes to business. First, you have to love what you do.""I think that if you're really doing something that you love, your passion for that is your motivation,"" she said while adding that sometimes life can be like a game...of tennis.""If you don't like doing something, it's like playing tennis. If you like playing tennis, you're going to run for that ball just because you want to hit it,"" she mused. ""But if you're not motivated, you're not excited by what you're doing, then you don't put the energy into it. Whereas the things I do, I'm excited. I don't care how long I work. I don't care how hard I work. I will get it done.""


But in the end, it's all about staying ""focused.""""If things go wrong, you learn from it. There's the good, the bad, and the ugly, and everything really, isn't there,"" she said. ""Sometimes it's overwhelming ... If you really get going and get on it, you'll be surprised by how much you can accomplish.""

Ryan Walther, co-founder of prank gift box and gag gift company Prank-O, has had a passion for comedy from a young age. ""It goes back to when I was in third grade, and I saw David Letterman do Velcro Man,"" he tells Entrepreneur. ""Right then, I said, 'I want to do that.'"" Walther didn't ""become the next king of late night,"" but he did work at the satirical news outlet The Onion for more than 20 years.It was there that Walther met his co-founder Arik Nordby. Nordby would bring fake gift boxes to The Onion store, which always sold out fast. Walther saw potential in the product, and when a little bit of research revealed the plethora of gift-giving occasions in the U.S. — and that no company was the go-to brand for comedic gifting — the wheels continued to turn.Image Credit: Courtesy of Prank-O. Arik Nordby, left; Ryan Walther, right. 



""I felt that gifting had become obligatory and mundane,"" Walther says. ""Aren't parties supposed to be full of laughter? So at that moment, I sought to develop a brand that brought great comedy to gifting occasions and parties.""Related: 'Don't Follow Your Passion': Mark Cuban Shares the 'Worst Piece' of Business Advice He's Ever Received — And How Changing That Mindset Can Lead to Success


""[With] everything that we do, we want to make sure people are laughing.""Walther and Nordby launched Prank-O — ""a 21st-century gift company that delivers laughter and experience"" — in July 2013. The first set of boxes included the Crib Dribbler, ""kind of like a gerbil feeder [for] a crib""; the Wake & Bake Dream Griddle Alarm Clock; the Family Blankeez that covers up to eight people and even an SUV; and the Sizzl Bacon Scented Dryer Sheets.""[With] everything that we do, we want to make sure people are laughing,"" Walther says. Essentially, Prank-O gives consumers ""the keys to the car,"" he adds: Whoever shows up to the party with one of the comedic boxes in tow ""[is] going to be the hero, where they deliver the prank pack, and the whole room erupts with laughter and passes it around, and it's a ton of fun.""One of the business's earliest hurdles was explaining to potential retailers that there wasn't actually a product in the box. But once they were in on the joke, the ""light bulb"" went off — and ""they absolutely loved it,"" Walther says. Prank-O landed Urban Outfitters as its first account during the 2013 holiday season; Target, Kohl's, Walmart and numerous others followed.


Related: Turn April Fool's Day Into a Marketing Success With These Innovative Strategies""We came out in our RynArik uniforms and presented different prank packs that were positioned as RynArik products.""In August 2018, a producer from Shark Tank called Walther about appearing on the show. Walther initially shot the idea down, much to his co-founder's — and the producer's — surprise. When the producer called back to ask why he'd declined, Walther said he ""wasn't interested in selling the company in seven minutes."" The producer explained that there's a due diligence period wherein either party can back out of a deal without penalty, and Walther was on board, as long as Prank-O was able to stay ""on brand"" — and prank the Sharks.The producers loved the idea. ""We came up with a skit where our company was RynArik Technologies, technology solutions for tomorrow, today,"" Walther recalls. ""So we came out in our RynArik uniforms and presented different prank packs that were positioned as RynArik products. I was wearing a prank pack we brought to life: a magnetic plate that stuck to your head so your kids could eat a meal while they sat on your shoulders.""


Image Credit: Courtesy of Prank-O. Ryan Walther, left; Arik Nordby, right.The Sharks ""were confused,"" Walther says — then ""certainly became amused."" When the duo revealed themselves as the co-founders of Prank-O, the company behind empty gift boxes, Mark Cuban was impressed. Prank-O had done $10 million in sales since 2013 and was on track for nearly $3 million in 2018. Although Walther and Nordby initially asked for $640,000 for an 8% stake, Cuban negotiated $640,000 for a 25% stake. The deal didn't close after the due diligence period.Related: Humor Can Make You (and Your Employees) More Influential — If You Do It Right""The studio is underwater — nobody can really know that — with sharks circling above you,"" Walther quips. ""That kind of makes it a little more intense.""


""I'm an empty box baron. Not many people in this world sell empty boxes.""The Onion is a social commentary on news, and Prank-O is a social commentary on consumers, Walther says. To stay current and relevant, Prank-O is constantly innovating to keep up with ""the ever-changing times of products and technology."" It's about layering ""fresh"" parody on what's new in the marketplace, he adds.Image Credit: Courtesy of Prank-OThese days, Prank-O boasts a nearly six-figure email list with an open rate that can reach 60%. Still, marketing and distribution remain two of the company's most significant challenges. Many people simply aren't aware of the product, Walther says, and distribution in the gift space can be tough with Hallmark's and American Greetings' hold on the market. Selling through Amazon in addition to brick-and-mortar stores has been helpful, he notes.


Looking ahead, Prank-O has plans to ""bring the Prank-O-verse and its characters and inventors"" to life with a not yet disclosed media project, and next year, the company will launch Prank-O Labs, ""which will essentially bring brands to life on and around April Fool's Day"" — ""a great day to spread laughter.""Related: 5 Corny Jokes Will Get You Past Cold-Calling Gatekeepers""I'm an empty box baron,"" Walther says.

So overall awareness certainly grows year over year.""

7,'The IRS is Coming in Hot': Jason Tartick Says All Business Owners Should Do This 1 Thing Before Filing Taxes — Or Risk a Potentially Pricey Audit,"Mar 21, 2024",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/jason-tartick-on-tax-mistakes-avoiding-audits/471463,"
Although Jason Tartick might have first made headlines and garnered an audience on Season 14 of ABC's The Bachelorette, he's carved out a place in the business world that's made him a trusted expert in the personal finance space — with or without a final rose.Tartick is the owner of five businesses (now including his own talent agency, Rewired Talent Management) and the host of one of Apple's top-rated business and money podcasts, Trading Secrets with Jason Tartick. The Wall Street Journal best-selling author of Talk Money to Me has a way of boiling down complex financial topics in a way that helps everyday people understand what they can do to improve their businesses, income and financial future.Entrepreneur sat down with Tartick, who is partnering with TurboTax this year, to discuss one of the most daunting tasks for entrepreneurs and individuals — filing taxes. Tartick offered advice on what to avoid, what to look out for and what to start doing today to maximize returns, both now and in the future.



Answers have been edited and condensed for clarity.Entrepreneur: What's the number one thing small business owners should focus on when starting the process of filing taxes?Jason Tartick: I think the biggest thing for small business owners is organization. There are so many statistics out there that showcase that when small business owners are unorganized, they're missing expenses, or they're missing opportunities to reduce their taxable income, which is just money not in their pockets. For small businesses and startups, it's critical. The big thing is that within five years, [about] 50% of startups in the United States go out of business, typically because of mismanagement and disorganization.


What's the first tangible step business owners should take to get and stay organized?I would recommend, first and foremost, QuickBooks to get bookkeeping in place. Small businesses [can] struggle with outsourcing to experts, so that's when they should use TurboTax Live Business, where they can file their taxes themselves, file an extension or file their taxes with an expert. The coolest thing about the experts is days, nights and weekends — they're available via FaceTime or a call for any questions they have.Related: 7 Advanced Tax Strategies for Self-Employed ProfessionalsIs outsourcing to an expert the best way to ensure that you're maximizing your tax return, both personally and for your business? How should people stay updated on what deductions they're eligible for?In tax law, change is the only constant — and we are seeing that in all forms of all metrics that connect to the economy, tax rates and just in general change to tax laws. So the problem is, if you're not working with an expert, you're not going to know what the closest or most relevant deduction is for your specific business or industry. America is so pro-business, and there are so many — I'll call them strategies, not loopholes — but strategies for individuals to take advantage of. There are even tax deductions in place for the size of your car, how much it weighs, what percentage of your house you can write off for office space, meals, business travel, mileage and depreciation of your car — there are things that business owners are spending money on every single day that they don't recognize as tax deductions. And because they're trying to do everything themselves and wear all the hats, they're missing out on those things. Outsource to an expert because it's so niche.Aside from trying to take everything on all at once and without help, what's another major mistake you see businesses and individuals make when filing their taxes?The biggest mistake I've seen with companies that are filing their taxes, and even individuals, is that they commingle personal and business expenses. Some people don't have a separate business card and a separate personal card, and they have no way of bookkeeping. So things that should be spent as personal expenses are being spent on business and vice versa. And the biggest issue with the success of these small businesses is managing the numbers. If your numbers aren't accurate, how can you manage them? How can you reduce your tax liability? How can you put yourself in a position to reinvest money to grow? It's always miscategorization of things due to unorganized expense management.


Related: Filing Your Taxes Is About to Get Cheaper in 13 States. Here's Who's Eligible.When it comes to the 2024 tax season specifically, are there any big changes to filing that people should be aware of?Let's look at last year, especially for individual returns, which are [due] coming up on April 15. Sixty-four percent of people who filed got a refund — and a refund of up to $2,700 on average. And we're still seeing so many people not even file their taxes, which is just absolutely crazy in today's world. The other thing we're seeing is that the IRS is putting hundreds of millions of dollars into auditing small business and personal tax returns. So, when I think about 2024 and the biggest change within taxes and the IRS, it's that the IRS is putting massive dollars into the audit. If you look at your past few years and things haven't been done properly, you are going to pay [for] it. The IRS is coming in hot; they're coming in hard, and they will be at people's front door when we least expect it.To avoid a not-so-pleasant run-in with the IRS, is there an ideal timeline you would recommend for people and businesses to start getting their ducks in a row for filing? How early should people be prepared?Every quarter you should understand where your books are, understand your financials and have all of your tax receipts and invoices for that quarter. When people wait for the full year, things fall through the cracks. There are also so many other deductions that can contribute to your retirement based on the time of the year. If you're contributing to your 401k or if you have a high-deductible health plan, for example, those cut-offs are in Q2 of this year. You're going to miss out on huge savings if you're not contributing to these pre-tax opportunities that will save you money and can be turned into investments. So we all think March 15, we think April 15, filing an extension to October 15 if we miss the deadline. And we think, ""That's it"" when it comes to taxes. But there are so many different dates and times throughout the year that we could be missing out on an opportunity to take pre-tax dollars and invest them and or qualify for certain expenses.

When Facebook launched in 2004, it offered the ability to ""poke"" your friends to get their attention as a virtual nudge — and the feature has been debated ever since. Was it a nuisance or a low-key way to say hi?While it lost its visibility (and popularity) over the years, in celebration of Facebook's 20th anniversary, Meta is hoping to capitalize on nostalgia for the retro practice by bringing back the ease of ""poking.""And like the 20-year fashion cycle, it seems to be back in style. In a Threads post, Facebook revealed that there had been a 13x increase in poking over the past month.



  Post by @zuckView on Threads ""I poked Prisiclla, and now we're married,"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg joked about his wife of nearly 12 years in response. ""Nature is healing.""Facebook told TechCrunch that in recent weeks, the social media platform has made it easier to find the informational page about poking easier, as well as adding a button to poke a person as soon as their name is searched on the platform.When users type ""poking"" or ""pokes"" into the Facebook search bar, the Poke page will surface.The company also said that over 50% of recent pokes came from a younger group of users aged 18 to 29.


Moreover, a recent report from the New York Times found that Gen Z has become more active on Facebook due to the platform's Marketplace feature, where users can buy and sell new and used goods without required fees or online transactions.Marketplace currently has over one billion monthly active users and per a 2022 Statista study, was the second most popular online destination for resold goods (eBay was first), even beating out Craigslist.

11,I Attended an Ivy League University's Most Popular MBA Leadership Class and Learned How Steve Jobs Became a Better Leader in 10 Minutes,"Mar 8, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/heres-how-steve-jobs-became-a-better-leader-in-10-minutes/470841,"
Hitendra Wadhwa, professor of practice at Columbia Business School and founder of Mentora Institute, teaches the university's most popular class on personal leadership and success — two topics that most business students are eager to learn more about.That much was clear on the rainy January day when I sat in on the afternoon session of Wadhwa's course; despite the dreary weather, the energy was palpable, with every seat taken and some attendees even standing in the back.Wadhwa wrote the literal book on looking inward to find outward success. In Inner Mastery, Outer Impact: How Your Five Core Energies Hold the Key to Success, Wadhwa reveals how activating purpose, wisdom, growth, love and self-realization can help people make a real mark on the world.

During the session I attended, Wadhwa relayed a compelling story about Steve Jobs that captures those core energies in action — and shows that the best leaders are willing to pivot, even when it's difficult.""Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.""The story starts in 2001, just before Apple was set to open its first retail store. Ron Johnson, the company's senior vice president of retail from 2000 to 2011, was riding to a weekly planning meeting with Jobs when he shared his concerns about the proposed layout of the new store.Like most retail outlets, Apple planned to organize its store by product. But Johnson saw an opportunity to design it according to activity, like making movies or listening to music, and lean into the innovation that had already helped Jobs' brainchild become a category of one.


But Jobs wasn't having it: The store's opening was fast approaching, and he didn't think there was time for a complete overhaul. Johnson and Jobs sat with the tension of that disagreement as they rode the rest of the way to the meeting.Related: As Steve Jobs Once Said, 'People With Passion Can Change The World'Then, about 10 minutes later, the pair walked into the meeting, and Jobs surprised Johnson by telling the team that Johnson believed the store's design was completely misguided — and that he agreed. Jobs said he was going to step aside while they all worked together to figure out the best way forward.By telling the story about Johnson and Jobs, Wadhwa makes an invaluable point: The kind of leader someone is in one moment doesn't have to dictate the kind of leader they'll be in the next. A willingness to change your mind and think outside of the box, even when it means additional challenges in the short term, isn't a weakness — it's a strength.

      Key Takeaways    



        Watercutter says she's always had an entrepreneurial spirit, but the side hustle proved challenging at the start. 
      


        Cash flow was one of the biggest hurdles; it took ""a lot of discipline and learning"" to push the business forward. 
      


        The brand's since gone viral on TikTok and began hitting seven-figure revenue months last year.

Katherine Watercutter.What was your day job when you started your side hustle, and why were you interested in entrepreneurship?



I was a sales representative for a distribution company working with kitchen and bath designers around Indiana (I studied interior architecture and design). I have always been an entrepreneur since I was young; you have to have that as a part of you to be willing to take risks.When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?


I got the idea for it in 2018 and started it in January 2019. There really was no inspiration — I thought it could make me quick money. But I was wrong about that.Related: He 'Accidentally Discovered' a Semi-Passive Side Hustle in College — Now He's on Track to Make More Than $500,000 This YearWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I started a Shopify store and created a website and an Instagram.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?One of the biggest challenges early on was cash flow. I didn't receive funding from outside investors and started with very little to invest. So there were a few times where I almost had to close the doors because of cash flow. It taught me a very valuable lesson early on because businesses often fail the first year when they run out of money. I navigated that by getting a line of credit from the bank and a business credit card, which helped with funds, but I also almost maxed those out. It took a lot of discipline, learning and watching the numbers to navigate this challenge until I saw more consistent growth and revenue.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?The side hustle didn't earn anything. It wasn't until a few years into making it my full-time job, dedicating 80-90 hours a week, that I actually started making money, and I didn't pay myself until about 2021. It is hard to say how long it took for consistent revenue because it wasn't until the spring or summer of 2020 that revenue took off — but later that year, it dropped again. It is safe to say that 2021 was the year that revenue was actually ""consistent"" enough to feel safe where debt was paid off, and things were headed in the right direction. So that would be a total of about three years (two years all-in on my business).

People in this day and age are impatient and sometimes quick to give up when they feel like they keep failing. There were a few times when I thought I hit ""rock bottom"" and exhausted all options, but I found a way around it. I felt like I was failing consistently for three years, and I know many would have given up by then, but business is all about problem-solving.Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a Month

      Key Takeaways    



        OpenAI executives on Tuesday published a blog post about the company's relationship with Elon Musk.
      


        Years after leaving OpenAI himself, Musk is suing the company and its CEO, Sam Altman.
      


        In emails posted by OpenAI, Musk suggested the AI company ""attach to Tesla as its cash cow.""

OpenAI executives including CEO Sam Altman (left) published a blog post containing emails that suggest Elon Musk (right) believed the AI company should have attached itself to Tesla for funding.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. OpenAI publicly fired back at Elon Musk's lawsuit on Tuesday in a blog post that revealed new details about Musk's relationship with the company.""We're sad that it's come to this with someone whom we've deeply admired — someone who inspired us to aim higher, then told us we would fail, started a competitor, and then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAI's mission without him,"" read the blog post, which published a series of internal emails between Musk and OpenAI executives dating between 2015 and 2018.



Lawyers for Musk and representatives for OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.In his lawsuit filed Friday, Musk accused OpenAI and its leaders of abandoning their open-source principles by partnering with Microsoft. It argued the company's 2019 pivot to a ""capped-profit"" division amounts to a breach of its original 2015 contract as a nonprofit.


The Tesla CEO left the board of OpenAI in 2018, but Musk's lawyers said in the suit he continued to contribute to the company until 2020.RELATED: Elon Musk Sues ChatGPT-Maker OpenAI, Accuses the Company of Working to 'Maximize Profits For Microsoft, Rather Than For the Benefit of Humanity'In the first of the emails published Tuesday by OpenAI, written November of 2015, Musk writes to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the company's president, Greg Brockman, that the company has to seek funding equating to a ""much bigger number than $100M to avoid sounding hopeless relative to what Google or Facebook are spending.""""I think we should say that we are starting with a $1B funding commitment,"" Musk wrote. ""This is real. I will cover whatever anyone else doesn't provide.""


The commentary written by Altman, Brockman, and other OpenAI executives in the blog post says that as Musk — who at the time sat on OpenAI's board — and the rest of the leaders of the company discussed the best financial path forward, it became clear in late 2017 among all involved parties that a for-profit structure was the only way to ensure the company could ensure sufficient funding for its pursuit of the development of artificial general intelligence.""Elon wanted majority equity, initial board control, and to be CEO. In the middle of these discussions, he withheld funding. Reid Hoffman bridged the gap to cover salaries and operations,"" the post reads. ""We couldn't agree to terms on a for-profit with Elon because we felt it was against the mission for any individual to have absolute control over OpenAI. He then suggested instead merging OpenAI into Tesla.""The post goes on to highlight a February 2018 email chain, forwarded from Musk to Brockman and OpenAI cofounder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, in which an unnamed third party suggests the most promising path forward for OpenAI is to ""attach to Tesla as its cash cow.""In forwarding the email, Musk writes that the unnamed author of the suggestion was ""exactly right,"" adding: ""Tesla is the only path that could even hope to hold a candle to Google. Even then, the probability of being a counterweight to Google is small. It just isn't zero.""


""Elon soon chose to leave OpenAI, saying that our probability of success was 0, and that he planned to build an AGI competitor within Tesla,"" the blog post reads. ""When he left in late February 2018, he told our team he was supportive of us finding our own path to raising billions of dollars. In December 2018, Elon sent us an email saying 'Even raising several hundred million won't be enough. This needs billions per year immediately or forget it.'""The recent drama between Musk and Altman, et. al. has unfolded just weeks after OpenAI finalized a deal valuing the company at $80 billion.Though he has made public jabs at OpenAI several times since leaving, Musk recently doubled down on his public questioning of the legality and ethics of OpenAI's financial structure, writing in a post on X in mid-February that he was offered shares at ""various points, but it seemed unethical/illegal to accept them"" and in interviews has claimed that OpenAI ""wouldn't exist without me.""The Tuesday blog post, which says OpenAI intends to move to dismiss all of Musk's claims, ends with assurances that, despite Musk's accusations, OpenAI is ""focused on advancing our mission"" and has ""a long way to go.""


""As we continue to make our tools better and better, we are excited to deploy these systems so they empower every individual.""Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company, has a global deal to allow OpenAI to train its models on its media brands' reporting.

      Key Takeaways    



        MrBeast is shifting his YouTube style from fast-paced and high-energy to slower storytelling.
      


        He credits this new approach for a significant increase in his video views.
      


        This shift may help Donaldson increase his reach and influence to more mature viewers. 
      



















MrBeast via Business Insider
YouTube's biggest star MrBeast.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. MrBeast appears to be ushering in a new, more mature era of YouTube.In his latest post on X, the YouTube megastar said wants to leave frantic, energetic personas in his videos behind.



""This past year I've slowed down our videos, focused on storytelling, let scenes breathe, yelled less, more personality, longer videos, etc. And our views have skyrocketed!"" YouTube's biggest star said in a post on X on March 3.He urged his fellow YouTubers to ""get rid of the ultra fast-paced"" and over-stimulating era of content. ""It doesn't even work,"" he said.It's a wise move, according to experts, and one that could help him rapidly grow his roughly $700 million-a-year empire.The formula for YouTube successMrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, has 242 million subscribers on YouTube, and his numbers are still growing rapidly.In 2024 alone, he's earned 17 million subscribers — significantly more than most creators will ever achieve in their careers.In his videos, Donaldson shreds Lamborghinis, gives away massive amounts of cash, and performs ambitious, over-the-top stunts like recreating the Netflix phenomenon ""Squid Game."" He's also become famous for his charity work, planting millions of trees, building wells, and paying for people to have cataract surgery.


But while Donaldson built much of his brand riding the wave of colorful videos full of lively, dynamic characters that served YouTubers so well in the early days, he's experimented with being a bit more composed in recent videos.This past year i've slowed down our videos, focused on story telling, let scenes breathe, yelled less, more personality, longer videos, etc. And our views have skyrocketed!My fellow YouTubers lets get rid of the ultra fast paced/overstim era of content. It doesn't even work ? pic.twitter.com/J7IBwHF6Jj— MrBeast (@MrBeast) March 3, 2024In September 2023, for example, he tried adjusting his thumbnails where he had an exhilarated, open-mouthed expression to a grin, and he said ""the watch time went up on every video.""Whatever Donaldson is doing is clearly working, having amassed 13 billion views on his channel since then. However, some viewers have criticized him for backpedaling on what made him popular.


One critic said Donaldson has realized he's the ""Oppenheimer of YouTube and is trying to undo the damage he caused.""Others, however, said they have enjoyed Donaldson's newer content. ""I'm all in for this kind of content,"" one viewer said. ""It's quality over quantity era again.""MrBeast has grown up, and so has his contentIn his latest stunt, ""I Survived 7 Days In An Abandoned City,"" Donaldson and his crew flew to Kupari in the southeast of Dubrovnik, Croatia. After being heavily shelled during the Balkan War in the 1990s, buildings in the area have been abandoned for decades.In 17 minutes, the group explored derelict buildings, set up camp, and documented some fun and eerie moments, such as discovering stray cats, building fires, and hearing glass breaking while they tried to sleep at night.


The video is still packed full of multiple angles and jump cuts but, apart from the introduction, it doesn't have any of the over-the-top shouting many associate with early YouTube.Katya Varbanova, a viral marketing expert, told Business Insider this pivot makes sense because Donaldson is no longer the 13-year-old he was when he started out on YouTube.""Now he's about to turn 26 and he's a whole grown businessman,"" she said. ""So of course he has evolved as a person, and of course, his content will evolve too.""She said she thinks it is Donaldson that is craving this change toward more storytelling and a slower pace, rather than it necessarily being what the majority of his audience wants.


""I think we have to ask ourselves if younger Jimmy who was blowing up with fast-paced content was reading that tweet, would he agree with it and pivot his strategy at this moment in time? I am not sure,"" Varbanova said.""In fact, I am willing to bet he would say 'Who cares about the rules — I am carving my own path.'""Donaldson's decision to slow down his videos seems to be a choice for him and his viewers rather than trying to game YouTube's indeterminable and unpredictable algorithm.In October 2020, Donaldson said he doesn't stress about the length of his videos just to try to appease a metric he can't see. He showed thumbnails of videos of differing lengths, demonstrating that they were all doing well, and urged creators to upload the ""best video"" they possibly could. ""Whatever length that is, upload it,"" he said.


""If a video is a banger, the algorithm will find an audience for it,"" he said, adding that YouTube wouldn't suddenly push out a video because it was ""a minute shorter than what you usually post.""The right content at the right timeBen Steele, a social media marketer at The Big Phone Store who runs the company's TikTok account, told BI that when Donaldson was first starting out, this ""toned-down content would have worked against him.""But now, Donaldson has the benefit of having a strong parasocial relationship with his followers, and a track record of bringing in clicks and engagement. This means whatever he chooses to do, his followers will probably respond positively.Donaldson's new content makes him appear more authentic, which will help him increase his influence even further, Steele said. He's already dominated the younger demographic, and his more mature content will likely be more interesting to millennials and older generations.


""In order to grow further, he needs to appeal to a broader audience, which includes older viewers who would be put off by the loud, obnoxious kind of video that readily goes viral,"" Steele said.Varbanova said the best way to thrive as a creator is to be a good storyteller, educator, or entertainer, and find what works, rather than trying to emulate what made someone else successful. This is a ""recipe for failure,"" she said.""The easiest way to struggle as a creator is to try what everyone else is doing without questioning whether it's right for you or not,"" she said. ""I would caution any content creator to not blindly listen to advice from someone who's 1,000 steps ahead of them.""The best creators think long-term, Varbanova said, and make content that's ""sustainable, not trendy.""""Or be the one that sets the trends,"" she said.

Sergey Brin played a key role in the development of Google's Gemini AI model.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. The Google co-founder Sergey Brin has weighed in on the company's Gemini drama.Speaking at San Francisco's AGI House over the weekend, Brin said the company had ""definitely messed up on the image generation."" He added that the historically inaccurate images generated by Gemini were likely due to a lack of thorough testing.



Google paused Gemini's image-generating feature last month after users complained it was creating strange images of people of color, including pictures depicting Black Nazis. Google's AI model also faced criticism of some of its written responses.Brin, who stepped back from Google in 2019, was listed in a December white paper outlining Gemini's capabilities as a ""core contributor.""Reports have described Brin and his fellow cofounder Larry Page as being more active at the company since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022.In January 2023, The New York Times first reported that Google's parent company, Alphabet, asked the cofounders for help after issuing a ""code red"" in response to OpenAI's viral chatbot.Since then, Brin has been spotted at Google's Silicon Valley headquarters and been directly involved with developing the company's AI strategy.Brin told the audience at AGI House that he ""kind of came out of retirement just because the trajectory of AI is so exciting.""Google's been feeling the heat in the wake of the Gemini controversy.Some critics have portrayed the drama as evidence that left-leaning bias among Big Tech employees has affected major AI models' output.Elon Musk has been especially vocal, frequently pointing to an example where the bot appeared unable to say whether he or Adolf Hitler was worse. When Business Insider tested the same prompt, Gemini said it was ""inaccurate and grossly inappropriate"" to compare Musk with Hitler.Brin appeared to push back on some of the criticism around the text-based model. He told the audience that any text model available, including ChatGPT or Musk's Grok, would be likely to say some ""pretty weird things"" that ""definitely feel far-left, for example,"" if put under pressure.


Brin added that Google hasn't fully understood why Gemini leans left in some cases and said that wasn't the company's intention.Representatives for Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider made outside normal working hours.On February 28, Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company, joined 31 other media groups and filed a $2.3 billion suit against Google in Dutch court, alleging losses suffered due to the company's advertising practices.Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company, has a global deal to allow OpenAI to train its models on its media brands' reporting.

18,A Skin Cancer Scare Led Lois Robbins on an Entrepreneurial Journey. Here Are Her 3 Best Success Tips.,"Feb 26, 2024",Robert Tuchman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/a-skin-cancer-scare-led-lois-robbins-to-entrepreneurship/470192,"
Last week on How Success Happens, I spoke with accomplished actor, producer and entrepreneur Lois Robbins to discuss her UPF 50+ protective clothing brand, Watskin. The company has grown exponentially since its launch last year, and I wanted to sit down with Robbins to find out how it all happened.You can listen to our entire conversation above, and I've pulled out three keytakeaways.Answers have been edited and condensed for clarity.



1. Necessity is the mother of invention""I never thought of myself as an entrepreneur, but they say necessity is the mother of invention,"" Robbins says. ""About five or six years ago, I had a squamous cell on my face, and my dermatologist told me I had to have Mohs surgery, so you can imagine as an actor how terrifying that was. He told me, 'You must stay out of the sun.' I spend a lot of time outdoors. I love exercising outside, being on the water and hiking. One night, I bolted up in bed and thought, I'm gonna make myself a catsuit with a matching skirt. I went downtown, found this great fabric store and bought about six different patterns that I thought were fun. I called a friend of mine who was a tailor and asked her to make me a catsuit. She made me five or six outfits, and I started wearing them everywhere. I was stopped on the street countless times and told [by people] that they'd never seen anything like this and that I had to make these pieces for others. The rest was history. When you have a real need for something, a business is born.""Timestamp — 11:15Related: This Fashion Founder's Company Will Take Back Any Piece of Clothing at Any Time for Any Reason. Here's Why.2. Use passion and persistence as your guide""Two summers ago, we had an unbelievable launch party where we sold a ton of our first collection out east. Then, there was a period of slowness — it was the end of summer when we launched,"" Robbins says. ""I thought back then, this was maybe not the most timely thing to do. But that's where the persistence comes in, and that's where the belief in myself and what I had created had to take hold. It was a nail-biter, but we've been moving forward ever since with even greater success than I even imagined. I don't want to jinx myself, but I think that those days of worry are over. We've learned so much about what works, what doesn't work, what our customer wants and what they don't want. We've created new styles for four collections now, and the brand keeps growing. I have the Shopify app on my phone. The sale buzzer goes off many times a day, but I get excited each time. As an actress, I've always had to be persistent and creative in my approach; it's really helped me with the business. I just keep coming up with more ideas, and we just keep moving forward, and that's how we've grown.""Timestamp — 26:05Related: Kim Kardashian's Skims Is Making Underwear for Men — But the $4 Billion Brand Could Soon Announce Even Bigger News


3. Never accept ""no""""When thinking about all that came into the creation of Watskin, what stands out is how I told myself, I'm gonna do this, and I just didn't accept the nos,"" Robbins says. ""I'm somebody who will forge straight ahead and say yes to life, and this has been a key to my success. Whether it was to prove anyone wrong or to prove to myself that I could fulfill a dream from start to finish, I have always had a sense of internal tenacity guiding my decision-making. When I was a theater major in college, I started doing summer stock. I was cast on daytime television, and maybe it was the naivety about me, but I have such distinct memories of walking into the room and thinking, Well, why wouldn't they hire me? I just believed I was good, and I had enough confidence to carry me through. Looking back, I wish I had even more confidence at the time, but I wasn't afraid of the word no, and that is the key.""Timestamps — 6:26, 17:59Related: Jeans Made Out of…What?

20,This 'Branding Whisperer' Wants to Reignite the X Games to Its Past Glory,"Feb 21, 2024",Jonathan Small,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/brand-expert-shaun-neff-joins-x-games-ownership-group/470015,"
Shaun Neff owes his entire entrepreneurial career to the action sports industry. As a freshman in college, he emblazoned his last name on T-shirts and beanies and watched elite athletes at the X Games proudly boast his logo as they flipped above ramps.""It was always such a huge moment for them as well as a big opportunity to grow my business,"" he says.Now, Neff is taking his X Games pedigree to the next level, joining the brand's ownership group as an investor and advisor.



""It is a really exciting business opportunity because X Games already has such awareness and cache with unrealized opportunity. The potential for growth and expansion is massive,"" he says.Related: Meet the Mastermind Behind Kendall Jenner's, Shay Mitchell's and Millie Bobby Brown's Brands X-ccelerating the X GamesDubbed the ""branding whisperer,"" Neff has a history of helping supercharge brands, including Sony Electronics, Target, and Walmart. He plans to take his marketing acumen to the iconic X Games, merging the sports with music, style and culture.Here are some big game-changers you can expect in the coming year.


A new scheduleThe X Games has always occurred during the summer or winter, but Neff says the brand will disrupt this familiar cadence, adding more event qualifiers and pop-ups to the schedule.""We are making shifts to become a year-round brand that will show up for our athletes and our fans for more than just summer and winter games,"" he says.More fansNeff believes that the X Games, founded in 1994, has lost some relevance. He wants to bring it back to the forefront of pop culture by returning to what made it so unique.""This isn't about building a brand; the brand is already massive,"" he says. ""It is about rebuilding the brand really intentionally, reconnecting with its youth and counterculture roots, and ultimately transcending sports into broader pop culture.""


Expect more music to rock the stands, starting at the X Games Ventura in California from June 28-30.Says Neff, ""We have some tricks up our sleeve to bring together our events and the biggest acts in the world in a unique format.Related: ESPN, Fox, and Warner Bros Are Launching a New Sports Streaming Service. It Could Change TV Forever.A new councilTo maintain the authenticity of the sport, X Games is introducing an athlete council led by TV host Selema Masekela, who previously hosted X Games for 13 years. The council is there to support the superstars but also help launch some of the up-and-comers into the stars of tomorrow.


""It's making sure that we are listening to the athletes primarily and how we are driving and shaping the events, building new events, how we present them — without them, we don't really have anything. I think it's leveraging our star power,"" Masekela told The Aspen Times.Fashion-forwardAs Neff discovered early on with his Neff gear, X Games is more than just a sport — it's a style. The brand wants to incorporate more creativity and self-expression into the action.A taste of this could be seen at X Games Aspen last summer, such as Japanese snowboarder Cocomo Murase's vintage-style sherpa pilot jacket, but expect more in all the events and across social media.""We're putting more emphasis on creativity, style and self-expression, which are at the heart of action sports and our brand,"" Neff says. ""We think it is a better experience for fans, something the athletes want, and frankly, something that makes us different from other sporting events out there.""


""Spin it to win it""Although some purists may argue that all the X Games extracurricular activities might take the focus away from the sport, Neff disagrees. It's all about progression, he says. You've got to ""spin it to win it.""Neff says the changes won't affect what X Games is at its core. """"We're just opening the gates so long-time fans get more of what they love, and new fans get to experience these sports for the first time in a way that isn't daunting or exclusive.""Related: Beanies, Tees and Steez: How Shaun Neff Built a $100 Million Business Out of His Backpack

Ready or not, Bridgit Mendler is setting out to disrupt the space industry.On Monday, the former Disney TV star and pop singer announced that she has co-founded Northwood Space, a startup that aims to quickly and reliably bring satellite data from space back down to Earth.""The vision is a data highway between Earth and space,"" Mendler told CNBC.According to Northwood Space's website, the company is creating infrastructure to ""accelerate mass adoption of satellite technology.""Bridgit Mendler. Mike Coppola | Getty Images for Save The Children



Mendler, who is serving as Northwood's CEO, says that collecting data from space is getting easier along so many different dimensions but that the actual exercise of sending data to and from space is difficult.""You have difficulty finding an access point for contacting your satellite,"" she told the outlet.RELATED: Elon Musk Is Moving SpaceX's Incorporation to Texas — Here's WhyNorthwood is tackling this problem by turning towards ground stations, which are the antennas that receive data from satellites, and striving to mass-produce them. The company wants to build ground stations quickly, in days, not months, so that space companies don't have to build their own or wait for over a year to get the antenna installed and built out.


Just like companies rent server space from Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure to avoid the high price tag associated with building their own servers, businesses would turn to Northwood to get data from space without owning or building their own ground stations.""For me, why the ground-side matters is because it actually is about bringing the impacts of space home to people,"" Mendler said to CNBC.Related: Every Company Has the Potential to Enter the Space Economy. Here's How.Mendler initially rose to fame as a singer — her song ""Ready or Not,"" which samples The Fugees' 1996 classic, has 225 million views on YouTube to date — and with starring roles on Disney Channel shows such as ""Good Luck, Charlie"" from 2010 to 2014 and ""Wizards of Waverly Place"" from 2009 to 2012.


Post-Disney career, she earned a Bachelor's degree from the University of Southern California in 2016 and a Master's degree from MIT in 2020. From 2020 to 2024, she was working towards a Ph.D. from MIT and a JD from Harvard Law School, per her LinkedIn.Mendler co-founded Northwood Space with her husband, Griffin Cleverly, who works as the chief technology officer, and Shaurya Luthra, the head of software. The team has already raised $6.3 million in seed funding from venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Founders Fund and plans a first test of its technology later this year.

Adam Neumann and Steve Jobs.


This story originally appeared on Business Insider. WeWork cofounder Adam Neumann is exploring an offer to buy the now-bankrupt company, The New York Times' DealBook first reported.DealBook published a letter sent to WeWork's lawyers by Alex Spiro, an attorney who has also represented Elon Musk.The letter says Neumann's new real-estate company, Flow Global, is partnering with capital providers including Dan Loeb's Third Point.Neumann has met with WeWork several times since December to discuss buying it or its assets or providing it with financing, per the letter.The letter says that includes a formal proposal for a $200 million debtor-in-possession agreement.It also accuses WeWork of failing to properly engage with Neumann's attempts to buy back the company by not providing requested information.WeWork, once valued at $47 billion, filed for bankruptcy last November. Its downfall began when preparing for its initial public offering in 2019, and Neumann stepped down as CEO, with his eccentric management style having came under fire.The possibility of him coming back on board bears similarity to Steve Jobs' revival at the helm of Apple.Jobs resigned in 1985 to start another company, NeXT, which was in turn bought by Apple 11 years later for $429 million.He then joined then-Apple CEO Gil Amelio on stage at January 1997's Macworld Expo as a keynote speaker. Jobs formally returned as CEO in September of that year after Amelio's ouster, leading the company through innovations like the creation of the iPhone, before stepping down in January 2011, 10 months before his death.In a statement shared with Business Insider, a WeWork spokesperson said: ""WeWork is an extraordinary company. As such, we receive expressions of interest from external parties on a regular basis. We and our advisors always review those approaches with a view to acting in the best interests of the company.""""We continue to believe that the work we are currently doing — addressing our unsustainable rent expenses and restructuring our business — will ensure WeWork is best positioned as an independent, valuable, financially strong and sustainable company long into the future,"" they added.

Elon Musk told investors that Tesla's next-generation EV is set to enter production in 2025.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider.Elon Musk warned Tesla workers to prepare for a challenging production ramp-up as he previewed plans to build a mass-market vehicle.The Tesla CEO said on the company's Wednesday earnings call that building Tesla's next-generation EV, set to enter production in 2025, will require Tesla workers to live and sleep on the manufacturing line at the company's Texas factory.



""We really need the engineers to be living on the line. This is not sort of an off-the-shelf 'it-just-works' type of thing,"" Musk told investors.""That will be a challenging production ramp,"" Musk said. ""We'll be sleeping on the line, practically. Not practically, we will be.""It wouldn't be the first time Tesla workers have reportedly had to sleep on manufacturing lines to meet the company's production deadlines.A former worker at Tesla's factory in Fremont, California, told The Verge that employees would sleep on the factory floor after 12-hour shifts. Musk has said he slept beneath his desk while spending ""three years straight"" basically living in Tesla's manufacturing facilities.Musk said that Tesla's next-generation vehicle, which Reuters reported is a mass-market, affordable EV codenamed ""Redwood,"" is set to enter production in the second half of 2025 at the company's Texas Gigafactory — though he admitted that he is often optimistic with timing, and could not yet predict how many of the vehicles Tesla would initially produce.Tesla workers could face a heightened form of what Musk previously dubbed ""production hell"" during Tesla's 2017 Model 3 ramp-up.""There's a lot of new technology, a tremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology here,"" Musk said.""I am confident that once it gets going, it will be head and shoulders above any other manufacturing technology that exists anywhere in the world. It's next level,"" he added.The billionaire has hinted for years that Tesla plans to release a cheaper EV expected to cost below $30,000.It comes as the company is under increasing pressure from Chinese EV manufacturers prioritizing more affordable vehicles, with the Chinese EV manufacturer BYD recently overtaking the U.S. automaker as the world's largest producer of electric vehicles. But BYD does not yet sell its cars in the U.S.

      Key Takeaways    



        Jeff Bezos is not far off overtaking Elon Musk to become the world's richest person once more.
      


        The Amazon founder is only $8 billion behind the Tesla CEO's $205 billion fortune, per Bloomberg.
      


        Mark Zuckerberg and Warren Buffett have also jumped up the wealth rankings this year.

Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Jeff Bezos is only about $8 billion away from overtaking Elon Musk as the world's wealthiest person following a surge in Amazon stock — and a slump for Tesla — this year.Amazon's founder and executive chairman has enjoyed a $20 billion rise in his estimated wealth this year, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That primarily reflects a 13% rise in Amazon stock this year, which has propelled him into second place on the rich list with a net worth of $197 billion.



In contrast, Musk's fortune has tumbled by $24 billion to $205 billion, largely due to a 24% plunge in Tesla's stock.Bloomberg's estimate still includes the value of about 304 million stock options from Musk's 2018 compensation plan, which was recently voided by a Delaware court.


The upshot is that Bezos is now just 4% behind Elon Musk in net worth, and could soon leapfrog him if Amazon keeps rising or Tesla continues to fall.Bezos owned 988 million shares, or nearly 10% of Amazon, at the end of December — a stake worth $169 billion at Friday's close.Meanwhile, Musk holds about 411 million Tesla shares, or a roughly 13% stake in the automaker, worth about $76 billion. His stakes in SpaceX, Twitter, and other businesses make up the rest of his fortune.It's worth noting that Bezos plans to sell up to 50 million Amazon shares, valued at $8.6 billion, by the end of January next year, his company's annual report revealed last week. He adopted the trading plan in November.


Bezos was top of the Bloomberg index from 2017 until January 2021 when a rise in Tesla stock put Musk almost $10 billion ahead at $194.9 billion.The release of Big Tech earnings in recent days has helped reshuffle Bloomberg's rich list this year. Meta stock soared 20% on Friday after an earnings blowout, boosting founder Mark Zuckerberg's fortune by $28 billion to $170 billion, and bolstering his wealth gain for this year to an unmatched $42 billion.Buffett beats 'Google guys'Meanwhile, Warren Buffett has climbed into seventh place above Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison and the ""Google Guys"" Larry Page and Sergey Brin.Ellison's net worth has been hit by the decline in value of his Tesla stake, while a 6% post-earnings drop in Alphabet stock last week trimmed the value of Page and Brin's holdings.


On the other hand, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway stock is up about 9% this year as the economic outlook brightens. The investor's wealth swelled by an estimated $10 billion in the first five weeks of this year, while Ellisson's fortune only grew by about $7 billion, and Page and Brin gained around $2 billion each.It's certainly striking that Musk's net worth has crashed from about $340 billion at its peak in late 2021 to about $200 billion today. However, Tesla stock is still up more than six-fold since the start of 2020, while Amazon shares have less than doubled.

26,Meta Warns Investors That Mark Zuckerberg's Love of Extreme Sports Could Kill Him,"Feb 2, 2024",Peter Kafka,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/investors-warned-of-mark-zuckerbergs-love-of-extreme-sports/469224,"
This article originally appeared on Business Insider. After a rough couple of years, Meta is flying: Revenue is growing again, profits are way up after some painful belt-tightening, and its stock is at a record high.What could possibly go wrong?Well, maybe Mark Zuckerberg, its CEO, could get hurt, or worse, in a cage match?That's what Meta is suggesting in a new Securities and Exchange Commission filing out this week. In the company's newest annual report, it told investors that Zuckerberg routinely did risky stuff for fun — and that it would be a real problem for the company if he got injured doing that.



From Meta's 10-K, filed under ""risk factors"":We currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg. Mr. Zuckerberg and certain other members of management participate in various high-risk activities, such as combat sports, extreme sports, and recreational aviation, which carry the risk of serious injury and death.Meta is presumably referring to Zuckerberg's well-documented embrace of all kinds of brotastic fun, including mixed martial arts, hydrofoiling, and CrossFit. He has also been training to get his pilot license, The Information reported.And he has gotten banged up along the way: Last year, he tore his ACL in a training fight.


Zuckerberg certainly isn't the only tech mogul who likes this stuff. His rival Elon Musk, for instance, flies himself around all the time, and he famously challenged Zuckerberg to a cage match (which some people insisted was going to be a real thing but never panned out).But he may be the only Big Tech CEO who's spelled that out as a problem for investors.Musk's Tesla, for instance, simply points out that the company is ""highly dependent"" on his services and doesn't mention the prospect of him crashing one of his Gulfstreams. (It does, however, say that Musk ""does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla"" because he's also running SpaceX, X, and other ventures.)Peers such as Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon either say that their CEOs are important or don't even mention them.Meta reps did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Zuckerberg basically did, by responding to a post about the 10-K filing on Threads:  Post by @zuckView on ThreadsIt's worth pointing out that while the ""risk factor"" section of any public company can be useful to scan, since it lays out all kinds of problems that could arise, it usually is not the kind of thing most investors care about. The point is to insulate the company from liability in case something does go wrong: ""See? We told you this could happen. Now tell your lawyers to stop bothering us.""So while Meta does take Zuckerberg's well-being very seriously — in 2022, it spent $15 million on personal security for him and his family — it's unlikely it thinks he's going to get really, really hurt. But they're letting us it could happen, just in case.

Taylor Swift's business era is continuing with another move that could mean a lot more sales.The superstar's Nashville-based LLC TAS Rights Management filed to trademark the term ""TAYLOR-CON"" with the U.S. Patent Office on Tuesday, per the New York Post.Buda Mendes/TAS23 | Getty ImagesRelated: Taylor Swift Is TIME's Person of the Year, a Billionaire and Boon to the Economy — Here Are the Brands She's Given a Major BoostSwift's prior ""Midnights"" trademark preceded an eponymous album release, leading to speculation that ""TAYLOR-CON"" may be the title of an upcoming project, per the outlet.



The trademark would apply to a wide range of products, including musical instruments, candles, kitchenware, jewelry, towels, hair accessories, clothing and more, according to the filing.What's more, the application's request for use of the trademark in ""arranging, organizing, conducting and hosting social entertainment events"" sparked comparisons to other ""convention events"" — like ComicCon for comic book aficionados — with some fans hoping for a multi-day Swift event of their own.""So how many taylor-cons are we talkin like is there a con per coast?""

The current online store selling official Taylor Swift merchandise is managed by Swift's record label Universal Music Group and has faced a barrage of criticism over service and quality issues.

        The business partners use a leadership approach honed over years on the set of 'Breaking Bad.' 
      












""I saw a clear opening with mezcal,"" Aaron Paul, co-founder of Dos Hombres Mezcal with fellow actor Bryan Cranston, says. ""You ask anyone on the side of the road, 'Name your favorite mezcal,' [and] they're like, 'Oh, mezcal is…' But they can name a vodka, a tequila.""Cranston and Paul, who played Walter White and Jesse Pinkman on AMC's award-winning crime drama series Breaking Bad, became fast friends on set. So, when Paul suggested the duo start a mezcal brand of their own several years after the show wrapped, Cranston was all in.Image Credit: Paul Quitoriano for Dos Hombres Mezcal 



Dos Hombres, which means ""two men"" in Spanish, launched in 2019. The mezcal is crafted by third-generation maestro mezcalero Gregorio Velasco, who uses traditional production methods to blend Espadin agave hand-picked from the hillsides of the small village of San Luis del Rio in Oaxaca, Mexico. It boasts notes of apples, mango, local ""zapote"" fruits, wood and an ""almost imperceptible"" smoke on the finish.Constellation Brands announced a minority stake in Dos Hombres in 2021 through its venture capital group, though the company remains independently owned and continues to manage, market and produce its mezcal.

They're determined to make Dos Hombres the No. 1 mezcal, they say, and that means doing things a bit differently than some of the many other celebrity spirits brands.""Celebrities have an opportunity,"" Cranston says. ""They have the door open. You want to come in? It's up to you. And a lot of celebrities will come in — and then go away. You want me to go and work…?""""Wait, you're not just going to write me…a check?"" Paul quips.Related: How to Be Your Own Boss and Drink on the Job


Cranston notes that ""there are far more celebrity brands that have failed than have succeeded."" But, like their on-screen characters, the pair isn't afraid to get in the trenches and do what needs to be done. Until about six months ago, the co-founders ""were on emails constantly,"" and Paul ran the company's social media accounts.""I think actors, especially, we're used to stepping into something we don't know,"" Cranston says. ""Every time we take a job, 'I think it could be this, but I'm not sure.' I'm playing a podiatrist — 'Oh, I gotta go learn all about the feet.' So we're not daunted about stepping into something we don't know. We're like a dry sponge. So we go down to Oaxaca once a year and talk to our people.""Image Credit: Paul Quitoriano for Dos Hombres Mezcal ""We break bread with them. We talk to them, and we learn.""Dos Hombres has 50 employees in Mexico and 22 in the U.S., and Paul and Cranston have personally interviewed each person who was hired onto the team. They want to make sure that everyone understands the culture they've built: ""We work hard here, and then we go home,"" Cranston says. ""That's the greatest thing. Work hard, go home.""Paul and Cranston are ""very proud"" of the team members they've brought together — and seize every opportunity to learn from them.""We break bread with them,"" Cranston says. ""We talk to them, and we learn. Every time we're down there, it's like, 'Oh wait a minute, that's a new thing. Why are you doing this? Oh right. What happened there?' And then [we] learn about the mashing, the smoking, fermentation, the distillation, bottling.""Related: Comedy Legend Dan Aykroyd Doesn't Mess Around When It Comes to Vodka


Paul and Cranston's hands-on leadership approach to building their ideal company, team and culture is a straightforward but perhaps underrated one these days. And it carries over from their years on the set of Breaking Bad. Paul, who was 28 when the show debuted, says that Cranston taught him that ""when you're No. 1 on the call sheet, you set the tone.""""[Cranston is] the hardest worker in the room but also the most immature person you've ever met,"" Paul says. ""And I say that with love and respect because he does the job perfectly, but he has the best time doing it. He loves to pull pranks; [he] jokes.""Cranston says there were a couple of hundred people on set that they felt responsible for, and to help establish the kind of close-knit culture they envisioned, they started a bowling night with not just the crew but the crew's family, too. ""We'd take over the entire bowling alley and just play,"" he recalls.Image Credit: Paul Quitoriano for Dos Hombres Mezcal 


""Down in Mexico, they say, 'You kiss the spirit.'""The co-founders might not have anticipated going into business together during their early days on set. Cranston admits he had no idea Paul had such a ""business mind,"" though he was quickly impressed by his co-star's boundless ""energy"" and strong work ethic — and adds that ""he's not at all like Jesse Pinkman.""Needless to say, the real-life friends have a more functional business partnership than Jesse and Walt ever did. They also have a lot of fun with it: Just don't ask them to take any shots of mezcal if you run into them at the bar.""We go out a lot to all the bars and restaurants, and most of the younger kids go, 'Ah, let's do shots,'"" Cranston explains.""It's sacrilegious to do a shot of mezcal,"" Paul says. ""Down in Mexico, they say, 'You kiss the spirit.'""

      Key Takeaways    



        Elon Musk just had his $55.8 billion Tesla pay package voided in a Delaware court ruling.
      


        The decision, which Tesla can still appeal, goes beyond just damaging Musk's personal gain.
      


        Musk's ambitions for Tesla and SpaceX were on the line, as was his confidence in the Diamond State.

The decision to void Elon Musk's pay package may have far-reaching consequences.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Elon Musk might be done with Delaware.The Diamond State, which supposedly gained its moniker from Thomas Jefferson, has proven to be a very hospitable, low-tax home for thousands of corporations including Tesla.



But Musk will have found that famed hospitality to be missing this week after a Delaware judge voided his $55.8 billion compensation package that was granted by the Tesla board in 2018.The lawsuit, led by Richard Tornetta — an investor who held just nine Tesla shares — has now nullified the payout that helped Musk become the world's richest person.


""The process leading to the approval of Musk's compensation plan was deeply flawed,"" Judge Kathaleen McCormick said in a 201-page opinion, which stated that Tesla's nine-person board at the time of the grant's approval was lacking any truly independent directors.Musk's Tesla pay was structured without a salary to involve 12 stock option awards that would only be given once performance goals for each of them were met. Musk has met the goals for the awards but can only sell them after a certain period.Though Musk can appeal the decision, there are signs that this battle is about more than just the massive pay package that has propelled him to a $205 billion fortune.Musk's ambitions are on the lineMusk's plans for SpaceX are somewhat tied to his ability to raise enormous personal wealth through Tesla. Chandan Khanna/Getty ImagesAs much as the Delaware court's decision is a hit to Musk's personal gain, it also risks being a hit to his ambitions with Tesla and SpaceX.In Tesla's case, a failed appeal would mean Musk loses options on roughly 303 million Tesla shares, leaving him with just a 13% stake in the EV maker.Is that enough? Apparently not.


Musk argued earlier this month that he needs 25% ownership of the company to give him the voting control needed to see through decision-making on key areas of innovation such as AI and robotics.""Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla. You don't seem to understand that Tesla is not one startup, but a dozen. Simply look at the delta between what Tesla does and GM,"" he wrote on X.I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can't be overturned.Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla. You don't seem to understand…— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 15, 2024In other words, failure to gain more control poses a possibility that Musk's focus could end up away from Tesla as he pursues AI and robotics ventures elsewhere.


It's a prospect that may give Tesla backers some pause. The carmaker is currently worth $600 billion, up from roughly $50 billion in 2018, when Musk received his pay plan. By comparison, Toyota, the second most valuable carmaker, is worth less than half of Tesla's value today.Musk also claimed during the trial around his pay in November 2022 that his pay package would help finance his ambitions to create a multiplanetary species with SpaceX. ""It's a way to get humanity to Mars,"" he said.As Judge McCormick noted in her opinion on Tuesday, ""colonizing Mars is an expensive endeavor."" So it's reasonable to take Musk at face value when he says his Tesla pay, as McCormick put it, is a ""means of bankrolling that mission.""

Charlie Munger (right) and Warren Buffett.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. The late Charlie Munger grew Daily Journal's stock portfolio from nothing to $300 million within 15 years. The newspaper publisher just filed its final portfolio update from the legendary investor's time in charge, and it underlines Munger's exceptional patience, discipline, and conviction.Munger, best known as Warren Buffett's right-hand man and Berkshire Hathaway's vice chairman, died aged 99 on November 28. He chaired Daily Journal's board for about 45 years from 1977 to 2022. When markets crashed during the 2008 financial crisis, he made the call to plow some of the company's money into stocks and started managing its investments.



Daily Journal's first portfolio filing dates back to the fourth quarter of 2013, likely because that's when the value of its holdings breached the $100 million reporting threshold. The publisher and legal-software provider disclosed 2.3 million shares of Bank of America, almost 1.6 million shares of Wells Fargo, 140,000 shares of US Bancorp, and 64,600 shares of South Korean steelmaker Posco.Remarkably, Daily Journal held the exact same amount of Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and US Bancorp shares a decade later, on December 30 last year. While it slashed its Posco position to 9,745 shares in the fourth quarter of 2014, it didn't touch it again until the fourth quarter of 2022, when it exited the holding.


Munger made only one other big change to Daily Journal's portfolio. He bet on Alibaba at the start of 2021, quadrupled his wager by the end of the year, then halved it the next quarter after souring on the Chinese e-commerce titan and deciding he'd made a mistake.It's worth noting that Munger's hands-off approach wasn't a winner across the board. The value of Daily Journal's Wells Fargo and US Bancorp positions rose by less than 10% in a decade, while the S&P 500 surged by over 150% in the same timeframe. The company's Bank of America stake did better, rising by almost 120% in that period.Munger's record appears to have been saved by an early bet on Chinese EV maker BYD. The wager likely made up the lion's share of Daily Journal's $138 million in unrealized gains on September 30, and allowed it to realize a 15-fold return on a $3.3 million wager in late 2021.Even so, Daily Journal's filings underscore Munger's commitment to making concentrated bets, buying for the long term and only at a compelling price, rarely selling, and resisting the urge to fiddle or panic. He barely touched its handful of US holdings for at least a decade, adding just one name, exiting another, and leaving three of its positions fully intact.

The event brought together entrepreneurs, mentors, and mentees to help foster business connections and listen to Branson dole out his ever-coveted advice.During the gathering, Branson said that when he embarks on a new endeavor or business with Virgin, he thinks less about how much it will cost the company and more about whether or not the idea is strong enough to separate itself from competitors.



Richard Branson speaks at the re-launch of RM72 at Virgin Hotels Dallas (Entrepreneur)""My attitude is 'Screw it, let's do it'. Let's see if we can create something better than anybody else has done it and the figures should stack up at the end of the year — that's been my approach,"" he said at the event. ""And sometimes we've fallen flat on our face, but we've always, I think, created something special. So even where things haven't worked out, we have left our hopefully happy memories and what our team tried. And fortunately, more worked out than not.""


Branson, who founded Virgin Records in 1972, has since gone on to pursue multiple other endeavors under the Virgin Umbrella, including Virgin Hotels, Virgin Galactic, Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Voyages, and more.Related: Richard Branson: Elon Musk Surprised Me Barefoot In My HomeBranson said that the importance of branding and wanting to use that branding to be the best in any given space or industry has been one of what he believes is any entrepreneur's key to success — regardless of budget and regardless of industry.""What matters is can you create the best? The best hotel? Can you create the best cruise line? Can you create the best airline? Can you create the best train company? Can you create the sexiest space company, and so on,"" he said. ""If you can, if you create something really, really special, generally speaking, as long as you haven't completely f****d up, the figures will add up in the end. And so, at Virgin, I think our teams have created the best in every field.""

      Key Takeaways    



        Amazon cofounder Jeff Bezos has a specific method for running the ""perfect meeting.""
      


        The billionaire said he prefers to have ""messy,"" wandering meetings at work.
      


        But he prefers ""crisp"" memos over slideshows for meeting presentations.

Jeff Bezos wants to find the truth in his meetings, and he says slideshow presentations aren't the way to go.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Jeff Bezos isn't a fan of using slideshow presentations for meetings.The billionaire has a very specific way he likes his meetings to run, and the ""perfect meeting"" starts with days of prepping. Bezos spoke with podcaster Lex Fridman about his preference for crystal-clear memos and long, wandering meetings.



""I like a crisp document and a messy meeting,"" Bezos said.New employees at Amazon and his rocket company Blue Origin can expect ""the weirdest meeting culture you ever encounter,"" according to Bezos. They begin with attendees silently studying a six-page memo for 30 minutes followed by a discussion.


 Unlike PowerPoints, which Bezos says are easy to create but hard for the audience to get a full understanding, memos require much more time and effort from the author.This means an employee might spend weeks putting together a six-page memo for a meeting. But, it ""has a kind of beauty to it,"" if done right, Bezos said.The process allows meeting participants to ask more productive questions and seek the truth instead of ""hiding a lot of sloppy thinking in bullet points.""In his efforts to encourage more truth-seeking at work, Bezos recommends people do away with compromise. Instead, they should ""try to get to as close to truth as possible.""""We have in our society and inside companies, a bunch of mechanisms we use to resolve these kinds of disputes,"" Bezos said in the podcast. ""A lot of them are, I think, really bad. An example of a really bad way of coming to an agreement is compromise.""Bezos has also implemented a ""two pizza rule"" into his past work meetings. If two pizzas isn't enough to feed the whole group, there are too many people in the meeting. The rule is meant to increase productivity and help avoid groupthink.


The tech billionaire was succeeded by Andy Jassy as the CEO of e-commerce giant Amazon in 2021. While at the helm, Bezos had a ""Day 1"" philosophy that encouraged employees to operate with the same speed and risk-acceptance they'd have at a budding startup.Today, Bezos is Amazon's chairman of the board and uses some of the free time he's gained from not being CEO to get more involved in Blue Origin.

Most Tesla model years 2012 through 2023 are impacted and will receive an over-the-air software update that will add additional alerts to keep drivers focused when Autosteer is engaged, according to a letter from the NHTSA.NHTSA's two-year investigation found that ""Tesla's unique design of its Autopilot system can provide inadequate driver engagement and usage controls that can lead to foreseeable misuse of the system.""


The notifications will help drivers keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road. It will perform more routine checks on the drivers' attention level when approaching traffic controls and people can face suspension from Autosteer if the driver fails to demonstrate responsible driving.The updates will begin being implemented on Tuesday.In a statement, an NHTSA spokesperson told Fox Business: ""Automated technology holds great promise for improving safety but only when it is deployed responsibly.""RELATED: Tesla Recalling 362,000 Vehicles Over Full Self-Driving Software Concerns


Tesla has not yet responded to the recall but did respond to a Washington Post story published on Sunday that reported eight Tesla accidents where the Autopilot feature should not have been engaged.

In 2021, she testified before the House and Senate subcommittees about misinformation and social media.In the whistleblower declaration made public on Monday, Donovan claims her studies on media manipulation campaigns were restricted following a $500 million donation from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to fund an artificial intelligence center in 2021.

Amazon has tapped Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch a series of internet satellites for its ambitious Project Kuiper constellation, CNN reported.The deal, confirmed on Friday, is a somewhat unexpected move in the commercial space race since Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has his own aerospace company, Blue Origin — and Musk and Bezos have had a very public 15-plus year rivalry.  Image Credit: Anadolu | Getty Images. Amazon's Project Kuiper launches first internet satellite test mission. Related: Amazon Signs Largest-Ever Commercial Rocket Deal With 3 Firms, Including Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin



SpaceX will execute three Falcon 9 rocket launches to assist Amazon in deploying Project Kuiper constellation, the goal of which is to establish a global network of satellites providing internet access, positioning it as a direct competitor to SpaceX's Starlink, which has over 5,000 satellites already in orbit.This tactical partnership comes amid Amazon's ongoing challenges with its initial launch provider, Blue Origin. The latter's New Glenn rocket has been subject to lengthy delays and is now slated for its inaugural voyage next year at the earliest.New Glenn, which is powered by seven BE-4 engines and can launch more than 13 metric tons to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), is a heavy-lift launch vehicle specifically suited to lift significant mass and volume to low Earth orbit (LEO), according to Blue Origin.To bolster its deployment timeline, Amazon inked deals (valued in the billions) for over 70 launches with other providers, including Blue Origin, United Launch Alliance, and Arianespace, per CNN. Despite these agreements, a shareholders' lawsuit filed by The Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund in August alleged that executives dismissed SpaceX's competitive launch costs in their earlier decisions. 


An Amazon spokesperson rejected the allegations in the lawsuit as ""completely without merit"" and emphasized the new SpaceX deal as an addition to, not a replacement for, the planned launches with other providers.Related: Musk Chirps Bezos About His 'Full-Time Job' Amid Back and Forth Battle With the FCCStill, as the legal and corporate saga unfolds, Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Project Kuiper, expressed confidence in the prototype satellites' performance and the company's plan to commence customer beta testing as early as the end of 2024.""So far, everything that we've tested on ground, we're getting the same results up in space,"" Badyal said.

42,Mark Zuckerberg's Daily Routine: The Schedule of the Meta CEO Who Wears the Same Thing Every Day and Trains with MMA Fighters,"Nov 27, 2023",Sarah Jackson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/mark-zuckerbergs-daily-routine-meta-meetings-mma-money/465946,"
This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Between steering Meta through its ""year of efficiency,"" trying to popularize Threads, and engaging in a will-they-won't-they with Elon Musk on a rumored MMA cage fight, Mark Zuckerberg has a lot on his plate.While the Facebook founder dedicates many hours to work, he still spends time on things like travel, tucking his kids in at night, and even bulking up through his pandemic-era hobby of jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts training.



Zuckerberg also famously saves time and brainpower by nixing nonessential choices from his life, most notably by wearing the same outfit nearly every day.Here's a look at the typical daily routine of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, based on what he's said in prior interviews:


After waking up around 8 a.m., the Meta CEO immediately checks Facebook, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp on his phone before he even puts on his contacts.Zuckerberg checks his phone as he arrives to testify at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas via BIThe social media session typically only lasts a few minutes but can take longer depending on current events, Zuckerberg said in a Facebook Live Q&A.""The first thing I do is look at my phone. I look at Facebook to see what's going on in the world,"" he said in the Q&A. ""It's a pretty sad situation to be honest. I have contacts and I can't see very well. And before I put my contacts in I often look to see what is going on Facebook.""


Zuckerberg admits checking his phone first thing in the morning is a bad habit.""You get like a million messages of stuff that come in, and it's usually not good. People reserve the good stuff to tell me in person,"" he told Joe Rogan last year. ""It's almost like you wake up and you're punched in the stomach, so it's like okay ... now I need to go reset myself and be able to be productive and not be stressed out about this.""Once he's gotten his morning updates, it's time to work out. Zuckerberg used to go for a workout at least three times a week, often running. Now, he stays away from running and instead does jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA).An Instagram video shows Zuckerberg sparring with MMA fighters on a floating barge. Mark Zuckerberg via BI""I used to run a lot, but the problem with running is you can think a lot,"" he told Rogan last year.Instead, he started asking himself: ""What's a thing that's both super engaging physically, but also intellectually, where you can't afford to focus on something else? MMA is the perfect thing because if you stop paying attention for one second, you're going to end up on the bottom.""In June, he said on Lex Fridman's podcast that he does three or four jiu-jitsu and MMA sessions weekly, in addition to strength and conditioning work and mobility training.It's unclear what Zuckerberg eats for breakfast but he recently revealed that as part of his training, he aims for 4,000 calories a day.

""I spend most of my time thinking about how to connect the world and serve our community better, but a lot of that time isn't in our office or meeting with people or doing what you'd call real work,"" he told CNN in 2015.""I take a lot of time just to read and think about things by myself,"" he continued. ""If you count the time I'm in the office, it's probably no more than 50-60 hours a week. But if you count all the time I'm focused on our mission, that's basically my whole life.""Zuckerberg has particular preferences for meetings at work.Charles Platiau/Reuters via BI

Wikipedia founder, Jimmy Wales, has strongly criticized X, formerly known as Twitter, following its recent acquisition by Elon Musk.Speaking to CNBC at the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon, Wales expressed his concern over the social media platform, claiming that it has been ""overrun by trolls and lunatics."" He also highlighted the decline in user engagement on X compared to previous years.Image Credit: Horacio Villalobos | Getty Images. Wikipedia Founder Jimmy Wales.Related: Elon Musk's Twitter 2.0: 'Long Hours, High Intensity' for WorkersWhen asked about the impact of Musk's $44 billion acquisition of Twitter on the social media landscape, Wales stated: ""It's a huge problem.""



Wales said thoughtful and serious users are abandoning the platform due to the increasing presence of trolls and inappropriate content. He emphasized that Twitter has been the default public square for people around the world, but the current state of the platform is detrimental to everyone.Millions of users have left X following Musk's takeover. According to data from market intelligence firm Similarweb, X's global website traffic dipped 14% year over year in September, and U.S. traffic fell by 19% in the same period.This latest statement from Wales adds to the growing conflict between the founder and Musk, which started last year when Musk accused Wikipedia of having ""a non-trivial left-wing bias,"" per CNBC. The dispute arose from a debate among Wikipedia editors about removing the platform's entry on the Twitter Files.These files were cited by Musk as evidence of biased content moderation against conservatives under the prior management of Twitter. Despite the controversy, Wikipedia opted to keep the entry, as the platform relies on a community of volunteers to maintain its content.

44,What Does Entrepreneurial Excellence Mean Today? The Benchmark for Success Is Evolving — Here's How.,"Nov 3, 2023",Milan Kordestani,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/what-does-entrepreneurial-excellence-mean-today-the/459588,"
From Ford to Musk, the image of the successful entrepreneur has often been intertwined with a set of traditional ideals: unyielding confidence, unwavering determination and an unrelenting pursuit of success. Those characteristics of excellence have shaped our perception of what it means to be a successful entrepreneur for generations. They also connect with larger social and political ideas of greatness: winning through domination in some form.However, a generational shift in the definition of excellence is becoming all too apparent as the once-unquestionable benchmarks of success, such as wealth, fame and power, have begun to coexist with qualities that transcend the headlines — qualities like personal growth, empathy and a commitment to lasting values. Additionally, an increasing number of successful female entrepreneurs are also calling into question masculine gatekeeping of definitions of entrepreneurial excellence. Numerous social pressures, along with rapid technological change, are causing many of us to contemplate what it actually means to pursue ""excellence"" or ""greatness"" today.Somewhere on the other side of Elon and Zuckerberg's proposed MMA fight is another view of what being great can be for an entrepreneur. A more encompassing view of excellence may be necessary, one which redefines not only the characteristics of greatness but also the obligations and behaviors of those we deem role models within the world of business. Excellence is no longer solely about conquering frontiers or amassing fortunes; it's about leaving a positive mark on the world, fostering innovation with ethics, and making decisions that resonate through generations. That excellence can be achieved by adding elements of stoicism and empathy to our entrepreneurial mindsets and leadership approaches.



Related: How to Unleash Your Entrepreneurial Spirit and Discover Your PotentialThe biography of excellenceThe historical record provides as many definitions of excellence as it does role models to learn from. Different eras have birthed distinct ideals of greatness, often mirroring the predominant societal norms and values. In the Renaissance, excellence was defined by creativity; in the Enlightenment, it was rationality. Excellence in political leadership was defined in many eras as the ability to win wars and defeat foes. Yet even some of the greatest warriors held up as role models of excellence, such as Leonidas's Spartans at Thermopylae or Saigō Takamori's Samurai at the Battle of Shiroyama, proved their merit through their defeat by holding fast to their values in the face of certain loss. Excellence, it seems, becomes a complex issue when one combines the morality of strong values with societal markers like wealth, fame, power or might.


The realm of entrepreneurialism, especially the tech field, has yielded its own vision of excellence. Innovation, creativity, self-discipline and drive are elevated, and entrepreneurs strive to emulate in the hopes of capturing their magic in a bottle. While their accomplishments are undeniable, the criteria by which we measure excellence are evolving, inviting us to reassess the values that truly define greatness. And while many great entrepreneurs stand out as examples of excellence, none better exemplify the increasingly problematic double-edged sword of entrepreneurial excellence than Elon Musk or Steve Jobs.As Walter Isaacson's biography of Elon Musk hits our shelves, it's an interesting moment to reflect on the nature of excellence as entrepreneurs and beyond — though, for many of us, the question of excellence has long been on our minds. Elon Musk, the visionary entrepreneur behind Tesla and SpaceX, epitomizes the charismatic and audacious archetype of excellence. His boldness and willingness to disrupt industries have yielded transformative results, yet his leadership style is marked by demanding expectations, public spats, and a sometimes controversial presence on social media.Biographer Isaacson — already skilled at getting to the core of powerhouse egos in his earlier works on Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci, Henry Kissinger and Steve Jobs — paints Elon Musk as a complex character, at times relatable and at times almost alien in mindset. Similarly, each of Isaacson's subjects represented ideas of excellence for their times — and beyond — yet each also struggled with a titanic-sized ego and disjointed relationships. Elon seems no different. Excellence, too often, it appears, comes at a steep social price.Many may liken Musk to Steve Jobs, another tech leader held up as an example of entrepreneurial and technological excellence. Jobs, the late co-founder of Apple, responsible for much of the company's product vision and innovation, is celebrated for revolutionizing personal technology. But his inability to relate to others was as legendary as his vision. His ""reality distortion field"" and uncompromising pursuit of perfection yielded groundbreaking products, but his interpersonal relationships and management methods were often called into question. Jobs is an extreme personality and example, but often excellence is equated with such extreme focus and vision.


A kinder approach to excellenceWhile the achievements of Jobs and Musk are undeniable, the emphasis on such figures as entrepreneurial role models perpetuates an image of excellence defined by brashness, bombastic and all-consuming individualism. But as younger generations search for relevant role models of greatness, they seek to redefine how the trait manifests in society. Excellence in this context is not confined to the individual's achievements but also extends to their contributions to the greater good. Leaders who recognize the strength of collaboration, who consider the impact of their decisions on diverse communities, and who work to bridge societal divides exemplify a new facet of excellence.Embracing kindness and empathy in leadership fosters collaboration, creativity and sustainable growth in organizations. A leader prioritizing these qualities can inspire loyalty and dedication among employees, creating a more harmonious and productive work environment. Additionally, exercising restraint and thoughtfulness in decision-making prevents hasty actions that might bring short-term gains but lead to detrimental long-term consequences.The challenge lies in finding a balance between audacity and empathy, innovation and collaboration. While figures like Musk and Jobs have undeniably left their marks on history, it's worth considering whether their methods could have been refined to include a greater emphasis on building positive relationships and nurturing well-being. Even keel business leaders like Tim Cook or Dara Khosrowshahi will likely never be held up as examples of generational-changing technological or entrepreneurial excellence, even though they may be more worthy of the accolade than their more bombastic peers.In his 2010 Commencement Speech at Princeton, Jeff Bezos recounted some wisdom he learned from his grandfather: ""Jeff, one day you'll understand that it's harder to be kind than clever."" Indeed, it is far easier to take the low road, forgetting compassion or patience. Can excellence be achieved without overshadowing qualities like kindness, empathy and restraint? Long before we had the concept of personal brands. Mr. Rogers built a persona around the transformative nature of kindness and empathy. With numerous tall tales of kindness on set coupled with extensive anonymous donations to children's cancer charities, many would consider Keanu Reeves to be a role model of quiet kindness in a Hollywood marked by greed, vanity, and self-promotion. Just as the media industry has managed to elevate some paragons of kindness, so too can the entrepreneurial field embrace those who translate kindness into excellence.


Related: These 3 Philosophies of the Ancient Stoics Will Change Your LifeStoicism over pompAnother approach to the question of greatness requires us to stop and think about, yes, the Roman Empire — just maybe not every day as some men do, according to the consensus of a hilarious new TikTok trend. The reason why I suggest that we consider the Roman Empire in pursuit of greatness is that many Roman Emporers embraced stoicism — a philosophy underlying entrepreneurial excellence. At its core, stoicism advocates for a rational and disciplined approach to life's challenges. It emphasizes the cultivation of inner resilience and the acceptance of circumstances beyond one's control, encouraging a mindset of gratitude rather than negativity.Stoics believe in focusing on what can be influenced while gracefully acknowledging and enduring what cannot. This philosophy encourages entrepreneurs to navigate the often tumultuous waters of business with a composed and clear-headed demeanor. By embracing stoic principles, entrepreneurs gain a powerful tool for maintaining equilibrium in the face of adversity, allowing them to make calculated decisions and pursue their goals with unwavering determination.It is easy to find examples of stoic leadership: those driven by a belief that they can rationally advance their values to improve the world. For example, Former Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel's legacy lies in her adept navigation of complex political terrains while upholding her principles, particularly in her fervent support for a united Europe. Her leadership exemplified the potency of diplomacy, restraint and patient persistence, highlighting that enduring change often stems from steadfast dedication rather than impulsive, headline-grabbing maneuvers.


In the realm of tech entrepreneurship, Steve Wozniak's journey reflects the value of staying grounded even in the face of immense success. His technical prowess and innovation were pivotal in shaping the technological landscape, yet he remained approachable and down-to-earth. Wozniak's commitment to education and his willingness to share his knowledge exemplifies the importance of giving back to the community that helped foster his success. Like Merkel, Wozniak has prioritized collaboration over grabbing headlines, building bridges rather than burning them.And, on a final note, if we ever need to look to the Roman Empire to teach us a lesson about greatness, surely it is this: the political leader held up by many through history as the pinnacle of political excellence was a bold and audacious general and emperor who was such a jerk that his friends and colleagues stabbed him to death. Julius Caesar may argue that a little less ego and a bit more kindness and stoicism are a sounder approach to leadership.Final thoughtsIn examining these contrasting examples, we can distill lessons that guide future leaders and innovators. By appreciating the achievements of ego-driven innovators like Musk and Jobs while critically evaluating the potential consequences of their approaches, we pave the way for a new generation of leaders who aspire to achieve greatness while also cultivating qualities that enrich the human experience. Not only should we seek out role models of excellence driven by compassion and empathy, but we should seek to lead our own organizations with the same stoic and caring attitude, fostering excellence in ourselves and those we lead.Ultimately, excellence should not be narrowly defined by the disruption of industries alone; rather, it should encompass the enhancement of society as a whole, with kindness, empathy and restraint being integral components of that journey. Kindness and stoicism offer new approaches to modern entrepreneurial excellence.


The narrative of excellence is being rewritten to include leaders who strive not just for personal greatness but also for the betterment of humanity. The unassuming acts of kindness, the quiet moments of empathy, and the decisions rooted in restraint are forging a new path for the concept of excellence. This evolution challenges us to evaluate the qualities that truly define greatness and to acknowledge that true excellence is as much about how we treat others as it is about what we achieve.

Elon Musk hasn't been shy about his opinions on AI — he's one of thousands of tech magnates and industry executives who signed an open letter in March calling for a six-month pause on AI development, warning of the ""profound risks to society and humanity."" However, no such pause happened.

During the conversation, Musk said that he is ""glad to see"" that people are ""taking AI seriously"" and delved into predictions about the technology, many of which he admitted are ""fairly utopian,"" such as envisioning a future where AI allows for an ""age of abundance"" with ""no shortage of goods and services.""Also, no jobs.""You can have a job if you wanted to have a job for personal satisfaction,"" Musk said, per CNBC. ""But the AI would be able to do everything.""Still, he didn't ignore AI's potential for harm, which has also been orbiting the AI conversation across the globe.

He envisions a future with increased bandwidth between humans and machines, and Neuralink, his brain-computer interface venture, is taking a significant stride toward achieving that objective.The company now seeks its inaugural volunteers to obtain an implant with over double the electrodes compared to earlier versions, permitting more data collection from a more significant number of nerve cells. Musk aims to boost the ""bandwidth"" between people, humans, and machines by at least 1,000 times.

Potential health benefits range from offering treatment options for neurological disorders to further advancing artificial intelligence, thus creating a new era of symbiotic human-machine collaborations.


Regulatory challenges and ethical concerns in first-in-human trialsRegulators must now evaluate the acceptable level of uncertainty as research proceeds to first-in-human trials and establish the proper participant selection method. It is crucial for regulators to maintain a balance between the potential benefits of novel treatments and ensuring the safety of trial participants. This involves a collaborative approach, engaging with researchers, ethicists, and the patients themselves, to develop a comprehensive understanding of risks and to implement informed, ethical decision-making processes.Related: Elon Musk Says Remote Work Is 'Morally Wrong,' Calls It 'Messed Up'This process seems like a no-brainer (pun intended).

Would you pay to use X (formerly Twitter)? The concept has been talked about for years, but now it appears to be one step closer to reality.X owner Elon Musk hinted at possibly implementing a subscription paywall for all users during a live-streamed conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday. During the talk, Musk mentioned that the company was considering a monthly fee, which he says would be ""a small amount of money"" for using X, and argued that such a change was necessary to address the issue of bots plaguing the platform.""The single most important reason that we are moving to [have] is a small monthly payment for the use of the X system, is it is the only way I could think of to combat vast armies of bots,"" Musk said.



Related: Elon Musk Took a $1 Billion Loan From SpaceX Before $44 Billion Acquisition of TwitterMusk, who is also the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, argued that despite bots being inexpensive to operate (costing a ""fraction of a penny"" or ""tenth of a penny""), if they were required to pay a small fee, the overall cost would be significantly higher, making the accounts less viable.


""We are actually going to come up with a lower-tier pricing. We want it to be just a small amount of money,"" Musk said, adding that the possibility is a ""longer discussion"" but the ""only"" way to tackle the issue.LIVE: Speaking with @elonmusk about how we can harness the opportunities and mitigate the risks of AI for the good of civilization. https://t.co/XiAQwOXzcP— Benjamin Netanyahu - בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) September 18, 2023Musk did not provide further details about the plan nor specify when such a change might take effect.Since acquiring the platform in October 2022, X has faced a series of changes and challenges both financially and critically. In May, investment group Fidelity assessed X's value to be $15 billion, which is approximately one-third of the $44 billion Elon Musk had invested in the platform when he acquired it. During the same month, internal documents obtained by The New York Times revealed that X's advertising revenue had declined by 59% compared to the previous year.


In July, Musk posted on X and acknowledged the financial challenges, citing a significant drop in advertising revenue and a heavy debt burden. In August, he shared another ominous post, admitting that the platform ""may fail"" amid its onslaught of hurdles.Related: Elon Musk Accused of Deliberately Slowing Down Links to News Outlets and Competitors on XIn his discussion with Netanyahu, the topic of hate speech was brought up, wherein Musk stated that he is ""against antisemitism"" and ""anything that promotes hate and conflict.In mid-August, Media Matters for America released a report that found over a dozen brands' ads were placed alongside a verified pro-Nazi account. As a result, two of these brands promptly halted their advertising expenditure on the platform.

While many of us spent our summer Fridays resting on a beach, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent his time in between meetings much differently — getting beat up on a floating barge.In a video posted to Meta-owned Instagram with the caption ""summer vibes,"" Zuckerberg can be seen training with MMA fighters Alexander Volkanovski and Israel Adesanya in a dramatically edited clip that features the trio fighting, kicking, and flipping into the crystal-clear waters surrounded by mountains and evergreens.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck) Facebook's founder has been training for more than a year and takes his hobby seriously. (The gold medal-winning jiu-jitsu champion reportedly set up an octagon in his backyard for MMA practice and training — his wife wasn't pleased.)



In May, on an episode of ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" he said training helps him as a CEO.""After an hour or two of working out, or rolling or wrestling with friends, or training with different folks, it's like now I'm ready to go solve whatever problem at work for the day,"" Zuckerberg said.Related: 'This Nerd Is a Silent Killer': Mark Zuckerberg Rented Out An Entire MMA Arena to Watch a Fight, PrivatelyFor the past few months, Zuckerberg and X owner Elon Musk have been sparring (on social media only, sadly) in a war of words about a potential real-life cage match between the billionaires. But after months of back and forth, Zuck ended the chatter by publicly writing that ""Elon isn't serious.""


Based on Zuckerberg's summer activities, Musk may want to stay that way.However, Musk takes home his own gold. Tesla's CEO is currently the world's richest person, per Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, with roughing $234 billion as of Wednesday afternoon. Zuckerberg is ranked the No. 10 richest, with $109 billion.

Elon Musk secured a $1 billion loan from SpaceX, the company he heads as CEO, around the time of his acquisition of the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, The Wall Street Journal reported.The loan, backed by his SpaceX stock, was approved and drawn down in October 2022 but the reason for acquiring it remains unknown. Musk promptly repaid the loan, including interest, to SpaceX the following month. Musk's substantial ownership of SpaceX allows him to access loans from the company itself, given his 42% stake and significant voting power.The unconventional move exemplifies how Musk, the world's wealthiest person, has the ability to generate cash from his various enterprises without relinquishing shares, allowing him to fund his diverse projects.

At the end of last year, SpaceX reported $4.7 billion in cash and securities, with the loan representing 11% of the $9 billion in equity it had raised since 2009.In November, Musk not only repaid the loan but also sold nearly $4 billion worth of Tesla stock, following a similar stock sale in the subsequent month. The sales amounted to approximately $39 billion over more than a year. Musk also mentioned paying over $11 billion in taxes for 2021 and contributed around $25 billion in cash toward his $44 billion acquisition of X in late October.

Jeff Bezos stepped down as Amazon's CEO in 2021, but remains executive chairman.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Jeff Bezos is one of the most recognizable names in business.The 59-year-old tech titan worked at a hedge fund before he left to start Amazon as an online bookseller, ultimately growing it into one of the world's largest companies by revenue. He's also founded space tourism company Blue Origin, which has flown him to the edge of space.



He's a fixture in the world's wealthiest list; currently, Bezos is the third-richest person in the world with a net worth of $158 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.With all of his wealth, Bezos has made some splashy purchases. He's the 24th-largest landowner in the US with 420,000 acres, according to the 2022 Land Report, with a real estate portfolio boasting mansions in Hawaii, California, Florida, and more. Bezos also owns the world's biggest sailing yacht, a 417-footer that cost an estimated $500 million.From his first job flipping burgers at McDonald's to building Amazon into a trillion-dollar company at one point, here's a look at Jeff Bezos' life and career.Allana Akhtar and Avery Hartmans contributed to an earlier version of this story.Jeff Bezos' mom, Jackie, was a teenager when she had him on January 12, 1964.Jeff Bezos with his father, Miguel ""Mike"" Bezos.

64,Will All This Elon Musk-Fueled Tech Chaos Change Social Media?,"Aug 24, 2023",Max Kraynov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-the-musk-fueled-tech-chaos-will-change-social-media/457162,"
There is no doubt that the social media landscape is in flux. It will soon be a year since Elon Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter, killing off its blue checkmark that used to signify verified users and replacing the Twitter brand with X.At the same time, fast-advancing technologies based on artificial intelligence (AI) are redefining user journeys and expectations. How can existing social media platforms and entertainment tech players position themselves at a time when hard-to-predict industry shifts keep coming at breakneck speed?As Group CEO of FunCorp, a developer of entertainment tech, my team and I are closely watching these developments.



Chaos at the company formerly known as Twitter (what a mouthful!) has at least temporarily boosted the user numbers for Mastodon, helping this smaller platform, based on a decentralized social networking protocol, grow. Within a few months of the 'Mastodon craze' and Twitter's advertising revenue plunging 50%, Meta announced its new social media app, Threads.While Threads achieved the fastest-ever acquisition of more than 150 million users—largely thanks to its tie-in with Instagram—questions about the longevity of its users' enthusiasm for the new app remain.


Related: ""Thread"" Lightly: What Brands Need To Know About This Emerging Social Media PlatformSo, what are the lessons learned for the rest of us, navigating this turbulent landscape and competing for eyeballs and revenue dollars in the current environment? My main takeaway is to tighten our seatbelts and continue doing what we do best. For Funcorp, this means catering to our customer base within the memes and short-form entertainment niche.Despite the changing face of social media, the universal need to unwind, check out of our daily troubles and be entertained has not gone away. The cost-of-living crisis, having to compete for jobs with artificial intelligence, worrying about the changing climate and other ongoing pressures mean that the stress epidemic is unlikely to subside anytime soon.Mobile-first short-form entertainment has great mass appeal even amid an ongoing discussion about the purpose of social media, screen time regulation and age restrictions for platforms that offer bite-sized mobile fun. While some big tech and social media companies might be playing musical chairs, we are staying the course of offering our users an opportunity to share humorous content they make themselves.


Related: Elon Musk Expresses Concern Over X's Future, Says It 'May Fail' Amid Turbulent YearI believe that staking a claim to a specific niche is the best way forward in this uncertain environment. From my vantage point, I certainly see a bright future for memes and the short-form video content space of user-generated content (UGC) platforms—it's a niche we will continue to develop despite the storm raging in the wider industry.The advancement of AI and its new applications are, of course, affecting all of us. While AI is making it easier to generate content, including text, images and video, users are increasingly looking for authentic and relatable content – which is still hard, if not impossible, for AI to produce.User-generated content is still king regarding funny videos, memes and similar short-form entertainment, while AI works backstage to enhance how it is delivered and consumed.


User-generated content also comes with challenges, like a need for moderation, which can be difficult to execute. We are continuously improving our approach to moderation and use a combination of AI-based tools, human moderation and community oversight to help weed out harmful content. There is still no perfect solution, as this is an ongoing process.Another thing we think deeply about is what our users want and expect from their entertainment apps. While mobile technologies potentially make us less sociable as a society, the opposite is true of the digital world.Related: Elon Musk Randomly Goes Live in the Middle of the Night to Post Video of Him Lifting WeightsNo matter what social media or entertainment platform we look at, there is a clear trend towards greater interactivity. Users are no longer passive consumers who just want to play a game or watch a video. Increasingly, they prefer to interact with others, share memes, comment on the videos they watch and otherwise engage with their digital communities and audiences. This trend is prompting the integration of social media functionality into mobile entertainment apps, and we're watching this trend closely.


Another pronounced trend is that consumers are starting to expect more immersive, personalized, interactive, real-time, multimodal and accessible experiences. As a result of changing user expectations, we are seeing greater competition among gaming and mobile entertainment companies to meet these expectations by pushing out new AR- and VR-enabled features. This industry journey will likely continue, with more exciting products coming to market shortly.Even though this might sound old-fashioned, I will stay calm and carry on, keeping my sight set firmly on new technology and UX trends and letting the big techs fight it out in social media.

X, formerly Twitter, has had a turbulent year since Elon Musk's acquisition of the platform in 2022 — marked by advertising decline, user dissatisfaction with changes, and the emergence of Threads, a similar competitor from Meta.Now, Musk is acknowledging that X ""may fail"" amid the constant changes and obstacles.""The sad truth is that there are no great 'social networks' right now,"" Musk posted on X on Saturday. ""We may fail, as so many have predicted, but we will try our best to make there be at least one.""



Linda Yaccarino, who stepped in as X CEO in June, chimed in to write: ""There is an important place in the world for X.""Musk also received some words of encouragement (and criticism) from a fellow billionaire and sometimes rival, Mark Cuban. In a reply to Musk's tweet, Cuban noted that the technology isn't the problem, and since the billionaire's acquisition it has been ""far better."" However, it's Musk's ""control"" of the platform that prevents it from being the digital town square of sorts it once was.


TBH , the tech is now far better since you took over. It's cleaner and you have introduced services (blue check excepted) that make the service more usable.The raw truth is the biggest challenge you have is your influence on the algorithms and the content they present.… https://t.co/bwxaQJQ2m8— Mark Cuban (@mcuban) August 20, 2023Cuban has weighed in before on X's changes, including criticism of the checkmark system, the billionaire's exercise of free speech, and skepticism of Musk's motives in purchasing the platform in the first place.Related: Meta Unveils Twitter Competitor to Offer People a 'Sanely Run' PlatformIn late May, the investment group Fidelity estimated X's valuation at $15 billion, nearly a third of the $44 billion Musk paid for the platform in October 2022. In the same month, it was found that ad revenue at X was down 59% as compared to a year earlier, according to internal documents obtained by The New York Times.


And the obstacles for X continue to pile up.Over the weekend, X experienced a glitch over the weekend, wherein images and links posted to the platform before December 2014 seeming got deleted. Last week, X faced another malfunction—competitors and news outlets experienced a noticeable slowdown of up to five seconds, which was also believed by major outlets like The Washington Post and Reuters to be an intentional move by Musk.On August 16th, Media Matters for America released a report that found at least 18 brands' ads were placed alongside a verified pro-Nazi account, resulting in two brands immediately suspending ad spend on the platform.Related: Elon Musk Accused of Deliberately Slowing Down Links to News Outlets and Competitors on X

Elon Musk has offered to cover the legal expenses for individuals who have experienced workplace discrimination due to their activity on the platform X (formerly Twitter).""If you were unfairly treated by your employer due to posting or liking something on this platform, we will fund your legal bill,"" Musk posted on X Saturday evening.The proposition comes without any financial constraints, with Musk saying there is ""no limit,"" and X intends to pursue the boards of directors of these companies as well, as stated in messages shared on the platform on Saturday night.

From October to March, tweets using slurs and derogatory language against the LGBTQ+ community increased by 119% per the Center of Countering Digital Hate. Over 30% of U.S. adults who used Twitter between March and May encountered content they deemed detrimental to society, according to a report by the USC Marshall Neely Social Media Index.

Last week, veteran Twitter user Gene X. Hwang lost his @X handle to Elon Musk's X — and he's not alone.Although it's unclear exactly how many former Twitter users might have had coveted accounts taken from them, Jeremy Vaught, director of engineering at the nonprofit Life Happens, joined them when X ""ripped away"" his 16-year-old @music handle, Ars Technica reported.Related: Bright X Sign at Twitter HQ Reportedly Went Up Without Permits



Vaught started the @music account in 2007 to promote independent music being performed live in the video game Second Life, but he ultimately transitioned to posting about music in general and amassed roughly 450,000 followers, per the outlet.Vaught said perks with the account were few (he'd receive headphones in exchange for a promotion, for example), but he turned down offers to purchase it — the highest to the tune of $5,000 — because selling was against Twitter policy and ""he figured there was more value in keeping the account.""


Earlier this year, Twitter toyed with the idea of auctioning off usernames to generate revenue after Musk said he wanted to remove inactive accounts and free up 1.5 billion handles, some of which might have value depending on their popularity, The New York Times reported.But it appears that the auction never moved forward — and now X is taking matters into its own hands.Vaught's @music account is now affiliated with X Corp and boasts 11 million followers; he was given the new handle @musicman, which he called ""probably the least worst"" of the options X offered to him, per Ars Technica.Related: Elon Musk Goes Live, Lifts Weights in Bizarre Video | Entrepreneur

70,Threads is Losing Users — Fast. Here's How the App Fumbled Its Product Launch (and 4 Social Media Fails It Resembles),"Aug 4, 2023",Kevin Kaminyar,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-threads-is-quickly-losing-users-and-resembles-these-4/449672,"
In November 2022, Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, received a late-night call from Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta (Instagram's parent company), while on a family vacation in Italy to discuss a plan to build the ""Twitter-killer.""A month after Elon Musk's tumultuous $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, Mosseri found himself speaking softly to avoid waking his sleeping wife as he, Zuckerberg, and a few other Meta executives discussed Twitter-like features they could add to Instagram until Zuckerberg said that he had a different idea: ""What if we went bigger?""On late July 5, 2023, Meta launched a new app called Threads, a standalone Twitter competitor based on Instagram's account system. Within 2 hours of its launch, Threads had two million downloads, and within five days of its launch, the Twitter (now referred to as X) competitor soared to more than 100 million users. It took Twitter 17 years to reach 368 million active users.



Related: 'We're Not There Yet': Meta Focuses on User Retention for Threads Amidst Significant Drop in Engagement What is the Threads app? Here's the description according to Meta:Threads is a new app built by the Instagram team for sharing text updates and joining public conversations.You log in using your Instagram account, and posts can be up to 500 characters long and include links, photos and videos up to 5 minutes in length.We're working to soon make Threads compatible with the open, interoperable social networks that we believe can shape the future of the internet.Why can Threads be seen as a more attractive alternative to Twitter?Twitter is more toxic than Threads — Users have reported a friendlier atmosphere.Twitter has an inferior verification system.Twitter users want better options — a recent study has found that 25% of current Twitter users are expected to leave within a year.However, after becoming one of the fastest-growing apps ever, Threads lost over half its 100 million users just ten days after its launch.What seems to be missing on and with Threads?


Chronological feed.Search functionality.Trending hashtags.Direct messages.But perhaps even more importantly, Threads has had a pretty underwhelming product launch from a marketing standpoint. What's made Twitter exciting for the past 17 years was seeing and hearing the blue bird logo with ""follow me @twitterhandle"" on every TV, news show, radio or podcast, resulting in billions of impressions and traffic to the site.Outside of the generic press release by Meta, there's not been much marketing or advertising done to promote the launch of the new social media platform. While I'm hopeful that Threads will find creative ways to attract and retain users, let's explore four social media companies that failed due to unsuccessful launches.Related: If You Don't Start Using Threads You Will Fall Behind — Here's Why the New Tech is a Game Changer For Entrepreneurs1. Google+: Circles that never fully connectedIn June 2011, Google launched Google+ with high hopes of competing with Facebook. The platform introduced the ""Circles"" concept, allowing users to group their connections into different categories. However, Google+ failed to resonate with users primarily because it was introduced as an invitation-only service.


This exclusivity created a perception that it was not easily accessible, and users didn't find a strong incentive to switch from established platforms like Facebook. Google+ struggled to find its identity and eventually shut down in 2019.Lesson: Accessibility is key. Social media platforms must be open and easy to join to attract a broad user base.Related: How to Make Your Social Media Channels More Accessible to Everyone2. Friendster: First but not the lastFriendster was one of the earliest social media platforms, launched in 2002. It allowed users to connect with friends, play games and share content. However, its launch was plagued with technical glitches and server issues, leading to frequent downtime. As competition from other platforms emerged, Friendster's slow response to user feedback and inability to handle its growing user base resulted in a rapid decline in popularity. It eventually closed down in 2011.


Lesson: Reliability and scalability are crucial for any social media platform to thrive.3. Vine: A six-second wonderVine, a short-form video hosting service, gained popularity with its six-second looping videos. Basically TikTok before TikTok. However, despite its initial success, Vine failed to capitalize on its unique format and lacked effective monetization strategies. Additionally, when Instagram and other platforms introduced similar video features, Vine faced tough competition. Twitter, which acquired Vine in 2012, eventually shut down the service in 2017.Lesson: Innovation alone isn't enough; sustainable monetization plans are essential for long-term success.4. Ello: The ad-free promise that fell flatEllo gained attention in 2014 for its promise of being an ad-free social network, catering to users' growing concerns about data privacy and intrusive advertising. However, its launch was marred by severe technical issues, limiting users' ability to invite friends and connect with others. Moreover, Ello struggled to maintain user interest due to its limited features and lack of engaging content. As a result, it failed to build a critical mass of active users and gradually faded away.


Lesson: Deliver on promises and provide compelling features and content to retain users.Social media platforms' history is filled with success stories and cautionary tales. The platforms mentioned above serve as reminders that a strong launch is critical to establishing a user base and gaining momentum. Accessibility, reliability, scalability, innovation and sustainable monetization strategies are key to achieving social media success.

(It also includes catering.)How Much Money Is Taylor Swift Generating for the Economy?While it's unclear exactly how much Zuckerberg spent on the big-ticket event, Swifties on average have spent $1,300 per show on tickets, travel, and other concert necessities, according to a June survey by research company QuestionsPro.

However, when the ""Eras"" tour took Chicago from June 2 to June 4, the city's tourism and marketing organization, Choose Chicago, found more than 44,000 hotel rooms were used each night of the concert, generating $39 million in hotel revenue for the city.


Swift has since extended her international tour and is expected to keep going until August 2024.

More than a decade ago, Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was embarking on a personal sustainability challenge to eat only meat he killed himself — but it looks like he's had a somewhat drastic change of heart.In a recent Threads post in response to one from McDonald's calling for orders, Zuckerberg put in an extensive request of his own — then explained that he needs to consume roughly 4,000 calories daily during his training ""to offset all the activity.""Related: Mark Zuckerberg Posts Shirtless Photo After MMA Training

What are Mark Zuckerberg's favorite foods?What other favorites of Zuckerberg's might make it onto the menu as he gets ready for a potential showdown with billionaire rival Elon Musk?It's safe to say Zuckerberg might enjoy some Philz Coffee; he served it at his wedding to Priscilla Chan in 2012 and even invited father-son co-founders Phil and Jacob Jaber, Forbes reported.Related: Elon Musk's Mom Doesn't Want Him to Fight Mark ZuckerbergThe special day also featured food from the couple's favorite restaurants, Mexican spot Palo Alto Sol and Fuki Sushi, and Burdick chocolate ""mice"" for dessert (little mice-shaped truffles the couple shared on their first date), per The Washington Post.


Zuckerberg and Chan also showed their support to Bay Area restaurants amid the pandemic — giving a $100,000 check to eight of their local favorites, including those two that catered their wedding, Eater reported.Palo Alto Japanese restaurant Dohatsuten; Los Altos Chinese spot Chef Chu's; Redwood City-based Vesta, a Bib Gourmand nominee; San Mateo sushi spot Sushi Sam's Edomata; and Sardinia restaurant La Ciccia and The Liberties Bar & Grill, two San Francisco restaurants not far from the couple's former Dolores Heights residence, all made the cut — and might be some of Zuckerberg's go-tos so long as he's not cutting.

Elon Musk is the world's richest person.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Elon Musk, the world's richest person, has a net worth of around $239 billion, according to estimates by Bloomberg.But the tech mogul's wealth comes from a number of sources and it isn't stable. His fortunes have fluctuated greatly since the start of the pandemic, and he's been trading places with other tech billionaires to top Bloomberg's rich list.



How has Musk's net worth changed over time?Musk, who was born in South Africa, moved to Canada, and dropped out of a Ph.D at Stanford, became a millionaire before he hit 30. Musk started Zip2, a website that provided city travel guides to newspapers, with his brother Kimbal Musk, and sold it to Compaq for more than $300 million in 1999. Musk, then aged 27, is believed to have got $22 million from the deal.He went on to cofound online bank X.com in 1999. It soon merged with Peter Thiel's Confinity to become PayPal, and the company was bought for $1.5 billion by eBay in 2002. Despite having been ousted as CEO, Musk walked away with around $165 million.


Musk cofounded space-exploration company SpaceX in 2002. In 2004, he became an investor in and chairman of EV company Tesla. During the financial crisis in 2008, he saved Tesla from bankruptcy with a $40 million investment and a $40 million loan. That same year, he was named CEO.Musk said 2008 was ""the worst year of my life."" Alongside problems in his personal life, Tesla kept losing money and SpaceX was having trouble launching its Falcon 1 rocket. By 2009, Musk was living off personal loans.But Tesla went public in 2010, and Musk's estimated net worth steadily climbed. In 2012 he debuted on Forbes' Billionaires List with an estimated wealth of $2 billion.In 2016, Musk set up tunnel-digging business the Boring Company. The next year, he founded neurotechnology startup Neuralink.


Musk's net worth began a rapid ascent at the start of the pandemic as Tesla shares soared. Musk started 2020 with an estimated net worth of just under $30 billion and was worth around $170 billion just a year later – a more than five-fold increase in just a year. His estimated fortune peaked at around $340 billion in November 2021.He also bought Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022, serving as its CEO until he stood down in early June.Though Bloomberg puts his current net worth at $239 billion, Forbes puts it at $242.4 billion.Where does Musk's fortune come from?Musk's wealth is largely dependent on Tesla shares. Though he takes no salary from Tesla, he's awarded stock options when the company hits challenging performance metrics.


""Elon will receive no guaranteed compensation of any kind — no salary, no cash bonuses, and no equity that vests simply by the passage of time,"" Tesla said in 2018 when the company announced a 10-year performance award for Musk. ""Instead, Elon's only compensation will be a 100% at-risk performance award, which ensures that he will be compensated only if Tesla and all of its shareholders do extraordinarily well.""According to Bloomberg, close to half of Musk's net worth comes from Tesla shares, while just over 20% comes from SpaceX shares. The rest of his wealth comes from shares in Twitter and The Boring Company, as well as other miscellaneous liabilities.How does Musk stack up to other billionaires?At time of writing, Musk was the world's richest person, according to Bloomberg's estimates, though he frequently trades places with other billionaires.Musk's current fortune is around $38 billion larger than that of LVMH founder Bernard Arnault, who Bloomberg estimates is worth $201 billion. Rounding off the top five are Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, at $153 billion, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, at $137 billion, and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, at $133 billion.

74,Mark Zuckerberg's Net Worth Soars to $113 Billion after Meta Stock Surges — Making Him the 9th Richest Person in the World,"Jul 28, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/mark-zuckerberg-became-9b-richer-after-meta-stock-surge/456603,"
Mark Zuckerberg experienced a significant boost in his wealth on Thursday, with gains reportedly up to $9 billion. This comes after Meta's stock surged by 9% on Wednesday, following a robust second-quarter earnings report, Business Insider reported. Zuckerberg, who has long had a salary of $1 as CEO, holds most of his wealth in stakes in the company and owns over 13% of Meta stock.The company's growth in advertising revenue, along with the launch of Meta's Twitter competitor, Threads, contributed to the Facebook parent company's success in the second quarter of 2023.Meta's revenue increased by 11% to $32 billion in Q2, surpassing Wall Street expectations of $31.12 billion, per Reuters. Ad revenue showed even stronger growth, rising by 12% in the quarter, outpacing Google's ad revenue growth, which was at 3%. Additionally, the adjusted earnings per share of $2.98 surpassed Wall Street's target of $2.91, according to data from Refinitiv, per Reuters.



After facing challenges in 2022, Meta has been on the path to recovery, driven by emerging AI technology and the company's efforts to optimize operations — in what Zuckerberg has dubbed the ""year of efficiency"" — which included laying off around 21,000 employees since the previous fall.Related: 'This Nerd Is a Silent Killer': Mark Zuckerberg Rented Out An Entire MMA Arena to Watch a Fight, Privately


Zuckerberg's net worth has more than doubled this year, after his wealth took a hit and plummeted to approximately $35 billion in November from around $125 billion at the beginning of the year, per the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. However, since hitting its lowest point last fall, Zuckerberg's net worth has rebounded and grown more than threefold to approximately $113 billion as of Friday.With the gains in Meta stock, Zuckerberg is now the ninth richest person in the world, ahead of Google co-founder Sergey Brin (net worth of $111 billion) and billionaire investor Carlos Slim (net worth of $97.5 billion), per the Bloomberg Billionaire Index.Throughout the year, the 165% surge in Meta stock has added approximately $70 billion to Zuckerberg's wealth, making it one of the most substantial gains in net worth this year. However, the year-to-date increase still lags behind tech CEO Elon Musk's $100 billion surge in wealth during the same period.Related: Twitter Roasts Elon Musk After His Mom 'Cancels' Cage Fight With Mark Zuckerberg: 'Mom, I'm Fighting Him Stop It'

75,'We're Not There Yet': Meta Focuses on User Retention for Threads Amidst Significant Drop in Engagement,"Jul 28, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/threads-users-down-by-half-meta-plans-retention-driving/456592,"
Meta executives are putting their focus on improving user retention for Threads, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees at a company town hall meeting on Thursday, per Reuters. The Twitter (now X) competitor experienced a significant drop in engagement after its initial launch, losing more than half of its user base, the CEO added.Zuckerberg also acknowledged that although user retention on Threads was better than expected, it still fell short of the ideal numbers.""Obviously, if you have more than 100 million people sign up, ideally it would be awesome if all of them or even half of them stuck around. We're not there yet,"" Zuckerberg said in the meeting.



According to data firm Similarweb, the number of active users on Threads is down 60% since its launch.Related: Threads to Implement Changes to Common Complaints After Hitting 100 Million Users


Now, to enhance user retention, Meta is exploring the use of ""retention-driving hooks"" to encourage users to return to Threads. Meta CFO Chris Cox told Reuters one such incentive is ""making sure people who are on the Instagram app can see important Threads.""Threads has already been implementing changes since its launch, including adding the ability to translate content between languages and a much-requested option to view one's feed chronologically.Before the CEO's Threads discussion, Meta's Q2 earnings report impressed investors with strong revenue growth. The results, released on Wednesday, led to a 9% stock surge on Thursday; Mark Zuckerberg added as much as $9 billion to his net worth.Related: Jack Dorsey Blasts Mark Zuckerberg Over Threads Follow Request: 'Too Soon'

78,Twitter Is Being Sued for $500 Million By Laid Off Employees Claiming Unpaid Severance,"Jul 13, 2023",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/twitter-slammed-with-500-million-lawsuit-over-severances/455792,"
Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter has been publicly contentious, from instating mass layoffs to ousting top executives on day one.Now, scorned former employees are suing the billionaire claiming they're collectively owed roughly $500 million in unpaid severance.The class action suit was filed in California on behalf of Courtney McMillian, a former Human Resources executive who oversaw employee benefits at Twitter and was laid off during Musk's first week at the company.



The lawsuit alleges that workers were set to be paid ""two months of their base pay plus one week of pay for each full year of service"" upon being laid off, per Reuters, and that senior employees were entitled to six months of base pay.However, under Musk, laid-off employees are claiming they only received one month of severance pay if anything, as some didn't even receive any payout.


It's noted that Twitter is being sued for a federal law violation pertaining to the company's employee benefits plan set in place in 2019, which is unrelated to prior lawsuits accusing the company of not paying severance to individual employees because of breaching their specific contracts.When reached for comment, Twitter media relations auto-replied to Entrepreneur with a poop emoji.Earlier this year, a disabled Twitter employee publicly asked Musk whether or not he was being laid off, to which Musk replied that he just wanted a ""big payout."" The two eventually settled the disagreement, ending in Musk publicly apologizing.It's estimated that Twitter has 1,000 employees as of May — about 10% of its workforce before Musk purchased the company last November.


""There were a lot of people that didn't seem to have a lot of value,"" Musk said bluntly at the Wall Street Journal's CEO Council Summit in London in May. ""I think there is the possibility for significant cuts at other companies without affecting their productivity, in fact increasing their productivity.""Musk's net worth as of Thursday morning was an estimated $244.1 billion.

The test occurred on June 30 at Blue Origin's West Texas facility.

The social media slap-fight between billionaires Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk about their platforms appears to be escalating — and fast.On Tuesday, Meta CEO Zuckerberg posted a photo on Instagram, which seemed like a ""shots fired"" moment at Musk. For weeks, the two have been trading barbs on social media and threatening to get physical IRL.

Per Variety's reporting, a cease-and-desist letter was sent to Zuckerberg over the launch of Threads.One of Twitter's lawyers commented that Meta ""has engaged in systematic, willful and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter's trade secrets and other intellectual property."" The letter went on to state that ""Twitter intends to strictly enforce its intellectual property rights, and demands that Meta take immediate steps to stop using any Twitter trade secrets or other highly confidential information.""

At first, I wasn't going to sign up for Threads — then I did. Then my friends did. And my co-workers. And my dad, whose first thread was about how ""stoked"" he was to be there.While I have yet to fully submerge myself into the…thread-sphere? Thread-a-verse? The sheer simplicity of joining (you can sign up with a single click if you link through Instagram) made it all too easy to hop on — apparently for millions of others, too.Threads, the text-based app by Meta, has rapidly gained popularity since its launch less than a week ago to the surprise of Meta employees. The company reportedly anticipated millions of users, not 100 million, which it garnered in just five days, making it the fastest-growing platform ever, according to data from Quiver Quantitative.



Related: Analysts Say 'Twitter's Traffic Is Tanking' as Threads Hits 100 Million Users""I never thought I'd want Zuckerberg to beat Twitter, but here we are,"" a former Twitter employee told Business Insider, with another source adding that Threads is the ""first legit competitor"" to Twitter.


""I'm so surprised. Everyone is,"" a Meta employee told the outlet.Still, it's not perfect, and users have been calling out the platform for its flaws, including the lack of a chronological feed, showing posts from accounts users follow, the absence of direct messaging, and the inability to see which posts a user has already liked — a feature I often utilize on Twitter to return to an account or remind myself to read something later.Responding to the feedback, Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, confirmed that a chronological feed is in the works and is among several planned updates for Threads, BBC reported, including the ability to edit a post, language translation, easier account switching, improvements to the desktop interface, and a ""more robust search function.""Elon Musk, who acquired Twitter in October 2022, made a series of changes to the app (most of which have been met with scathing feedback from users) and has found himself on the defensive. With only five days since the launch, Musk has engaged in a heated exchange with Zuckerberg via cease-and-desist letters and social media posts (all of which are very public, and very embarrassing).

In truth, I miss the old Twitter, and if anything, Threads makes me miss it more. I'm still on the platform — well, both platforms now — it's just…different. Neither feels quite ""right."" Threads may be a viable alternative, but until Meta addresses the much-needed updates — or until Twitter gets its act together — I'll be on the sidelines, keeping whatever bite-size thoughts I once would have shared with the internet in my head (far away from both Musk and Zuckerberg).Wall Street, however, is definitely on board. Analysts anticipate Threads to become a lucrative source of revenue for Meta, potentially generating $8 billion annually if it reaches 200 million users, per Bloomberg.

Elon Musk might not be on Threads, but his jet sure is.Months after the Twitter owner permanently suspended the Twitter account ElonJet — which tracked the location of Musk's jet using a bot and publicly available data — the account reemerged on Threads shortly after the Meta app's launch.Under the new name ""elonmusksjet,"" the account, which is run by 20-year-old college student Jack Sweeney, has been tracking Musk's travels, including flights from Texas to Los Angeles, and has already amassed a following of 107,000 users as of Tuesday.



The account's pivot to Threads comes after Musk offered Sweeney $5,000 to stop posting his whereabouts, claiming it was a safety hazard. The student countered his offer with $50,000, but Musk turned down the deal.


RELATED: Elon Musk's Jet Took A 9-Minute Flight From San Jose to San FranciscoAfter Musk bought Twitter in April 2022, Twitter permanently suspended the account. It had 500,000 followers at the time.  Sweeney created another Twitter account, ElonJetNext Day, which posts Musk's jet data after a 24-hour delay and has 25,600 followers. That account is still active on Twitter.Sweeney tracks several other celebrity's jets, including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian and more. His work has been controversial due to safety concerns.Bernard Arnault, the French CEO of luxury conglomerate LVMH, sold his private jet after it was tracked on Twitter, Bloomberg reported.RELATED: The Second-Richest Man in the World Sold His Private Jet, Thanks to Twitter UsersAs for his revival on Threads, Sweeney is happy to have his following back. ""This is the most I've had since my Twitter account was suspended,"" he told CNN. ""There's still a lot of people who are interested in this.""Shortly after joining Threads and posting the message ""@zuck will I be allowed to stay [?],"" Sweeney's new account was temporarily suspended. However, it was reinstated shortly after, according to screenshots shared to his personal account @jxck.sweeney.

84,Analysts Say 'Twitter's Traffic Is Tanking' as Threads Hits 100 Million Users,"Jul 11, 2023",Jonathan Small,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/twitters-traffic-is-tanking-as-threads-hits-100-million/455593,"
Meta's new app Threads may not yet be the ""Twitter killer"" that some social media denizens claim, but industry analysts say its launch last week is seriously hurting Twitter's numbers.Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, said on Monday that Threads has already hit 100 million downloads. 



 Post by @zuckView on Threads  Meanwhile, traffic to Twitter is ""tanking,"" according to Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince, who Tweeted a chart of Twitter's domain ranking dropping over the weekend.


Twitter traffic tanking. https://t.co/KSIXqNsu40 pic.twitter.com/mLlbuXVR6r— Matthew Prince ? (@eastdakota) July 9, 2023According to Similar Web, a website analysis and market intelligence platform, traffic to Twitter's website dropped 5% during the first few days of Threads' rollout. The gloves are offThreads' surprising early success has caused a contentious relationship between Twitter's Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg's Meta to unravel completely.Last week, Twitter's CEO threatened to sue Meta, claiming that the new platform copied Twitter.""Twitter intends to strictly enforce its intellectual property rights, and demands that Meta take immediate steps to stop using any Twitter trade secrets or other highly confidential information,"" Twitter lawyer Alex Spiro wrote.Over the weekend, Musk aimed his ire straight at Zuckerberg, tweeting, ""Zuck is a cuck,"" and proposing ""a literal dick measuring contest."" 


I propose a literal dick measuring contest ?— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 10, 2023So far, Zuckerberg hasn't taken the bait, preferring to point to Threads' impressive numbers than to spar with Musk — although he did agree to a cage match last week.In a Threads post, Zuck boasted that Threads signups were the result of ""mostly organic demand, and we haven't even turned on many promotions yet.""But despite the colorful barbs and taunts between billionaires, the jury is still out on the real impact Threads will have on Twitter's bottom line.


Sure, 100 million users in 4 days is an astonishing achievement, but it's still far from Twitter's 354 million active users. And just because everyone's checking out the shiny new car on the lot doesn't mean they'll stick around after the test drive.""Whether they actually become engaged users or not, it will take a while to know,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney told The Wall Street Journal.

Meta, the parent company of Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, is launching its Twitter competitor ""Threads by Instagram"" on Thursday, according to the countdown clock on its App Store and web page (and several reports).The launch comes at a time when Twitter users have been searching for alternatives after a series of changes occurred following Elon Musk's purchase last fall. Twitter co-founder and billionaire Jack Dorsey's Twitter-like app, Bluesky, for example, reportedly saw ""record"" numbers last week. Still, so far, no copycats have been able to compete with the social media giant that Musk bought for $44 billion.How To Get ThreadsAhead of the launch, potential Threads users can download an invitation through Instagram by searching for ""threads"" and clicking on the red ticket that appears at the end of the search bar.



Screenshot of author's InstagramRelated: Twitter Temporarily Sets Rate Limits for Users, Blames 'Extreme Levels of Data Scraping'The invites are also available by tapping the three lines next to your profile, per CNBC.What might set Threads apart is accessibility. Dorsey's Bluesky is still in Beta with an invite-only system that feels exclusive (and standoffish), while Instagram's version reportedly will merge with your current account, keep your username, and (looks) to be open to everyone.Original story below: Instagram is ""secretly testing"" a text-based app to compete with Twitter, and the debut may happen as soon as next month, Bloomberg reported.The new platform has reportedly already been available to select celebrities and creators for months and is a separate app from Instagram, but there will be an option to link accounts.Lia Haberman, an adjunct professor at UCLA in social and influencer marketing, tweeted a screenshot of the new platform, per Bloomberg.""It's impossible to predict how audiences will respond but this could be an alternative,"" she wrote.


Based on a (somewhat blurry) example I got, Meta's new app looks a lot like Twitter.So, could this take over all the Twitter screenshots we've been seeing on the Feed lately? Maybe.It's impossible to predict how audiences will respond but this could be an alternative. pic.twitter.com/xgQa1kUjCl— Lia Haberman (@liahaberman) May 19, 2023Since Elon Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022, many users have grown frustrated with the changes — from reinstating controversial accounts to the adoption of Twitter Blue.Data shows that even the most dedicated tweeters are losing interest. According to a survey from Pew Research Center, activity for Twitter's ""most active"" users declined by 25% since Musk's acquisition of the platform.Related: 'It's a Long Story': Elon Musk Publicly Apologizes to Disabled Employee After Squabble on TwitterEntrepreneur has reached out to Meta, the owner of Instagram, for comment.

Beyond the private planes occupying the hangars of billionaires, yachts have come to symbolize the highly private sites of leisure and networking reserved for the ultra-wealthy.Tech billionaires like Bezos, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, and Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have all purchased their own mini vacation hubs at sea, decking their boats with amenities like gyms, spas, pools, nightclubs, and movie theaters.


For those wishing to experience life aboard these multi-million-dollar yachts, some are available to rent out for a few nights or weeks at a time. Late Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen's yacht can be booked for $2.2 million per week or more, according Bloomberg.Chartering yachts owned by billionaires like Alphabet cofounder Sergey Brin has previously cost customers anywhere from $773,000 a week to $1.2 million.It remains to be seen how these vessels will fare against the apparent Orca uprising.Take a look at some of the yachts that have been owned by tech billionaires.

This story originally appeared on Business Insider.Mark Zuckerberg is one of the wealthiest people in the world.The Meta founder and CEO's fortune surpassed $100 billion last year, making him one of 10 centi-billionaires on the planet. As of June, Zuckerberg's net worth was $101.1 billion, according to Forbes.



Zuckerberg mostly keeps a low profile, but he does splurge on real estate — especially in the tropical paradise that is Hawaii. He and his wife, Priscilla Chan, also invest in childhood education and medical research.More recently, Zuckerberg accepted a random challenge from Twitter CEO Elon Musk to a ""cage match."" The Meta CEO is known to participate in jiu-jitsu tournaments and other recreational sports.

Elon Musk is nothing if not contentious, and now the stature he has associated with his last name is getting his family members into less-than-desirable business situations.Musk's younger sister, Tosca Musk, 48, told the Daily Mail in a new interview that she was upcharged on a shooting location for a video of her passion and romance streaming site, Passionflix, because they ""heard my name and assumed we were rich … That's not exactly fair, is it?""Tosca said that the shoot was originally supposed to cost $5,000 for the location but ended up being offered to her at $25,000.



""It's a double-edged sword for me to say whether my brother has helped in any way,"" she told the outlet. ""If I say no, then people will say he does not support me at all, and if I say yes, they'll think he paid for everything.""Tosca and Elon, 51, also share a brother, Kimball Musk, 50.Tosca Musk also went on to talk about the work ethic that her mother, model Maye Musk, 75, instilled in her and her siblings when they were growing up.""I was taken care of and loved by my family,"" she explained.

Since Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter in October 2022, the social media platform has been on a bumpy road: advertisers have been leaving in droves, users have grown agitated with ongoing changes (including the integration of Twitter Blue), and the mass layoffs have ignited internal frustration at the company.In December, Musk put out a poll on Twitter, asking the platform to weigh in on his fate as the social media's first-in-command: ""Should I step down as head of Twitter? I will abide by the results of this poll."" The people spoke and, two days later, Musk stated he would step down as CEO as soon as he finds someone ""foolish enough to take the job.""And yet, Twitter's new CEO, Linda Yaccarino, is anything but that. The 60-year-old media veteran officially stepped into her new role on June 5th (about two weeks earlier than expected, per Musk's original announcement on May 12).



So, who is Yaccarino, Twitter's new first-in-command? Here's everything to know about the advertising powerhouse and Twitter's new CEO.Where is Linda Yaccarino from? Linda Yaccarino is an Italian-American who grew up in Deer Park, New York. Yaccarino later went to Pennsylvania State University, where she graduated in 1985 with a degree in telecommunications.


What was Linda Yaccarino's last job? Yaccarino joins Twitter after working in the advertising industry for decades. Her former role was chairman of advertising and client partnerships at NBC Universal, where she was in charge of the company's market strategy and advertising revenue for NBC's cable, broadcast, and digital assets.""It has been an absolute honor to be part of Comcast NBCUniversal and lead the most incredible team,"" Yaccarino said in a statement announcing her departure from NBC. ""We've transformed our company and the entire industry—and I am so proud of what we've accomplished together.""Yaccarino had been at NBC for almost 12 years by the time of her departure. Formerly, she worked at Turner Broadcasting Systems for two decades, holding a variety of roles from executive vice president to chief operating officer.Related: Elon Musk Claims He's Hiring a 'VP of Witchcraft and Propaganda'


Does Linda Yaccarino have a family? Yaccarino met her husband, Claude Madrazo on a blind date, BBC noted. The couple has two children, and they reside in Sea Cliff, New York.What has Linda Yaccarino said about being Twitter's new CEO?While taking command of Twitter in its current state is no easy task, Yaccarino has voiced excitement about the new role. Last month, on both Twitter and LinkedIn, Yaccarino said she has been ""inspired"" by former Twitter CEO Musk's ""vision to create a brighter future.""""Now, I'm excited to help bring that vision to Twitter and transform the business together. Everyone's feedback is VITAL to Twitter's future. And I'm here for all of it,"" the new CEO wrote on LinkedIn.Related: 'Literally Everything Is Possible': Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino Pens First-Ever Letter To Employees About 'Transformation'


What does Elon Musk now do at Twitter?Now that Yaccarino has filled the CEO position, Musk tweeted in May that his role will transition to executive chair, CTO, and overseeing product design and new technology.

Richard Branson's space tourism company, Virgin Galactic, is set to launch its first commercial flight this month, planning to take off between June 27 and June 30, the company announced on Thursday.The first commercial spaceflight, ""Galactic 01,"" is a scientific research mission and will carry three crew members from the Italian Air Force and the National Research Council of Italy to conduct microgravity research.Following the announcement, stock for Virgin Galactic surged over 40% in extended trading on Thursday and is up nearly 34% year-to-date as of Friday afternoon.Related: Virgin Galactic Just Opened Space Flights to the Public. Here's How Much It Will Cost You.However, the space tourism company, founded in 2004, has faced a series of hardships over the past few years, marked mostly by consistent financial losses. Between 2018 and 2022, the company generated $12.5 million in revenue and $1.5 billion in operating losses, per the Wall Street Journal. In 2021, Branson himself sold about $300 million worth of Virgin Galactic stock shares, reducing his stake by nearly 75%.In April, Virgin Orbit (Branson's other space company that specializes in satellite launches) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy following a failed launch attempt in early 2023, and the company's inability to secure long-term funding.Nonetheless, things might finally be looking up (literally) for the space company.After the planned launch of Galactic 01, ""Galactic 02"" is intended to launch in early August, and the company aims to have monthly commercial flights after that. By the end of 2022, Virgin Galactic had about 800 reservations, each seat on a spaceflight costing $450,000 a pop.

Twitter is being sued by 17 separate music publishers, which claim the social media platform is permitting users to post music without proper licenses.""Social media companies behind such well-known platforms as TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat have entered into agreements with Publishers and other rights holders that compensate creators of musical compositions for use of their works on those platforms,"" the lawsuit states.  ""There are also dynamic existing markets for individuals to receive streams and downloads of music, including recordings embodying Publishers' musical compositions, outside the context of social media.""The lawsuit, which was filed in Nashville, was brought by well-known publishers such as Sony Music Publishing and Universal Music Publishing Group. The plaintiffs are seeking more than $250 million in damages for violation of more than 1,700 copyrights, per Reuters.Documents state that the copyright issues started before Elon Musk purchased the company and that ""Twitter has engaged in, knowingly facilitated, and profited from copyright infringement"" after Musk's takeover as well.""Twitter knows perfectly well that neither it nor users of the Twitter platform have secured licenses for the rampant use of music being made on its platform as complained of herein,"" the lawsuit says. ""Nonetheless, in connection with its highly interactive platform, Twitter consistently and knowingly hosts and streams infringing copies of musical compositions, including ones uploaded by or streamed to Tennessee residents and including specific infringing material that Twitter knows is infringing.""



The lawsuit is another hit against Twitter, which has been no stranger to controversy since the billionaire purchased it in November 2022.Twitter's new CEO, Linda Yaccarino, started her position this week.

  Why Elon Musk and Other Tech Experts Are Worried About Artificial Intelligence
  
    In the emerging AI era, notable tech figures celebrate the technology's astounding capabilities while other companies fiercely compete in the AI market. Yet, as businesses struggle to adapt, many tech experts voice concerns about AI's potential pitfalls.

    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

""The age of AI has begun,"" Bill Gates declared this March, reflecting on an OpenAI demonstration of feats such as acing an AP Bio exam and giving a thoughtful, touching answer to being asked what it would do if it were the father of a sick child.At the same time, tech giants like Microsoft and Google have been locked in a race to develop AI tech, integrate it into their existing ecosystems and dominate the market. In February, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella challenged Sundar Pichai of Google to ""come out and dance"" in the AI battlefield.For businesses, it's a challenge to keep up. On the one hand, AI promises to streamline workflows, automate tedious tasks and increased overall productivity. Conversely, the AI sphere is fast-paced, with new tools constantly appearing. Where should they place their bets to stay ahead of the curve?



And now, many tech experts are backpedaling. Leaders like Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Tesla's Elon Musk, alongside 1,300 other industry experts, professors and AI luminaries, all signed an open letter calling to halt AI development for six months.At the same time, the ""godfather of AI,"" Geoffrey Hinton, resigned as one of Google's lead AI researchers and wrote a New York Times op-ed warning of the technology he'd helped create.


Even ChatGPT's Sam Altman joined in the chorus of warning voices during a Congress hearing.But what are these warnings about? Why do tech experts say that AI could actually pose a threat to businesses — and even humanity?Here is a closer look at their warnings.Uncertain liabilityTo begin with, there is a very business-focused concern. Liability.


While AIs have developed amazing capabilities, they are far from faultless. ChatGPT, for instance, famously invented scientific references in a paper it helped write.Consequently, the question of liability arises. If a business uses AI to complete a task and gives a client erroneous information, who is liable for damages? The business? The AI provider?None of that is clear right now. And traditional business insurance fails to cover AI-related liabilities.Regulators and insurers are struggling to catch up. Only recently, the EU drafted a framework to regulate AI liability.Related: Rein in the AI Revolution Through the Power of Legal LiabilityLarge-scale data theftAnother concern is linked to unauthorized data use and cybersecurity threats. AI systems frequently store and handle large amounts of sensitive information, much of it collected in legal gray areas.This could make them attractive targets for cyberattacks.""In the absence of robust privacy regulations (US) or adequate, timely enforcement of existing laws (EU), businesses have a tendency to collect as much data as they possibly can,"" explained Merve Hickok, Chair & Research Director at Center for AI and Digital Policy, in an interview with The Cyber Express.


""AI systems tend to connect previously disparate datasets,"" Hickok continued. ""This means that data breaches can result in exposure of more granular data and can create even more serious harm.""MisinformationNext up, bad actors are turning to AI to generate misinformation. Not only can this have serious ramifications for political figures, especially with an election year looming. It can also cause direct damage to businesses.Whether targeted or accidental, misinformation is already rampant online. AI will likely drive up the volume and make it harder to spot.AI-generated photos of business leaders, audio mimicking a politician's voice and artificial news anchors announcing convincing economic news. Business decisions triggered by such fake information could have disastrous consequences.


Related: Pope Francis Didn't Really Wear A White Puffer Coat. But It Won't Be the Last Time You're Fooled By an AI-Generated Image.Demotivated and less creative team membersEntrepreneurs are also debating how AI will affect the psyche of individual members of the workforce.""Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us?"" the open letter asks.According to Matt Cronin, the U.S. Department of Justice's National Security & Cybercrime Coordinator, the answer is a clear ""No."" Such a large-scale replacement would devastate the motivation and creativity of people in the workforce.


""Mastering a domain and deeply understanding a topic takes significant time and effort,"" he writes in The Hill. ""For the first time in history, an entire generation can skip this process and still progress in school and work. However, reliance on generative AI comes with a hidden price. You are not truly learning — at least not in a way that meaningfully benefits you.""Ultimately, widespread AI use may lower team members' competence, including critical thinking skills.Related: AI Can Replace (Some) Jobs — But It Can't Replace Human Connection. Here's Why.Economic and political instabilityWhat economic shifts widespread AI adoption will cause are unknown, but they will likely be large and fast. After all, a recent Goldman Sachs estimate projected that two-thirds of current occupations could be partially or fully automated, with opaque ramifications for individual businesses.


According to experts' more pessimistic outlooks, AI could also incite political instability. This could range from election tampering to truly apocalyptic scenarios.In an op-ed in Time Magazine, decision theorist Eliezer Yudkowsky called for a general halt to AI development. He and others argue that we are unprepared for powerful AIs and that unfettered development could lead to catastrophe.ConclusionAI tools hold immense potential to increase businesses' productivity and level up their success.However, it's crucial to be aware of the danger that AI systems pose, not just according to doomsayers and techno-skeptics, but according to the very same people who developed these technologies.


That awareness will help infuse businesses' AI approach with a caution critical to successful adaptation.

Facebook parent company Meta Platforms might have its sights set on the metaverse — but it's still making time for other big projects.Meta revealed it will release a standalone app to compete with Elon Musk's Twitter at an all-hands meeting led by chief product officer Chris Cox on Thursday, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal.Related: Meta Rolls Out New Feature for People Who Want to Make Money in the Metaverse



Twitter has struggled in the wake of Musk's takeover, with advertisers pulling out amid significant issues including the rise of hate speech. Sixty percent of Twitter users say they've ""taken a break"" from the platform in the past year, according to a study from the Pew Research Center.Cox told Meta employees that creators and public figures told the company they want a ""sanely run"" platform; Meta is discussing commitments to the app with Oprah Winfrey and the Dalai Lama. Meta strives to launch the app, internally code-named Project 92, ""as soon as we can,"" per the WSJ.


Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg also spoke at the meeting, noting that Apple's recently announced $3,500 Vision Pro headset doesn't provide any ""magical solutions"" and is less ""accessible"" and ""affordable"" than Meta's version of the product. Meta's Quest 3 is expected to hit the market this fall and start at $499.Related: Meta's Layoffs Are Underway, Right on Schedule | EntrepreneurZuckerberg also touched on the company's extensive generative AI efforts, which include LLM-based ""agents"" with different personas for Messenger and Whatsapp.Meta Platforms Inc is up nearly 44% year over year.

In April, billionaire Twitter owner Elon Musk said the company's finances were looking up as almost all advertisers had returned to the platform, the BBC reported.But Twitter's U.S. ad revenue is telling a different story, according to The New York Times. The outlet obtained an internal company presentation, which revealed that its U.S. ad revenue was $88 million from April 1 to the first week of May — down 59% from a year earlier.Related: Elon Musk Gets Into Twitter Fight With Ex-Employee | Entrepreneur



The report said Twitter has consistently failed to reach its weekly sales projections, sometimes by as much as 30%, and that trajectory's unlikely to improve, per the documents and seven current and former Twitter employees. The company has predicted that U.S. ad revenue this month will drop at least 56% each week year over year.Former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino reportedly assumed the role of Twitter chief executive on Monday (earlier than expected, per The Information) and inherited the company's many significant problems, which include increasing hate speech and ads for online gambling and marijuana products, sources told the NYT.


That's a dealbreaker for many major advertisers: As of February, more than half of Twitter's top 1,000 advertisers before the acquisition had pulled their ads from the platform, per data from digital marketing analysis firm Pathmatics reported by Vox.Related: Twitter Rips Into Elon Musk for Poor-Quality Video | EntrepreneurTwitter's valuation has plunged since Musk bought the company for $44 billion in October, with ads making up 90% of its revenue.

It's a busy week in China as some of the biggest names in U.S. business are in town — Elon Musk, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, and Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan have all gone overseas.Dimon, who's there for a three-day JPMorgan summit in Shanghai, is hoping his visit will help smooth things over after he made a joke in 2021 that his company would outlast the Chinese Communist Party.""You're not going to fix these things if you are just sitting across the Pacific yelling at each other. So I'm hoping we have real engagement,"" he said at the conference this week.



Narasimhan is also in Shanghai for business meetings and announced that he's doubling down on plans to open another estimated 2,800 locations in China by the end of 2025, hoping that the country will become the coffee chain's biggest market.But all eyes have been on Musk, who arrived in style via private jet to Beijing on Tuesday before heading to Shanghai on Wednesday to check up on Tesla's factory and meet with staff members there, according to Reuters.


Musk is visiting the country for the first time in three years after pandemic-era restrictions hindered travel to the country, and the masses are happy to see him.Reuters also reported Musk is being called a ""global idol"" and ""Brother Ma,"" in reference to famed Chinese billionaire and businessman Jack Ma who co-founded Alibaba.Chinese social media and blogging site Weibo shows what appears to be a customized menu for dinner, along with Musk's arrival, who's seen entering the building with Chinese billionaire Zeng Yuqun, founder of battery manufacturer Contemporary Amperex Technology.Musk and Yuqun in Shanghai this week via WeiboThe menu at Man Fu Yan proudly displays Tesla's logo, featuring 16 courses and an homage to the electric car company calling it a ""dark horse, standing out from traditional automotive companies and making remarkable achievements.""The menu for Musk's dinner in Shanghai via WeiboTesla, which opened its Shanghai gigafactory in 2018, is set to begin construction on a battery factory at the same location by Q3 of 2023, with production estimated to reach completion by Q2 of 2024.Tesla's Megapack, a rechargeable battery energy storage device used at battery storage stations, will primarily be produced in the new facility.Musk did not post on social media about his visit overseas.

Elon Musk's company Neuralink announced late today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave it the green light to experiment with implanting brain chips in humans.

While other companies have used brain implants to assist people with debilitating medical conditions like paralysis and ALS, Neuralink's brain chips have only been used in monkeys.But that will soon change.



Musk has said, ""I think we have a chance with Neuralink to restore full-body functionality to someone who has a spinal cord injury."" But he and the company also want to take the technology a step further — maximizing the potential of healthy people to keep up with artificial intelligence.""We want to surpass able-bodied human performance with our technology,"" Neuralink tweeted last month.Related: Elon Musk's Neuralink Is Under Investigation for Allegedly Jeopardizing Human Safety'The future is going to be weird.'Musk said he envisions a world where patients can drop by clinics to have a chip surgically implanted into their brains by a robot. ""You'll be able to save and replay memories,"" he said at a show-and-tell presentation last year. ""The future is going to be weird.""


He also predicts customers will want to upgrade their brain chips to the latest models regularly.""I'm pretty sure you would not want the iPhone 1 stuck in your head if the iPhone 14 is available,"" Musk said.Musk is so confident that the devices are safe that he would be willing to implant them in his children.It is still unclear if the brain implants will pass the rigorous FDA trial stage. Still, the announcement is a significant step forward for Musk's business empire and brain-computer interface technology.

In late 2022, the San Francisco Department of Buildings launched an investigation into allegations Twitter had converted conference rooms into bedrooms. Now, city officials have opened a new investigation into the company for violating building codes after six former employees filed an explosive lawsuit against Elon Musk and the company, the San Francisco Chronicle reportedJoseph Killian, a plaintiff who was formerly the company's lead project manager of global design and construction, said Twitter CEO Elon Musk's team instructed him to violate building codes by disconnecting motion-sensitive lights and installing space heaters and door locks incapable of automatically unlocking in case of an emergency — all of which were violations of Twitter's lease and city safety standards.According to the lawsuit, when Killian told Musk's team that the cheaper locks Musk wanted to install would prevent ""first responders from being able to access the rooms"" in case of an emergency, ""nobody cared,"" and he quit that day.

If you're reading this while working remotely, Elon Musk is judging you.In a recent interview with CNBC, the tech CEO came down hard on work-from-home culture, saying he thinks it's ""morally wrong.""Musk, who told Tesla workers last year to return to the office or ""depart Tesla,"" has long been vocal about his belief that people are more productive in person. However, on Tuesday, he said it's not only about productivity, it's also a ""moral issue.""

Musk, also the CEO of SpaceX, said he believes people should ""put 40 hours in"" and that it doesn't ""necessarily need to be Monday through Friday."" He said he works seven days a week, and that days in a year where he does not put in ""some meaningful amount of work"" only add up to ""about two or three.""Despite Musk's opinion, in a 2022 Cisco survey, 78% of respondents said remote and hybrid work improved their overall well-being. Still, there is an argument for one glaring problem posed by remote work beyond the CEO's argument of productivity and morality: commercial real estate.Remote work has upended the commercial real estate industryAcross the U.S., nearly 20% of office spaces are vacant, and those numbers almost double in big cities like New York and San Francisco, where less than half of the cities' office spaces are occupied, according to property management company, Kastle Systems.The trouble with vacant buildings isn't just the eeriness they possess or the dust they collect, but the trillions in debt they potentially foreshadow. According to Morgan Stanley, nearly $1.5 trillion in commercial real estate debt will be due by the end of 2025, and a potential surge of loan defaults could be catastrophic for an already fragile banking system plagued by three bank failures in 2023 thus far.

Tesla held its annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday afternoon, and CEO Elon Musk said the company will make changes to its business practices, including the decision to begin advertising for the first time in its 20-year history.Following the meeting, Musk sat down for an interview with David Faber of CNBC, where the two chatted about how inflation and the recent rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve will impact Tesla.Musk said he expects it to be a ""tough 12 months ahead"" for ""everyone, not just Tesla.""Related: 'Think Carefully': Musk Issues Stark Warning About New Hires to Tesla Employees""You can think of raising the Fed rate as somewhat of a brake pedal on the economy, frankly,"" Musk said. ""It makes a lot of things more expensive – certainly things that are bought with credit. But then it has downstream effects even on things that aren't bought with credit … if the car payments or your home mortgage payment is absorbing more of your monthly budget, then you have less money to buy other things.""



Earlier this month, the Fed hiked interest rates for the 10th cycle in a row (by another 0.25 of a percentage point). As of Wednesday morning, rates sit in the range of 5%-5.25%.Musk also expressed his concerns and warned that the government most likely wouldn't be lowering rates anytime soon.""My concern with the way the Federal Reserve is making decisions is they're just operating with too much latency,"" Musk continued. ""Basically, the data is somewhat stale. The Federal Reserve was slow to raise interest rates, and now I think they're going be slow to lower them.""Related: Elon Musk Danced the Night Away at a Rave In Mexico After Appointing New Twitter CEO


Musk compared this ideology with how Tesla sets and adjusts its prices based on demand, noting that the company uses ""real-time information"" about orders placed on any given day.During the shareholder meeting, Musk touched on his bleak outlook for the economy in the year ahead, saying the car industry would be vastly impacted due to hiked interest rates but said it is important not to ""overreact.""""It is important to remember that there are good times and there are dark times, but then the good times follow the dark times,"" he told attendees on Tuesday. ""So my advice would be, don't look at the markets for the next 12 months. If there's a dip, buy the dip, and I think you will not be sorry.""Tesla came off a rough Q1 2023, finishing with a year-over-year net income loss of 24%.The electric car company was down just over 33.1% in a one-year period as of Wednesday morning.

Elon Musk has been known to lay down the hammer when it comes to his Tesla employees, whether it's requiring them to come into the office and encouraging them to leave if they do not comply or sending mass emails about productivity.Now, another leaked memo shows that Musk, who is CEO of Tesla, must directly approve of all potential employees before they can be formally offered a job at the electric car company.Related: Neon Lights, Fireworks and $90 Merch: Elon Musk Throws Massive 'Cyber Rodeo' Party at Tesla Factory Opening



""Think carefully before sending me a request,"" Musk penned to employees in an email viewed by Electrek. ""No one can join Tesla, even as a contractor, until you receive my email approval.""Musk also requested that the VPs of each department send him their requests for hiring weekly so that he can ""gain a better understanding"" of the hiring process at the company.


The new process will of course make the hiring process slower and more deliberate, with one anonymous employee telling CNBC that many Tesla workers inferred that the email meant a ""soft"" hiring freeze was imminent.Tesla saw several rounds of layoffs in 2022, which was a rough year for the electric car company as it saw its stock value plummet when Musk sold off large portions of his own shares to fund his acquisition of Twitter.Related: Elon Musk Brutally Tells Tesla Executives They Must Return to Offices 'Or Depart Tesla'However, after opening new gigafactories in Austin, Texas and Berlin, the company hired an estimated 28,565 new employees between 2021 and 2022.


Musk will now have plenty of time to dedicate to Tesla as he relieves himself of CEO duties at Twitter, announcing last week that former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino will be taking on the role.Tesla reported a year-over-year net income loss of 24% in Q1 2023, which the company attributed to an ""underutilization of new factories"" and higher costs for raw materials, among other things.Tesla's annual shareholder meeting is expected to begin at 4 p.m. EST on Tuesday at Tesla's gigafactory in Austin.The company was down over 31.6% year over year as of Tuesday morning.

Where's Elon? That's what government officials in the Virgin Islands want to know.On April 28, they tried to serve Tesla and Twitter CEO Elon Musk a subpoena for documents as part of a court case involving accused sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and mega-bank JPMorgan Chase. But the billionaire was nowhere to be found.""The Government contacted Mr. Musk's counsel via email to ask if he would be authorized to accept service on Mr. Musk's behalf in this matter but did not receive a response confirming or denying his authority,"" officials said in a court filing earlier today at the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.



According to CNN, the Virgin Islands government has had so much trouble tracking down Musk they've had to hire an investigative firm.Musk isn't being accused of any crimes. But the Virgin Islands attorney general's office wants him to share ""all communications between Musk and JPMorgan regarding Epstein or any role the disgraced financier played in the Tesla CEO's financial management,"" said CNN.


Related: 'You're Going Way Back In Time': Bill Gates Gets Visibly Irritated When Pressed on EpsteinVirgin Islands vs. JPMorgan ChaseThe Musk subpoena is the latest move in a high-stakes lawsuit filed by the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands against JPMorgan Chase. The territory alleges that the bank ""turned a blind eye"" to evidence that Jeffrey Epstein used JPMorgan to ease sex-trafficking activities on his private island, Little St. James, until his suicide in 2019.The complaint says that its investigation ""revealed that JPMorgan knowingly, negligently, and unlawfully provided and pulled the levers through which recruiters and victims were paid and was indispensable to the operation and concealment of the Epstein trafficking enterprise.""JPMorgan Chase has denied any wrongdoing and said it will vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit.


What does any of this have to do with Elon Musk? According to Reuters, Musk may have introduced Epstein to his contacts at JPMorgan. Now the Virgin Islands wants to understand the nature of their relationship better.At press time, Musk had not responded to requests for comment.

The Metaverse, once the hottest idea in tech, is headed to the industry's graveyard of failed fads.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. The Metaverse, the once-buzzy technology that promised to allow users to hang out awkwardly in a disorientating video-game-like world, has died after being abandoned by the business world. It was three years old.The capital-M Metaverse, a descendant of the 1982 movie ""Tron"" and the 2003 video game ""Second Life,"" was born in 2021 when Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg changed the name of his trillion-dollar company to Meta. After a much-heralded debut, the Metaverse became the obsession of the tech world and a quick hack to win over Wall Street investors. The hype could not save the Metaverse, however, and a lack of coherent vision for the product ultimately led to its decline. Once the tech industry turned to a new, more promising trend — generative AI — the fate of the Metaverse was sealed.



The Metaverse is now headed to the tech industry's graveyard of failed ideas. But the short life and ignominious death of the Metaverse offers a glaring indictment of the tech industry that birthed it.Grand promiseFrom the moment of its delivery, Zuckerberg claimed that the Metaverse would be the future of the internet. The glitzy, spurious promotional video that accompanied Zuckerberg's name-change announcement described a future where we'd be able to interact seamlessly in virtual worlds: Users would ""make eye contact"" and ""feel like you're right in the room together."" The Metaverse offered people the chance to engage in an ""immersive"" experience, he claimed.


These grandiose promises heaped sky-high expectations on the Metaverse. The media swooned over the newborn concept: The Verge published a nearly 5,000-word-long interview with Zuckerberg immediately following the announcement — in which the writer called it ""an expansive, immersive vision of the internet."" Glowing profiles of the Metaverse seemed to set it on a laudatory path, but the actual technology failed to deliver on this promise throughout its short life. A wonky virtual-reality interview with the CBS host Gayle King, where low-quality cartoon avatars of both King and Zuckerberg awkwardly motioned to each other, was a stark contrast to the futuristic vistas shown in Meta's splashy introductory video.The Metaverse also suffered from an acute identity crisis. A functional business proposition requires a few things to thrive and grow: a clear use case, a target audience, and the willingness of customers to adopt the product. Zuckerberg waxed poetic about the Metaverse as ""a vision that spans many companies'' and ""the successor to the mobile internet,"" but he failed to articulate the basic business problems that the Metaverse would address. The concept of virtual worlds where users interact with each other using digital avatars is an old one, going back as far as the late 1990s with massively multiplayer online role-player games, such as ""Meridian 59,"" ""Ultimate Online,"" and ""EverQuest."" And while the Metaverse supposedly built on these ideas with new technology, Zuckerberg's one actual product — the VR platform Horizon Worlds, which required the use of an incredibly clunky Oculus headset — failed to suggest anything approaching a road map or a genuine vision. In spite of the Metaverse's arrested conceptual development, a pliant press published statements about the future of the technology that were somewhere between unrealistic and outright irresponsible. The CNBC host Jim Cramer nodded approvingly when Zuckerberg claimed that 1 billion people would use the Metaverse and spend hundreds of dollars there, despite the Meta CEO's inability to say what people would receive in exchange for their cash or why anyone would want to strap a clunky headset to their face to attend a low-quality, cartoon concert.A high-flying lifeThe inability to define the Metaverse in any meaningful way didn't get in the way of its ascension to the top of the business world. In the months following the Meta announcement, it seemed that every company had a Metaverse product on offer, despite it not being obvious what it was or why they should.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella would say at the company's 2021 Ignite Conference that he couldn't ""overstate how much of a breakthrough"" the Metaverse was for his company, the industry, and the world. Roblox, an online game platform that has existed since 2004, rode the Metaverse hype wave to an initial public offering and a $41 billion valuation. Of course, the cryptocurrency industry took the ball and ran with it: The people behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT company conned the press into believing that uploading someone's digital monkey pictures into VR would be the key to ""master the Metaverse."" Other crypto pumpers even successfully convinced people that digital land in the Metaverse would be the next frontier of real-estate investment. Even businesses that seemed to have little to do with tech jumped on board. Walmart joined the Metaverse. Disney joined the Metaverse.


Despite Zuckerberg's obsession with the Metaverse, the tech never lived up to the hype. FacebookCompanies' rush to get into the game led Wall Street investors, consultants, and analysts to try to one up each other's projections for the Metaverse's growth. The consulting firm Gartner claimed that 25% of people would spend at least one hour a day in the Metaverse by 2026. The Wall Street Journal said the Metaverse would change the way we work forever. The global consulting firm McKinsey predicted that the Metaverse could generate up to ""$5 trillion in value,"" adding that around 95% of business leaders expected the Metaverse to ""positively impact their industry"" within five to 10 years. Not to be outdone, Citi put out a massive report that declared the Metaverse would be a $13 trillion opportunity.A brutal downfallIn spite of all this hype, the Metaverse did not lead a healthy life. Every single business idea or rosy market projection was built on the vague promises of a single CEO. And when people were actually offered the opportunity to try it out, nobody actually used the Metaverse.


Decentraland, the most well-funded, decentralized, crypto-based Metaverse product (effectively a wonky online world you can ""walk"" around), only had around 38 daily active users in its ""$1.3 billion ecosystem."" Decentraland would dispute this number, claiming that it had 8,000 daily active users — but that's still only a fraction of the number of people playing large online games like ""Fortnite."" Meta's much-heralded efforts similarly struggled: By October 2022, Mashable reported that Horizon Worlds had less than 200,000 monthly active users — dramatically short of the 500,000 target Meta had set for the end of 2022. The Wall Street Journal reported that only about 9% of user-created worlds were visited by more than 50 players, and The Verge said that it was so buggy that even Meta employees eschewed it. Despite the might of a then-trillion-dollar company, Meta could not convince people to use the product it had staked its future on.The Metaverse fell seriously ill as the economy slowed and the hype around generative AI grew. Microsoft shuttered its virtual-workspace platform AltSpaceVR in January 2023, laid off the 100 members of its ""industrial metaverse team,"" and made a series of cuts to its HoloLens team. Disney shuttered its Metaverse division in March, and Walmart followed suit by ending its Roblox-based Metaverse projects. The billions of dollars invested and the breathless hype around a half-baked concept led to thousands — if not tens of thousands — of people losing their jobs.But the Metaverse was officially pulled off life support when it became clear that Zuckerberg and the company that launched the craze had moved on to greener financial pastures. Zuckerberg declared in a March update that Meta's ""single largest investment is advancing AI and building it into every one of our products."" Meta's chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, told CNBC in April that he, along with Mark Zuckerberg and the company's chief product officer, Chris Cox, were now spending most of their time on AI. The company has even stopped pitching the Metaverse to advertisers, despite spending more than $100 billion in research and development on its mission to be ""Metaverse first."" While Zuckerberg may suggest that developing games for the Quest headsets is some sort of investment, the writing is on the wall: Meta is done with the Metaverse.Did anyone learn their lesson?While the idea of virtual worlds or collective online experiences may live on in some form, the Capital-M Metaverse is dead. It was preceded in death by a long line of tech fads like Web3 and Google Glass. It is survived by newfangled ideas like the aforementioned generative AI and the self-driving car. Despite this long lineage of disappointment, let's be clear: The death of the Metaverse should be remembered as arguably one of the most historic failures in tech history.


I do not believe that Mark Zuckerberg ever had any real interest in ""the Metaverse,"" because he never seemed to define it beyond a slightly tweaked Facebook with avatars and cumbersome hardware. It was the means to an increased share price, rather than any real vision for the future of human interaction. And Zuckerberg used his outsize wealth and power to get the whole of the tech industry and a good portion of the American business world into line behind this half-baked idea.The fact that Mark Zuckerberg has clearly stepped away from the Metaverse is a damning indictment of everyone who followed him, and anyone who still considers him a visionary tech leader. It should also be the cause for some serious reflection among the venture-capital community, which recklessly followed Zuckerberg into blowing billions of dollars on a hype cycle founded on the flimsiest possible press-release language. In a just world, Mark Zuckerberg should be fired as CEO of Meta (in the real world, this is actually impossible).Zuckerberg misled everyone, burned tens of billions of dollars, convinced an industry of followers to submit to his quixotic obsession, and then killed it the second that another idea started to interest Wall Street. There is no reason that a man who has overseen the layoffs of tens of thousands of people should run a major company. There is no future for Meta with Mark Zuckerberg at the helm: It will stagnate, and then it will die and follow the Metaverse into the proverbial grave.Ed Zitron is the CEO of EZPR, a national tech and business public-relations agency.

108,Elon Musk Calls San Francisco 'Post-Apocalyptic' as Another Major Retailer Leaves Due to Crime,"May 5, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/elon-musk-says-downtown-san-francisco-feels/451069,"
Elon Musk said downtown San Francisco ""feels post-apocalyptic"" in a recent tweet.Musk's comment was in reply to a Twitter thread discussing the news that Nordstrom would be closing both of its stores in downtown San Francisco by August. The company stated that while it was a tough decision, the ""dynamics"" of the area have ""changed dramatically."" The announcement came just weeks after Whole Foods closed its downtown location after only being open for a year.""So many stores shuttered in downtown SF. Feels post-apocalyptic,"" he tweeted, followed by another tweet: ""The philosophy that led to this bleak outcome will be the end of civilization if extended to the world.""



So many stores shuttered in downtown SF. Feels post-apocalyptic.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 4, 2023Since 2020, at least 20 retailers have shuttered business in San Francisco's downtown area, 11 of which closed in 2023 alone, according to The San Francisco Standard.


Musk hasn't been shy about sharing his feelings about San Francisco, where the Twitter headquarters are located. In April, the tech CEO tweeted that one could film an episode of The Walking Dead ""unedited"" in downtown San Francisco.You could literally film a Walking Dead episode unedited in downtown SF.This is where San Francisco politics leads and Twitter was exporting this self-destructive mind virus to the world.With some exceptions, other tech companies are still doing so.Evil in guise of good.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 1, 2023Just a few days later, in the wake of Cash App founder Bob Lee's murder, Musk called violent crime in the city ""horrific"" — which was later met with backlash by District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, who called his statements ""reckless and irresponsible,"" as Lee was murdered by someone he knew, and was not a random act of violence.Related: A Suspect Has Been Arrested in Killing of Cash App Founder Bob Lee


""Statements like those contained in Mr. Musk's tweet that assumed incorrect circumstances about Mr. Lee's death served to mislead the world in their perceptions of San Francisco,"" Jenkins said in a statement, per NBC Bay Area.While violent crime in San Francisco is relatively low, instances of robbery and theft occur in the thousands each year, according to city police data. It also ranked second as the city most affected by organized retail crime in 2021 and 2020, according to a 2022 survey by the National Retail Federation.

Twitter users and haters alike have had no problem airing their grievances about the changes that have come to the platform since Tesla CEO Elon Musk took over late last year.Though Musk stands by his claims that the sweeping changes he's made, such as removing legacy blue checkmarks for verified profiles and allowing Twitter Blue subscribers to edit their Tweets after they've been posted, are improvements for the better, he's now being roasted for seemingly taking a step backward with Twitter's newest livestreaming feature.Related: Elon Musk Is Forcing Twitter Blue Verification on Certain PeopleThe billionaire tested the new feature on Wednesday by broadcasting a livestream to his 138 million Twitter followers.However, users quickly noticed that the stream was pixelated and low-resolution throughout the entirety of the 4-minute and 26-second live video. ""We're just testing the live video feature so we can see if it works, and we can modify it accordingly,"" Musk says during the stream.He and another Twitter employee confirm in the video that the code they're using to power the livestream comes from the 2015 code for Periscope, a livestreaming app that was acquired by Twitter before its official independent launch and was discontinued in 2021.Musk's stream reached a peak of roughly 150,000 live viewers before the video crashed and ended, though the clip, which now lives on his Twitter profile, has since been viewed more than 9.2 million times.Many Twitter users reposted Musk's stream and lamented the poor quality of the video.



Ok. Here's my prediction. If Elon starts getting the hang of live-streaming Internet will break. But it will probably no longer be with 8-bit Twitter livestreams.
