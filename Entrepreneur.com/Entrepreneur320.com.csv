0,Bankruptcy Isn't a Sign of Failure — It's a Strategy. Here's Why It Might Be The Right Move For You.,"Mar 29, 2024",Gene Marks,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/bankruptcy-isnt-a-sign-of-failure-its-a-strategy/469975,"
When it comes to bankruptcies in the U.S., there's good news and bad news.The good news is that 2023 was the third-lowest year for bankruptcy filings and 42% below the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. Excluding 2021 and 2022 — where many businesses received pandemic-related assistance — bankruptcies were at the lowest historic levels since 1997.But the bad news is that they're on the rise. According to data from the global legal consulting firm Epiq AACER and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, bankruptcy filings in the U.S. increased by about 17 to 18% in 2023 compared to the prior year, with January marking ""18 consecutive months that total, individual, and commercial bankruptcy filings have registered monthly year-over-year increases."" And the actual numbers could very well be higher when you consider the unreported number of small business owners who shutter their doors, settle their debts (or not) and walk away from their firms without making any formal filings.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Ray Cao, a Gen Z seller on StockX, an online marketplace and sneaker reseller. Image Credit: Courtesy of Ray CaoWhat was your day job when you started your side hustle, and why were you interested in entrepreneurship?I was a student working as a part-time barista earning about $8 an hour (minimum wage at the time) at a bubble tea store in New York City. My family had gotten into $200,000 worth of debt from speculative investments and gambling. We were desperate to the point where my parents borrowed from relatives to get by. This put an obvious strain on the relationship between them, and my family would quickly become the topic of untoward gossip. I was ashamed, scared and insecure. I eventually cultivated these feelings of vulnerability into action and dove into entrepreneurship.



When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?I started the side hustle in 2015 when I had just turned 18. Sneaker and streetwear culture was growing popular, and demand for these coveted brands trended higher. I heard from my friend that this would be a lucrative business opportunity, and we both pursued it. My inspiration for starting and continuing this business was always my immigrant family.Related: I Was a 25-Year-Old Nurse When I Started a Side Hustle to Combat Anxiety. It Made $1 Million in 7 Months — Then Sold for a Life-Changing Amount.


Throughout my childhood and adolescence, I grew to understand that I was much poorer than my peers. My parents were seamstresses and worked around the clock to support the family. My mom would tell me that she only earned a dime for each fabric she had sewn together, totaling only $200 weekly. Even my late grandma would spend her days picking up bottles and cans to recycle for five cents per piece. My parents and grandma navigated their lives here through sacrifice, cultural disparity and language differences. To this day, their story continues to fuel my ambitions and keeps me progressing.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I joined online communities and forums (Reddit, Facebook, NikeTalk) to conduct research and opened a bank account and card to purchase online drops. Eventually, I bought my first item, Supreme Air Jordan Desert Camo 5s (2015), for $225 and sold them locally for a $400 profit.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?As college progressed and my finance career came into focus, I didn't have the energy to grind through the manual labor required for the business (sorting through incoming inventory, shipping outbound orders, conducting quality checks and dealing with returns from purchases and sales). I automated the business through Excel spreadsheets and worked with my parents to facilitate the day-to-day operations. During this time, I also gained access to store inventory at the StockX warehouse. This dramatically reduced my active work time and involvement to 10 hours a month. Everything I needed to manage the business could now be done from my laptop anywhere in the world.Related: Access our best side hustle stories and make more money. Subscribe to Entrepreneur+ now.


As my available capital increased, a new challenge sprouted: order sizing. For example, with $1,000 and a hype release, it was easy to size my order — as much as I could afford. When that available capital increases a hundredfold or a thousandfold, things become more complex. I remember placing a roughly $10,000 order for the Nike Blazer Mid 77 Vintage White Black. About the first 30 sold at a 15% premium, but demand dried up as I flooded the market with available pairs. I lost about $3,000 and quickly learned the importance of order sizing and liquidity.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?During the early growth stages, monthly revenue trended closely with the amount of capital that was readily available. As the business matured, monthly revenues in the past two years peaked at a little under $20,000.What does total revenue look like now?I've earned about $1.53 million in total revenue on StockX.What do you enjoy most about this side hustle?I enjoy the hands-off nature of this business because it allows me to simultaneously progress my finance career (whether it's a new business venture or another corporate gig). The network of partners and relationships I've built along the way is invaluable, and so is being surrounded by so many smart individuals — special shoutout to the StockX team!

Your network is a major barrier to growth, so take every opportunity to show potential partners the value you can bring them. Good information is valuable and scarce: Conduct your market research within small niche communities and build connections organically.

2,"How I Taught Myself to Be Financially Secure — and How You Can Do It, Too.","Mar 19, 2024","Dr. Brandy Zachary, DC, IFMCP",https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-i-taught-myself-financial-literacy-and-how-you-can/470302,"
The pursuit of financial security is a universal aspiration, regardless of profession or background. While achieving financial well-being may appear daunting, it is a journey that can be navigated with the right mindset, knowledge and strategies.This is a straightforward account of my experiences, the financial lessons I've learned the hard way and the personal realizations that have shaped my understanding of money. Let's get real — not having enough money goes beyond numbers in your bank account. It's an emotionally draining burden that feels stressful and, at times, is almost too much to bear.This isn't your exhaustive guide to all things financial; life's too complex for that. I'll break down some specific layers that lie deep within us and shape our perception of finances: things like childhood programming, societal expectations, the subtle art of self-sabotage and your relationship with money.



Related: 5 Entrepreneurial Mindset Principles That Empower Financial Literacy1. Breaking the chains of limiting beliefsFor many years, I proudly embraced the belief that money was beneath me. As an idealist, a creative spirit and a healer, discussing money was crass. Little did I realize that by keeping this belief, I was inadvertently causing myself years of stress, overspending and being taken advantage of.


I realized that the journey toward financial security often begins with confronting and dismantling limiting beliefs about money. These beliefs, often formed in childhood or reinforced by societal expectations, can act as invisible barriers, hindering our progress.Common limiting beliefs include:""I'm not good with money.""""Making money is hard.""""Wealthy people are bad.""""I don't deserve financial abundance.""Harboring limiting beliefs about money can lead you down a path of negative financial behaviors. These beliefs, often formed in childhood or reinforced by societal expectations, can hold you back from achieving financial security. They can manifest as avoiding budgeting, overspending and neglecting financial planning, ultimately hindering your progress. The first step towards financial empowerment is recognizing these limiting beliefs and their potential consequences. Once you become aware of them, you can challenge these beliefs and replace them with empowering perspectives. Now, I advocate for open and honest conversations about money, by which we can dismantle the stigma that surrounds financial discussions and empower ourselves and others to make informed financial decisions.Tips:


Self-reflection: Engage in journaling or introspection to identify your ingrained beliefs about money. Ask yourself questions like, ""What messages did I receive about money growing up?"" or ""How do I feel when I think about money?""Fact-checking: Once you've identified your limiting beliefs, research and challenge their validity. Seek information from reputable sources such as government agencies, financial institutions or trusted financial professionals.Positive affirmations: Replace negative thoughts with empowering affirmations. Instead of ""I'm not good with money,"" tell yourself, ""I am actively learning to manage my finances effectively.""Seek guidance: Consider enrolling in financial literacy workshops, online courses or seeking guidance from financial advisors or mentors.2. Empower yourself with financial literacyFinancial literacy is the foundation of informed financial decision-making. According to the Journal of Economic Education, individuals with higher levels of financial literacy tend to make better financial decisions, leading to improved financial well-being. Never fall into the trap of believing that making ""just a little"" money is enough because it hinders personal growth and the ability to make a meaningful impact on the world with the resources you have.Related: Top 5 Tools to Help Improve Your Financial LiteracyHow to build your financial toolkitBudgeting: Track the budget that is suitable for your income and expenses through budget-tracking apps. These tools can help you categorize your spending, identify areas for improvement and allocate funds toward savings and debt repayment.Goal setting: Define both short-term and long-term financial goals. This could include saving for a down payment on a house, funding your child's education or building a comfortable retirement nest egg. Having clear goals provides direction and motivation for your financial planning.


Understanding financial products: Explore different investment vehicles like stocks, bonds, mutual funds and real estate. Don't forget to consider your risk tolerance, financial goals and investment timeframe. Seek professional guidance from a financial advisor if needed.Debt management: Develop a debt repayment plan that prioritizes high-interest debts and creates a strategy to pay them off efficiently. Consider debt consolidation or refinancing options, if applicable.3. Invest in yourselfThe most valuable investment you can make is in yourself. This goes beyond formal education and encompasses continuous learning, skill development and personal growth. Individuals who invest in their skills through training and immersion experience higher earnings and career advancement. So, don't downplay your worth. You can get that higher-paying role and start your own practice, shaped by hours that suit you and by honing your skills. Commit to yourself and embody an entrepreneurial mindset.What I've learned is that you cannot save your way out of debt or budget your way to becoming wealthy. You won't find the right job to end your financial woes. I've tried them all, and by far, the best way to make more money is by investing in yourself and harnessing the true power of knowledge. Dedicate time and effort to self-improvement, ultimately becoming your own financial powerhouse.


Related: 5 Ways You Can Become More Financially StableI've lived through all of the scenarios mentioned above. I've witnessed the extremes of financial experiences, from amassing wealth to hitting rock bottom and relying on Social Security Disability Insurance. Life threw major challenges my way, demanding a complete restart and reinvention. What became glaringly evident to me was that the actual money itself had little to do with the outcomes. It was more about me — where I stood in my growth journey and what I believed was possible.As cliche as it may sound, financial security is really a continuous journey. It requires commitment, discipline and consistent effort. By actively challenging limiting beliefs, acquiring financial knowledge, investing in yourself and making informed financial decisions, you can build a solid foundation for a secure financial future.Remember to cultivate a growth mindset, believing in your ability to learn, adapt and improve your financial situation. View challenges as opportunities for growth and consider seeking professional guidance who can tailor strategies to your specific needs and goals if needed. Celebrate your big and small wins to stay motivated and prioritize long-term goals by practicing delayed gratification and living within your means.

        Rowley recognized a gap in the market when it came to aesthetically pleasing baby gear — like wraps. 
      


        She bought a few thousand dollars worth of fabric and a used serger and opened an Etsy shop, then got to work.

Elle Rowley.When did you start Solly Baby as a side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?



After having my first baby in 2009, I was surprised to find a surge of creative inspiration that I had never known before having kids. My husband was still in school, and I was hungry to start something to supplement our meager student income. By the time I was pregnant with our second child in 2011, the online world was fertile ground for mothers looking to start a side hustle from home. I tried a few different things, but I intuitively knew that there was a gap in the market when it came to aesthetically pleasing baby gear, so I was pretty focused on that space throughout my pregnancy.I loved wearing my first baby, and I'd heard that wraps were the most comfortable way to wear an infant, so being industrious and broke, I made two wraps out of cheap jersey knit fabric — one for me and one for a friend who was also pregnant. While my crude prototype was far from what the product became, I could see the potential for this long piece of fabric to actually be a fashion accessory for the wearer rather than ""baby gear."" What really sealed it, though, was the first time I timidly ventured out holding my toddler's hand and carrying my baby wrapped on my chest. Before we left the front porch, he was asleep and breathing deeply on my chest. The increase in confidence that I felt with each step was palpable. I felt liberated, and at the same time, I'd never felt more connected to my baby. I knew I was on to something.


What were some of the first steps you took to get the side hustle off the ground?I found a fabric supplier in the fabric district of Los Angeles, purchased a few thousand dollars worth of fabric (thanks to credit cards and a loan from my in-laws), bought a used serger on Craigslist for $50 and opened an Etsy shop. Then, I got to work mostly when my babies were sleeping. I turned our house into a factory to make the first 50 wraps. I signed up for every local handmade market that I could find, which didn't garner great sales results, but the feedback I received from people in real life was invaluable. Lastly, in a decision that felt reckless at the time because of the cost, I hired my favorite photographer to take photos of me wearing my son. I had a nice camera and could have ""made-do"" on my own, but I knew that having beautiful images would help compensate for the many other areas where the brand was weak.Image Credit: Courtesy of Solly BabyWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building the business, and how did you navigate them?


Growth is expensive: I had no capital other than the $4,000 loan for fabric, and finance is not my area of expertise, so I knew I would need a very cash flow-positive business model. In the first three years, it was very challenging to finance our growth, but I can see what a gift it was now to have that constraint. Because we had no factoring terms with our suppliers or credit lines, we'd have to pay a hefty deposit on our production when we submitted the purchase order. Then, we'd pay the remainder of the balance upon completion. This made growth slow, and we were constantly underselling. As demand for the product grew, we started placing everything on preorder on our website, which gave us enough to pay for the order. This made it so our customers were essentially funding our growth.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the business bring in at that point?Sales had been growing year over year in 2013, but we were still only grossing a few hundred thousand dollars a year and taking home less than $100,000. Daily sales were still very inconsistent, which made it difficult to have a lot of confidence in hiring employees or even believing that this was anything more than a side hustle. I was hitting a wall of exhaustion when my husband and I made the leap of faith to bring him into Solly Baby with me. He'd finished school and was working with another startup, but we both felt his time would be better spent if we focused our efforts together. This shift immediately led to new growth and vision. His help also freed me up to work more on the business rather than in the business. We then hired our first employee, Kortney, who took over customer service and fulfillment in a way that freed my husband and me up to focus on growth.Just weeks after hiring Kortney, and days before I had my third child in the spring of 2014, we released our spring collection, and the demand went through the roof. Sales went from anywhere between zero to $3,000 per day to $2,000 becoming our new daily baseline — and releases bringing in tens of thousands of dollars in a day. We hit $1 million in sales that November, and by the end of that year, we knew this was much more than a side hustle.


You've since turned your side hustle into a very successful business. What does revenue look like now?It's been amazing to experience the growth we have been able to achieve. To see this business grow from my house to an Etsy shop to reaching millions of mothers, parents and families is truly humbling. As we continued to build the team and find our footing in the market, some years, we saw revenue double year over year. Today, Solly Baby operates at $10 to 20 million in annual revenue.What's your favorite part about running Solly Baby? As a mother of four, connecting with, encouraging and providing products for postpartum mothers during a very transformational time of life has always been life-giving work for me. It will never get old to meet a mother or father who says, ""Your wraps changed my relationship with my baby."" Knowing that our products have the power to change the trajectory of a parent-child relationship is deeply rewarding.


Developing company culture and ethos was also very rewarding. I made our company motto ""small things with great love"" several years ago because I hold a deep belief that small things done thoughtfully create the biggest and best things. This is relevant to growing a business and equally relevant to raising children. Seeing this adopted and trickle down into every part of the company as CEO felt very meaningful.What does your routine look like these days? Are there any helpful habits you'd recommend to other entrepreneurs?Keeping a daily routine is my best advice. I am a big believer in getting up before your kids (unless you have an infant — then sleep as much as you can!), exercising, getting ready for the day and taking at least 30 minutes for spiritual or meditative practice.It was easy in the early days to completely neglect myself to meet the needs of my family and the business, but I strongly believe that we would've grown faster and with more intention had I taken better care of myself from the beginning. I was running on empty all of the time, and it just about broke me in the first two years. What's more is that the business was not stronger because of my ""sacrifices."" I became very depressed and anxious and finally shared this with my husband. We made a self-care plan together, and everything quickly improved in my life, personally and professionally.


What's your best advice for others hoping to start a successful business of their own? We're often encouraged to ""think big"" when it comes to business, but sometimes, thinking ""small"" is the perfect way to begin — mainly because it will get you to begin. I don't think I would have had the confidence to start a multi-million dollar, global company at the age of 25, but I didn't need to. I just needed enough confidence to make the first 50 wraps to help pay the rent and a sincere desire to bring mothers and babies closer through the product. That was all I needed to get the ball rolling, and then my confidence and vision expanded with the company. We kind of grew up together, Solly Baby and me.This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

4,Struggling to Get a Bank Loan for Your Small Business? Try This Flexible Financing Option Instead.,"Mar 13, 2024",Joseph Camberato,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/cant-get-a-bank-loan-for-your-small-business-try-this/470462,"
Increasingly, small businesses are turning to private credit to fund business expansions or ongoing operational costs. Private credit accounted for roughly 30% of the credit market in 2021, growing from $400 billion in assets to over $1 trillion since 2012.This type of financing usually comes with flexible terms, customized solutions and fast access to capital. So, if your company needs funding but you don't want to apply for a traditional bank loan, here's how private credit works and how you can access it.Related: How Alternative Funding Solutions Can Help Your Business Navigate The Ongoing Financial Storm



What is private credit?The term private credit usually refers to non-bank loans issued to businesses — peer-to-peer lenders, online lenders and financing marketplaces are all examples of this. This financing option has been especially helpful for small businesses recently, considering banks aren't lending to businesses due to market conditions and their notorious risk-averse behavior.Private credit gives companies access to various short-term and long-term financing options. Your company can then use this financing to fund startup costs, a business expansion or working capital.


Benefits of private creditHere are the biggest benefits of private credit for small businesses:Fast access to capital: When you apply for a bank loan, the application process can take weeks to months to process. In comparison, loans from non-bank lenders typically take less than a week. Some lenders even offer same-day financing. This is a huge advantage for businesses that need to act quickly on a business opportunity.Flexible financing: Private credit is also more flexible when it comes to the collateral requirements and repayment terms.High approval rate: Banks prefer lending to larger, more established companies. Non-bank loans have a much higher rate of approval for small and medium-sized businesses.Custom solutions: Since non-bank lenders have experience working with small businesses, they can provide custom financing solutions to meet your company's needs. For example, some lenders offer asset-based financing where the loan is secured by the company's assets.Related: This Non-Traditional Financing Solution Lends Money to People Rejected By BanksHow small businesses can access private creditHere are the steps you'll take to evaluate your situation, find the right lender and successfully access financing.Determine your needs:Start by determining why you need financing and what you plan to use the funds for. For example, are you taking out a loan to cover daily expenses, like payroll or inventory? Or do you want to purchase new equipment to increase your production or improve efficiency?


Evaluating your current and future lending needs will help you determine the type of financing you're looking for. For example, if you have a good idea of how much you're looking to spend, taking out a loan might make sense. But if you're unsure how much money you'll need, you may want to opt for a line of credit.Prepare the necessary documentsIt's a good idea to gather the necessary paperwork before applying for private credit. The specific requirements will vary depending on your lenders, but most will want to see the following information:Business information: Not all lenders require a business plan, but you'll have to provide some basic information about your business. At the very least, you'll need to provide your company's name, address and employer identification number (EIN).Financial statements: You'll also need to provide financial statements like a profit and loss statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement. This information helps your lender understand the financial health of your business.Tax returns: Most lenders will want to see at least one year of personal and business tax returns. Tax returns help your lender evaluate your financial situation and your ability to repay the loan.Bank statements: You'll also need to provide at least six months of bank statements.Business documents: Your lender will also want to see your business's articles of incorporation and any relevant business licenses.Compare your offersIt's always a good idea to get pre-approved with several different lenders before selecting the one you want to go with. Applying with a minimum of three different lenders lets you compare the potential interest rates, fees and repayment terms. It also gives you more negotiation power because you're not putting yourself in a situation where you have to take the first offer that comes your way.


Of course, submitting multiple loan applications can become tedious and take up quite a bit of your time. If you need a quicker solution, consider using an online lending marketplace. When you use a lending marketplace, you'll apply once and receive offers from multiple lenders.Related: 4 Reasons Small Businesses Need Nonbank Lenders More Than EverIf you're looking for alternatives to bank loans, private credit is an excellent option. These loans are more accessible and give your company the resources it needs to continue growing.When you take out private credit, you may gain access to support that goes beyond the application process. But it's important to look for the right non-bank lenders. National Business Capital has been working in private credit for 15 years; We're already an expert in this market.

      Key Takeaways    



        I make $125,000 working at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
      


        I own consulting agency Juntero Design, which began as a side hustle.
      


        I'm passionate about Juntero's new subscription-based model, which provides a range of services for a fixed rate.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Chisom Okwulehie, who started consulting agency Juntero as a side hustle when she was an employee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The piece has been edited for length and clarity. In 2017, I started working at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, where I design and manage infrastructure projects. At the height of the pandemic in 2020, I'd had my first child and was told we wouldn't receive a merit-based pay increase at work, so I wanted to find ways to supplement my income. My father always told me and my siblings that if your spouse dies, you have to be able to cover the mortgage and support your family. I'm a big advocate for diversified income.So, I started Juntero as a side hustle with my husband. Now, it's a corporation that we co-own, split into two subsidiary companies or studios: Juntero Design and Juntero Technology. My husband owns Juntero Technology; I own Juntero Design. Today, Juntero is a full-fledged design and technology business, but it all started with me taking on small projects on different platforms and charging as little as $20.



Back then, I watched a lot of YouTube tutorials to prepare and experimented with my different talents — web design, photo editing, graphic design, architecture design and interior design. People gravitated towards my architecture and interior design services. Initially, I kept my prices low to build a portfolio and accumulate strong testimonials. That credibility is the greatest currency and helped me increase my visibility; for every 10 pieces of positive feedback, I'd raise my hourly rate by $20. Eventually, I learned not to trade my time for money and switched to fixed rates.Related: At 23, She Started a Side Hustle for 'Quick Money.'

I made about $55,000 that year, and over $200,000 the next. Then, in 2023, I exceeded $400,000.Then, near the end of 2021, I realized that I couldn't help as many clients as I wanted, so I had to put my ego aside and trust other people. I started hiring other designers on a project-based model. They're not employees; they're contractors. So, since 2022, I've outsourced more than 90% of the work. That helped me scale the business even more. I made about $55,000 that year and over $200,000 the next. Then, in 2023, I exceeded $400,000.At Port Authority, my salary is $125,000.

Also, I learn so much from my colleagues' expertise.Now that I'm not on the production side of Juntero, I spend more time on marketing and client management. We have two payment structures: a one-time payment model and a subscription-based model. I've spent a lot of time marketing the subscription model. It's an idea that came to me last year. One of my major clients is a developer, so with the subscription model, she can pay the monthly rate and access our services for a range of tasks.

And it helps these businesses scale, too. One of my clients uses my renderings to consistently sell multimillion-dollar homes over the asking price. With the subscription model, these companies can have five people doing the work for the salary of one; for instance, a marketer could hire a designer at $100,000 a year or enroll with my service and see even more output.

        Gooljar began arranging the flowers his roommate brought home from Trader Joe's in 2020.
      


        He grew the IRIS blossom Instagram account to more than 40,000 followers and has made over $500,000 in just a few years. 
      


        Gooljar is on a mission to keep growing and lift up other diverse creators along the way.
      












""I've always been an artist,"" Rob Gooljar, founder of IRIS blossom, says. ""I've always been a creative person. I've done a lot of mixed media, painting, drawing, music, photography, but my medium shifted to floral.""In 2020, Gooljar was struggling with depression while working toward his Ph.D. in urban, social and economic geography, and he credits his then-roommate Becca Whittier as ""the catalyst"" for his new creative outlet. Whittier would bring flowers home from Trader Joe's, and Gooljar would arrange them.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom



Arranging flowers became a passion, and Gooljar decided to start an Instagram to bring others along on his artistic journey, especially those who might feel excluded from an industry known for lacking diversity. The average florist in the U.S. is 47 years old, and most of them are women (77.2%) and white (77.3%), according to data from Zippia.With his social media platform, Gooljar put out the kind of representation he wanted to see: ""Hey, I'm a queer Black florist — kind of, not really. I'm just playing with flowers, but watch me, and let's see what happens.""


What happened was IRIS blossom, named for Gooljar's rescue pitbull Iris, turned into a successful business.Related: For Years, This Black Founder Learned an Uncommon But Essential Craft on the Side. Now His Creations Are Beloved By Celebrity Chefs — and Can Sell for More Than $1,000.People saw Gooljar's posts on the Instagram account, which grew from zero to more than 40,000 followers, and began asking to buy arrangements. In the past three-and-a-half years, the self-funded company has fulfilled thousands of orders and made more than $500,000 — but it's just the beginning.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossomGooljar is expanding IRIS blossom to South Florida, where he moved last year, while Whittier and two employees continue to helm the company's operations in Greater Charlotte. Meanwhile, he's working with another business partner, Jihann Hanchell, to get IRIS blossom's sister business, island IRIS, off the ground in Turks and Caicos. The idea there is to offer ""full-scale design"" for luxury events.""He was really kind, but looked at me and was like, 'Well, you're not going to get a business loan.'""Gooljar isn't entering into these floral ventures ""blindly,"" he notes. He also has a holding company and a consulting firm. Still, despite Gooljar's entrepreneurial savvy and IRIS's track record of success and growth, its journey hasn't been without some serious challenges. Two of the biggest barriers, according to Gooljar? Funding and space. And in the floral industry, those tend to go hand in hand.


""It's very hard for small businesses to exist in Charlotte without being pre-existing,"" Gooljar says. ""Pre-existing meaning that A, you come from money or B, you have somebody to help you. So we worked out of our two-bedroom apartment [when] we were doing events that were $15,000-$16,000, and we were doing it on our kitchen island that was six-and-a-half feet long. We had buckets all over the house.""IRIS blossom has been ""100% self-funded"" from the start and able to accomplish all it has thanks to its supportive clients, Gooljar says. The revenue earned goes back into the company's growth, a strategy that's helped it achieve its milestone of $500,000 in revenue in just a few years. But in the early days, Gooljar did try to secure a business loan — and was turned away.Related: This Black Founder Stayed True to His Triple 'Win' Strategy to Build a $1 Billion Business""I had a white banker in Charlotte, and he was really kind, but looked at me and was like, 'Well, you're not going to get a business loan because you have to be in business for a few years,'"" Gooljar recalls. ""And then I would ask, 'Well, how are people who are just starting a business getting a loan?' 'Oh, they probably have an online presence, or they probably just go into it with money, and then they can put up their own money.' That kind of quasi, not-really-plausible explanation about funding and gatekeeping funding.""


Affording space in Charlotte remained a significant obstacle. Eventually, Gooljar and Whittier moved into a three-bedroom apartment. But there still wasn't enough room for the rapidly growing business, and Gooljar didn't want to spend all the money they made on rent. At one point in their search for a reliable place to store their expensive, perishable materials, someone offered to rent them an Airstream travel trailer for thousands of dollars a month sans air conditioning or running water.Now, Gooljar lives and works out of a house in Florida.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom


""It's cool when people look at me, and they're wondering if my business is working out: All I can do is smile and say, 'You know, it is.'""Throughout his time building IRIS blossom, Gooljar says he's ""stepped on a few toes"" within the gatekept industry and has had to field some pointed questions: ""Well, who are you?"" ""Is your business going to last?"" ""How's your little business going?"" ""How's your flower thing going?""But none of that has deterred Gooljar, who comes from a ""very long line of people working hard.""""My grandma cut sugar cane for 40 years in Trinidad,"" Gooljar says. ""My parents came here with nothing and worked and tried their best. And I'm trying to change that tide. So yeah, it's cool when people look at me, and they're wondering if my business is working out: All I can do is smile and say, 'You know, it is, and I'm putting in the work for it.'""

Now She Has $25 Million in Funding — and Smart Advice for Fellow Black Women Founders.Gooljar admits that ""there's still a long way to go"" in transforming the industry into a more inclusive space, but he's happy to report that other diverse floral businesses popped up in Charlotte after his own — because ""there's room for everybody.""""I see some of the landscape changing, especially when I go into the floral cooler, and I see somebody else that's Black, or I go into the floral cooler, and I see somebody that's young, or I go in there, and I see somebody with pink hair or something,"" Gooljar says.""You have to face those obstacles and keep pushing because there's always going to be people who are preying on your downfall.""Next, Gooljar plans to implement a national subscription program for IRIS, a sort of ""color-by-numbers"" approach. He'll ship the flowers nationwide, and customers can follow along with his arrangements via video. ""I want people who don't feel creative in their current jobs or current lives to get that creative outlet just the same way that I needed that outlet,"" he says.In the long-term, Gooljar's goal is to collaborate with a tech company to make it possible for people to order IRIS flowers on an app ""like they do an Uber."" But even though Gooljar envisions IRIS as a wide-scale service allowing employees to run ""little mini IRIS blossoms out of their own homes,"" quality remains a top priority.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom

It's not always easy, and Gooljar admits there have been ""plenty of times"" he wanted to give up, but he's always kept going — never wavering in his belief that great things are on the other side.""You can ask anyone that I know, and they will tell you that they don't know anybody that grinds the way that I do,"" Gooljar says. ""And I'm not saying that you just have to throw yourself into everything all the time. But I think a big part of this is that you have to face those obstacles and keep pushing because there's always going to be people who are preying on your downfall. There are always going to be roadblocks. There are always going to be obstacles. There are always going to be things to climb, but you have to just keep going.""

8,Interest Rates Are Going to Drop This Year. Here Are 6 Ways Businesses Can Take Advantage When the Time Comes.,"Feb 9, 2024",Daniel Altman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/6-ways-for-businesses-to-be-ready-when-interest-rates-fall/469009,"
If there's one thing economists are sure about this year, it's that interest rates are coming down. Even the Federal Reserve's officials have been upfront about their plans to lower short-term rates by at least three-quarters of a percentage point. Financing and credit will be easier to come by, but how can you take advantage? As the chief economist at Instawork, here are some of my tips to prepare:Distinguish between short-term and long-term rates. Short-term interest rates have been coming down in anticipation of the Fed's moves, but long-term rates actually started to increase at the end of 2023. With the Treasury borrowing more and more to finance the federal government's debts, there's a lot of demand for long-term credit. Moreover, the Fed has been selling off its own long-term assets, which drains the supply of money from that side of the market.These moves have direct repercussions for businesses since long-term rates are the ones that determine the cost of borrowing for capital expenditures. So if you're planning to seek funding for a new factory, an overhaul of your offices or expansion into a new market, keep your eye on the rates that correspond to the time after which you'll repay.



Related: Where Will the Economy Go Next? What to Watch For in 2024Pick the right moment to raise money. If you've been thinking about an initial public offering (IPO) or tapping another source of funding, two things will affect the optimal timing: the growth of your business and the competing options for returns. The best moment usually arrives when growth is high and other possible investments are paying low rates.


The economy has been growing fairly rapidly, and expectations are for continued moderate growth this year. But it may take a couple of years for interest rates to fall to the ""easy money"" levels from before the Covid-19 pandemic, if they do at all. What will happen after the elections in November is anyone's guess, but companies considering an IPO may well be rewarded for waiting.Refinance debt when possible. Just as homeowners flock to refinance their mortgages when rates drop, so should businesses seek out lower rates for their outstanding debts. As the supply of credit grows, lenders are typically more willing to consider refinancing.The key is to calculate the true value of a refinancing deal — not just after paying fees, but also when considering the difference between the refinancing rate and the interest rates in the market. A lender might offer a no-fee refinancing, but it's not necessarily a bargain if the rate is higher than what other lenders would agree. The same goes for refinancing deals that ""reset the clock"" for a loan, implying a longer series of repayments in the future.Be aware of fluctuating exchange rates. Big institutional investors move markets, and today's institutional investors like to take advantage of international differences in interest rates. If they can borrow at 4% in Europe and earn 5% in the United States, even for a short time, they will. But if rates fall more quickly in the United States than in Europe, some of that money could go in the opposite direction, weakening the dollar along the way.


If you're negotiating contracts with international suppliers or if you're selling into markets abroad, then these exchange rates have a direct effect on your bottom line. In fact, given the volatility that could result in foreign exchange markets this year, you might want to consider long-term deals that lock in rates for several months or more.Related: Small Businesses Are Facing Higher Costs and Interest Rates. Here Are 6 Steps to Stave Off a Crisis.Use caution when hiring. The labor market is still tight by historical standards, and the economy is growing fairly quickly. If anything, economists are concerned that the Fed won't lower rates fast enough to stave off higher unemployment. Yet with lower inventories in retail and an uptick in some manufacturing industries, as well as sustained demand for services, things could also heat up again. After all, the unemployment rate was even lower than it is now for long spells in the past couple of years.This atmosphere of uncertainty means businesses ought to be careful in the labor market. Hiring — and sometimes firing as well — carries a fixed cost that can't be recouped. As an alternative, employers may want to consider using flexible workers, either on a recurring basis or even on long-term contracts. When the uncertainty clears and demand is steady, these workers will also be great candidates for permanent hires.


As a final note, consider your customers and suppliers. For small businesses that run on cash from day to day, interest rates may not seem too important. But they affect your customers' ability to buy your goods and services. They also determine how much rent your landlord needs to charge and where your insurance premium might go next. Once you know how these things are connected, you'll be in a better position to prepare for the trends to come.

9,Revenue is up 40%. Why Am I Still Laying Awake at Night Worrying About Cash Flow?,"Feb 2, 2024",Dr. Sabrina Starling,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-to-handle-your-cash-flow-fears/468292,"
Carl came to our coaching call in a panic. Payroll was due in 3 days, and there was not enough money in his bank account to cover it. Exasperated, he commented, ""I feel like calling it quits. I'm exhausted. I don't understand why this keeps happening! I've been doing this for over ten years, and all the financial stress of owning a business is too much on top of balancing a family and our financial stress. Our revenue is up 40% compared to last year's, and I still can't pay bills. I am working harder than I was a few months ago. Just last night, my wife and I argued because we still haven't been able to do the kitchen remodel I promised her two years ago. Where will I get the money? Why does this keep happening? I have all this debt tied to my business. I want to close it all, change my name, and leave it behind.""Carl's pain is one many of us have experienced. Years ago, I struggled to figure out my business finances. It didn't make sense that the revenue was growing, but I was paying myself less than the previous year, and it was getting harder to cover payroll.When I confided this to a good friend and colleague, he suggested I allocate a percentage of all revenue to pay myself first and set aside a percentage to run the business. Although this seemed like extra work because it involved having an additional account, I realized how much I looked forward to doing my allocations a few months into doing this. It was fun to see the money I was able to pay myself. For the first time after many years of running my business, I felt rich! Reflecting on that makes me smile.



Related: 10 Expert Tips on Managing Cash Flow as a New BusinessWhat seemed like much money back then was enough for me to cover an extra month or two of my pay. It gave me hope for a better future as a business owner. About seven months into doing this, I was able to take a nine-week, fully unplugged, paid maternity leave from my business when my second daughter was born. That was incredible!


I realized that by running my business from one bank account, there were times when it looked like much money was available, so I would make large purchases and add the team to reduce my workload, thinking the business was doing well. Then, six weeks later, I struggled to pay bills and meet payroll. I had failed to account for increased payroll taxes, quarterly estimate taxes, and annual due subscriptions. I also didn't anticipate the drop in sales from my having to spend time training new team members.I was running my business from the survival trap and making decisions accordingly. These cash flow crises led me to take on work with less desirable, demanding clients to get cash in the door. The additional client work caused stress, and I questioned if I was losing money by working with them because I never seemed to get around to writing my book, The 4 Week Vacation®, which I knew would bring in better clients.Related: 5 Steps to Turning Experience (and Failure) Into WisdomI've learned much over the years of running my business in this way and sharing it with others. It's not about how much we make but how much we keep. Hustle culture would make us believe we need to grow our revenue and have more vehicles on the road, a fancy office space, and many employees. After all, those are the signs of success as an entrepreneur. Or are they? These are the very expectations that keep us from being profitable and paying ourselves appropriately.


Reflecting on Carl's challenge, it is easy for our expenses to creep up as the business grows. We start hiring to meet increased demand. This results in the need for more space and equipment. Payroll and rent are the most significant expenses.As revenue grows, our most significant opportunity lies in creating efficiency in our businesses. Running the company with a certain percentage set aside for operating expenses forces me to make decisions daily to be profitable.Related: Why Embracing Failure Is Good for BusinessLimits force innovation and creativity. When we exceed our operating expense budget, we determine how to deliver excellent service with our existing team and platforms. When we hire, we have a training plan for getting the new team member up to speed as quickly as possible, and we articulate to that team member how the key results they are responsible for contributing to profit. I like to set aside three months of the new employee's paycheck in a separate account before hiring. This gives me confidence that we can afford this team member.


As a child, my parents scrimped and saved to send me to private school. They drove me to school in our old pickup truck. I cringed seeing my peers dropped off in Mercedes and BMWs. At dinner, I'd complain about my parents' ""shortcomings."" That's when I learned a powerful life lesson.My father was a banker, and most of his customers were small business owners. They were in debt. My father informed me that it is possible to drive a BMW and be drowning in debt. Once a month, in the evening, he'd disappear into the back bedroom to make phone calls. He was calling his customers who were behind on their payments. He alluded to some of my peers' parents being his customers. My parents chose vehicles we could pay for without going into debt. Sure, we didn't have the fancy cars, but we had peace of mind.After many sleepless nights as an entrepreneur, peace of mind is priceless. There's a better, more sustainable way to run our businesses. We can design our businesses to be sustainably profitable and make choices that give us peace of mind, more time for what matters most, and a growing bank account.

10,3 Ways to Conquer Your Debt and Stay on Top of Your Financial Game,"Jan 24, 2024",Mikey Lucas,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/3-ways-to-conquer-your-debt-and-stay-on-top-of-your-finances/468325,"
Let's cut to the chase and talk about something that's hitting our wallets hard – consumer credit. The numbers don't lie: Consumer credit is not just bad; it's getting worse by the day.Credit card debt: It's now at an unprecedented $1.03 trillion.Other loans and retail credit cards: There's been a $15 billion increase.Auto loans: These have risen by $20 billion, totaling $179 trillion.Interest rates: We're seeing an average of 20.53%, the highest in 22 years.



Now, despite these sky-high figures, something curious is happening: Delinquency rates are staying low. This means many households are still juggling their debt effectively. But hey, if the economic winds shift, we could be looking at some real trouble.Related: 9 Financial Mistakes to Avoid in 2024The credit score connectionYour credit score and consumer debt are like peanut butter and jelly — they just go together. Your score is influenced by payment history, credit utilization and new credit inquiries. Let's break it down:Payment history: This is a biggie, making up 35% of your FICO score. Regular, timely payments are your best friend here, boosting your credit. But with debts rising, those monthly payments are also climbing. Missed payments? They'll ding your credit score for up to seven years.


Credit utilization: Accounting for about 30% of your credit score, this is all about how much credit you're using versus what you've got available. As your debts pile up, so does your credit utilization. Crossing that 30% threshold can start to hurt your score.New credit inquiries: Applying for new credit cards or loans? That can temporarily lower your score. Be strategic about when and how often you apply for new credit.Smart debt managementHere's where we get proactive. You've got options like the Avalanche Method, where you tackle debts with the highest interest rates first. Or, try the Snowball Method, knocking out the smallest balances first for quick wins. Both have their merits, depending on your style.Then there's debt consolidation. Combine all those pesky debts into one, ideally with a lower interest rate. It's about simplifying your life and potentially reducing interest costs over time.


And remember, if you pay off a credit card, think twice before closing the account. Why? It can actually hike up your credit utilization ratio and ding your score. Keep those accounts open with a zero balance to keep your credit in good shape.Debt's bigger pictureConsumer debt isn't just about numbers on a screen. It's about life. High debt payments can eat into your ability to save, impacting your financial future. And if we're all spending less on the fun stuff, that can ripple out and hit the economy too. Before you know it, we're staring down the barrel of a recession.Now, let's not forget the personal toll. Debt stress is real. It messes with your sleep, strains your relationships and can put major life decisions like buying a home or starting a family on pause. The moral of the story? It's not just about dollars and cents; it's about your well-being.Related: Americans' Debt Just Exceeded $17 Trillion for the First Time — Here's the Smartest First Step to Fix Your Finances


Take charge of your debtSo, how do you steer clear of the debt trap? Let me lay out three key tools to help you conquer your debt:1. Calculate Your CLR: Your Consumer Leverage Ratio (CLR) is the ratio of your monthly consumer debt to your disposable income. If it's over 20%, you need to hit the brakes and focus on debt reduction.How to calculate: To calculate your CLR, divide the total balance of your credit card debt by your total credit limit. For instance, if you have a total credit card debt of $5,000 and a total credit limit of $25,000 across all cards, your CLR is $5,000 ÷ $25,000, which equals 0.20 or 20%.2. Prioritize debt repayment: Start by targeting those high-interest debts. Use either the Avalanche or Snowball method to get ahead. Paying off these debts not only improves your financial health but also boosts your peace of mind.How to implement: List out all your debts in order of their interest rates, from highest to lowest. Continue making minimum payments on all your debts, but direct any extra money you can afford toward the debt with the highest interest rate. Once the highest-interest debt is fully paid, focus on the next highest, and so on.3. Monitor your spending: Keep an eagle eye on where your cash is going. Use apps or good old-fashioned spreadsheets to track your expenses. Look for areas to cut back on luxuries, so you can channel more funds toward debt repayment and savings.


How to monitor: You can use budgeting apps, spreadsheets or traditional accounting methods to track your spending. Categorize your expenses into necessities (like rent, utilities, groceries, etc.) and luxuries (like dining out, entertainment, etc.).Credit utilization isn't just some fancy financial term; it's a wake-up call to all of us trying to navigate this tough financial landscape. Listen, the state of consumer credit is alarming, and it's time we took the reins. By understanding and managing your credit utilization, you're not just boosting your credit score; you're building a fortress against the rising tide of debt. Remember, it's not about the credit you have; it's about how smartly you use it. Stay sharp, keep your utilization low, and make those smart financial moves!Related: How to Manage Personal Credit Card Debt as an Entrepreneur

An uptick in sticker prices also means more drivers took on auto loans, and now, auto loan debt currently stands at $1.58 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, an all-time high.All of this has left many Americans in a bind.""I'm paying a ton of money right now for a car that I don't really need, and I've been struggling and struggling to sell it,"" Sean Miller, who took out an auto loan in 2019, told CNBC. ""If I were to sell it today, it would probably be at a $10,000 to $15,000 loss. This is something that right now is preventing me from being able to save up in order to start a family.""Rising car loan rates have coincided with increasing interest rates, reaching levels not seen since 2008, subsequently leading to the surge of borrowing money, per Bankrate.


On the bright side, the Fed decided on Wednesday to maintain interest rates within a range of 5.25% to 5.50%, offering temporary relief from escalating interest rates.

12,How to Fund Your Business Using Banks and Credit Unions,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-fund-your-business-using-banks-and-credit-unions/459438,"
Many of the most successful businesses are financed by banks, which can provide small to moderate amounts of capital at market costs. They don't want control—at least beyond the control exerted in the covenants of a loan document. And they don't want ownership. Bankers make loans, not investments, and as a general rule they don't want to wind up owning your company.Bankers primarily provide debt financing. You take out a loan and pay it back, perhaps in installments consisting of principal and interest, perhaps in payments of interest only, followed by a balloon payment of the principal. One of the nice things about debt financing is that the entrepreneur doesn't have to give up ownership of his company to get it. The cost is clearly stated.Related: Finance Your Money RightBankers can usually be counted on to want minimal, if any, input into how the business is run. Most often, as long as you remain current on payments, you can do as you like. Get behind on the payment schedule, and you're likely to find a host of covenants buried in your loan documentation.



Loan covenants, however, may require you to do all sorts of things, from setting a minimum amount of working capital you must maintain to prohibiting you from making certain purchases or signing leases without approval from the bank. In fact, most bank loans contain so many covenants that it's difficult for a borrower to avoid being technically in default on one or more of them at a given time. For this reason, you want your accountant, financial advisor, or attorney to review your loan documents and spell out everything for you very carefully.Related: 3 Strategies For Getting Into Lending ShapeYour loan officer is likely to ignore many covenant violations unless you stop, or seem likely to stop, making timely payments. Even then you'll probably get a chance to work out the problem. But if you remain in violation, you may find yourself declared in default in short order, and the bank may demand all of its money immediately, perhaps seizing your collateral and even forcing you to protect yourself by declaring bankruptcy.What Bankers WantA banker's first concern is getting the bank's money back plus a reasonable return. To increase the odds of this, bankers look for certain things in the businesses they lend to. Those include everything from a solid explanation of why you need the money and what you're going to use it for to details about any other borrowing or leasing deals you've entered into.


Bank loan applications can be voluminous, almost as long and complete as a full-fledged business plan. Plans and loan applications aren't interchangeable, however. A banker may not be interested in your rosy projections of future growth. In fact, when confronted with the kind of growth projection required to interest a venture capitalist, a banker may be turned off. On the other hand, a banker is likely to be quite interested in seeing a contingency plan that will let you pay back the loan even in the event of a worst-case scenario. The things a banker will look for you to address are:Cash flow. One of the most convincing things you can show a banker is the existence of a strong, well-documented flow of cash that will be more than adequate to repay a loan's scheduled principal and interest. Basically, you're going to have to show where you're going to get the money to pay back what you're borrowing.Related: Choosing A Lender? Watch Out FOr These Costly Traps.You'll need more than a projection of future cash flow, by the way. Most bankers will want to see cash flow statements as well as balance sheets and income statements for the past three or so years. And don't forget your tax returns for the same period.Collateral. If you're just starting out in business or if you're dealing with a banker who you don't know well, you're unlikely to be able to borrow from a bank without collateral. (That's doubly true if, as is the case with many entrepreneurs, both descriptions apply to you.) Collateral is just something the banker can seize and sell to get back some or all of the money you've borrowed in the event that everything goes wrong and you can't pay it back with profits from operations. It may consist of machinery, equipment, inventory, or all too often, the equity you own in your home. It's advisable NOT to put your home up for collateral—it's simply too big a risk.But it's a good idea to take the initiative here and propose something that will be used if you suspect a banker will require it. Often the collateral will consist of whatever you're borrowing money to buy—production equipment, computers, a building, and so on.Related: 4 Ways To Finance Your Business.


Why do bankers seek collateral? They have no desire to own secondhand equipment or your house. Experience has taught them that entrepreneurs who have their own assets at risk are more likely to stick to a business than those who have none of their own assets at risk.Quick tip: It seems sensible to plan to put up as collateral the exact item you're borrowing money to buy. But bankers often demand more because it may be impossible to sell the item that you're buying for what you'll owe on it. So, plan to use purchased equipment for part of your collateral but be ready to offer more.Cosigners. They provide an added layer of protection for lenders. If your own capacity for taking on additional debt is shaky, a cosigner (who is essentially lending you his or her creditworthiness) may make the difference.Related: Choosing A Business Loan TypeMarketing plans. More than ever before, bankers are taking a closer look at the marketing plans embedded in business plans. Strong competitors, price wars, me-too products, the fickle habits of the buying public, and other market-related risks must be addressed. There are also very web-savvy marketers out there, and it helps if you are tapped into online marketing, such as social media.Your banker (and most other investors) has to know that you recognize these risks and have well-thought-out ways to deal with them. Besides, it's the cash flow from operations that pays off bank loans.Management. Bankers like to stress the personal aspect of their services. Many state that they are interested in making loans based on a borrower's character as well as her financial strength. In fact, the borrower's track record and management ability are concerns for bankers evaluating a loan application. If you can show you've run one or more other companies successfully, it will increase your chances of landing a loan to get a startup going.


Related: Despite Access to Credit, Many Business Owners Are Reluctant to Take on DebtGetting Your House in OrderAs an entrepreneur seeking a bank loan, or any funding for that matter, you'll want to make sure you have everything in place, including all of your financial documentation as well as your credit history. And if you need to improve your credit history and rating, you should do so in advance. Even if you have previous business experience, you'll need to get your personal credit information in order. Start by contacting one of the three major credit bureaus:Equifax: 1-800-685-1111, www.equifax.comExperian: 1-888-397-3742, www.experian.comTransUnion: 1-800-916-8800, www.transunion.comDo this once because loan officers will also inquire, and the more your credit ratings are checked, the more suspicious it may appear to lenders. Also, read your credit reports carefully, especially if your rating is not as good as you expected. Credit bureaus make more mistakes than you would ever imagine. Make sure there are no errors on your credit reports. If there are errors, call the credit bureau to have them corrected.Related: 6 Tips For Navigating Online Lending Options


Lenders Look at the Four Cs of CreditCharacter. What's your reputation and record?Capacity or cash flow. Do you have sufficient cash flow to repay principal and interest?Capital. Does your business have enough capital to keep going if you can't pay the debt from earnings?Collateral. Do you own something valuable the banker can take if you can't pay the loan back?Don't Take No for an AnswerOne, two, three strikes, you're out. Most small business owners give up after trying three banks. You should be more persistent. Those entrepreneurs that have persisted have found that the fifth, tenth, or even twentieth banker has been impressed enough to give them a loan. Of course, tweaking the business plan based on the criticism you receive can, and often does, help improve your odds as you continue going from bank to bank. Listen and learn from feedback and criticism, make changes if you feel the comments are relevant, and keep on going. Be persistent.Related: Fund Your Business With Bonds And Indirect Funding SourcesWhen Bank Financing Is AppropriateBank financing is most appropriate for up-and-running enterprises that can show adequate cash flow and collateral to service and secure the loan. Bankers are less likely to provide startup money to turn a concept into a business and even less likely to put up seed money to prove a concept unless you have a track record of launching previous businesses with successful results. Even then, each concept will stand on its own merits.Bankers are sensitive to the term or length of a loan. Most bank loans are short to intermediate term, meaning they are due in anywhere from less than a year to five years. A short-term loan may be for ninety days and used to finance receivables so you can get a big order out the door. A longer-term loan, up to twenty years, may be used to purchase a piece of long-lasting capital equipment.Borrowing When You Really Need ItThe old saying about bankers lending only to people who don't need to borrow is almost true. Bankers prefer to lend to companies that are almost, but not quite, financially robust enough to pursue their objective without the loan. Bankers are lenders, not investors. Unlike a venture capitalist who takes an equity position, bankers don't get a higher return on their loan if you happen to be more successful than expected. Their natural tendency is to be conservative.Related: The Current State Of Business LendingThis is important to understand because it affects how and when you will borrow. You should try to foresee times you'll need to borrow money and arrange a line of credit or other loan before you need it. That will make it easier and, in many cases, cheaper in terms of interest rates than if you wait until you're a needier and, in bankers' eyes, less attractive borrower.


Credit UnionsAnother option when seeking funding is to join a credit union. According to the National Credit Union Administration, there are more than 4,900 credit unions in the country with 131 million members as of March 31, 2022. Because credit unions are not-for-profit financial institutions, their focus is serving the financial needs of their members and not on making a profit. As a result, once you have applied and joined a credit union, it may be easier to get a lower interest rate with fewer fees than can be found at a bank when procuring a loan. However, like a bank, you will still need to prove your creditworthiness and that you can repay the loan or have someone cosign for it.Because banks have gotten a lot of bad press in recent years for attaching fees to all sorts of activities, many people have switched over to credit unions. One reason is that credit unions typically offer more personalized service, which can include helping you get your house in order before applying for a loan. Credit unions may also offer a sense of camaraderie because they are typically sponsored by a business, a community, or some group of people of which you are one. This can be advantageous because you may find other people interested in your business ideas.Related: Choosing A Bank For Your Start-Up? Here Are Some Things To Know.While credit unions are not protected like banks by the FDIC, they are covered by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF). This fund provides federal and most state-chartered credit union members with up to $250,000 of insurance per individual depositor, per federally insured credit union.Term to Know: Balloon PaymentA balloon payment is a single, usually final, payment on a loan much greater than the preceding payments. Some business loans, for example, require interest-only payments the first year or two, followed by a single large payment that repays all the principal.

13,What's the Deal With These 'Snowball' and 'Avalanche' Debt Repayment Methods? Here's How to Know Which One Is Right For You.,"Oct 24, 2023",Entrepreneur Staff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/debt-snowball-vs-avalanche-method-choose-the-right/464134,"
Living with debt can be a heavy burden, affecting your financial well-being — and peace of mind. In fact, in the second quarter of 2023, household debt in the U.S. rose to a whopping $17.06 trillion, led by credit card balances, according to the Federal Reserve. Fortunately, there are methods to help you tackle debt systematically and regain control of your finances. Two tactics for managing debt are the Debt Snowball and the Debt Avalanche methods. Here, we'll break down these methods and how they work and help you decide which strategy might be right for your financial situation.What's the Debt Snowball method — and how does it work?The Debt Snowball method is a debt repayment strategy popularized by financial expert Dave Ramsey. The core principle of this method is to start by paying off the smallest debt first and then gradually moving up to the larger ones. Here's a quick rundown of how it works:List your debts: Begin by making a list of all your debts, from the smallest to the largest. This list could include credit card balances, personal loans or other outstanding debts.Minimum payments: Continue making minimum payments on all your debts to maintain your credit and avoid penalties.Focus on the smallest debt: Allocate any extra funds you have to pay off the smallest debt while continuing to make minimum payments on your other debts.Celebrate small wins: Once the smallest debt is paid off, you'll experience a psychological boost. Celebrate this victory and use the money you were paying toward the smallest debt to add to the minimum payment for the next smallest debt.Repeat: Continue this process until you've paid off all your debts.The Debt Snowball method is popular because it provides quick wins, boosting your motivation as you clear each debt. It's a psychological approach to debt repayment that emphasizes the emotional satisfaction of closing accounts, even if the interest rates on the debts are not necessarily the highest.

Unlike the Snowball method, the Debt Avalanche method prioritizes paying off debts based on their interest rates, starting with the highest-interest debt and working down. Here's how it works:


List your debts: Like the Debt Snowball, list all your debts, but this time, order them from the highest interest rate to the lowest.Minimum payments: Maintain minimum payments on all debts.Focus on high-interest debt: Allocate any additional funds to paying off the debt with the highest interest rate. Continue to do so until it's completely paid off.Roll down the interest rates: Once you've paid off the highest-interest debt, move to the next-highest interest-rate debt, applying the freed-up funds from the previous one. Continue this process until you've paid off all your debts.The Debt Avalanche method is financially efficient because it minimizes the overall interest you pay, as you're targeting the most costly debts first. This method might not offer the same psychological wins as the Debt Snowball, but it can be more cost-effective over the long run.Related: Average 401(k) Account Balances Plummeted Last Year. How Does Yours Compare to the Typical American's?So, which debt repayment method is right for you?The choice between the Debt Snowball and the Debt Avalanche method depends on your personal financial situation, goals and preferences. Here's a handy breakdown of both strategies and who they might be best for:Debt Snowball:Ideal for individuals who need motivation and quick wins to stay on track.Well-suited for those who have several smaller debts that can be paid off relatively quickly.Helpful for people looking for a psychological boost as they eliminate debts one by one.Debt Avalanche:Recommended for those who want to minimize the total interest paid and are willing to focus on the most financially efficient approach.Effective for individuals with higher-interest debts, such as credit card balances.Appropriate for those who can maintain motivation without the immediate emotional rewards of closing accounts.In the end, the ""right"" method is subjective. You can even combine elements of both strategies by paying off a small debt first to gain motivation and then transitioning to the Debt Avalanche method to minimize interest costs. The key is creating a plan that aligns with your financial situation, preferences and goals. Whichever method you choose, the most crucial step is to take action and stick with your plan. Commitment and consistency are the keys to successfully managing and eventually eliminating your debt.

14,Student Loan Payments Resume in October: Here's Everything You Need to Know,"Sep 5, 2023",Gene Marks,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/student-loan-payments-resume-in-october-what-to-know/458513,"
After a three-year hiatus, repayments on federal student loans begin again this October. If you already have a student loan that's previously been suspended because of the Covid-19 pandemic, you will be required to resume paying both the principal and interest due.Thanks to the CARES Act, federal student loans were paused in March 2020 with interest at 0%, and it's stayed that way since. President Joe Biden tried to initiate a plan to forgive $430 billion of student loan debt, but the Supreme Court blocked that plan in June when it ruled the program an unlawful overreach of executive power in a 6-to-3 decision. After this long hiatus, borrowers will have to once again start paying down their loans plus interest.As a certified public accountant, there are some common questions you might have about this process that I can help answer. Here's what you need to know.Related: Supreme Court Blocks Biden's Student Loan Forgiveness Plan — Here's How It May Affect the EconomyWhat loans are affected?All federally-backed loans for financing education that have been issued by the U.S. government through the U.S. Department of Education. Loans received from private lenders are subject to separate rules and repayment terms from those borrowers.



What types of federally backed student loans are there?The most popular federally-backed student loan program are Direct Subsidized Loans, where the U.S. Department of Education pays the interest while a borrower is still in school at least half-time, for the first six months after they left school and during a period of deferment (a postponement of loan payments). There are also Direct Unsubsidized Loans where borrowers are responsible for paying the interest during all periods. Other student loan options are available such as the Parent PLUS, Graduate PLUS and Direct Consolidation programs.Who services these loans?There are currently eight federal student loan servicers:EdfinancialMOHELAAidvantageNelnetOSLA ServicingECSIGreat Lakes Educational Loan ServicesDefault Resolution GroupWhen you receive a federal student loan, it's automatically assigned to one of these servicers.

Interest restarted on Sept. 1, 2023.


What if I don't receive notice?The first thing you should do is reach out to the previous company servicing your loan to find out its status and whether or not it's been transferred to another service provider. You can also look up your loan status in the National Student Loan Data System.Related: How Student Loans Are Crushing Millennial EntrepreneurialismIs there any grace period remaining?Yes, if you left school within the last six to nine months, you are still in your automatic grace period.What payment options do I have?There are currently seven options for paying back your student loans.


Standard Repayment Plan: 10-year term with fixed payments.Graduated Repayment Plan: 10-year term with lower payments earlier, then gradually increasing.Extended Repayment Plan: 25-year term with both fixed or graduated repayment options.Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan (formerly known as Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan): Payback is based on 10% of your discretionary income (the money you have left after paying taxes and personal necessities, such as food, shelter, and clothing) but no larger than what you would pay under the Standard Repayment Plan.Income-Based Repayment Plan: 20-25 year terms with payments based on 10-15% of discretionary income with any remaining balance forgiven.Income-Contingent Repayment Plan: The lesser of payments of 20% of your discretionary income or what you'd pay back over 12 years.Income-Sensitive Repayment Plan: 15 years of monthly payments based on annual income.Can I change my payment plan?Yes, you can usually change your payment plan at any time at no charge. You should contact your loan service provider to do this.Which payment plan is best for me?This depends on various factors including your income, assets and ability to pay back your loans. It's best to consult with a financial advisor to answer this question.What are the interest rates on student loans?Interest rates vary by loan type, but they are currently in the range of 5.5% to 8.05%.How do I know if my loan has been forgiven?The Biden Administration has, through executive orders, changed the terms of some of the federally-backed student loans that have resulted in forgiveness for certain debtors. To find out if your loan is eligible for forgiveness, you should contact your loan service provider.


What if I can't afford to pay my loans?Your best bet is to talk to your loan service provider to see if there's a better payment plan to accommodate your financial situation.Related: Why You Should Care About Student Loan DebtWhat if I default on my student loans?Your federally-backed student loan is like any other long-term debt commitment.

Call 1-800-621-3115 and ask about their Fresh Start program where you can work out a repayment plan and have your loan transferred to the Default Resolution Group which can assist in getting the loan back into ""in repayment"" status.

On Friday, the U.S. Department of Education announced $39 billion in outstanding student loans will be forgiven.In the coming days, more than 804,000 individuals will receive a notification via email that their federal student loans will be automatically discharged. To be eligible for forgiveness, borrowers must have made the equivalent payments of either 20 or 25 years of qualifying months under an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan.The 804,000 individuals are the first round of eligible borrowers who will be notified. Overall, the Biden administration has approved nearly $117 billion in student loan forgiveness for over 3.4 million borrowers, the Department of Education added, and it plans to continue identifying and notifying borrowers who reach the forgiveness thresholds every two months until next year.



Borrowers will have the option to opt out for any reason. Last month, Biden faced a setback to his administration's large-scale student loan forgiveness plan after the Supreme Court ruled that his debt relief plan was an unlawful overreach of executive power.

That's unacceptable,"" Under Secretary James Kvaal said in the release. ""Today we are holding up the bargain we offered borrowers who have completed decades of repayment.""The Department of Education stated that the move addresses ""historical failures"" in the student loan program. Essentially, some borrowers' payments weren't counted towards forgiveness, even though they were qualified through income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — meaning that they were working towards forgiveness for years, but weren't making any progress.Now, the administration is helping borrowers know exactly how many monthly payments count towards loan forgiveness, as well as providing relief for borrowers who have been making payments for a long time. Many of the affected borrowers are likely to be 50 years or older, USA Today noted.


In total, the Biden administration has approved more than $116.6 billion in student loans for over 3.4 million borrowers. Chris J.

16,How to Use Your Own Debts to Fund Your Business,"Jul 11, 2023",Jorge Contreras,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-use-your-own-debts-to-fund-your-business/454717,"
To borrow or not to borrow? That is the question. And it's a pretty difficult one to answer, too, especially if you need money but are averse to debt. However, contrary to popular belief — not all debts are bad. If you're an entrepreneur or planning to start your own business but have closed yourself off from borrowing, you might be missing out on a good financial opportunity.You see, debts can be classified into two categories: the good and the bad. Good debts add value to your life; bad debts only acquire interest over time. Bad debts are liabilities, while good debts can be used to grow your assets. Now if you have a business and you're looking for more funding, you might want to consider getting into debt. Read on to find a few options you can use to get started.Related: Dealing with Debt as an Entrepreneur



Getting a business loanLaunching a business requires money, and sometimes you, as an entrepreneur, might have to get creative just to get financial support. Sure, you can self-fund or rely on loans from friends and family during the initial stages. But as your business expands, you may find that these options are minimal. In these cases, you might want to turn to business loans offered by banks.Business loans can give you access to additional capital that you can use to cover business expenses such as rent and utilities. You can also use it to fund necessary purchases like machines you need for your operations.


However, there's a caveat here: applying for a business loan can be difficult. And it's especially true for new business owners. Most banks will refer to your business credit history as a basis for approval. Sometimes, they'll even have to examine your personal finances. All of these means that your financial performance needs to be excellent because it would be difficult to get approved if they aren't.Related: 10 Ways to Fund Your Small BusinessUtilizing a business credit cardAside from getting business loans, you can also apply for a business credit card to finance your venture. A business credit card can give significant benefits that personal cards don't. For one, it'll give you a better chance of getting approved for business loans.When you use your business card for purchases, you're acquiring more points for your business credit score. You can't do that with a personal credit card.


Now if you've heard of the advice to get a business credit card before, but you're not doing it yet because you're afraid of the interests, there's a strategy we can teach you that will not only help you maximize your card's benefits but will also give you lower interest rates on it. This strategy is called balance transfer.Related: 3 Questions You Must Ask Before Securing a Small Business Credit CardThe ""Balance Transfer"" strategyBalance transfer is when you transfer money from your business credit card to another credit card with a lower interest or annual percentage rate (APR). With this, you will now have more finances to fund your business, and you'll even get more time to pay off the debt without incurring additional interest!To do this, you must first find a business credit card with a good balance transfer offer, then request a balance transfer from your business card to your new card. The new credit card company pays off the transferred balance and puts it on your new card. Most banks that offer balance transfer cards even offer 0% APR for the first year, which you can use to your business advantage.


So you see, there are many ways you can use liabilities like debts to add value to your life. You just need to remember that the keyword here is ""leverage."" When you leverage loans or credit cards to propel your business to new heights, you're actually using other people's money to grow your own. And that's the best way to turn your bad debt into a good one.By the way, do you know what type of business can benefit most from the funding strategies we've mentioned? You should try it on short-term rental businesses like Airbnb.Related: 7 Steps to Reduce Business Debt in 90 DaysUsing debts to start subleasing AirbnbsNow I've been an entrepreneur for a long while now, and I can tell you so much about what you can do to grow your business. But out of the ventures I had over the years, I have to say that I have a favorite: launching short-term rentals on Airbnb.


Launching an Airbnb business gives you the potential to earn from an asset that you already have but aren't using yet. And if the systems are automated correctly, it will even allow you to go hands-free in the business. In short, passive income.But you know what I like best about this business? It's because I could start it even if I didn't have properties. And I did it through subleasing. The subleasing method is where you can rent other people's properties and ask the landlord if you can use them as a listing on Airbnb.Then I used the Balance Transfer strategy to fund the business. I used that money to pay for the rent, the deposit, and the furniture to launch a new Airbnb. Then I took the profits from my Airbnb to pay off the credit card. And I repeated the process over and over until I reached my financial goal. This is how I got my first million. You might want to try it for yourself too.Related: How to Start an Airbnb Business Without Owning Property


So to sum it all up, not all debts are bad. If you want to launch or scale your business fast and need funding, one of your best options is to borrow. And the keyword is leverage, so don't be afraid to use that money to work for you — like using it to sublease properties for Airbnb.

In a long-awaited ruling by the Supreme Court on President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness program, the court blocked the plan in a 6-3 decision on Friday.The program would have allowed eligible borrowers to eliminate up to $20,000 in debt but was deemed an unlawful overreach of executive power. The plan carried an estimated cost of $400 billion.The Supreme Court's decision is significant for Biden, who made tackling student loan debt a key pillar of his 2020 campaign. However, the court's decision hinges on the plan being an overstep of authority, arguing that such a program cannot be implemented without authorization from Congress.



The Biden administration formerly defended the motion by citing the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act (HEROES Act) of 2003, which allows the government to provide relief during a national emergency. Still, the court has ruled that the language in the HEROES Act is not specific enough to authorize a plan as broad as Biden's.Related: Supreme Court Rules Against Affirmative Action at Harvard and UNC


""The Secretary asserts that the HEROES Act grants him the authority to cancel $430 billion of student loan principal. It does not,"" Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote in the ruling. ""We hold today that the Act allows the Secretary to 'waive or modify' existing statutory or regulatory provisions applicable to financial assistance programs under the Education Act, not to rewrite that statute from the ground up.""The Biden administration disagrees with the decision, a source familiar with the matter told CNN, and that it wants to make it ""crystal clear to borrowers and their families that Republicans are responsible for denying them the relief that President Biden has been fighting to get to them.""How will the decision affect the economy?The student loan repayment process, which was paused during the pandemic, is set to resume in August, with monthly payments beginning in October. While the pause was always going to end regardless of the court's decision, millions may have been banking on Biden's plan to eliminate their student loan debt, and experts have expressed concerns about the potentially wide-ranging impact on the economy.Laura Beamer, a researcher specializing in higher education finance at the Jain Family Institute, told the New York Times that any progress made during the repayment hiatus — such as improving borrowers' credit scores, which enabled them to make significant purchases like cars and homes — may be swiftly undone as the pause ends.

Now, in a more typical time, that's not really that big a deal. The economy can digest that gracefully. But in the current environment with the economy as weak as it is, recession risks as high as they are, a couple of tenths of percent can matter,"" Zandi said.

18,Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Is Suing the Biden Administration Over Higher Education Standards That Control Federal Student Loans. Here's Why,"Jun 23, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/desantis-sues-biden-over-college-system-that-controls/454723,"
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced on Thursday that the state is suing the Biden administration and the Department of Education over the college accreditation process, which controls the federal funding for public universities.The 41-page lawsuit, filed on Wednesday, argues that Congress has given ""unchecked power"" to private accrediting agencies that determine education standards required to receive federal funding — which is used for student scholarships, loans, faculty grants, and more.""Our public colleges and universities will not be subject to politicized accrediting agencies serving as gatekeepers to gigantic amounts of federal funds,"" DeSantis tweeted on Thursday.



Last year, DeSantis passed state legislation that requires colleges to change accreditors every 10 years on the basis that some agencies had a ""monopoly"" on Florida schools and could ""withhold accreditation if an institution didn't adhere to the ideological agenda promoted by its accreditor.""The Department of Education requires that institutions must cite a ""reasonable cause"" to change accreditors.


The recent lawsuit accuses the Biden administration and the DOE of giving private accreditation agencies the power to implement their own standards and ""act as gatekeepers to $112 billion in annual federal student aid.""Related: California Colleges Are Flooded With 'Ghost Students' Attempting to Steal Financial AidThe Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), which is the primary accreditor for Florida public schools and institutions in the south, has raised questions about some of the state colleges' actions in recent years. In 2021, SACS ""threatened accreditation"" of Florida State University after a former education commissioner for the state was considered for the position of president at the university, the lawsuit states.Also in 2021, SACS investigated an instance of alleged political interference after three University of Florida professors were blocked by the college from serving as expert witnesses in a case against the state, The Miami Herald reported, which challenged two of SACS' accreditation standards: ""Undue political influence"" and ""academic freedom.""


In a statement to the AP, White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan said that DeSantis is bringing ""culture wars, like book bans,"" to a long-standing education system. ""These culture wars do nothing to actually help students and only make things worse. This Administration won't allow it,"" Hasan added.DeSantis, meanwhile, accuses the Biden administration of trying to ""defund"" Florida colleges because the state ""refuse(s) to bow to unaccountable accreditors who think they should run Florida's public universities.""""I have made it a priority to bring transparency and accountability to higher education and to reorient the mission of our colleges and universities away from purveying destructive ideologies and back toward the pursuit of truth,"" DeSantis said in a statement.

19,How Entrepreneurs Can Position Their Businesses for Growth This Summer,"Jun 16, 2023",Sharon Miller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-position-your-business-for-growth-this-summer/452638,"
The warmer months often bring our picturesque visions of small businesses into focus — local florists adorn their stores with colorful bouquets, mom-and-pop ice cream shops serve lines out the door, and our favorite restaurants bustle with the day's fresh catch and seasonal specialties under a clear sky.While daydreaming of these early summer scenes, it's important to remain cognizant of the economic headwinds that have impaired small businesses over the past year. Though entrepreneurs are used to rising above a difficult economy, challenges persist.Although inflation rates have cooled significantly over the last year, prices are still causing problems for consumers. Supply chain and labor issues linger, and concerns around a potential recession and commodities prices remain at the top of many people's minds.



Despite these concerns, Bank of America's 2023 Small Business Owner Report found that nearly half of entrepreneurs plan to grow their businesses in the coming year.Related: 3 Ways to Start Raising Capital for Your Business, Big or Small


The importance of capitalOne of the most critical components for business growth is access to capital. Consistent and convenient credit empowers business owners to expand the scale of their operations, diversify their revenue streams, acquire new tools and technology and provide a buffer against economic downturns.For many business owners, a key source of capital infusion is a bank loan. The process of applying for and receiving loans can feel complex, even mystifying, but understanding the keys to the application and approval process can provide clarity and help business owners prep for success.Most lenders consider a few primary factors when evaluating a loan application: Capacity, capital, conditions, character and collateral.Capacity:


Lenders want to ensure the borrower has the ability to repay their business loan. This is often calculated by evaluating a business' debt-to-income ratio. A capacity evaluation is essentially a risk assessment on the part of a lender — they want to ensure you have the cash flow to take on loan payments.Capital:To secure a loan, entrepreneurs will likely have to show they can commit their own funds toward business costs. Prospective lenders are looking for a personal investment in your business endeavors, including equipment and savings to support your business. Think of it like a down payment that shows you're committed to the project.Conditions:


Some external factors are also considered in your loan application, including the economy, industry trends and any pending legislation related to your business.Character:Your personal history also plays a role in a credit application. Some considerations of character might include industry experience, work history and personal credit history. Many lenders believe that past behavior is the best predictor for the future, and it's crucial for business owners to repay any outstanding loans and monitor the behavior of those closely associated with their businesses.Collateral:


Some lenders will want the assurance of additional assets as security for potential loan repayment. Inventory, cash and real estate can all qualify as collateral, as will secured loans and credit cards.Related: 5 Things Entrepreneurs Need to Know When Raising CapitalOther avenues for access to capitalSometimes, business owners will struggle for approval even if they meet the previously mentioned criteria and are otherwise in good financial standing. Luckily, there are options beyond traditional loans to secure capital, such as grants and community development financial institutions (CDFIs).There are thousands of federal grants that business owners can apply for, and many states and local organizations also offer specific grants for entrepreneurs. Additionally, CDFIs are lenders with a mission to provide fair, responsible financing to underserved entrepreneurs.


The small business lending space can feel overwhelming, and staying up to date on the latest programs and resources available to business owners is crucial — and not always easy.Many entrepreneurs are interested in greater educational resources around small business finances. Over the past few years, these resources have continuously improved and evolved.The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers a learning platform for small business owners, including educational and training programs. SCORE also provides educational resources across the business lifecycle, as does Bank of America's Small Business Resources site. In addition, the Bank of America Access to Capital Directory can serve as a crucial resource for business owners looking to identify sources of capital.The capital landscape and approval process can feel overwhelming at times, but by staying prepared, exploring all available options and keeping up with the latest business trends, entrepreneurs can focus less on the ins and outs of finance and more on serving their customers all summer long.

21,Debt Ceiling Plan: Here's What You Should Know and How It Impacts Your Business,"Jun 2, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/what-is-the-us-debt-ceiling-deadline-limit-default/452881,"
In January, the U.S. hit its debt limit of $31.4 trillion, which meant the federal government couldn't rack up more tabs (or borrow more money) — unless they raised or suspended the debt ceiling. Now, after weeks of negotiating, President Biden and the House Republicans reached an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and cut back on spending. The bill was passed by the Senate on Thursday night with a 63 to 36 vote.How will the debt ceiling deal affect you? It's a loaded question, so let's pull back the layers. Here's what to know.What is the debt ceiling?The debt ceiling was created by Congress in 1917 and limits how much the U.S. can borrow to fund legal obligations set by lawmakers in the past (social security, tax refunds, military salaries, interest payments on outstanding debt, medicare benefits, and more). In other words, it caps how much debt the U.S. can incur. The current debt ceiling is $31.4 trillion.



What does hitting the debt ceiling mean?Hitting the debt ceiling limit wouldn't be a hot topic if the country's revenue exceeded its costs (the government receives money primarily from individual and corporate taxes but also has other sources such as leases of government-owned buildings and land, sale of natural resources, and admission to national parks).However, the U.S. hasn't been in the green since 2001, meaning that for over 20 years, the government has had to borrow money to fund operations. Once the U.S. hit its debt limit, there were two options: raise or suspend the limit so the government can pay its bills on time or face a default.


Raising the debt ceiling would be just what it sounds like (bumping up the limit that the U.S. can borrow). Suspending the debt ceiling means that the Treasury can temporarily override the ceiling and borrow more beyond the current limit. If the U.S. were to default, the country wouldn't be able to pay its bills on time, and the economic impact would likely be felt immediately.Related: Fannie Mae Says a 'Modest Recession' Is 'Expected' in Second Half of the YearWhen was the deadline to raise or suspend the debt ceiling?Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told lawmakers in May that the U.S. will run out of funds to fulfill its financial obligations on June 5.""We now estimate that Treasury will have insufficient resources to satisfy the government's obligations if Congress has not raised or suspended the debt limit by June 5,"" Yellen wrote in a letter to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on May 26.


Fortunately, Biden and the House Republicans reached an agreement with time to spare.Has a deal been made to raise or suspend the debt ceiling?McCarthy and the Biden administration negotiated a deal to avoid a federal default after weeks of differing stances: McCarthy and House Republicans were pushing for $3.6 trillion in cuts and limits to future spending for certain programs in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, while the Biden administration was focused on raising the limit and paying bills on time before it agrees to any cuts.The bill, which calls for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts in exchange for suspending the debt ceiling for two years, passed the House on Wednesday with a 314-117 vote. The bill then went to Senate and was passed with a 63 to 36 vote on Thursday.""Tonight, senators from both parties voted to protect the hard-earned economic progress we have made and prevent a first-ever default by the United States,"" Biden said in celebration of the passage, per the New York Times. ""No one gets everything they want in a negotiation, but make no mistake: This bipartisan agreement is a big win for our economy and the American people.""


What's in the debt ceiling bill?The debt ceiling deal suspends the country's debt for two years, until January 2025 — meaning the nation can borrow money beyond the current debt limit to fulfill its financial obligations. Additionally, the deal calls for $1.5 trillion in federal spending cuts over the next decade.There will also be a two-year cap on spending growth for the 2024 fiscal year in nondefense discretionary programs such as domestic law enforcement, forest management, and scientific research. Among the biggest spending cuts will be in IRS funding, wherein $1.38 billion would be rescinded immediately if the deal goes through, and another $20 billion would be repurposed.Unspent funds from the Covid relief bill will also be scaled back, some of which will be repurposed and put towards nondefense discretionary spending.What would have happened if the U.S. defaulted? In March, Moody Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi warned that if the U.S. defaults, it would be ""catastrophic"" and Americans would likely pay for the default ""for generations.""


For example, government workers and businesses with government contracts might not get paid on time, and social security payments could stop. In a broader sense, it would also trigger ""a loss of consumer and business confidence,"" said Brookings Institution analysts Wendy Edelberg and Louise Sheiner.Would a default cause a recession?The default would essentially spark a nationwide economic collapse and induce an ""immediate, sharp recession,"" the Council of Economic Advisors warned in early May.Harry Mamaysky, professor of professional practice at Columbia Business School, told Entrepreneur that the government has ""lots of obligations to lots of people.""""At some point, when there's not enough money, they have to begin to prioritize who to pay first,"" Mamaysky said. ""Someone is not going to get paid the money that they're owed on time, and that's going to be disruptive.""


Related: Bank Failures and Inflation Making You Sweat? Here Are 3 Marketing Moves to Make Your Business Recession-Proof.However, the short-term ramifications of default could be nowhere near as damaging as the long-term implications—what Mamaysky calls a ""reputational issue"" that could call into question the U.S.'s credibility as a smart country to do business with.""That's the biggest risk to me—it isn't what happens this year or next year, but will the world perceive in five to 10 years the U.S. to be the best country in the world to conduct business?"" he said. ""It's not imminent, but if Congress doesn't watch it, they're going to erode confidence.""In May, top credit rating agency Finch placed the U.S.'s current ""AAA"" rating under ""rating watch negative,"" which means the country's perfect score might be at risk for a downgrade.


""The Rating Watch Negative reflects increased political partisanship that is hindering reaching a resolution to raise or suspend the debt limit despite the fast-approaching x date (when the U.S. Treasury exhausts its cash position and capacity for extraordinary measures without incurring new debt),"" the company said in a statement.How would a default affect small businesses?A recent report by Goldman Sachs found that 65% of small business owners would be ""negatively impacted"" if the U.S. defaults on its debt. Furthermore, 90% said it was ""very important"" that the government avoid defaulting.If the U.S. defaults, businesses with government contracts may not see payments, and shops that have customers who rely on food stamps or social security to pay for necessities may see a drop in spending.""If you're a social security recipient and you owe rent, you may not have the money to pay rent,"" Mamaysky added. ""And if the landlord owes the utility bill on their building, they may not be able to pay the utility bill because they didn't get the rent.""


Related: 7 Savings Strategies for Small Businesses in Uncertain Economic ClimatesWhat's more, a 2011 Federal Reserve of New York report said small businesses were hit the hardest during the 2008-2009 recession.According to the report, banks become ""more selective and risk-averse"" when granting loans in a recession, making it more difficult for individuals to get a small business loan.""Small firms, which rely more on external financing and tend to be riskier, are more likely to be affected by a credit crunch,"" researchers wrote.


How many times has the debt ceiling been raised or modified?Despite the current pressure to raise or suspend the debt ceiling, it's a relatively routine practice for the U.S. government. Since 1960, Congress has acted 78 times to raise, temporarily extend, or revise the definition of the debt limit to avoid a default—49 times under Republican presidents and 29 times under Democratic presidents, according to the Treasury, adding that ""Congressional leaders in both parties have recognized that this is necessary.""The most recent increase was in 2021, when the debt ceiling was raised by $2.5 trillion.What is the 14th Amendment, and what does it have to do with the debt ceiling? The 14th Amendment covers equal protection and other rights such as citizenship, state taxation, and what Congress can regulate. The fourth section of the Amendment, which covers public debt, states that the ""validity of the public debt of the United States ... shall not be questioned.""Given that the U.S. has hit its debt ceiling and may not be able to pay its bills, there is an argument that, by invoking the 14th Amendment, Biden has the legal authority to bypass Congress (which approves any action to raise or suspend the debt ceiling) and essentially continue to issue more debt through the Treasury and ignore the debt limit.


Biden was supportive but cautious about invoking the 14th Amendment as a solution.""The question is, could it be done and invoked in time that it would not be appealed, and as a consequence past the date in question and still default on the debt? That is a question that I think is unresolved,"" Biden told reporters on Sunday, per The Wall Street Journal.Some experts said that the move would be unconstitutional.""The Biden administration even flirting with these ideas really suggests that the administration's fidelity to the Constitution is questionable or opportunistic,"" Philip Wallach, a senior fellow at the center-right think tank American Enterprise Institute, told the Wall Street Journal.


Others were slightly more straightforward on their opinion of the idea, Yellen saying it could provoke a ""constitutional crisis,"" and Representative Chip Roy saying if Biden took the 14th Amendment route, the House Republicans would ""blow crap up.""

23,How to Access Capital in an Economic Downturn,"May 3, 2023",Joseph Camberato,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-to-raise-funds-for-your-business-in-an-economic-downturn/450280,"
Concerns that the U.S. is headed for a recession have been mounting for a while, especially among business owners. One survey found that eight out of 10 small business owners anticipate a recession will happen sometime this year.Recessions affect most businesses in two ways — first, revenue takes a hit as consumers start holding onto their cash instead of spending. Second, tightening credit conditions limit the number of financial resources available to help businesses weather economic challenges.Some businesses consider taking out a loan or line of credit when economic hardship is on the horizon, but is this the right move for your business?Related: How to Fund Your Budding Small Business During a RecessionShould you get a loan during a recession?You may not like the idea of taking on additional debt and wonder if applying for a loan during a recession is a good plan, but there are situations where taking out a loan or line of credit is the smartest option.



You should start by considering how much cash you have on hand. If you're heading into an economic downturn with little cash, a business loan can provide a financial buffer. Access to cash will give you options for solving challenges, making staying profitable and committed to growth that much easier.This is especially true since no one knows how long a recession will last. You may have enough cash to get you through the next six months, but that won't help if the downturn lasts two years or more.Waiting until you desperately need money can significantly reduce your options. As a downturn approaches, lenders tighten their guidelines, and you may be unable to meet their inflated eligibility requirements amid economic hardship. If you think you may need additional capital, it's best to act sooner rather than later.Lending standards are starting to tightenMany companies struggle during recessions as demand falls and uncertainty about the future increases. They'll start to look for ways to increase capital, like taking out a business loan or line of credit, but this becomes a challenge since most banks will tighten their lending standards during an economic downturn.


As the economy worsens, banks face a higher risk when lending money. Most banks will only lend money to established businesses with strong credit histories and limited industry exposure to mitigate their risk of financial loss, which inflates eligibility criteria and makes it harder for entrepreneurs to qualify altogether.Fortunately, banks and credit unions aren't the only lending institutions. Non-bank lenders don't follow the same guidelines as traditional lenders, so they can extend credit to a wide range of businesses, even during a recession.Related: Worried About Raising Capital in a Recession? Give Your Company The Edge By Doing What Other Entrepreneurs Often Overlook.Consider using a non-bank lenderA non-bank lender is a financial institution that isn't a bank or credit union. They lend money like traditional lenders but don't have a full banking license, and they don't offer things like checking and savings accounts.


There are advantages and disadvantages to going the non-bank route. While this type of lender tends to charge higher interest rates than banks or credit unions, they offer numerous quality-of-life improvements and specialized benefits, including online communications, streamlined underwriting processes, fast funding times, alternative financing solutions and more.What you lose in the cost of capital is gained through speed and efficiency. For example, you can complete the application in as little as 15 minutes at some institutions, and many lenders provide same-day or next-day funding.These loans also come with fewer stipulations about how you can spend the money, and the cost of capital can be offset with revenue-driving opportunities. For example, spending $10,000 on interest charges won't matter as much if you increase your revenue by $50,000.Plus, as you continue to build a relationship with that lender and improve your business credit score, you'll be eligible for better rates in the future.


Start looking for business financing nowAfter the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March, some economists lowered their economic growth forecasts for the year. The lending environment was already starting to weaken following numerous prime rate hikes, but the SVB crisis caused many banks to tighten their lending standards even further.In particular, small banks have to be more cautious about lending money in an effort to preserve cash. Small to medium-sized banks account for roughly 50% of commercial and industrial lending, so this will impact a number of businesses.Federal Reserve documents predicted that the fallout from the banking crisis would likely lead to a recession later this year, and it's unlikely that we'll see any significant improvements for at least two years.If you anticipate needing funds in the coming year, you should start looking for business financing now. Although you might be apprehensive, a loan or line of credit can tide your business over until the economy improves and give you the capital you need to continue growing.

25,4 Crucial Signs That Your Small Business Needs Funding,"Apr 24, 2023",Nick Chandi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-signs-that-your-small-business-needs-funding/449606,"
Every small business can agree that securing funding is vital for a small business to grow. Whether you are a fledgling start-up business launching a new product or service, or an established small business striving to maintain profitability, cash is king when it comes to driving the progress of operations.Every day, small businesses face unforeseen challenges, with shrinking margins and economic competition making it crucial to allocate sufficient cash flow for a business's financial health. According to a study by U.S. Bank, 82% of all failed businesses are due to poor cash flow management or a lack of a grasp of cash flow and its importance to its business.As a business owner, how do you avoid these catastrophes? With a staggering 90% of all start-ups failing, how can you proactively identify the signs that indicate the need for funding and stay ahead of these warning signals? Here are four signs indicating that it's time your small business needs funding.



Related: 10 Expert Tips on Managing Cash Flow as a New BusinessExperiencing gaps in cash flowA cash flow gap clearly indicates that your small business requires a funding boost, which occurs when a business pays out cash for expenses but does not receive the expected inflow of money within a reasonable timeframe.


A prime example of a cash flow gap is a business that needs to purchase supplies to create its products to generate an inventory. After spending the cash on supplies, there is a delay in receiving payment from customers, creating a gap between the outflow and inflow of cash. For instance, if customers pay for the inventory after 30 days (or even worst late payments), the period between the purchase of supplies and the receipt of payment creates the cash flow gap. Consistent widening cash flow gaps can leave your business strapped financially, potentially putting it in a dangerous position if not addressed.Related: 80% of Businesses Fail Due To a Lack of Cash. Here are 4 Reasons Why Cash Flow Forecasting Is So ImportantSeasonal downturns in the businessSeasonal fluctuations pose significant cashflow challenges for many businesses. A typical example is a restaurant operating on a beach in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. During the summer peak months from Memorial Day through Labor Day in September, the restaurant can encounter an endless stream of customers fleeing to the restaurant. Despite an influx of cash coming in, your business could face cash flow challenges between a surge in profits during peak seasons but struggle to maintain financial stability during off-seasons.With seasonal downturns and limited cash flow, the challenges of paying overhead costs with employees, rent, utility costs, etc., can create financial instability. Without proper cash flow forecasting, how can your business maintain operations and overcome these financial challenges during the off-season?


Related: 3 Cash Flow Mistakes to Avoid at All CostsThe business needs to changeEvery business needs to evolve and adapt to new challenges, as they cannot continue to operate with the same employees and equipment indefinitely. At some point, you need to invest back into the business to promote growth and development.For instance, a landscaping company has an initial upfront cost of purchasing equipment before it can hit the ground running. As the company progresses, the equipment may deteriorate and require upgrading to continue serving existing customers or expanding into new areas. Hiring skilled employees or investing in new equipment upgrades will be needed to help expand your capacities. In order for your business to meet these needs, It's essential to reserve sufficient funds to meet these necessary investments.Opportunities happenExpecting the unexpected and be ready no matter what is the heartstring of all business owners. It's unclear what the next card in the deck will reveal, especially when exciting opportunities arise. Hence the need for agility despite the size of your businesses. Small business owners must be particularly vigilant about having enough capital to invest in new opportunities that arise.In this constantly changing landscape, your business needs to be in a strong financial position to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. Whether it's purchasing another business, opening a new location, launching a new product or the immediate need for available capital investment, the ability to act quickly can make all the difference. Without sufficient cash, your businesses can struggle to capitalize on these exciting opportunities, resulting in missed opportunities or financial losses.

26,Why Entrepreneurs Shouldn't Worry About Interest Rate Changes,"Apr 14, 2023",Roy Dekel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-entrepreneurs-shouldnt-worry-about-interest-rate/449125,"
As an entrepreneur, you're likely keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve and its efforts to cool inflation. It's natural for business leaders to watch interest rate hikes closely. But despite uncertain forecasts and any banking turmoil, there's no need to panic. Here's why:Your business should always come first, regardless of interest ratesNo matter how interest rates go up or down, it's important to remember that your business comes first. As an entrepreneur, you need to trust in your business and its ability to adapt to changing market conditions. Interest rates may fluctuate, but your business should remain your top priority.If you believe in your business, you should be confident in its ability to weather any storm. While rising interest rates can pose challenges, they can also present opportunities for growth and innovation. By staying focused on your business goals and remaining flexible, you can navigate any changes in the market and emerge even stronger.



It's important to remember that interest rates are just one factor that can impact your business's success. By focusing on other areas, such as product development, marketing and customer service, you can ensure that your business remains competitive and profitable, regardless of interest rate fluctuations.Related: Inflation Is a Risk for Your Business, But Doesn't Have to Spell Doom


Take on debt to invest in your businessAs an entrepreneur, taking on debt is often a necessary part of growing and expanding your business. Interest rates can play a significant role in determining the cost of borrowing, but they should not be the sole factor in your decision-making process. In fact, it is always advantageous to take on a debt no matter what the interest rate levels are.But before taking on debt, make sure you understand and tick each point:Make sure you have a solid plan in place for how you will use the borrowed funds: What specific investments do you plan to make? How will those investments help grow your business and increase profitability? By having a clear plan in place, you can make sure that you are using debt strategically to support your long-term goals.Consider the costs and risks associated with borrowing: While interest rates may be low, you will still need to pay interest on the borrowed funds. Additionally, there may be fees and other costs associated with taking on debt. Make sure you carefully evaluate the costs and risks before deciding to borrow.Shop around for the best interest rates and terms: Different lenders may offer different rates and terms, so it's important to do your research and compare options before deciding where to borrow from.Have a plan in place for how you will repay the borrowed funds: Taking on debt can be a valuable tool for growing your business, but it's important to make sure that you can repay the debt on schedule.How to leverage debt to grow your business during inflationary periodsIf you're confident in your business model and have a plan for how to use borrowed funds, taking on debt can help you grow your business faster than you would be able to otherwise.But when inflation is high, it can be challenging to navigate how to leverage debt to grow your business. Here are some tips to help you make the most of your borrowing during inflationary periods:


Take advantage of fixed interest rate: If you can secure a fixed interest rate, it can protect you from rising inflation rates. As inflation goes up, so does the cost of borrowing, but a fixed-rate loan will lock in your interest rate at the time of borrowing.Consider short-term loans: Inflation typically leads to higher interest rates, so opting for a short-term loan can help you avoid paying higher interest rates over an extended period.Be cautious about long-term commitment: Long-term loans and investments can be riskier during periods of high inflation. While it may be tempting to lock in a low-interest rate for a longer period, you may end up paying more in interest over time.Look for opportunities to invest in assets that will appreciate: During inflation, assets like real estate and precious metals tend to appreciate. If you can borrow money to invest in these assets, you may be able to benefit from their increased value over time.Focus on revenue-generating investments: When borrowing during inflation, it's essential to focus on investments that will generate revenue and help you pay off your debt faster. This could include expanding your business operations or investing in marketing and advertising to attract new customers.Related: 4 Ways to Deal With High Interest Rates in Every Part of Your BusinessMake long-term goals your priorityRather than worrying about short-term fluctuations in interest rates, it's important to keep your eyes on the bigger picture.

Focus on making smart investments, building a strong team and staying true to your values and mission.Stay agile and adaptableAs an entrepreneur, you're no stranger to uncertainty and volatility.

27,Why Customer Confidence Always Comes First,"Apr 11, 2023",Scott Ford,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-customer-confidence-always-comes-first/448471,"
If you're in the professional services industry, take a step back and watch what's happening in the banking industry right now. As of this writing in late March 2023, two banks have failed in the US, and the FDIC stepped in to support the depositors, making them whole. This means the money was not lost per se but rather inconvenienced momentarily.However, in the week following, over 120 billion dollars flowed back into the nation's top 25 biggest banks.This should scream to you that consumer confidence is the most important aspect of the client relationship. Period.



Using banking as an example, customers are always on the lookout for the best deals. They want the lowest interest rates on loans, the highest interest rates on savings and the best customer service. This is why many customers opt for local and regional banks. These institutions often offer better rates and more personalized service than larger banks.Related: Analysts Remain Bullish On These 3 Regional Banks


However, when the economy takes a turn for the worse, and a couple of small banks fail, it can quickly shake customers' confidence. Suddenly, the safety and security of their funds become the priority, and they run back to the big banks they once avoided and likely still loathe.Need more examples? If you're hiring a CPA for your company's tax return, what's more important: customer service and friendliness or your tax bill? Would you feel okay paying more in tax if they responded to your emails and were friendly? Probably not.How about this — if you were wrongly accused of a crime and needed to hire a defense attorney, which is more important? Hourly fees, customer service or the ability to get you out of jail. See what I'm saying now?The worst part of all this is that the overwhelming majority of local or regional banks are probably doing just fine. All it took to move all those billions of dollars back to the big banks was the mere thought of a small chance of failure (even though it's still FDIC insured). The slightest sliver of doubt sent them running back to the perceived safety (and horrible service and rates) of big banks without even giving the local guys a chance to defend themselves.


Related: Banks or VCs; Where Should Startups Seek Funds?In banking, law and all professional services, confidence must come first, followed by customer service. Clients are willing to overlook customer service issues if they have confidence in the provider's ability to deliver results. This is not to say that customer service is not important. It is crucial in building and maintaining client relationships. However, it is not the primary driver of the client's decision-making process. I always say, ""People work with people they like,"" but I should add that they only work with people they know can get the job done, then they pick the one they like most.So, how can professional service providers build and maintain client confidence? There are a few key strategies that can be employed:1. Build a strong reputation. Reputation is everything in the professional services industry. A provider's reputation is built on their track record of delivering results, expertise and ability to meet client needs.


Saved a client some money on their taxes? — make sure you tell everyone you know.Win a big case? — tell everyone you know! Spread the word!2. Communicate often. This transparency can help build trust and confidence in the provider's ability to deliver results. Taking a personalized approach and communicating frequently can show clients that they are important and that their needs are being met.3. Embrace technology. Like it or not, technology is changing how professional services are delivered. By embracing technology, you stay current in the world. This also instills confidence that you're able to keep up in the changing world and are at the forefront of your industry. That CPA that ""doesn't do email"" probably isn't as up-to-date on recent tax law changes either.


Remember to be the person they trust; then be the person they like.

28,4 Tips to Manage and Avoid This Startup Killer,"Mar 10, 2023",Nitin Kumar,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-ways-to-address-and-avoid-this-startup-killer/446446,"
Technical debt occurs when development teams take shortcuts to expedite delivery and build code that later needs to be refactored, i.e., prioritizing speed over perfect code. It is also a tool to get ahead, and if you choose to have technical debt, it must have strategy, intent, reasoning and a payoff plan. Technical debt can occur across many dimensions like in architecture, test automation, infrastructure, organization, process, design and defects.In an agile development world, a company always carries a certain amount of technical debt that is considered healthy; only when the threshold is broken does it quickly spirals out. Waterfall teams operate in a zero-tolerance mode for technical debt, a rare and inflexible practice today. Business stakeholders have slightly more tolerance for minor debt and can understand the trade-offs, while technical leaders are tougher on it. However, if you see the situation reversed in your organization, you have bigger problems at play.Startups feel the pressure to ship and show momentum forcing some early debt to tradeoff against a delayed launch. If these debt items may grow beyond a point, the traction alone will not yield funding at an ideal valuation. Venture capitalists want their money to scale, and the thought of using it to pay back debt is scary.



For early-stage companies, taking on too much technical debt causes product destabilization. I have seen teams working for 12 months on customization and then losing another 12 months to merge and stabilize while delaying their fundraising after failing technical due diligence.Related: How Should Entrepreneurs Manage Their Debt?


Valuation implications of technical debtTechnical debt is real as interest payments — and the installments of these payments — come out of your valuation, manifesting itself on your P/L in multiple ways. Here are several of these ways:Heavy technical debt-laden companies require more headcount to run existing operations and more developer time to build new capabilities.Overheads from the delayed realization of synergies from any acquisition made carrying costs for a longer time.Possible remediation fines in compliance and security breachesLoss of customers and pipeline due to poor customer experience, system outages, degraded performance, timeline delays and inefficient marketing spending.Increased working capital requirements for companies with higher inventory balances.Spikes in cloud spending costs, small CapEx turning into monumental OpEx.Inability to adapt quickly to market changes, causing predatory moves from competitors.Multiple versions of the truth create an inability to convert data into information, slowing and lowering the quality of decision-making.Lower staff productivity and morale; the opportunity cost of management distractionsMultiple rejections from venture capitalists create questions on company viability.As a startup's go-to-market becomes feature-rich, the technical debt multiplies and the underlying architecture gets exposed for its limitations. Many startups discover that the short-term technical convenience may have killed the company's long-term success. The technical foundation of any software product is fundamental to future scaling and maintainability. Startups usually work with an 18–24-month runway between funding rounds, and heavier debt built up in its early days could shorten this runway by a quarter or two.Related: A New Economy is Coming. Here Are 5 Ways to Prepare Your Mindset for Personal SuccessManaging technical debtTechnical debt is always hard to see and easy to feel. One must be conscious about tackling the root causes rather than the visible symptoms.1. Admit the problemMany technical and business executives do not admit this problem and get defensive during technical due diligence; most savvy VCs can see through this and will not throw money to fix the broken.2. Estimate, prioritize and commitRemediation must be ongoing and prioritized against growth features, and resources must be committed to resolving it early. It is a tricky situation to manage technical debt while balancing customer needs and new product enhancements. Many startups are guilty of chasing cash flow and traction in the short term but killing their valuations when they come up for funding.


3. Decompose the problemsPeople criticize agile methodologies for being unstructured and lacking adequate planning. However, agile is the new norm aligning with the business velocity needs of the new era. Managing technical debt in agile requires decomposing the product features into shippable pieces aligned with long-term and valuation-driving goals. All technical debt items must be cataloged in the product backlog. I used to scrutinize the backlog for technical debt items when I conducted diligences for funding or M&A; it is a practice professionals follow to the core.4. Be disciplinedThe easiest way to avoid and combat technical debt. Good executives understand the cost of short-term velocity and the risk of delivering customer-specific builds. Like financial debt, the longer any debt is ignored, the harder it is to stabilize and scale. Pick the right technologies and make hard decisions to retire them as soon as they are not fit for purpose, and don't undertake nasty workarounds.


Related: Five Easy Ways Startups Can Manage Debts From Day OneConcluding thoughtsTechnical debt and its implications are widespread, and the interest on this is repaid by the hour, even if it is not apparent to the executives. Like financial debt, the technical debt must be paid off as it has suffocated many companies' growth and pushed some to the verge of bankruptcy.Unlike financial debt, growing technical debt has no formal controls like credit committees, treasury staff or asset liability teams to enforce ongoing tracking. Technical debt must be paid off and costs capital — this will eventually come from the company's future value (like the value robbed out of shareholders and investors.) The technical debt issue is an area of savvy investors' diligence with much more rigor lately. Many companies don't get funded or pay the price with a lower valuation when the diligence uncovers material technical debt.A level of technical debt is unavoidable and considered the cost of doing business, but it must be handled correctly to ensure a startup's long-term viability.

29,How to Lower Your Personal Loan Payments,"Mar 2, 2023",Baruch Mann (Silvermann),https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-to-lower-your-personal-loan-payments/443959,"
Personal loans are a great way to access funds for various business purposes, but if the payments are too high, they can become a burden on your cash flow.With rates increasing, you may find that your personal loan repayments have become more expensive. Whether you have just one personal loan or multiple loans, if your monthly payments have increased, it can make it more difficult to manage your money and stay on top of debt.One of the ways that you can reduce your financial burden is by lowering personal loan payments. Personal loans are a great way to access funds for various business purposes, but if the payments are too high, they can become a burden on your cash flow.



Here are some strategies for lowering your personal loan payments as an entrepreneur.Repay earlyThis is an ideal scenario, and even if you can't repay the loan in full, you can reduce the amount of interest and lower your payments. If you have savings, you can make a lump sum payment on your loans. Just be sure to check if any of your loans have early repayment fees. If so, you will incur a hefty percentage fee, and it could negate the early repayment.


If you don't have savings, it may be time to take a look at your budget. If you don't have a budget, set one. Take a look at your bank statements, credit card bills and other paperwork to calculate all your essential costs, including rent or mortgage payments, food costs, utilities and taxes.Next, look at what you spend on non-essentials and see if there are areas where you can make cuts. Of course, you don't need to live a spartan life, but do you really need two or three television subscription services? Can you cut down on dining out twice a month rather than every week? Any extra money you can find within your budget can go towards paying off your personal loan.Related: 8 Things Entrepreneurs Should Look for When Getting a Business LoanAdjust the loan termAnother way to lower your payments is by extending the loan term. This will reduce the monthly payments but increase the overall interest you pay over the life of the loan. This strategy may be a good option if you need some time to build up your business and increase your income.


You will need to speak to your lender or arrange a new loan deal for this approach. Increasing the loan term will reduce your monthly repayments, but you will pay more in the long term. However, if you're feeling the pinch and are prepared to repay your loan over a longer term, it could be an option for you. If you have extra cash, you could put this towards reducing your loan term. If you arrange to repay your loan over a shorter period, you'll pay more now but end up paying less interest and clearing the loan more quickly.Get an income boostIf you have extra cash flow, making extra payments on your loan can help you pay off the loan faster and lower your overall interest costs. This can also help improve your credit score, making it easier to secure funding in the future.You will need to think about this strategy according to your specific circumstances. You may be able to negotiate a pay raise at your current job or switch to a better-paying job.However, for many business owners, these options are not possible, so you may need to look at a side hustle. There are a number of side gigs in the marketplace, such as food delivery, ridesharing, freelancing and many other ways to monetize one of your existing skills or hobbies. You could even consider selling any unwanted items online or renting out space in your home.


This doesn't necessarily mean that you'll need to have a roommate — many sites allow you to rent out garage space, driveways and other areas that allow you to maintain your privacy and earn a side income. You can then use this additional income to reduce your debt.Related: What is a Good Personal Loan Interest Rate?RefinanceIf you have a good credit score and a stable income, you may be eligible to refinance your personal loan at a lower interest rate. This can significantly lower your monthly payments, making them more manageable for your business.A debt consolidation loan will allow you to merge all your unsecured debt into one loan. This is a sound strategy, particularly if you also have high-interest credit card debt. You'll not only enjoy lower monthly repayments, but your obligations will be easier to manage as you'll have just one bill each month. In some cases, you may be able to lock in a reduced rate, making your debt more affordable.


Just be aware that refinancing will require a hard credit search which could impact your credit score. You will also need to choose your loan options carefully, as some deals are only available to those with excellent credit. If your credit score has dropped since you took out your current personal loans, you may be offered a higher rate — which means your debt will cost you more in the short and long term.Contact your lenderIf you have a good payment history and a solid business plan, you may be able to negotiate with your lender for a lower interest rate. This can be done by providing financial statements and a business plan that shows how you plan to improve your income. Many lenders are willing to work with those who are having payment difficulties.Your lender may be willing to accept a number of scenarios, including creating a different repayment schedule, settling the debt with a smaller lump sum payment or temporarily putting your payments into forbearance. This allows you to temporarily stop making payments so that you can get your finances under control.If you are negotiating with your lender, make sure you ask what they will report to the credit bureaus so that you know how settling your debt will impact your credit. You should know beforehand that your credit score could take a hit.


Related: What You Need to Know About Personal LoansMany of us are feeling the effects of the uncertainty in the economy right now, so it is natural to be concerned about your personal loan obligations. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to lower your personal loan payments. However, it is important to think about how making changes to your personal loan will impact your credit in the future.If you're experiencing temporary financial issues, it may be better to tighten your financial belt for a few months to get over a hump rather than taking action that may have adverse effects on your credit. The sooner that you recognize that your personal loan payments could be a difficulty, the better your chances of finding an effective solution.

30,How to Rebuild Credit After Bankruptcy,"Feb 28, 2023",Baruch Mann (Silvermann),https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-to-rebuild-credit-after-bankruptcy/443961,"
Bankruptcy can provide financial relief, but the downside is that it can negatively impact credit. While bankruptcy will remain on a credit report for as long as 10 years, the impact will lessen with time. Whether you filed Chapter 7 (which means you have the ability to pay back your debts) or Chapter 13 (you're required to pay your creditors all of your disposable income), it is possible to start rebuilding credit with some simple measures.Rebuilding credit after bankruptcy as an entrepreneur can be challenging, but it's not impossible. The first step is understanding that rebuilding credit takes time and consistent effort.How bankruptcy affects creditPayment history is one of the most important factors when determining credit scores. When someone files for bankruptcy, the individual won't be repaying covered debts in full as per the original credit agreement. This means that when filing for bankruptcy, it can have a severe negative impact on someone's credit score.



A bankruptcy filing will appear on an individual's credit report for up to 10 years, making it difficult to obtain credit or loans in the future. An entrepreneur may also have difficulty obtaining credit from suppliers or vendors, as they may be hesitant to extend credit to a business that has filed for bankruptcy.Regardless of the bankruptcy type, lenders will see it on a credit report within the public records section, and it is likely to be a decision-making factor. After completing the legal process, it will show the bankruptcy and included debts that have been discharged.


However, it's important to note that filing for bankruptcy can also provide a fresh start for an entrepreneur, allowing them to discharge debt and start anew.When applying for credit, lenders may not approve certain types of credit — and even if approved, an individual may find that they're offered higher interest rates or other unfavorable terms.Related: How This Entrepreneur Achieved His Greatest Success After His Worst FailureCan I get a credit card after bankruptcy?It can be difficult for an entrepreneur to get a credit card after filing for bankruptcy. Many lenders view individuals who have filed for bankruptcy as a higher risk. However, it is possible to get a credit card after bankruptcy, but it may take time and effort.


The best approach is to apply for a card that is specifically designed to help rebuild credit. An ideal card option is a secured credit card — approval is possible even with a fresh bankruptcy. Secured cards typically have a credit limit equal to the amount of security deposit that is provided.However, some unsecured card issuers won't pull a credit score or may extend a line of credit even if there are blemishes on someone's credit history. Just be aware that these types of cards typically have extremely high rates and an abundance of fees. A secured card is likely the better option with lower costs.The best ways to build credit after bankruptcyAs soon as a bankruptcy has been finalized, the individual can start working on building credit. Some of the best ways include the following:Maintain payments on non-bankruptcy accountsAfter filing, determine if any accounts have not been closed. While bankruptcy cancels most debt, there may be some remaining. Paying down these balances can lower the debt-to-income ratio — making timely payments remains crucial. Consistent payments will also help with staying on top of bills.


Keep credit balances as low as possibleCredit balances not only impact the credit utilization ratio but depending on how the need to file for bankruptcy was developed, people should look to avoid falling into the same habits. Reduce credit card usage and pay down balances — it will benefit your financial health.Build emergency savingsSave some money each payday to build emergency savings. This will provide a fund for unexpected expenses, which will help to avoid incurring future debt that could impede rebuilding credit.Get a secured cardAs we touched on above, a secured credit card could help with rebuilding credit. While a security deposit is necessary, each time that a repayment is made on the card's account, it will be reported to the credit bureaus. This will demonstrate responsible credit behavior.Some secured card issuers allow cardholders to move on to an unsecured card after making consistent and on-time payments. This is a great benefit as there will be no need to apply for a new card as credit starts to improve.


Consider credit builder loansA credit builder loan could be another way to help build credit. An individual will need to have a certain amount of money held in a secured savings account, but the individual can make monthly payments until the loan amount is repaid. Depending on the lender, it is also possible to have a secured loan that allows borrowing against savings.As with a traditional loan, the payment activity for a credit builder loan will be reported to the major credit bureau, which will help to improve credit scores over time.Related: I Filed for Bankruptcy at Age 21How long until credit improves?This will depend on an individual's specific circumstances, but if someone is making consistent payments, and has a low credit utilization ratio and low debt-to-income ratio, they should start to see positive changes to their credit score after approximately six months.


However, be prepared to take a long-term approach. Remember that bankruptcy will be on a credit report for seven to 10 years. While the effects will diminish over time, responsible behavior will lead to improvements. Stay patient.Related: 6 Steps Resilient Entrepreneurs Take to Rebound From BankruptcyCan I get a mortgage after bankruptcy?There is no need to wait for bankruptcy to disappear from a credit report to apply for a mortgage. However, if applying for a conventional mortgage, an individual will need to wait at least four years after bankruptcy has been discharged. If there are extraneous circumstances, it may be possible after two years.

31,How to Pick the Right Debt Provider for Your Business,"Feb 3, 2023",Tim Makhauri,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-choose-the-right-debt-provider-for-your-business/440451,"
When founders think of raising debt, they often imagine going to a bank. In my three years advising companies on debt financing options, I frequently remind founders that banks are certainly an option — but not the only one. Founders exploring debt should familiarize themselves with all of the options in the market, from traditional asset-based loans to more innovative venture debt and revenue-based financing solutions.These various lenders don't just have distinctive structures and terms for their capital, they also each have a particular set of criteria to qualify for a loan. By acquainting yourself with the entire market upfront, you can focus on the lenders that suit your business the best, maximize the number of term sheets you receive and spend less time chasing dead ends.Related: Why Founders Should Embrace Debt Alongside Equity



BanksBanks themselves come in various shapes and sizes. When it comes to business loans, you have your regional community banks, large multinational banks and specialized venture debt banks. Sometimes one large bank may roll up all of these divisions under one roof, providing a range of options from revolving lines of credit, term loans, warehouse lines and more.Oftentimes these banks have access to the cheapest available capital and therefore can offer you the lowest interest rate. But bear in mind that while this is usually the cheapest option, banks also have a high bar to qualify for their capital. They may include covenants or other performance requirements to ensure the business continues to meet their benchmarks throughout the duration of the loan.


For many small businesses, taking a loan from a local community bank can be a simple low-cost option. But be aware that they may have minimum asset or cash flow requirements to qualify or even ask for a personal guarantee.Venture debt banks, on the other hand, specialize in VC-backed cash-burning businesses that show huge growth potential. Oftentimes, getting a loan from one of these banks requires several rounds of equity from brand-name venture capital funds, providing up to 25-35% of your most recent equity raise amount.Eventually, once your business is generating several millions of dollars in cash flow, an even wider spectrum of bank options opens up including some of the largest multinational banks.Venture debt fundsMore traditional venture debt offerings are very similar to those one would find at a bank. A three- to four-term loan structure is standard, though generally, rates are more expensive than banks with the flipside of a greater quantum of capital.


Similarly, venture debt funds look for VC-backed companies or at least some form of institutional backing, rapid growth and high LTV/CAC. More bespoke options do exist as well, oftentimes branded as growth debt rather than venture debt, since they can provide capital to angel-backed or even fully bootstrapped businesses.Both of these options typically come at a cost of capital in the teens with interest-only periods and can be quite creative in structure. Founders should be aware that for both venture debt banks and funds, loan packages often come with warrants — effectively an option to purchase shares of the company in the future at a fixed price. Meaning, a small amount of dilution should be expected, though some lenders in this space pride themselves on being fully non-dilutive.Related: When is the Best Time to Raise Venture Debt – Here's the KeyRevenue-based financing (RBF)An increasingly popular non-dilutive financing solution for early-stage companies is technically not debt. Revenue-based financing functions more akin to a cash advance. Capital injections are repaid as a percentage of monthly revenues, as opposed to a fixed principal repayment schedule.


If you're looking for the fastest path to receiving capital, revenue-based financing is the solution. Many firms that use API integrations to your accounting and commerce data are able to aggregate that data through their underwriting systems and offer terms in 24-48 hours.While this capital tends to be on the more expensive side, speed and flexibility make up for it. Unlike other lenders, RBF facilities usually don't require collateral or impose restrictive covenants that may limit your ability to grow.In terms of qualifying for an RBF, monthly revenue minimums can be as low as $10K with at least six months of operating history. The crucial requirement is to show evidence of recurring revenue. This usually means SaaS revenue with low churn, but can also be applied to most subscription-style businesses or even transactional ecommerce businesses that show a strong history of sticky customers.Non-bank cash flow lendingTraditional private credit funds lend to established companies that have several years of traction under their belts. They generally are EBITDA or cash flow positive, some starting at as low as $3M annual EBITDA while others require $10M+. Businesses can be founder or sponsor-owned, and range from fast-growing later-stage tech companies to more traditional businesses and even turnaround financing for distressed situations.


Use of capital covers a huge spectrum from funding leveraged buyouts or asset purchases to growth capital. Funding structures run the gamut, from senior secured to mezzanine debt (below senior lenders but above equity-holders) or even preferred equity in the capital stack. Rates are typically higher than banks from single digits to mid-teens, with three- to five-year terms. Closing fees and exit fees are common, as are covenants, and loan sizes are derived either holistically on the business fundamentals or as a function of cash flow.Non-bank asset-based lending (ABL)An ABL facility allows borrowers to use an asset as collateral for a line of credit or term loan. The asset can be as liquid as accounts receivable and inventory or as illiquid as real estate or a specific piece of equipment. Some of these loans can be secured with just one asset. For instance, a company needs a new warehouse and gets ABL financing for that, or it could be a combination like A/R and inventory.Asset-based lenders will often focus on a specific industry and require a minimum amount of whichever asset(s) they specialize in (accounts receivable, inventory, capital equipment, real estate or even intellectual property). Those assets can be held on the books as collateral or in some cases purchased outright at a discount (receivables factoring, for example).Unlike the other debt facilities covered, ABLs normally carve out a specific asset rather than taking a security interest on the entire company. This lowers the risk for borrowers and provides some flexibility to stack on additional debt, provided they can cover it. The advance rate (the amount of cash you get up-front) is usually between 50% and 90% of the value of the pledged assets.


Related: The Old-School Solution to Cash Flow Problems Hiding in Your ReceivablesQuestions to ask yourselfAs you consider which debt provider to approach, you need to think about the characteristics of the funding vehicle that will unlock the long-term potential of your business — while covering your short-term cash flow needs. Don't forget that each lender has its own unique criteria. Fundraising without a clear plan of action can become a huge time suck for founders, pulling them away from operating the business. By strategizing upfront and learning the market, you can ensure that you only spend valuable time with lenders that can provide a real offer.Once the term sheets are in hand, you can now leverage them and pick the terms that are best for you.

33,Getting a Loan in 2023 Could be Harder — But Not Impossible (If You Know Where to Look). Here Are 10 Ways You Can Obtain One.,"Jan 7, 2023",Gene Marks,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/10-places-to-get-loans-in-2023/441721,"
As I write this, commercial interest rates — the rate businesses pay for working capital, equipment and property loans — have more than doubled over this past year. My clients are now seeing commercial rates exceed 10% — that's going to be a big challenge for those that rely on debt to fund their operations and expansion, let alone those entrepreneurs looking to startup and grow their businesses.The financing environment will be tough in 2023. Less businesses will get approved for loans as the financial services industry contracts in response to continued high interest, inflation and a slowing economy. But it's not a catastrophe. There will be money out there if you're willing to pay for it. Here are your best choices to consider.Related: 5 Best and Fast Small-Business Loans (Some of Which You've Never Heard of)



Big bank loansFor starters, if you don't need a loan, then you should definitely go to a traditional bank. I'm kidding, of course. But traditional banks — and you know the names — are the most risk-averse of all lenders. They are going to lend money to businesses that have collateral, history, solid credit and the ability to pay the loans back almost without question. Interest rates and terms, assuming you meet those requirements, will always be the most favorable compared to other financing options.Small bank loansBesides the big banks, there are independent and community banks and credit unions all of which offer different types of loan arrangements and may be more amenable to dealing with a smaller company that isn't as qualified to get a loan from a big bank. But still, these banks, though a little more entrepreneurial, tend to also be very risk averse and will require significant due diligence.


SBA LoansThe best option in 2023 is to seek out a loan from a lender certified by the Small Business Administration. Those loans (called Section 7a or 504) can be offered at market or slightly above market interest rates. Because most of the amounts are guaranteed by the federal government, the banks offering these loans can do so to smaller companies with less of a financial history or collateral available and are less at risk. But it's still not a slam dunk and you'll have plenty of hoops to jump through.Related: How to Navigate the Volatile Business-Funding EnvironmentOnline lendersIf you're looking for a very short-term loan to satisfy an immediate financing need (a big inventory purchase, a down payment on a lease, a deposit on a new piece of equipment) you can try an online banker like Kabbage, Fundbox and OnDeck. These companies charge extremely high annual interest rates, but no sane business person would borrow from them for the long term. The upside is that these services provide funds very quickly — in some cases within 24 to 48 hours — and (as opposed to many banks) are more technology-oriented to gather data, monitor their loans and communicate issues.Merchant advancesIf you're in the retail world then you might want to consider a merchant advance, which are short-term loans provided by popular payment services like Square, PayPal and QuickBooks Merchant Services. Your loan qualifications are determined by your actual sales volume to which these payment services are privy because, well, they're already handling your cash. Like online lenders, interest rates are much higher than what traditional banks offer but the funds are quickly deposited in your account and payback is done automatically through the sales transactions you record with the service.


SSBCIIf you're a very small business or a minority business owner or someone located in a lower-income part of the world then you should definitely look into the State Small Business Credit Imitative.  Thanks to prior pandemic-related legislation, $10 billion is being distributed this year and next by the Treasury Department to states (based on a number of factors) that will then be allocated to local nonprofits and other organizations that support small and minority-owned businesses. You can Google your state and the State Small Business Credit initiative to find out what organizations are getting this funding and then apply directly to those organizations. Grants and equity investments are also available through this program.Micro loansFor startups and very small businesses, you can also look for microloans offered by nonprofit organizations like Kiva, for example. These amounts are — by definition — very small but organizations like this one also provide good consulting services and can connect you to other places that offer finances for companies at your early stage.Private lendersAlthough these companies don't charge as much interest as some of the short-term online lenders mentioned previously, interest rates are still higher but so are approval rates. Collateral — oftentimes receivables (for companies that ""factor these amounts) and inventory — will be required. The best place to find these lenders (and other more traditional forms of financing) are platforms like Lendio and Fundera which offer a ""marketplace"" of different vehicles provided by their partners and an easy way to apply for them all.Credit cardsWhat about credit card financing? You know you'll pay a hefty interest rate but don't knock it entirely — it may be a bad choice unless it's for very short-term needs. Just make sure you're not building your business around credit card debt because as interest rates continue to rise, so will credit card rates.


Family and friendsFinally, there are friends and family. A lot's been written on this so I don't have to tell you of the potential perils. You already know them. But getting a loan from a reasonable friend or family member can provide you with a reasonable rate of interest and flexibility. It all depends on the people involved.The takeaway is that 2023 will be a tough year for financing. But not impossible. Just make sure you can afford it. And give yourself the flexibility to renegotiate in the future when rates do eventually come down.

34,"How to Change Your Money Mindset in 2023, According to This Couple Who Paid Off More Than $100,000 in Debt","Jan 3, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-to-make-more-money-in-2023-according-to-the-fi-couple/441333,"
It was 2017, the year before they got married, when Ali and Josh Lupo took a serious look at their finances — and realized they owed more than $100,000 in student loans.Despite working long, hard hours in human services, the couple was still living paycheck-to-paycheck, unsure how they'd afford a wedding or pay off their staggering debt.""So we started having that conversation of: 'Is this what we want to do for the next 30 to 40 years, or do we want to start learning how to live differently?' And that was where our mindset around money really started to evolve,"" Josh tells Entrepreneur.



The Lupos began tracking their expenses and saw they spent most of their income on rent and car payments, followed by food and dining out. Their first plan of attack? Implementing a strict budget: No date nights, no Netflix subscription, etc.But the extreme approach burned the couple out quickly, so they went back to the drawing board. They needed to find a creative way to reduce their largest expense: housing.


Self-education led them to a solution (Ali emphasizes how many online resources, podcasts and books on financial freedom exist). If the Lupos purchased a multi-family home with a low down payment, they could dramatically decrease their monthly payments by renting out the other unit.So that's exactly what they did.In the years since then, the Lupos have continued their journey to financial independence. They manage numerous streams of active and passive income, including their work as personal-finance content creators running the educational platform ""The FI Couple.""If you're ready to get your finances on track in 2023, read on for the Lupos' step-by-step strategy.


Define what success looks like for youThe first step is the foundation for all the rest: Figure out your unique definition of success.The couple suggests considering what your ideal day and life look like. In other words, be clear about how financial freedom will allow you to do more of the things that make you happy.""Our life was 'easier' when our heads were in the sand, ignoring everything about our finances,"" Ali says. ""Our lives are more complicated and harder now because we're more in tune with all of the responsibilities that come with this. But to have the power and autonomy over our time is worth all of it, so [you have to be] clear with your why.""Related: How to Train Your Brain and Reach the Highest Levels of Success


Build a community that can help you stay the courseThe road to financial freedom can be a difficult one, but it's even harder for those going it alone.Finding a community geared towards financial wellness can make all the difference, according to the Lupos.""Unfortunately, being financially savvy is not the norm,"" Josh says, ""and pursuing financial independence can get lonely because a lot of people aren't necessarily living the same lifestyle. So whether it's in person or online, having that community of like-minded people can be really inspiring.""Related: The Key Benefits of Building an Online Community


Know your numbers: income, expenses, assets and debtsAnother critical move? Get thoroughly acquainted with the reality of your financial picture.As of September 2022, consumer debt in the U.S. was at $16.5 trillion, according to Bankrate. But many Americans are unaware of how much they actually owe: A 2019 survey from U.S. News found that one in five Americans doesn't know if they have credit card debt.The Lupos stress the value of familiarizing yourself with all of your numbers.""So literally outlining and understanding your income, expenses, assets and debts,"" Ali explains, ""and having a crystal clear understanding of your financial situation.""

""We decided to focus on how we could radically lower our expenses to increase our savings,"" Josh says, ""and doing so helped us pay off all the debt and buy real estate.""""If you're able to increase your income and reduce your expenses, you'll have more of a gap in between,"" Ali adds, ""and what you do with that gap is the key to becoming financially independent.""Never underestimate your earning potential either.""Coming from backgrounds in social work and human services that are historically lower-income opportunities, for a long time we identified ourselves as people [whose] value was a little bit lower and [thought] earning more just simply wasn't in the cards,"" Josh says. ""In hindsight though, [the key is] getting around the right people and understanding different opportunity vehicles.""

""So you have to [ask], What strategy makes sense for me? Do I want to invest in stocks? Do I want to invest in real estate? Do I want to be a business owner?""


""We talk to people all the time,"" she continues. ""They say, 'I want to buy real estate.' But then we talk to them, and I'm like, 'It doesn't really sound like you want real estate. Because real estate's not that passive — and it's a little more hands-on.' You really have to think about which investing strategy makes sense for [your] life.""Real estate isn't always ""passive""Then again, neither are 40-50 hour weeks at a jobAt least with real estate ""hard"" weeks are still only 2-3 hours of work— TheFIcouple (@theficouple) December 11, 2022Maybe the most important thing to keep in mind, though? Don't forget to enjoy the journey to financial freedom.""When we first started out, it felt like a chore,"" Ali says. ""Through the process, we've learned that the journey to financial independence is more important than the destination and that it's really important that whatever you do to get there is sustainable and you don't sacrifice the quality of your life to achieve [your] goal. Because then once you get to the goal, what life do you have?""

Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only. It should not be considered legal or financial advice. You should consult with an attorney or other financial professional to determine what may be best for your individual needs.A college education in the U.S. might be expensive, but it's still accessible to many American students thanks to federal student loans. The only problem: It can be tough to know which student loans to choose from, mainly subsidized vs. unsubsidized student loans.If you're unsure what to borrow or the difference between these student loan types, you've come to the right place. Read on for more information about subsidized and unsubsidized student loans.



What are subsidized student loans?A subsidized student loan, also called a direct subsidized loan, is a federal student loan available to undergraduate students if they show sufficient financial need.Being subsidized means interest rates are temporarily paid for or halted by the government, and are generally much lower than unsubsidized loans. This allows students to focus on education without worrying about interest accruing on them for some of their terms.


More specifically, the US Department of Education pays all of the interest on subsidized student loans so long as the borrower is enrolled at least half-time in school. This arrangement continues for six months after graduation and during other applicable deferment periods.What are unsubsidized student loans?An unsubsidized student loan is also a kind of federal student loan. But unlike subsidized loans, the interest rates for unsubsidized loans begin accruing as soon as money is distributed to a borrower's school.However, this doesn't mean that students need to pay the interest right off the bat. Students can choose not to pay the interest while in school and throughout a six-month grace period after graduation. However, unpaid interest accumulates during this time and constantly adds to the borrower's total balance.Main differences between subsidized and unsubsidized student loansTo recap: Subsidized student loans' interest is paid for by the government while students are in school and for six months after graduation.


The government does not pay for unsubsidized student loans' interest at any point, so it consistently accumulates. Graduate students only have eligibility for unsubsidized loans, and only in some cases.However, there are many differences between subsidized and unsubsidized student loans aside from the above basic breakdown. Here's a closer look at those differences.Loan limits and qualificationsDirect subsidized student loans have lower annual loan limits than direct unsubsidized loans. For example, first-year dependent undergraduate students can borrow $3500 in subsidized loans and $5500 in unsubsidized loans. Both contribute to a total federal student loan limit of $23,000.Furthermore, students must demonstrate sufficient financial need to qualify for subsidized types of loans. You can apply via the FAFSA or Free Application for Federal Student Aid. In contrast, unsubsidized student loans are available to any student borrower, no matter their financial need.


Interest and feesAs mentioned above, the most significant difference between subsidized and unsubsidized student loans is how interest is handled. Subsidized student loans have their interest paid by the government for a while, but unsubsidized loans do not.There are other differences as well, however. Subsidized federal student loans have fixed annual percentage rates or APRs of 4.99% for all loans disbursed from July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023. These apply to loan payments (usually monthly payments) required over the life of the loan.Unsubsidized federal student loans have fixed APRs of 4.99% for undergraduate loans, 6.54% for graduate or professional student loans, and 7.54% for PLUS loans. These rates apply for the same timeframe as subsidized loans.Meanwhile, subsidized and unsubsidized loans have fees of 1.057% for all loans disbursed between October 1, 2020, and October 1, 2021.


Grace periods and defermentSubsidized and unsubsidized federal student loans have six-month grace periods, or periods of deferment, meaning student loan repayment won't begin until six months after graduation.However, unsubsidized loans' interest capitalizes, meaning that it is added to the original loan amount. That's because, as stated above, the federal government doesn't pay the interest fees for unsubsidized student loans.Unfortunately, this can lead to a spiraling and costly effect. The larger the principal loan balance gets, for example, the more each successive interest charge adds to the pile. Therefore, prospective students should be careful about using too many unsubsidized federal student loans.As far as deferment is concerned, the Education Department pays interest for all subsidized loans during deferment periods, like the recent one for Covid-19. Unsubsidized loans, of course, have their interest continue to be collected during deferment.


Recently, the U.S. government released a student loan debt relief program. U.S. citizens could qualify for loan forgiveness. However, this program is currently blocked.How much money can you borrow?Now that you know the significant differences between subsidized and unsubsidized student loans, you might wonder what the maximum amount you can borrow is.Dependent first-year undergraduate students can borrow $5500 in student loans, of which no more than $3,500 can be subsidized. Independent students, meanwhile, can borrow up to $9,500. Again, only up to $3,500 can be in subsidized loans.The loan rates increase for each successive year of schooling. Here's a breakdown:


Dependent second-year undergraduate students: $4,500 in subsidized loans, $6,500 total.Independent second-year undergraduate students: $4,500 in subsidized loans, $10,500 total.Dependent third-year and beyond undergraduate students: $5,500 in subsidized loans, $7,500 total.Independent third-year and beyond undergraduate students: $5,500 in subsidized loans, $12,500 total.As you can see, you can only take out a certain amount of money in loans per year from the federal government. If you have more financial needs, you'll have to seek financial aid through scholarships, grants or loans from private lenders or other institutions.Which should you use: subsidized or unsubsidized student loans?Given all this information, you might ask yourself whether you should prioritize subsidized unsubsidized student loans.For most American students, the answer is clear: Subsidized student loans are superior because you don't have to worry about interest accruing while you are at school and through any grace or deferment periods.In this way, you'll pay less for subsidized loans over their lifespans than unsubsidized loans. However, you can't take out as much money in federal direct subsidized loans as you can in unsubsidized loans.


The most followed strategy is this:Apply for as many federal student-subsidized loans as you can. Take out as much money through this system as possible, as it is the most cost-effective way to pay for your education and benefit from plentiful repayment options.Then, only if you still need a little more money, take out extra unsubsidized federal student loans for the remainder of the academic year to pay for the cost of attendance.Alternatively, pursue other means of financial aid, like scholarships, grants, and other loans with low-interest rates from secondary financial institutions and lenders like banks or credit unions.If you do this, you'll negate as many of your future interest payments as possible and walk away with as much financial aid as possible.Related: Don't Be a Victim: 4 Ways You Can Take Charge of Your Student Loans Should you take out federal or private student loans?Given the potentially high costs of unsubsidized federal student loans, some students might wonder whether private loans are better.It's almost always better to borrow federally first. Why? Private loans, even those offered by trustworthy financial institutions, usually have higher interest rates. They also usually require cosigners if student borrowers don't have credit histories, which is very common for first-time college students.


Related: Private and Federal Student Loans for College: Which Works Best for Your Child? Meanwhile, subsidized and unsubsidized federal student loans offer more forgiveness and refinancing options, borrower repayment plans and extra flexibility compared to private loans.In the worst-case scenario, if you default on your loans and have a ton of student debt, you'll have an easier time resolving things with federal student loans than with private student loans.You should only use private student loans if you have to fill unexpected payment gaps to meet college expenses or if you find an excellent deal with a low-interest rate. In that case, a private student loan might be slightly better compared to an unsubsidized student loan, but that's rarer than not.


SummaryIn many ways, subsidized student loans might be superior to unsubsidized loans. Still, both could allow you to acquire a college education and open up new professional pathways for your future.If you qualify for student loans, it may be best to take them, provided you plan to pay them back once you graduate. Additionally, consult your college's financial aid office to receive more personalized counseling.Looking for more resources to expand your financial knowledge?

36,What Is a Recession and How Do You Prepare for One?,"Dec 23, 2022",Entrepreneur Staff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/what-is-a-recession-and-how-do-you-prepare-for-one/441574,"
The news is abuzz with rumors of the next recession coming in 2023 or 2024. But for most Americans, all of that triggers a sudden panic and a desperate need to look at one's bank account.What is a recession, what does it mean, and how can you prepare yourself and your family's finances for one? This article will answer each of these questions and more. By the end, you'll know what to expect and how to prepare for a recession.What is a recession?According to economists working for the National Bureau of Economic Research, a recession is a prolonged period of economic downturn or declining economic activity.



It affects a nation's or the world's entire economy and lasts for a few months or more. In some ways, the best way to understand the recession is to compare it to ""regular"" or positive economic activity and GDP.GDP (gross domestic product) is essentially the combined value of the goods and services made by an economy, like the American economy. The country's GDP grows a bit each day/week/month in a standard economy.


When a recession kicks in, there is no economic expansion. Instead, the GDP is negative — the value of goods and services in the economy decreases — for more than two quarters or approximately six months. People stop spending as much money when this happens because the dollar's value decreases.Related: Are We in a Recession? Here's What Economists Say This decrease in consumer demand triggers a decline in industrial production, exacerbating the spiral effect and making a recession last longer. A significant decline in the business cycle, characterized by many consecutive quarters of lower consumer spending, may lead to job losses or a high unemployment rate.Several past recessions have stalled economic growth and led to the depletion of the Federal Reserve or the ""Fed.""


These include the recession leading into World War II, the Great Recession financial crisis, which occurred in 2008 from speculation on real estate, and the most recent recession brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic and the necessary cutback/slowdown on retail sales in the U.S. economy.Signs of a recessionAside from this recession indicator, some typical economic indicators also have other signs and symptoms to pay attention to.These signs include:More layoffs than average, a tighter labor market.A general, widespread decline in stock market stock prices.More businesses are going bankrupt than usual.Fewer raises or promotions for workers.Related: Are We Headed for a Recession? It's Complicated. 


As for GDP? According to some sources, the American GDP was -1.6% in the first quarter of 2022 and -0.9% in the second quarter of 2022. Technically, this means there is currently a recession, regardless of what people say.Note that a recession differs from a depression, which is much more severe. In a depression, the economy tanks significantly, and many more people may lose their jobs and money.In contrast, a recession is usually relatively short-lived. Some people may not feel a recession's impact, depending on how much money they have saved up and their financial situation before the recession occurs.In any case, a recession is never good news, which could signify that you must prepare accordingly.


How to prepare for a recessionFortunately, there are multiple ways in which you can prepare for a recession. Good recession prep can keep your finances secure until the recession recedes, allowing you to maintain your investments, keep your savings account intact and provide your family with peace of mind.Knock out as much debt as possible (and avoid new debt)Your priority should be to get rid of as much debt in your name as possible. You should already be trying to clear debt aggressively. The longer you leave it hanging around, the worse your credit will be and the more interest fees you'll pay over time — it's lost funds.As you put more of your money toward knocking out your debt, prioritize high-interest debt, such as credit cards and loans with high-interest rates. When you get rid of as much debt as possible, you set yourself up for financial success during the potentially turbulent economic times ahead.Avoid taking out any unnecessary loans or opening up new credit accounts during this timeframe. If you avoid further debt, you'll have more money to spend on savings or necessities, which may be necessary soon.


Related: How to Recession-Proof Your Business Keep saving aggressivelySpeaking of saving, you should continue to save aggressively or even save more money than you were previously.You might not get an unexpected promotion or pay raise during the recession. Even worse, your job could be at risk if you recently joined a company or are at the beginning of your professional career.In these cases and others, your income streams could dry up unexpectedly. If you save aggressively before that happens, you'll be well-positioned to get back on your feet and weather this economic storm until clear skies return.


Try to save as aggressively as possible and put that money into a secure savings account. That way, you'll earn interest on those savings and avoid accidentally spending the money.Diversify investmentsPlunging numbers and red lines on charts are not reasons to withdraw all of your investments or blow up your portfolio if you're invested in the stock market. You should keep your money in the market; after all, the stock market will eventually rebound just like it always does.Instead of panicking, diversify your investments by distributing your money into different stocks, funds, and other securities and assets. When you diversify your portfolio further, you protect it from economic damage, even from recessions.Plus, if you diversify your investments instead of withdrawing from the market, you'll prevent yourself from losing money in the short term.


Every time a recession occurs, some Americans invested in the market sell all of their securities, which only lowers prices for those securities. Then they regret this panicked decision as the market inevitably rebounds, with many stocks achieving higher prices than they reached previously.Bottom line: keep your investments in the market and keep your eye on the prize, particularly for long-term gains. A recession will eventually pass. Your current positions may be unattainable the next time you have money to invest in the market.Related: Worried About a Recession? Do This to Prepare Your Company. Bump up your creditYour credit score is also essential during a recession. You should improve your credit score before and during a recession whenever possible, primarily by eliminating high-interest debt such as credit card debt.


If necessary, move any high-interest debt to a new credit card with an introductory 0% APR offer for any balance transfer funds. This can be an excellent way to quickly pay down any other debt in your name (in keeping with the tip above) without paying extra interest.In any case, try to improve your credit so you can take out emergency loans if necessary, and so any other fees or financial strain you face over the next few months, reduce your credit by as little as possible. Many people feel the aftereffects of recessions for years to come, primarily because it damages their savings accounts or credit scores.Don't panicDo not panic if and when a recession occurs or when the news anchors start talking about it. Contrary to what some may believe, recessions are standard parts of the economic cycles inherent in capitalism.Simply put, recessions are inevitable declines in economic activity that eventually fade away. Once people stop panicking about the effects of a recession, economic activity should return to normal, and businesses will start to boom again.


Just thinking of a recession in this light — a regular element of the economy and not something to necessarily be feared — will help you keep your head straight as you plan.Not panicking is crucial, so you keep spending and saving money, which are essential actions to do your part to prevent the economy from spiraling downward even further.SummaryRecessions might be financially uncomfortable, but they are far from devastating if you take the right steps beforehand. The proper prep and patience will go a long way toward shoring up your bank accounts and protecting your finances throughout the upcoming recession until the market upswings again.Looking to expand your financial knowledge with more articles like this one?

37,Do You Need a Business Checking Account for Your Startup? It Depends on These 8 Factors.,"Nov 30, 2022",Baruch Mann (Silvermann),https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/do-you-need-a-business-checking-account-for-your-startup/436413,"
When you're establishing your startup, it can be a challenge to choose the right bank and the right business checking account, particularly if you have limited business experience. You need a bank account that not only meets your current needs but will grow as your requirements evolve with your expanding business.You might be wondering if you need a business checking account. While a personal checking account will perhaps meet your needs for your basic day-to-day business activities, you need to consider whether you need a business loan in the future or want to hold profits in a savings account.Your new checking account can be the start of your banking relationship, so you can start to establish goodwill and trust. However, while the bank is important, the characteristics of the checking account are also vital. So, here we'll explore how to choose a business checking account for your startup.



Think about what you need from your bankThe first thing you need to consider is what you need from your bank. Are you just looking for a checking account or do you also need a small business loan? There are lots of banks that not only offer a variety of business checking accounts but also have great business product lines such as business loans and lines of credit, business credit cards and tax counseling.While you may be looking for a checking account to handle your checks and manage client payments, you may need a line of credit or other products in the immediate future. So, take some time to think about your immediate and potential future needs to see which banks can meet your requirements.


Once you have a short list of things you need from your bank, you can start comparing the offerings from different banks both in your area and nationally. If you are considering a couple of banks, you can speak to their customer support team and obtain product information or even schedule a meeting to discuss your requirements.However, if your startup will only require basic account services, you could consider online banks. These tend to offer various products with minimal fees. The downside to this is that you don't have face-to-face interaction, and depositing cash can be tricky.Related: 5 Signs It's Time to Switch Your Business BankConsiderations for choosing a business checking account1. Location restrictionsEven if you're not looking at an online bank, some traditional banks put location restrictions on certain accounts. If you're considering a business checking account that has very low fees, it is worth checking if it is online only.


Depending on your operation, you may need to speak to a bank representative in person, pay in cash or send certified checks. In these scenarios, having a business checking account that does not have branch access could be a problem.2. Digital toolsMost modern startups benefit from digital tools such as mobile deposits, and digital bill payments. So, it is well worth assessing what digital tools are offered with the checking account.Many banks and financial institutions have an app that allows you to manage your account on your mobile device. Make sure that you check the reviews for the accompanying app to see if there are any potential issues.3. FeesAs with a personal checking account, the fees for your business checking account can quickly add up. For most startups and small businesses, every cent counts, so it is crucial to check the fee structure for your new checking account before you sign up. If your bank offers fee waivers for monthly maintenance charges, be sure to check the criteria to ensure that you can meet the minimum balance needed to waive it.


4. Relationship perksMany banks offer some great perks, such as fee waivers and preferential rates if you link multiple accounts. So, it is worth checking if the bank holding your personal checking account offers relationship perks if you open a business account.You may find that your existing bank will provide some excellent account options and since you already know and enjoy the bank, you can feel confident with your new business checking account. On the other hand, if there are no benefits to having the same bank for your personal and business accounts, don't feel obliged to stick with them.Related: 5 Items You Must Have to Open a Business Bank Account5. Additional debit cardsWhen you have a startup, you'll have plenty of administration tasks that will keep you busy every day. So, it can be very handy if you can provide your trusted team members with a company debit card.


This means that you won't need to micromanage essential purchases or deal with annoying reimbursement requests.6. Business savings accountsAnother important consideration is whether the business checking account has an accompanying or compatible savings account. While some business checking accounts are interest-bearing, you may still have startup capital that would be better in a savings account.A compatible savings account would allow you to keep your funds on hand for when they are needed. Some banks even facilitate automatic transfers. This will transfer funds from your savings account if the checking account balance reaches a certain threshold. This is a great feature, as you don't need to worry about going overdrawn or having payments refused, yet you can still be earning a higher rate of interest.7. Additional resourcesFinally, it is worth checking whether your new business checking account provides access to additional resources. Many banks appreciate the challenges of operating a startup and offer help and guidance. This could be something as simple as a learning center that offers live webinars, informative guides, or access to a business banking manager.


8. Business vs. personal checking accountThere are several good reasons to keep a separate checking account for your business if you own one. According to the SBA, business banking offers some personal liability protection by keeping your personal and corporate funds apart. Check writing and debit cards are features that both personal and business checking accounts can provide.A company checking account, however, could provide benefits that a personal checking account does not. While some personal checking accounts can be opened for as little as $1, depending on the bank or credit union, a business checking account may cost $500, $1,000, or more to open. Combining your personal and commercial operations in one checking account, if you plan to do both, can make bookkeeping difficult and tax season a nightmare.Bottom lineOnce you have begun your startup, you are likely to be excited to get working on your core business, but the right checking account can be an ally or a hindrance. The right checking account will provide you with the tools and services your startup needs.

    What constitutes multi-generational wealth these days, and why should we care? Here is my perspective as an entrepreneur with some advice on building it for your family's future.

    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

""You can't take it with you"" — how often have you heard that?It's an oft-abused phrase employed, usually within the context of a person amassing wealth or assets beyond their needs. What it speaks to is intent, and that's what building multi-generational wealth is all about: growing your assets to pass them on to future generations.We're not just talking about money and other valuable items, though. There's far more to it than that.



Right now, in the West and throughout the world, we're experiencing deep financial uncertainty. Especially since the crash of 2008, we've been on an increasingly fast treadmill of debt.Most Millennials and Generation Z in America identified home ownership as the prime marker for success. Increasingly, though, they are being priced out of the housing market altogether. Two-thirds of non-homeowners cited affordability as why they didn't own their own home.


There are, of course, several factors that have gone into this situation. It boils down to a total lack of focus on building generational wealth. Now we could lay that at the feet of consumerism; far too much emphasis on instant gratification, not enough on the journey of life and deferred gratification for greater future reward.Related: Experts Share Tips on Overcoming Generational Wealth DisparityCertainly, that's true to an extent. We buy on credit now more than ever (I'll get to why that's bad…but not why you think, shortly). We seek shortcuts and outcomes rather than journeys and experiences. But as with everything in life: the answer lies in more than one factor.Right now, we're experiencing the perfect storm of destabilizing geopolitics, recessions, war and cultural norms that don't favor multi-generational wealth.


We've cultivated this sense of wealth being about what you can demonstrate to others. It's all about ""flex"" culture (as the kids say). But this belies the true nature of what it means to be wealthy.What is wealth?I'm not going to say something as predictable or demonstrably untrue as: ""wealth has nothing to do with money."" That kind of platitudinal soundbite is also part of the problem. We're not holding ourselves accountable for what we say publicly. Money is absolutely a component of wealth, there's no doubt. But it also doesn't paint the complete picture.A ""wealth"" of something simply means that you have an abundant supply of it. For example, you can have a wealth of knowledge. It comes down to how resourced you are as a person and how valuable you can be as an individual to the broader community.We've done ourselves a cultural disservice in emphasizing money. Not that this is some kind of anti-capitalist rant! I'm a serial entrepreneur, after all. We do, however, need to steer the conversation towards other forms of wealth to heal the current pain we find ourselves in.


Related: Health Is Wealth: How to Move Away From Hustle CultureFor multi-generational wealth, we must take a more holistic approach to lifeMillions of dollars in the bank won't serve you if you have to sacrifice your mental well-being and time with your family (or a family, for that matter) to achieve it. My vision of multi-generational wealth is not about one generation falling on their proverbial sword to bring it about.My approach is about breaking these ""molds"" into which we constantly try to force ourselves. I want us to ditch the 'cookie-cutter' approach altogether and really examine what we have to offer future generations beyond just accrued capital.Related: Successful Entrepreneurs Don't Follow Mainstream Money Advice, And You Shouldn't Either


Let's start with moneyThanks to inflation, the money that you leave behind for your kids will be eroded by the sands of time anyway.Our education systems throughout the west offer pitifully little education when it comes to money management. We need to start teaching our kids how to handle money properly if we want to build generational wealth.That starts with understanding how to use debt properly!We're used to buying things on credit, usually having been fed the ridiculous line about how it frees up your capital to earn money. Given the rates that most retailers and third-party lenders charge, that's total garbage.You find me a savings account or investment portfolio that will give you the level of return that will match or exceed what they're charging!That said: we also need to avoid the trap of thinking that debt is inherently evil. It's not. It just depends on how you use it.Consumer debt (i.e., buying consumables with debt) is a terrible idea because you're servicing debt on something that is losing value. Hence why you can leverage your capacity to service debt, for example, to become a lender yourself essentially. That's how a lot of other successful entrepreneurs and I make a lot of money.From an entrepreneurial perspective, educating your kids about how debt works is a massive leap toward building generational wealth.This means educating yourself — no bad thing. I would encourage you to break the old habits and stigmas around debt for your own sake. Learn to identify the difference between consumer debt and the debt you can leverage.


The most important advice I can offer to you as an entrepreneur that will help you build multi-generational wealth is to…Find your 'why'! ""He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how"" — Friedrich NietzscheThis is always the first port of call for anyone I coach in business. It's the single most important thing to teach your kids if you want them to build on your legacy.You must understand what's driving you and why. That takes serious introspection and hard work. You will need to weed out all the programmings you've been fed since you were a kid that is keeping you motivated by the desires of others.


We think that so much of what drives us comes from us. More often than not, however, we're being driven by what someone else expects of us. When we don't confront this proactively, it leads to mid-life crises.The stark realization that we have less time left than we've had throws into sharp relief all of the things we've valued and how little we actually did for ourselves!Don't let that be the legacy you leave.Get your head around the life that you want to lead. Be an example to future generations and build your resources (money, knowledge, health, energy, etc…) to be of maximal service.Being of service to others ultimately builds true wealth, after all.

39,Looking for Funding for Your Business? You Should Know About Venture Debt.,"Sep 9, 2022",Peter DeCaprio,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/looking-for-funding-for-your-business-you-should-know/433441,"
Whether you're a small business owner or an aspiring entrepreneur, you've probably heard of venture capital. This popular private equity financing strategy is typically employed by investors looking to capitalize on the growth potential of lucrative startups and emerging companies. However, most people haven't heard about its loan-based counterpart — venture debt.In the post-pandemic age, venture capital is rapidly becoming the go-to tool for entrepreneurs seeking financing for their business to boost their cash flow. It's also used to support their provider with minimal equity dilution.Related: Why Venture Debt is Gaining PopularityBelow is information about venture debt, with everything you need to know from how it works to types and key benefits.Venture debt – overviewVenture debt is essentially a type of debt financing that startups and emerging companies choose to complement their equity venture financing. Unlike traditional methods, this form of debt financing requires no collateral as lenders (banks and other financial institutions) understand most entrepreneurs and startups don't own substantial assets. Therefore, they're compensated with the business's stock warrants on common equity. They can convert these warrants into common shares in the future for returns based on the company's appreciation.



Moreover, venture debt is typically offered to individuals or startups that have completed many rounds of venture capital equity financing. They are simply looking for positive cash flows to apply for conventional loans. Thus, the debt term lasts no longer than three or four years. The lenders decide the principal amount to be paid (typically 30 percent of the total amount raised from the last round of equity financing) with interest.Main types of venture debtA line of creditThis is the most common type of venture debt. It helps companies fund short-term assets (mainly equipment) and facilitates daily operations. The line of credit offered over a pre-specified period is revenue-based, meaning it can change according to sales and customer retention, among other factors.Term debt


This is a loan type that borrowers can repay over several years with a fixed interest rate. Due to its predictable nature, this type of venture debt is a great option for businesses looking for large investments.Convertible notesWith convertible notes, borrowers don't pay interest payments. Instead, the holder of the notes receives company shares in a future fundraising round. Since this venture debt type involves interest, it has an expiration date. If funds aren't generated, the borrower has to pay the amount in full.Key benefits of opting for venture debt


Startups and small businesses can benefit greatly by taking on venture dept. This instrument offers users a balanced capital structure and doesn't require financing collateral or board governance. Plus, did you know companies such as Uber, Spotify and Airbnb have utilized this tool to fuel and accelerate their growth?Related: When Is the Best Time to Raise Venture Debt? Here's the Key.Some of the key benefits of venture debt for borrowersA great alternative to equity financingFor years, equity financing has been a great way for businesses to seek the funds they need but often at the cost of shares dilution and control. Venture debt allows borrowers to raise the funds they need and repay the loan by generating cash flow and increasing profitability. In the process, they avoid equity dilution and maximize control of their operations and brand.


A great way to increase cash runway and capitalVenture debt can be the intermediary between equity financing rounds and help you achieve different financial milestones. Moreover, you can use this strategy to increase capital with timely investments and repayments. Plus, you can operate with relatively fewer risks since you don't necessarily need a steady income stream or substantial assets.Prepare for funding rounds without sponsorshipsUtilizing venture debt is the best way to kick-start operations in an unfunded or unsponsored startup. Using this tool, you can get everything started and work on improving operations and different functions (marketing, sales, R&D, etc.) to accelerate growth and build long-lasting relationships.


To summarize, venture debt is a powerful tool that provides startups and small businesses with a flexible, cost-effective and non-dilutive way to get the funding they need to grow and scale their operations.With this method, owners can build a solid foundation. They can improve their chances of acquiring future equity financing. Financing they'll need to roll out new products or services, open new facilities or take on new digital transformation initiatives without sacrificing control or their long-term vision. However, you have to find the right lender and venture debt type for your needs, which requires professional guidance from experts in this domain.Related: 4 Reasons Why Borrowing Money Is Usually Better Than Giving Up ...

40,The 5 Cs to Consider When Applying for a Business Loan,"Sep 2, 2022",Jevon Wooden,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/the-5-cs-to-consider-when-applying-for-a-business-loan/432985,"
For some entrepreneurs, bootstrapping your business isn't an option. That's where finding an alternative method for obtaining capital comes in. Business credit is the most well-known option for an entrepreneur to receive an influx of capital.Business credit is the ability of a company to borrow money to buy something now and pay the money back later. When a business goes for credit, there are five things (the five Cs) that a lender will look at before approving the company for a loan. Here they are below:1. CharacterCharacter refers to your business' credit history. Depending on the history of your business, your personal credit history may also come into play. If the character review of the borrower shows a history of responsibility for paying back lenders and credit maturity via prior credit lending opportunities (e.g., credit cards, lines of credit, auto loans), the borrower is likely to be approved for the loan. If the character of the borrower displays an immature credit profile (e.g., no prior credit lending, delinquencies, collections), the lender is likely to reject the borrower.



Similar to personal credit, there are ways you can check your business credit profile, such as Nav.com and DNB.com (Dun and Bradstreet). Business credit profiles are not as mature as personal credit, so you may see discrepancies in your various reporting source profiles.Related: 5 Tips for Securing the Business Credit You Need to Start and Scale Your Business


2. CapacityThe capacity of a business is the ability to pay back a loan. A lender will look at your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio to calculate capacity. The formula to calculate your debt-to-income ratio is (total debt/total income) x 100.The lower your DTI, the better your capacity to pay back a loan in the eyes of a lender. As with personal credit, you want to keep your business DTI at 36% or lower to be considered for future lending opportunities.3. CapitalCapital is your business's assets the borrower can leverage to repay a loan. Only liquid assets — such as bank account funds, investments and assets the lender can claim — are considered. Accounts receivable are not capital in this case, because it is not tangible.Related: How to Qualify for a Business Startup Loan


4. CollateralCollateral is an asset that can be offered as security to reduce the risk of capital loss in the case of default for the lender. Examples of collateral would be property, cash, inventory, accounts receivable or equipment.As a general rule, lenders will loan 80% of the value of the collateral. This means the borrower would need to have 20% of the purchase amount on hand or an alternate means to raise the capital. This is known as a loan-to-value ratio.5. ConditionsConditions include how the business plans to use the money and external factors, such as the state of the economy. For example, an equipment loan may be less risky for a dropshipping company than a loan for working capital in a risky business environment, such as a lending firm.When applying for credit, some of the five Cs are more in the business's control than others. Let's discuss how to increase your chances of being approved for credit by improving character, capacity, capital, collateral and conditions.


Related: These Things Can Give You Success in Business Loan BorrowingHow to increase your chances of being approved for creditImproving character: Character is absolutely on the business to maintain. Some ways to improve your character rating include paying bills early or on time that are reported to credit bureaus (e.g., credit cards and lines of credit), having a higher age of credit, diversifying your credit portfolio with a mix of revolving and installment credit and getting adverse events (like late payments) removed or closed. By calling the number provided, you can verify that your credit lenders report to the credit bureaus. Some lenders, primarily net 30-90 vendors, may not report until you request it.Improving capacity: The business needs to make more money or incur fewer expenses to improve capacity. Another option is to have a cosigner with a low DTI to improve your DTI.Improving capital: Capital is tougher to control by the business if the business is struggling to generate revenue. It is recommended that the business begins to save as much as possible in preparing a credit request to ensure the debt-to-income ratio will be 36% or lower. Some lenders will lend credit at a higher interest rate, up to 50% DTI.Improving collateral: Collateral is harder to control for businesses, primarily digital businesses, because the collateral, in most cases, must be liquid and owned outright. One way to improve the strength of collateral is by entering into a secured loan agreement leveraging additional assets that are equal to or higher than the loan amount.Improving conditions: Conditions are typically outside of the lender and borrower's control. The borrower must have a solid reason to request the loan and a strong enough credit profile to fit the lender's lending criteria. It helps the business to have financial documents in order and a strong outlook on revenue generation.There are a lot of considerations when requesting a business loan. Establishing relationships with lenders helps to strengthen the chances of being approved for a loan. Still, the most important attributes to consider are DTI, the reason for the loan and the business outlook. You should consult your financial advisor or accountant before pursuing a loan.

41,How to Find Franchise Financing and Funding,"Aug 22, 2022",Jeff Cheatham,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/how-to-find-franchise-financing-and-funding/432346,"

42,Smart Tips for Accessing Capital to Fund Your Franchise,"Jul 20, 2022",Dan Rowe,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/smart-tips-for-accessing-capital-to-fund-your-franchise/429876,"
One of the main concerns many franchisees have is coming up with the startup costs necessary to buy and open their first franchise location. Many are surprised to learn that right now there is a lot of money out there to be had, and one of the best sources for it is through the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA).In 2021, 14% of all SBA 7(a) loans went to franchisees, representing nearly $4 billion.Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now and take this quiz to find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.



One distinction of an SBA loan is that the SBA doesn't issue the loan directly. Instead, it offers guaranteed payment security for the issuing bank. The SBA has relationships with banks in all states. Banks like working with the SBA because it offers them a virtually no-risk lending situation. The bank can profit more from the loan by selling the guaranteed portion of the loan at a premium in the secondary market, as well as from interest income and from a monthly fee for servicing the loan. It's easy to see why lenders love the SBA program.SBA loans are a popular source of funding for franchisees because the loan term is usually longer than a conventional loan and because the SBA guarantees a part of the loan for the bank. Different banks offer different options with SBA loans. For example, some may offer a fixed interest rate for the length of the term, an attractive option in our current economy with interest rates on the rise. Banks that are preferred lenders with the SBA can make final credit decisions on SBA loans without submitting them to the SBA for approval, making the process quicker. Smart franchisees will shop around and find the best bank to work with in conjunction with an SBA loan.

The SBA 7(a) loan is the ideal option for a general business startup. It's the most popular SBA program, and in fiscal year 2021, almost 52,000 of these types of loans were granted. The loan can be used for startup expenses, working capital, buying equipment, purchasing real estate or refinancing debt. It can't be used for ongoing franchise or royalty fees. The maximum loan amount is $5 million. The loan term is 10 years for working capital and 25 years for fixed assets, with no prepayment penalties. While 7(a) loans offer lower down payments and longer terms, they can be more expensive upfront due to SBA fees and the fact that SBA loans are subject to an All Business Assets lien. This means that everything your business owns is collateral for the loan.The average processing for a loan that includes construction is 60 to 120 days, and if no construction is involved, it can be 45 to 90 days.The other type of loan available through the SBA is a 504 loan. This loan is designed to purchase major assets like real estate, equipment or aid in facility renovation. The loan amount is usually $5 million or less. A 504 loan offers low money down, usually 10%, and long-term fixed rates. Loan terms range from 10 to 25 years.

The SBA Express loan is the solution. While the loan is similar to the SBA 7 (a) loan, the major difference is the funding amount. Instead of $5 million, the SBA Express loan caps at $500,000. However, applicants will get a decision within 36 hours, and for loans up to $25,000, no collateral may be required.Related: I Ditched My Stock Portfolio And Put Money Into a Franchise. Here Are The 4 Steps I Followed.EligibilityThe SBA uses its SBA Franchise Directory to allow franchisees to easily look up if the franchise they wish to purchase is eligible for an SBA loan.


To determine if they wish to fund an SBA loan, banks will assess a prospect application with an eye toward liquidity, operating costs, working capital levels and projected revenue.Multi-unit operatorsAccording to Rookey, SBA loans can also be a great financing strategy for multi-unit operators. A franchisee can secure an SBA loan for the first unit, a ROBS (rollover for business startup) for the second location so they can open it debt free, and then another SBA or conventional loan for the third location.When I first started franchising, I used an SBA loan. I put down roughly 1/3 of the project cost and got 2/3 of the costs covered by the loan, making my cash go further. It was the perfect solution, and I always recommend this option to our franchisees.For new entrepreneurs, those new to franchising and even multi-unit operators, an SBA loan can be the best path to securing capital.Related: Picking a Winning Emerging Brand Is How You Get Rich in Franchising.

43,Anonymous Donor Pays Off Student Debt For Entire Graduating Class: 'You No Longer Have a Balance',"May 9, 2022",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/anonymous-donor-pays-off-student-debt-for-entire-graduating/427150,"
It's a sad but true fact that the celebration and sense of accomplishment that comes with graduating college also often means the looming realization that student loans and debt have not, in fact, magically gone away.But for the Wiley College Class of 2022, it looks like that's exactly what happened when an anonymous donor cleared the balances of the graduating class.Wiley, which is a historically black college located in Marshall, Texas, hosted its 133rd Commencement Convocation over the weekend, where more than 100 students were set to walk the stage and earn their diplomas.

""You are debt free, you do not owe the college a penny,"" Hermon J. Felton, president and CEO of Wiley College, told graduates in a surprise announcement during the ceremony. ""If you have a balance, you had a balance. You no longer have a balance.""Felton's words were met with cheers and tears by the graduating class and their loved ones as it was revealed that students' balances were cleared by an anonymous donor.Congratulations 2022 Graduates, YOU ARE DEBT FREE!Go Forth Inspired, glorious deeds to do. #wileygrad22 #wileycollege #hbcu #hbcugrad #hbcupride #goforthinspired pic.twitter.com/a0zHUDTFc4— Wiley College (@WileyCollege) May 7, 2022Typical tuition, including room and board, costs $17,500 per student at Wiley, but the college reported that, due to pandemic-related challenges, many were unable to pay balances.

""We are grateful for this anonymous donor who will assist the students in paying off their balances to Wiley College and help us achieve institutional goals of graduating our students with little to no debt.""The college estimates that the overall total of balances owed by the class of 2022 was around $300,000.HBCUs (particularly private ones, like Wiley College) rely heavily on donations and gifts from alumni and other donors as graduates of these universities are more likely to suffer from a generational wealth gap.

44,3 Credit Secrets That Will Help You Qualify for the House of Your Dreams,"Mar 4, 2022",Antoine Sallis,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/3-credit-secrets-that-will-help-you-qualify-for-the-house/418577,"
For thousands of Americans nationwide, a common New Year's resolution included buying a home. For some, this goal may easily be within reach, for others it might seem more of a dream. But is it?Regardless of whether we will be in a buyers or seller's market, interest rates are expected to increase in the near future. Armed with this information, you can decide whether it's better to pay a little over asking price now or pay a higher interest rate over time (keeping in mind that you can always refinance in the future to get a lower rate if that option works best).Related: Are You Planning to Buy a Home? Read This First.



In the meantime, there are some underreported credit moves that will help you qualify for a loan and make that New Year's resolution a reality, no matter how much money you have in the bank.1. Avoid credit mistakesCommon missteps made when consumers are about to purchase a home are paying off accounts in full, closing or using credit cards unwisely and opening new accounts. 


It might seem logical to think that paying off an account in full is always a good thing; the truth is that sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't. When you pay off an installment account in full it closes, which harms your credit score because the age of that account is no longer reflected on your credit profile. Also keep in mind that a closed account is worth less than an open one. So, when buying a home, the secret is to pay a vast majority of the installment loan yet leave it open. In most cases a 90/10 ratio is good (provided that it's within your budget), meaning that 90% of the account is paid off, with 10% of the balance open. This reduces your debt-to-income ratio and will increase your credit score.Since we now know closing accounts is a bad idea, we want to do the same with credit cards; pay them down as low as you can but leave them open (you can use the same 90/10 ratio for these as well). Also, if you have bills or monthly memberships connected to your credit cards, it may be a good idea to disconnect them until you finish escrow. That way there won't be a balance on cards that you may have forgotten about. (If that balance reports, then it will hurt your debt-to-income ratio.)Related: 3 Credit Secrets Millionaires Use as Leverage2. Use other/additional creditIf you live with your spouse or family member (i.e., brother, sister, son, cousin) over the age of 18, you can use their credit profile under a tenancy in common (TIC) legal provision, in which each tenant owns a certain percentage of the property. The advantage of this is that if all tenants are employed, each of their incomes (as well as credit scores) can be included in a loan application. The disadvantage is that the lender will normally go with the lowest credit profile of all the tenants, but there is a workaround to this, which leads to our next and last credit secret.


3. PiggybackingAdding an authorized user (a relative, friend or family member) of a credit card, aka ""piggybacking,"" can be a reliable way of boosting a credit score. For example, when a mother adds her daughter to a card, that credit history (including the age of the card and credit limit) will show up on the daughter's credit report. The secret to this is to get a card with sufficient age as well as one with a high credit limit. It's additionally vital that there are no missed payments associated with the card, and that it is paid down to under 10% of the total utilization (the lower the better).An authorized user account will normally show up on a credit profile five to 10 days after the statement date associated with the credit card, so it's then that the boost on a credit report will be seen. Related: This New Credit Card Can Help You Buy A Home. But Creating It Was Nearly Impossible.In the illustration used above, the consumers with the high credit scores can each add the third consumer with the low credit score to their credit cards, and that will ultimately raise the score. (The more cards you do this with, the better!) This will certainly improve the chances of a favorable outcome in pursuing a home purchase.


Keep in mind that once a mortgage reports to your credit report, it takes your credit to a higher credit class, because the algorithm of having a great profile includes having a mortgage. Furthermore, lenders can now see that you have a stable residence, and are aware that the vast majority of property owners gain escrow in their homes, which makes the consumer more attractive to lenders — a win-win situation.

45,"Balancing Hopes, Dreams and a Low-Paying College Major","Feb 28, 2022",Anna Helhoski,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/balancing-hopes-dreams-and-a-low-paying-college-major/420873,"
Humanities majors are more than a punchline. Not everyone can or wants to be a STEM major, and the world would be a poorer place if they were.To have great things to read, music that inspires, perspectives that challenge us — to have a sense of reward and meaning in life —  we must have students who pursue college degrees that don't lead directly to a big paycheck.That turns the pursuit of intellectual curiosity and artistic appreciation into a balancing act: the likelihood you'll make a good living versus the debt you incur along the way.



""I encourage students to find this balance between what they like and what pays,"" says Nicole Smith, research professor and chief economist at the Georgetown University Center for Education and the Workforce. ""I'm not discounting how beneficial these positions are to our society as a whole, but if you can't pay back your student loan, you'll be in a serious state,"" Smith says.Liberal arts grads face longer odds compared with science, technology, engineering and mathematics degrees, but a well-chosen humanities major doesn't have to be a vow of poverty.


How long does it take to recoup what you paid?To assess the value of earning a specific degree at a specific institution, consider the concept of price-to-earnings premium, spearheaded by Michael Itzkowitz, senior fellow of higher education at Third Way, a center-left think tank.It measures what you pay out of pocket, including loans, against the amount you'll earn each year above the earnings of a typical high school graduate. The results show how quickly you can get a return on investment in your college major.The majority of liberal arts degrees lead to a ""pretty good ROI,"" says Itzkowitz, but the specific program you graduate with and the type of degree you earn will affect individual outcomes.The bachelor's degree programs that allow graduates to recoup their costs within five years or less include what you'd expect: Registered nursing, electrical engineering and dental assistants all make the list.


Among the programs with no economic ROI at all: drama, fine arts and anthropology.Itzkowitz says the majority of college programs enable students to recoup costs within 10 years or less. ""College is still worth it the vast majority of the time,"" he says.Unfortunately, his research also found nearly one-quarter of all college programs of study show graduates failing to recoup their costs in the 20 years after graduation.There are several tools that can help you compare data on costs, earnings and debt:


The College Scorecard, a data tool from the U.S. Department of Education.An interactive map of price-to-earnings premiums from Third Way.The Buyer Beware tool from the Georgetown Center for Education and the Workforce.Of course, education and major aren't the only predictors of income. Your wages will also be affected by where you live, your gender and race, whether you work in the public or private sector, and your experience level.Should you get a graduate degree?Your humanities degree could go much further if you get an advanced degree — generally, the more education you have, the greater your earnings, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.But you should continue to weigh cost versus benefit since it's also easier to rack up debt. A graduate degree may increase your earning potential, or it may just increase your debt.For example, if you majored in liberal arts for your bachelor's degree you can expect a median annual wage of $50,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.


But if you get a graduate degree in law, taking on more debt, you could earn a median of $126,930. A master's of fine arts, on the other hand, is unlikely to yield higher earnings: The annual median wage is $42,000.Your other options could include a minor in a field with higher earnings, an internship to get on-the-job experience or finding less-expensive graduate programs if your intended field requires it.If you're taking on additional student debt, remember that the federal government offers payment plans that tie the size of your payment to your income. Most private loans don't.What are your options if your earnings are low?If you're already working in a low-paying field and you have student loan debt, look at how you can lower payments or discharge your debt.


If you're having trouble making payments, consider enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan, which ties payments to your monthly income. Your payment amounts will increase as your earnings do, too.Those working in public sector fields should learn the ins and outs of public service loan forgiveness, a red-tape-laden process of getting your loans discharged after 10 years of payments on a qualifying payment plan while working full time in a qualifying field.This article was written by NerdWallet and was originally published by The Associated Press.

""Buy now, pay later"" promises simple payment plans that can make financing your next purchase easy and affordable.These plans typically divide your total purchase into four equal installments with zero interest. The first installment is due at checkout, and the remaining three are due every two weeks until the loan is paid in full.But even a simple payment plan can turn complicated when you're juggling three or four of them at a time — a problem unique to buy now, pay later, which unlike other forms of financing, doesn't look at similar existing debts when extending an offer.



Know the risks of multiple buy now, pay later loansWhile certain debts like credit cards and traditional loans are reported to the three major credit bureaus, buy now, pay later loans typically aren't, so lenders don't know how many loans you have outstanding and can't assess your ability to afford more.This will likely change in the coming months as TransUnion, Equifax and Experian work to increase the visibility of buy now, pay later on credit reports to better track the loans across lenders, while still protecting the credit scores of consumers who may be taking out multiple loans in a short period of time and successfully paying them off.


For now, borrowers can continue taking on debt from multiple buy now, pay later providers. And though plans may be advertised as no-cost, the consequences of falling behind are anything but, says Marisabel Torres, director of California policy for the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit research and policy organization.""There needs to be more transparency,"" she says. ""It's not just, ""zero financing, zero fees.' If you miss a payment, you will incur fees. You will incur some type of penalty.""While many buy now, pay later providers charge late fees, which can dig borrowers further into debt, others send defaulted loans to collections, jeopardizing borrowers' credit scores.There are also consequences on the other side of the transaction. Even if a buy now, pay later provider doesn't penalize you for falling behind, your bank might if you overdraw an account tied to the loan, like a debit card.


""Could you be triggering nonsufficient fund fees or overdraft fees? Could you be kicked out of the banking system? Those are very real consequences that are tied to not being able to keep up with a loan payment,"" Torres says.Establish a budget for buy now, pay later paymentsFor borrowers who take multiple buy now, pay later loans, the most important thing to do is plan your spending ahead of time, says Jordan Nietzel, a certified financial planner based in Columbia, Missouri.If you don't already follow a monthly budget, start by reviewing your income and expenses over the past three months to identify how much money is coming in and going out.Assuming there's a surplus of income you want to spend on buy now, pay later purchases, set a total dollar limit for what you can commit to monthly payments, instead of evaluating loan offers individually.


Nietzel says looking at buy now, pay later loans as a whole is particularly important since the small installments make the debt seem more manageable than it is.""We tend to think, ""Well, no big deal, I can definitely make this $10-a-month payment,'"" he says. ""You don't realize that if you do that several times, those payments stack onto each other.""Resist the temptation to overspendBudgeting can also help address one of the top concerns about buy now, pay later: the ease of overspending at checkout.Since buy now, pay later plans automatically divide your purchase, it's easy to lose sight of what you originally planned to spend. For example, a $100 purchase becomes $25 with a pay-in-four plan. For some shoppers, this could mean filling their carts with more items.


Paul Paradis, president of Sezzle, a buy now, pay later provider that partners with Target and other retailers, says his company has little to gain from encouraging customers to overextend themselves.""Since we don't charge interest, and we make the vast majority of our revenue from our merchant fees, we actually lose out if we encourage overspending,"" he says. ""Unlike credit cards that make money when people don't pay on time, we lose money when people don't pay us back on time.""However, Nietzel and Torres note that the willingness of major retailers to pay merchant fees in the first place likely means consumers are spending more.If buy now, pay later plans tempt you to overspend on a regular basis, you're better off ditching them.


""It may seem like it's easier for your cash flow to stomach, but over the long haul you're paying the same amount,"" Nietzel says. ""So if it's causing you to buy more than you would've otherwise, that's when it really becomes a problem.""This article was written by NerdWallet and was originally published by The Associated Press.

48,Why Small Businesses Should Look for Alternative Capital Financing,"Feb 18, 2022",Imran Tariq,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/why-small-businesses-should-look-for-alternative-capital/414310,"
It's difficult for many small-to medium-sized businesses (SMEs) to navigate through various loan programs and debt-consolidation opportunities, especially during an unprecedented global pandemic. Unlike consumers who are protected by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), business owners are not often covered by the same guidelines, presenting individuals with less protections and new alternative-funding companies that don't always provide the helping hand needed.Therefore, consumers are often looking for the liaisons who can help them navigate through the application and approval process, while providing them with the fundamental education necessary on how to receive inexpensive capital with product education. According to the Biz2Credit Small Business Lending Index, small business loan-approval rates have slowly been climbing this year — with approval percentages at big banks rising from 14.2% last November to 14.3% in December. However, during that same period, small banks' approvals increased from 19.9% to 20.1%.



Here are how SMEs have had to find new, alternative paths to capital, allowing business owners to access funds faster than before — and without the headache of trying to navigate through the tedious legalese of paperwork. Related: So You Want Your PPP Loan Forgiven? Make Sure You Submit This Application


Raise debt first before selling equityDuring the beginning stages of the pandemic, many business owners would be told by hedge funds, private-equity groups and venture-capital firms that they were approved for loans. This after many months spent negotiating term sheet deals, frequently more than 100 pages long, only to find out later that they wouldn't be receiving the funds until several months after signing their loan documents. Others would simply receive vague decline reasons or a lack of correspondence entirely, and calling the Small Business Association (SBA) would only keep you on hold for hours before someone would tell you to wait for an email response. Some companies sell their equity away prior to raising the debt, taking on immediate investors with immense amounts of pressure from the get-go. Many companies believe that initially investing into the flashy technologies and top-shelf CRMs will set the business off in the right direction and keep it attractive to the market.Wrong. One of the biggest strategies a newly launched business can have for itself is preparing for the worst-case scenario of when it happens (not if), which in this case means starting off lean, mean and looking for ways to keep expenses to a minimum. Networking and the Chamber of Commerce are your friendsHow many business owners do you know that understand the difference between factoring and a merchant cash advance? In most cases, these owners want quick-working capital with an affordable payback. If you don't have the necessary web of connections and network, that's where joining your local Chamber of Commerce comes into play, as well as attending trade conventions and local business groups.


Small- and medium-sized businesses, self-employed individuals and minority-owned businesses have been repeatedly left out throughout history. Unfortunately, the pandemic only exacerbated this problem. Paycheck Protection Program and EIDL government-backed loans were set up to help small businesses, but were initially, widely distributed to companies like Shake Shack and TB12.According to the New York Times, data collected on the PPP allocation's racial breakdown has been scarce, illustrating New York as a problematic zone where lenders were not required to collect demographic details on their borrowers. Ultimately, economists have consistently found signs of gaps here. Additionally, an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York noted that some counties with large numbers of Black-owned businesses — most notably the Bronx, Queens and Wayne County, MI (which includes Detroit) — had strikingly low concentrations of the relief loans — of the 996,000 loands that included information on the borrower's race, 71% of the dollars went to white-owned businesses.More than half of the roughly $525 billion in loans given out through November 2020 went to just 5% of the more than five million recipients, as revealed by an analysis of the SBA data by The Washington Post.


Related: 4 Ways Businesses Can Dodge Loan Scams and Predatory LendersCaution your reliance upon government-provided fundingCongress approved billions of dollars in aid for small companies to help them keep their employees covered during the pandemic, but a large portion of these businesses never saw the funds. When the PPP was first initiated in April 2020, banks quickly moved towards bigger loans and more established businesses, because in their world, they were more lucrative. According to The New York Times, the program's largest lender (JPMorgan Chase) refused to even make loans of less than $1,000. Forbes went on to report, ""...from April 2020 to May 2021, the PPP provided millions of loans to help keep businesses afloat during Covid-19. Since the rollout in 2020, over 11.8 million PPP loans totaling almost $800 billion have been approved, according to data from the U.S. Small Business Administration in May 2021. While many of the earliest PPP borrowers have already applied for and been granted loan forgiveness, SBA data shows that as of the end of July, 18% of 2020 PPP loan borrowers had not submitted forgiveness applications.""Small- and medium-sized businesses are still struggling with the uncertainty of government loans, and with inflation rising, so have typical operating costs. The SBA EIDL loans were originally capped at $150,000 in 2020. The SBA increased this amount to $500,000 in April 2021 to help businesses that were still struggling. 


With the PPP gone, SMEs should look towards taking chances again and growing their company. Small businesses still don't know where to turn, so having private groups that understand how to provide customer-focused solutions that help educate small-business owners on the best financing available will only serve to provide SMEs with alternative financing that doesn't set business owners up for failure.

50,Freelancers Deserve a Voice: Here's How to Give It to Them,"Jan 26, 2022",Andre Lee,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/freelancers-deserve-a-voice-heres-how-to-give-it-to-them/411464,"
The past 18 months have at once boosted and upended the gig economy, with some industries experiencing significant increases in their number of freelancers, while others contracted their ranks. Even among these seismic shifts, one thing remains the same: freelancers aren't going anywhere and they promise to make up a sizeable portion of the future workforce.Giving freelancers a voice in benefits negotiationsPartly because they are, by their very nature, independent of any larger organization, freelancers don't have a level of institutional influence commensurate with their population. As a result, some states (most recently California) have created legislation designed to protect gig workers, but the effect of such laws remains to be seen. As it stands now, there are no overarching freelancer unions or similar bodies designed to protect benefits. Lyft and Uber drivers have been at the forefront of this fight for several years, as their respective companies often sought to treat them like employees, but without extending benefits to them. With recent labor shortages and other difficulties involved in the return to a pre-pandemic state of operation, many companies find themselves increasingly outsourcing work like accounting and writing to freelancers. With these developments and with more and more American families depending on freelancing to survive, the question of what sorts of benefits to provide them is inevitable, and vital. 



Related: Why Digital Freelancing is the Future of WorkFreelancing is a business, and businesses need financingGiving freelancers a voice to protect their job security and benefits will require action by the government, to be sure, but arguably the more significant issue at hand is how they can secure financing for their businesses. There's still a misconception out there that independent workers are simply pursuing ""side hustles"" to help pay off some bills or save for their kids' college fund, but that's no longer the case. Increasingly, freelancers are independent contractors who are running self-owned companies full time. Until public perception shifts, these will be handicapped by a lack of access to sustainable capital, but that doesn't have to be the case: there is a growing realization that banks and lenders could greatly benefit by offering specialized financing options for them. Banks would get access to a market they have historically underserved, one with potential for record-setting growth in the coming years (the first to offer such products would be tapping a virtually unexplored market), and freelancers would win by getting access to capital which they desperately need to grow. Finally, unlocking such capital would benefit the economy as a whole: Business growth means more and better-paying jobs, more competition and ultimately better value for consumers, while the government would see larger tax revenues, which further helps society.


This should be one of the rare topics that gets bipartisan support in our country.Related: The Case for FreelancersHow a packaged story is a roadmap to successNumerous obstacles remain to turning this vision into a reality, unfortunately, chief among them the lack of recognition on the part of banks and other financial institutions that freelancing is a viable business. Currently, there is little incentive for these institutions to reassess their models. As a result, freelancers face lending practices tailored to traditional businesses, making the process of providing information a bank needs to make a proper risk calculation difficult. Freelancers have their own stories…experiences, reputation, network, skills and credentials. They also have their own way of working, but the storyline of a gig economy worker actually can be translated to fit a traditional loan risk calculation — one that can place them on the bank's radar to unleash the vast potential value in the digital economy, and it's high time that lenders and freelancers unite capabilities to do so.

On Tuesday, U.S. District Court judge Laura Taylor Swain signed a plan for Puerto Rico that sets the record as the largest public-sector debt restructuring deal in U.S. history. According to Swain's ruling, the U.S. territory's debt will be reduced from $33 billion to $7.4 billion — around an 80 percent cut.""The provisions of the plan constitute a good faith, reasonable, fair, and equitable compromise and settlement of all claims and controversies resolved pursuant to the plan,"" Swain said in the ruling.Related: These 2 Franchisees in Puerto Rico Survived Hurricane Maria and Lived to Tell What They Learned



Puerto Rico has had financial problems over the years, declaring bankruptcy in 2017 after it announced it couldn't pay the more than $70 billion debt it had accumulated. The debt, while partly accumulated through mismanagement and excessive borrowing, was further exacerbated by natural disasters and the pandemic.Under this new debt payment structure, Puerto Rico will only have to pay $666 million a year for the first 10 years, instead of $1.6 billion annually. The territory is expected to have budget surpluses through the mid-2030s but might have problems funding its pension system, which owes its present and future retirees an estimated $55 billion.


In a statement, Puerto Rico governor Pedro Pierluisi said that while this new plan isn't perfect, the debt restructure is a good move for the future of the territory.""The agreement, while not perfect, is very good for Puerto Rico and protects our pensioners, university and municipalities that serve our people,"" Pierluisi said. ""We still have a lot of work ahead of us.""Related: How Entrepreneurship Is Helping to Save Puerto Rico

52,3 Credit Secrets Millionaires Use as Leverage,"Jan 10, 2022",Antoine Sallis,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/3-credit-secrets-millionaires-use-as-leverage/403651,"
As the old saying goes, the rich get richer while the poor get poorer, but why is it that some people seem to have the knack for accumulating wealth, seemingly without much effort? Are these people born lucky, or are they simply privileged? What's certain is that in order to manage money successfully, it's vital to absorb some basics of how things work in the financial world, as well as certain tricks of the trade with which savvy millionaires are likely familiar.1. The inside banking secretBanks use several factors to measure a potential borrower's level of risk. These include the amount of money in his or her bank account (primarily savings), age of the account, and how many deposits come into it (as opposed to withdrawals). In a savings account, it is recommended that you have at least $400, but the more the merrier. It's also recommended that you have a larger number of withdrawals than deposits, and many banks additionally prefer that you leave 20% of all deposits in an account. (This explains why incentives for keeping money in a checking account are so frequently seen.) However, very few people know that having multiple accounts within one institution can greatly increase your banking credibility. In addition to a personal checking and savings account, you can have a credit card, a HELOC (home equity line of credit), a signature loan, mortgage or an auto loan. Such diversity will greatly increase your chances of approval for any service you apply for. Related: Should You Tap Into Personal Savings to Start a Business?



2. The ""almost paid"" installment secretThe time has come: you've finally got the funds to pay off an auto or signature loan… you have a chance to reduce debt and increase your credit score. Sounds good, right? Not exactly. Installment loans are accounts that have one set payment amount, and once it's paid off, the account closes. The problem is that on your credit profile, an open account is worth far more than a closed account. However, the more that debt on an open account is reduced, the more points will be added to a score. So, if you are financing a car or house and can afford to pay down an installment loan, do so, but just down to 10% of the remaining balance. This leaves the account open while reducing the utilization on it, resulting in a credit score jump in most cases. 3. The enhanced DTI secretWhen applying for items such as a vehicle, credit card, even a house, one of the main things that lenders look at is a borrower's debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. To calculate yours, divide gross monthly income (income from all sources before taxes) by gross monthly debt (all bills, including food, gas, rent and utilities). If this number is under 30%, underwriters will look favorably on your file.


As a general rule, you want income to be high and debt to be low, but even if debt-to-income ratio is on the high side, there is a way to counteract that: For bank applications in most cases, you can include projected income or household income. In calculating household income, include amounts that anyone in the home pays in terms of rent or other expenses, including family members, roommates and spouses. Alternatively, if sharing the rent with one or more people, you can divide the total amount of rent by the number of people paying it.On many applications, there may be an ask for projected income. This is a chance for you to be creative, and think of the highest amount you can realistically make in your field for the next year, which will improve your DTI ratio and exponentially increase your chances of approval.Related: 5 Tips to Improve Your Odds of Getting a Small Business Loan

53,A 6-Step Guide to Building a Solid Credit Score,"Jan 1, 2022",Aidan Sowa,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/a-6-step-guide-to-building-a-solid-credit-score/400766,"
Credit rating is a crucial factor not just in securing a mortgage, credit card or loan — it can dramatically affect everything from car insurance and mobile phone contract rates to overall employability.What is a credit score?Put simply, this is a three-digit number any lender looks at to estimate how risky a borrower you are likely to be: the higher it is, the better off you'll be in terms of acceptability and interest rates. Lenders usually use the FICO credit scoring model — its scores ranging from 350 to 850 — and incorporate five factors when calculating it: payment history (30% importance), total amount of debt owed (25%), length of credit card history (25%), credit mix (10%) and new credit (10%).If potential lenders see you've been financially irresponsible in the past, you could be in a pickle. (After all, would you lend your money to a person with a history of not paying their debts?) And there's slim chance of keeping anything from them, since they'll likely consult all of the big three credit reporting agencies agencies: Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. Credit mix, meanwhile, is an assessment of the various types of accounts in your name (including credit cards, student loans and personal loans), while the new credit numeral shows how many times you've applied for a loan recently.



Once your financial history and habits are thoroughly dissected, you get a credit report — a summary of payment history, credit accounts and balances. Logically, negative payment history can damage your score. Moreover, should you be more than 30 days late to pay a balance, you will likely be reported to one of the major credit agencies. Once this shows up on a report, you're marked as a risky borrower, which could stay on a report for up to seven years.Related: Why Is My Personal Credit Score Used to Qualify for a Business Loan?Building a credit score may seem like a daunting process, and in truth it does take effort and time, but there are specific steps to follow.1. Build your credit fileThis is a vital first step for laying down a good track record, and includes the opening of new accounts that will be reported to bureaus. Credit-builder loans or secured cards are great options if you're just starting out. A way to attain a higher score is by mixing different types of accounts. Although it may sound strange to own debt in various forms, it's proof of reliability as long as you're paying bills on time, which brings us to…2. Maintain good payment habitsPayment history is one of the most crucial factors. It's simple: a long history of regular payments is the most important factor in score calculation, so make sure to keep track of loans, credit card balances and pay dates. And don't wait more than 29 days after the ""payment due"" date, since 30-days-late payments could get reported to bureaus. A wise move to do is set up automatic payments, while securing any associated bank accounts from overdrafts. And if you're having trouble putting together money for a bill, reach out to your card issuer to discuss options. It's far worse to simply ignore the problem.If you're in trouble with a credit card debt, the wisest thing to do is to consult a credit counselor on creating a debt management plan, one aspect of which will be a negotiation of reduced payments and/or interest rates.


3. Review reports periodicallyObtain a copy of your current report (the FTC maintains a good site detailing how and where to get them): see where you stand and where you want to go from there. A point that's often overlooked is that there might be errors hurting a score; if you notice any, notify the credit agency about them, which usually means explaining in writing what's wrong and including documents that support you. For that reason, keep records of payments (banking apps are a blessing in this regard).Related: Help Save Your Credit Score with Lexington Law's Credit Repair Service4. Don't use more than 30% of your creditKeep abreast of your card limit and try not to use any more than 30% of it. Too much credit utilization can hurt a score, and it's always possible to ask a bank to increase a limit to offer more flexibility. Pro tip: To keep balances low, pay credit card bills twice a month.5. Minimize new credit requests""Hard"" credit requests for such things as credit cards, loans or lines of credit will most often lower a score (a few-points difference can make or break an application).


6. Don't close accounts not in useDon't close that credit card from college. It doesn't hurt to keep it open; in fact, closing the account might damage your score. For each account you decide to close, points will be lost.What if you have no credit?If you have not utilized any credit cards or loans in the past ten years, you might not exist in the credit report world at all. However, having no profile could pose a significant problem once you decide to put a roof over your head or a steering wheel in front of you. To avoid that happening, check with your bank or credit union to determine if you can get a secured credit card (which usually means putting down a deposit). But, of course, you must then use it responsibly and make regular payments.Related: How You May Be Sabotaging Your Ability to Procure FundingHow long it takes to build a scoreUnfortunately, there is no definitive timeline for building or rebuilding credit. The first thing to do is find out what's hurting (or fueling) yours, then set priorities. Suppose you missed just one payment. Relax: it should not take long to rebuild by keeping up with payments after a slip-up. However, if you start to miss them on various accounts and sink significantly behind, it will take longer to recover.


Once you start taking steps to build it, it may take some time for you to notice an impact on a report. Still, it's important to persevere. And the truth is that no solution fits all situations, so it's wise to ask for credit management help when in doubt.

54,The Case for Hiring a Loan Expert,"Nov 23, 2021",Avi Levine,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/the-case-for-hiring-a-loan-expert/396214,"
Assessing the right type of small-business loan is both time consuming and complicated. There are dozens of financial products available, and even more banks and non-bank lenders to choose from. So, how will you decide which product is right for your business, and what type of research is needed to determine which financial institution to select? These are just a few of many required questions.Business owners regularly rely on industry experts when making decisions — they use accountants, lawyers, benefits consultants, real estate mortgage brokers and many others, and do so because associated decisions can have major impacts on the success of an enterprise. I'd actually put a business-financing expert near the top of that list, specifically a commercial loan broker. This person will have the ability to analyze your needs, goals and objectives to determine what the right lender should be. They also help explain all available options, and even negotiate on your behalf. As a busy entrepreneur, they can help save time and streamline an arduous process.There are also some additional benefits. 



ExpertiseAn experienced commercial loan broker will look past the dollar amount and first ask a simple question: ""Why do you want to apply for a loan?"" It's crucial to understand that all loan programs are not equal, and brokers know that the first step to finding the right one is pinpointing need. Once a broker knows that, he or she will build an application and source lenders that accomplish your goals. When the right one is picked, they also have the expertise to understand rates, terms and covenants, and can warn of potential pitfalls.  Related: What It's Like to Work With a Business Loan Broker


A ready lender networkReputable brokers have established and vetted networks of professionals that offer options based on a business's needs and qualifications, which helps avoid spending weeks, if not months, speaking and meeting with lenders — and perhaps still not getting financing, or winding up with the wrong type (which can easily be more harmful than having no financing at all).Multiple solutionsI often find that small-business owners know how much money they need in a loan, but after discovering why they need it, I realize that it will take multiple solutions to properly finance them. A B2B company seeking both working capital and equipment, for example, should be looking for a line of credit or invoice financing solution to solve day-to-day working capital needs, while a lease might be a better option for purchasing the equipment. Each product is designed for a specific need and should be used in the proper way.Related: The 7 Different Loans You Can Get as a Business OwnerOf course, it's vital to do proper research before hiring a commercial broker. First, make sure they have a professional website with working contact information. Request recommendations from other business owners and read client references and reviews, and never be shy about asking as many questions as you need to.


While doing this research, there are a few red flags to keep in mind:Lack of references or reviews from real customers.Either the absence of a proper business number, or that number always redirecting to an automated recording. No physical address listed on a website.Any ""guarantee"" that you'll get approved for a loan.No available information about owners or key employees on the business site.All of your careful research will be well worth it: Once you do hire a qualified professional, you'll save yourself time and the headache that so often comes with the loan process.

55,Why Focusing on Underserved or Niche Markets Can Be a Winning Strategy,"Nov 23, 2021",Bill Packer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-focusing-on-underserved-or-niche-markets-can-be-a/396218,"
There are entire industries built on the premise of ""Go big or go home"" — wherein success is defined not necessarily in terms of profitability, but by the ability to find the big market, scale to meet it, then scale even more. The underlying concept is that, because large markets have huge numbers of customers to reach, the opportunity is greatest there, but going after the biggest buyer group and honing in on their obvious needs isn't the only path to doing well, and can often put one in the position of simply being a commodity player. It's worth asking, as a seller, whether it's possible to do better taking a different path and looking for smaller, perhaps underserved markets. These are often less expensive to buy into, have lower overall competition and provide a new business the opportunity to truly differentiate itself through convenience, technology and personalized service.Related: How to Thrive in Niche MarketsObvious opportunities = ample competitionWhen a lot of people have a clear need, it's obvious that many business leaders are going to target it — their principal concern how to develop themselves and their companies to meet that need in a way that stands out. As a result, competition is often reduced to its lowest common denominator: price, which is often the sole differentiator that customers are actually able to see. In such a crowded mass market, products get commoditized. Take coffee, for example, which was a commodity-only proposition for decades until a few competitors realized that customers had another need: they wanted a place where they could be social, where coffee was just a part of the experience. And, voila, an entirely new industry was invented (some might say rediscovered).  



In mass market situations, a potentially winning bet is to leave that crowded playing field and find niche areas where customers aren't being served. The number of customers in that niche might be smaller, but you'll have less competition and can earn a reputation as a leader in providing those special goods and services.If this tactic strikes a familiar technology note, that's because it's one concept behind good SEO. If you find the relevant keywords most other sites don't use, then you can pop to the top of Google rankings. 


Related: Why Finding Your Niche Is Crucial to Excel and SucceedFinding your nicheRenovation lending is a great example of how niche marketing can work in your favor. In this structure, a lender bases a loan on what a property will be worth after improvements (such as redoing a kitchen, updating a bath or adding an addition) are made. For example, let's say you want to buy a property priced at $200,000 and are further interested in a bath and kitchen remodel costing $75,000. A conventional lender might lend you up to 80%, or $160,000, and you come up with the rest ($40,000) as a down payment. After purchasing the home, you hire a contractor and pay them $75,000, for a total cash outlay of $115,000. But if you take a renovation loan, the appraiser will evaluate the property as though you've already done the improvements. That might bump the value of the home from $200,000 to perhaps $260,000. A lender would then lend 80% of $260,000, which covers the purchase price plus $8,000 of the remodeling expense. For most, that loan type would be considerably more affordable.Smaller companies in particular can benefit from renovation loans and other lesser-known loan products. They don't need the economy of scale that the big players do, and are usually more comfortable with a more high-touch or personal market. In much the same way a local boutique clothing store can offer a more immersive, relationship-based experience compared to a giant like Amazon, smaller lending companies are taking advantage of their ability to tackle less common products, in a personal way, and directly within their communities.Related: How Niching Down Gives You the Power to Dominate Your Market


The risks can be well worth itGetting involved in a niche product or sector admittedly carries higher risks. In the renovation lending example, the risk of a contractor issue is now shared by consumer and lender (rather than being just the consumer's concern), and you have to be comfortable with that higher risk. But going niche and addressing underserved markets often means you can cater to the strengths you already have, rather than changing everything to do new business. So, look at what you do well or already have the resources for, then match that to a product or market need that doesn't have as much competition, and take time along the way to build strong relationships for consistent profit and sustainability.

57,Received Extra Cash? Should You Invest or Pay Off Debt?,"Oct 22, 2021",Melissa Brock,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/received-extra-cash-should-you-invest-or-pay-off-debt/392790,"
Invest or pay off debt… Pay off debt or invest? The choice can seem excruciating, especially if you have a deep desire to prepare for your financial future and wipe out debt once and for all.Do these scenarios sound familiar?



Sarah has $5,000 in student loan debt and $5,000 in credit card debt. In addition to these debts, she has a car payment and a mortgage. She has trouble making ends meet and has decided that she just doesn't have any extra cash to sink into a 401(K) or Roth IRA. One of Sarah's relatives dies and leaves her with $10,000. She thinks, ""Wow, that's just enough to pay off student loans and my credit card debt. But I haven't gotten started investing at all — I've been working for five years and have never set up a retirement account."" 


What should Sarah do?Or maybe you can relate to this one: Caleb has been investing for years. He has $90,000 in student loan debt from his stint in medical school. He pays just the minimum on his student loans because he believes he can make more money by investing in the stock market and it's more advantageous to do that rather than pay off his loans. He gets a $10,000 windfall and puts it all into the stock market.Should Caleb have chosen to do that instead of pay off his student loans?


Here's the deal: Ultimately, what's right for you may not make sense for someone else. In this example, Caleb has already moved down the path of investing in lieu of paying off student loans, while Sarah seems paralyzed with indecision. Let's take a look at some things you may want to consider in your own personal situation.How to Decide Whether to Pay Off Debt or InvestIf you've come across some money, use the old pro and con trick to decide which will benefit you the most. Reasons to Invest Instead of Pay Off Debt Let's take a look at the pros and cons of investing before focusing on paying off debt. 


You can take advantage of compound interest. Investing money in the market can benefit you in the long run. Putting money in the market early on can make a major difference in how much you end up with at retirement or a number of years down the road. In general, if you believe it's more important to pursue a higher return on your investments than the interest rate that you pay on your debt, you should consider investing. You also might not want to spend so much time on paying down debt that you miss the chance to take advantage of what happens in the markets over time.The interest rate on your debt might be low. The current average mortgage rate on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 3.03%, which is really low by a lot of standards. You might reason that you can earn more in the stock market (10% on average over the past century) and may opt to put a priority on investing instead.Consider investing to protect yourself. What if you got in a car accident, suffered a serious injury and could no longer work or if your spouse died at a young age, leaving you to raise young children. Preparation might come with investing and coming up with income streams instead of continuing to pay off debt.Reasons to Pay Off Debt Instead of InvestLet's take a look at the flip side. If you can't stomach the thought of keeping debt hanging around, you're not wrong to consider that angle. Consider the reasons to pay off debt instead of putting a priority on investing: Debt is psychologically challenging. When you have excessive amounts of debt, it might be all you can think about. Wiping out debt can offer better mental benefits (and even physical benefits!).You save on interest. Let's say you have a $10,000 credit card balance and have an APR of 18% on your credit card. You can arrive at your minimum payment and amount owed using a simple calculation: $10,000 balance x (0.18 APR / 12 months) = $150. You owe $10,150. Imagine if you continue to add increments like that onto your amount each month. Yikes.You may retire earlier. Research shows that a reduction in mortgage debt since age 62 comes with lower bill-paying difficulty and lower levels of ongoing financial strain in retirement.It helps your credit score: When you pay off debt, it boosts your credit score, which can help you qualify for things you want, such as that beautiful house you've always ogled in your neighborhood.You build a stronger relationship with your spouse or partner: Your spouse or partner will thank you for restoring equilibrium to your relationship. Debt has a tendency to force apart relationships, and numerous studies have proven that fact.Reasons Why You Might Want to Consider Doing BothThere's a third option here: Investing and paying off debt at the same time. The option has long been popularized by many experts and it's also completely viable. It's fair to take a look at the possibility of saving and investing at the same time. You can balance both goals. You might not feel quite right about focusing on just getting out of the red or just investing. Doing both can allow you to feel as if you're making progress in both directions: your financial goals (like saving for retirement) and working to eliminate debt at the same time. What Did You Decide?Guess what. There's no wrong answer here. The beauty of personal finance is that it's personal. You can make a decision better than anyone else for your own life because nobody  has the exact same goals and dreams as you do. As long as you factor your investment goals and time horizon into all the angles that you consider, you're unstoppable.

58,You Might Not Know That You're a High-Risk Customer for Mainstream Banks,"Oct 18, 2021",Ekaterina Romanovskaya,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/you-might-not-know-that-youre-a-high-risk-customer-for/390014,"
It may come as a surprise to see your business in the high-risk category. Segments of the ""new economy"" like trading cryptocurrency, creating online content, selling legal cannabis or contemporary art, or even building ecommerce platforms, can raise red flags for banks. You might run into unexpected bumps trying to open a bank account for your business or even for yourself as an individual. How should you approach this challenge?Traditionally, high-risk used to be a narrow niche of gambling, all things adult-oriented, selling firearms and other marginal activities in so-called gray areas of the law. Technology has dramatically changed the ways people make money and build wealth, creating new disruptive industries almost every day. A few years ago, a professional Twitch streamer was treated as an isolated business case, but today creators have their own economy with a market size of $104 billion. The crypto market will reach $4.94 billion by 2030. Add $347 billion of the gig economy growing by 30% each year, and you won't be inclined to call it a niche. 



It is time to shake off the negative connotation of the term ""high-risk"" — that same high risk will most certainly drive fintech and traditional banking growth over the next ten years.Related: Here's How Automation Has Changed the Face of the Banking


Mainstream banking isn't ready to embrace the new economy Most next-generation businesses are labeled as high-risk, which limits their access to banking, sometimes significantly. Traditional banks and payment processors find it too demanding and resource-consuming to work with them. Recent media dramas with adult-entertainment platform OnlyFans and leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance illustrate the trend: Banking partners threaten to break relationships with companies involved in what they perceive as risky business. More and more often, they are following through on their threats by freezing transactions and deposits, closing existing bank accounts without notice, or simply refusing any kind of service without explanation. The problem is that the rejected businesses still need financial services, and they are sometimes forced to look for less traditional alternatives.This disconnect has already been acknowledged by a few fintech projects targeted at specific audiences. Karat announced it will develop bespoke banking products for creators, and DayLight raised $20 million to build a bank for the LGBT+ community. It may look like a tangible solution, but it's nothing more than a patch. Seriously, should every community wait until there's a tailor-made bank for them?Related: 8 Ways Digital Banking Will Evolve Over the Next 5 YearsIt's all about complianceA bank's compliance team is the first to greet you after receiving your application. Their job is to make sure you are who you say you are, you haven't done anything illegal before, and you won't do anything suspicious on their platform. 


If there's anything complicated about your line of work, you may face longer onboarding with back-and-forth emailing or even be rejected when opening a bank account. Any of the following can make the onboarding process difficult:Non-standard operations: unusual, new or non-conventional approach to business.Complex corporate and ownership structure: multiple legal entities with convoluted affiliation, non-resident owners.Sophisticated money flows: multileg transactions in multiple jurisdictions and currencies.Dealing with third-party money: in other words, if your business is B2B2C.Activity that is restricted in certain jurisdictions or requires licensing or certification.Cash-heavy operations, especially ATM networks and payment kiosks of all sorts.Basically, if your ambition is to serve global customers and modern audiences with changing consumption habits, you'd better be prepared to prove that your business is compliant. What does that mean for the practical side of things?


You can help the bank's compliance teams understand your business inside out. In other words, you need to decompose the risk for them by providing comprehensive and verifiable answers to the following questions.1. What do you do?Do not limit the description of your business to a single line. Unlike venture capitalists and startup accelerators who encourage founders to come up with three-word business descriptions, compliance teams won't be impressed with a one-liner like ""Collaborative platform for creators"" or ""Programmable money solution"" in your application. Be specific and elaborate on every aspect of your business. Do not use industry jargon. Your goal is to explain your business with enough details and clarity for an outsider to get a solid understanding of what you do.2. Who owns your business? 


If the ownership of your company is complicated, it is your job to unravel it, layer by layer. Provide documents from relevant business registries about all beneficiaries, investors, shareholders and other affiliated companies and individuals. Include proofs of sources of funds, recent bank statements, and other documents that shine some light on the origin of the money you build your business with.3. Who are your customers (and your customers' customers)?You must explain who exactly you are dealing with and what the nature of your relationship is. It is not enough to describe the audience on a general level. Name your existing and potential customers, send your list of vendors, and share details of your interaction with them.If you deal with other people's money, you should persuade your banking partner that you meet KYC (Know Your Customer) standards and that you can expand to KYCC (Know Your Customers' Customers) if necessary. Having compliance policies in place is not enough. You have to prove that the policies are applied in every single case, your global customers' identities are verified, and your company has the capacity to detect and prevent fraudulent activity.


Your end game is to help your bank help you. If you take the time to align your application with the regulation requirements, you'll increase your chances of being accepted by your chosen bank. In turn, the bank won't spend days trying to connect the dots and figure out important information on its own. You do it for your bank with the expectation that down the road, the bank will be able to explain to regulators that the risk of serving your company is very manageable.

59,Received a Lump Sum of Money? Here's What You Might Want to Do Next,"Sep 28, 2021",Melissa Brock,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/received-a-lump-sum-of-money-heres-what-you-might-want-to/388068,"
Did you receive a lump sum of money from a deceased relative? Maybe you're all set to receive a wad of cash from a parent or grandparent around the holidays. Or maybe you're planning to get a larger-than-usual bonus from your boss at year end. Windfalls are more common than you may think, and Americans get them through a variety of methods — through an inheritance, lawsuit settlement, bonus and even the lottery. According to Schwab, Americans plan to leave an average of $177,000 to their relatives when they die. About 35% of working-age Americans receive an average of $24,000 from family members in gift money.Once you receive a lump sum of money, what do you do with it? Invest it as a lump sum or invest in increments over time? Spend half of it and invest the rest? Let's walk though your options.



What Options Do You Have for a Lump Sum?What might you choose to do when you receive a lump sum of money? Some options might include paying down debt, building your emergency fund, investing, fund your retirement accounts, funding an HSA and more. Let's walk through each option.Pay Down DebtYou may want to direct your attention to your looming debt — a mortgage, a couple of car loans, maybe a personal loan and student loans. If you have debt, you're not alone. 


In fact, total household debt rose by $313 billion (2.1%) to reach $14.96 trillion in the second quarter of 2021, according to the latest Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Mortgage balances rose by $282 billion and auto loans increased by $33 billion. Credit card balances increased by $17 billion, according to the same report.You may see the value in paying off any high-interest consumer debt like credit cards. Doing so can benefit you in more ways than one: You can save on interest and also eliminate any possible negative impact on your credit score. Build Your Emergency FundBuilding an emergency fund might seem like really boring uses of windfall money. Building your emergency fund, however, can give you the peace of mind you need so you have money at your disposal if something comes up — the car conks out, you must have an emergency surgery, you lose your job, etc. The bottom line: You want to have between three and six months' worth of expenses in an emergency fund. You might want to cushion your emergency fund with more money if, for example, you own your own business and make irregular income. 


Invest Your MoneyInvesting your windfall is often a natural choice. But should invest all your money at once or invest it in smaller increments over time, a strategy called dollar-cost averaging? Dollar-cost averaging allows you to avoid volatility on large investments right away. Dollar-cost averaging might work best for you if you want to minimize the downside risk of a huge investment or take advantage of the market's natural fluctuations by only buying when the market dips. Taking the dollar-cost averaging approach can help you feel better about investing right when the market takes a swing downward. Investing a lump sum, on the other hand, gives you exposure to the markets right away so you can take advantage of market growth immediately. You put time on your side so your money can grow.A Northwestern Mutual study found that between an immediate lump-sum investment and dollar-cost averaging, the lump-sum investing outperformed dollar-cost averaging 75% of the time. In fact, a 100% fixed income portfolio outperformed dollar-cost averaging 90% of the time. You may want to consider this study before you choose one option over the other.Fund Your Retirement AccountsWhat's going on with your retirement fund these days? Is it plumped to the max? You can invest $19,500 in 2021 in employer-sponsored plans such as a 401(k), 403(b), 457 plans or a thrift savings plan. You can invest an additional $6,500 if you're 50 or older.


You can contribute $6,000 to an individual retirement account (IRA) or Roth IRA with a catch-up provision of $1,000 for individuals 50 and older.As long as you're earning income, you may be able to put extra money here. Fund an HSAHave you ever considered using a health savings account (HSA) to fund your retirement? You can do so as long as you invest in a high-deductible health plan.HSAs offer a three-pronged tax benefit: 


Contributions are tax-deductible.Earnings grow tax-free.Withdrawals are tax free as long as you use them for medical expenses.It's a great retirement savings vehicle because you'll probably need to spend money on medical expenses in retirement.Put the Money Aside for NowHere's an unconventional thought. Instead of doing something with your money right away, you might want to set it aside so you can think about what to do with your cash. You can put it in a short-term account (such as a savings account or money market account) while you decide what to do. It might even help you figure out whether it's a wise choice to spend part of it or not.Talk to a Fiduciary Financial Advisor and/or a Tax AdvisorA fiduciary financial advisor can help you figure out how to handle a large amount of money based on your goals, risk tolerance and investment timeline/horizon. A financial advisor can also help you carefully figure out the right asset allocation for your investments based on all of those factors.You may want to get a CPA or tax advisor involved because you'll need to pay taxes on part of your windfall through capital gains taxes or estate taxes. 


Make the Right Decisions for Your Lump SumNotice that one other option didn't make the list, though it's certainly an option: You can spend all of your windfall (or a portion of it). Spending a portion of it may make sense if you've got all your debts paid off and if you have your retirement funds squared away. If you've made the right decisions financially, you might want to take that trip to Tahiti or build the home of your dreams. However, just be aware of the tax implications before you get started.

60,So You Want Your PPP Loan Forgiven? Make Sure You Submit This Application,"Aug 21, 2021",Ken So,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/so-you-want-your-ppp-loan-forgiven-make-sure-you-submit/380385,"
The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) — the U.S. government's lifeline for small businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic — sent out a total of nearly $800 billion to help companies keep staff on their payrolls in 2020 and 2021. PPP loan applications officially closed on May 31 after the available funds were exhausted sooner than analysts originally predicted.But confusion remains about the loans. The term ""loan"" in and of itself isn't entirely accurate, because the required ""forgiveness"" follow-up application effectively makes the loan a grant — as long as certain requirements are met.Contrary to what many might think, forgiveness isn't automatically granted or guaranteed. Why? When the pandemic began, Congress wanted to help small businesses through the crisis. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) wasn't equipped to distribute those grants, but it was equipped to approve loans. Overhauling that process takes time, and Congress had to act.



Related: 3 Lessons on PPP Loan Forgiveness From Small-Business OwnersIn execution, the process worked like this: Small businesses applied for and received PPP loans. During the covered period, they spent those loans on the appropriate items, primarily payroll. Now, they have to apply for forgiveness with their lenders and provide the required documentation in order to have the loans forgiven. Lenders have 60 days to respond to these requests.


To date, more than 3.3 million loans — worth a total of $279.4 billion — have been forgiven, according to the SBA. That leaves nearly $159.1 billion in loans left to forgive, but the businesses with these loans first have to take action and apply.Will your PPP loan be forgiven?In general, your business can expect loan forgiveness if you kept or rehired employees while still maintaining pre-pandemic salary levels, spent at least 60 percent of the loan on payroll and spent the other 40 percent on other qualified expenses. Even if your company doesn't meet these criteria (if your headcount or salaries decreased, for instance), you might still be eligible for partial forgiveness.Related: PPP Loan Forgiveness Period Beginning to Close; Payments May Be DueStill, there are a number of misconceptions when it comes to loan forgiveness and the PPP process in general. Some small business owners erroneously assume that the PPP is just for big businesses. But as long as a company has fewer than 500 employees and was operating on Feb. 15, 2020, it is eligible. Some sole proprietors and independent contractors are even eligible to apply.


Other businesses assume that if they're receiving other forms of financial assistance, they aren't eligible to also receive a PPP loan. This is not true. In fact, many businesses received a PPP loan as well as other SBA financial assistance, such as the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) and 7(a) loans. However, it is worth noting that organizations can't use their PPP funding and EIDL loan for the same payments.Finally, many business owners think the forgiveness process is too complicated and that their business might not qualify. This couldn't be further from the truth. Full forgiveness isn't guaranteed, but if you use or used the PPP proceeds according to the rules, forgiveness is likely and certainly worth pursuing. Even if forgiveness isn't possible, the loan terms are generally much better than most — 1 percent annual percentage rate for 60 months with payments deferred up to 10 months after that.Preparing for the PPP forgiveness application processIf you haven't applied for forgiveness, don't wait any longer. Having the PPP on your books could hurt your ability to get financing with some lenders who want to see the loan cleared first. That said, here are three ways to prepare for applying:1. Review the time frame and make a planPPP loan forgiveness happens in phases. Applications are open for loans funded through Feb. 28, 2021. That will progressively open up over the next several weeks. You may submit a loan forgiveness application at any time on or before the loan's maturity if you've used all of the proceeds.


Related: SBA Releases New EZ PPP Loan-Forgiveness ApplicationThe good news is that the process is likely much easier than you think if you follow instructions and apply on time. Jill Draper, a yarn shop owner in upstate New York, said she essentially had to fill in a few boxes on a mostly auto-filled form from her bank. Ten days later, she received an email confirming her loan was forgiven in full.2. Make sure you're spending your money the right way to qualifyRemember: At least 60 percent of your PPP loan needs to go to payroll, with the other 40 percent to qualified expenses. You'll need to provide documentation on your loan forgiveness application, so it's important you keep good records and can supply a breakdown of how you spent funds within each expense category.What should you avoid spending your PPP loan funds on? As 22 people who committed PPP fraud found out the hard way, jewelry, cars and other luxury personal items are off-limits.


3. Work with your lender to dig into the detailsYour lender is your guide in this process. Ask them to help you distinguish between a PPP1 and PPP2 loan. The process is more difficult for the former than the latter (one page versus 13 pages). Your lender will help ensure you are following all the proper protocols for your specific situation.The SBA just announced a consumer-facing online platform where businesses can apply for PPP loan forgiveness. For loans of $150,000 or less — which account for 90 percent of the PPP loans yet to be paid off — businesses can apply for forgiveness on their own. For businesses with loans over that $150,000 threshold, the SBA requires lenders to negotiate directly with them. It's important to keep your lender in your corner and lean on them for support. The SBA is the final decision maker when it comes to loan forgiveness, but your lender will act as your advocate to try and give you the best chance of successful and complete forgiveness.PPP loans were designed to be forgiven, but small businesses still need to apply for that forgiveness for it to become reality. By knowing the timelines, keeping good financial records and working closely with your lender, you will set your business up for success in getting that loan forgiven in full, further benefiting your business and enabling it to move forward in a strong position.

61,Are You Planning to Buy a Home? Read This First.,"Aug 10, 2021",Cheryl Snapp Conner,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/are-you-planning-to-buy-a-home-read-this-first/378862,"
My column has been quiet for the past two months for an interesting reason. I've been on a quest to buy a second home, in Idaho. My most important reason was to be closer to my 83-year-old mother, who was widowed when my father passed away late last year. A great plan, but I could have never imagined the adventure I'd experience. Because it's lengthy, I'll jump to the punchline first. I succeeded, but not without a series of nightmares I will not soon forget. For others considering this journey, I'm offering the wisdom of an expert I've recently met: Nicole Espinosa, ""The Short Sale Queen."" I wish I'd known her sooner. Espinosa, from Dallas, is an expert in ""short sales"" — situations where an owner can't afford to continue his or her mortgage and the lender accepts a reduced sum to avoid foreclosure. It helps protect the homeowner's credit and helps the lender avoid an even larger loss. The structure also helps other buyers by reducing artificially inflated prices. 



Related: 5 Amazing Tips on Turning Real Estate Into a Real FortuneFrom her experience, Espinosa knows what to look out for in a home purchase and an accompanying loan. With her help, I've outlined six things every entrepreneur, owner or self-employed person should know that could have stopped the majority of my woes in their tracks: Avoid large banks. As a realtor who specializes in entrepreneurs, Espinosa stays away from large banks. Regardless of the agent, she says, these banks don't have the flexibility or even the ability, period, to deal with exceptions. You need a lender that specializes in self-employment and can make exceptions where warranted or at least be able to bring a little extra common sense into the mix. The realtor is vital. He or she must be knowledgeable about what you're working with and able to route you to the deals and lenders who can make your deal work. If you are selling a home, the right realtor can also confirm that your buyer is working with a lender that can finish the deal and can do so within contractual limits for time.Consider a bank statement loan. There are lenders, Espinosa says, who can get a loan approved on only your bank statements. The rate is a bit higher, but it brings the ability to steer clear of nightmares like ""You certainly rebounded from Covid, but these are forecasts, not historic reports. Come back in a year"" or ""You had a PPP loan. Forgiven or not, it makes your debt-to-income ratio too high."" Consider the home as an investment. If the need or desire arises, could you rent it out? If you experience a downturn, can you exit it quickly? Will you have high equity and could you access it quickly? Strategize in advance of the buy. If you're thinking of a future purchase, find out how to structure your assets for surest success. For example, could you buy the home through your business or within an LLC and rent it back to yourself? Get input that allows you to think out of the box and get better prepared.  If you can pay in cash, is it worth it? If the price a cash offer gets you is worth it, and you have the option to do so, perhaps the answer is ""yes."" Then evaluate afterward if it's advantageous to open a line of credit against the equity as emergency funds or to give you a leveraged position without the need to offer an inflated price to win the deal because you are funding your home. And now I will share my adventure with you.  For many reasons, my decision to purchase made great sense. However, I was buying into one of the fastest-growing areas in the entire U.S. I spoke to our CPA and a rental properties expert and devised a plan to secure a home that could be compelling as a part-time rental. Family vacations are still a giant priority, I learned from my friend Jerry Conti, who heads up LuxHomePro and LuxVacationRentals in Phoenix. The ideal home offers high-end amenities and a location where a family can enjoy parks, pools and a level of luxury while limiting their exposure to outsiders and crowds when desired. Eureka. Renting my home for even 15% of the time would open a host of tax advantages as well as provide rental income to help offset the carrying costs. 


I found a beautiful development of new properties seven minutes from my mother and the family home. I learned the builder was not a mass developer, but a retired veteran turned craftsman doing custom remodeling and real-estate flips. Extra points. My offer was accepted on January 9. I was over the moon. Related: 2021 Home Buying Trends in the U.S.The adventures begin""Do you need a lender?"" The builder's wife, who also served as our agent, provided me with the card of a mortgage officer for one of the largest national banks. As an owner of multiple homes throughout my career, I'm familiar with the mortgage process and have worked with it well. ""I don't know this individual,"" she said, ""But he gave me his contact information and said he'd be happy to help the clientele we're supporting."" I accepted the card and gave him a call. ""Easy,"" I thought. I'd get a 7/1 loan (seven years at the fixed rate followed by variable interest for any portion that remained by year eight). I submitted a mountain of paperwork through the online portal. Everything appeared to be great.  Weeks went by, but I wasn't worried. Neither was our builder, who signed a first and then a second extension on our agreement to purchase.  


Unlike the loan we'd nearly taken for a rebuild of our Utah home the year prior, we learned late in the process that this loan, in contrast, required the down payment upfront. (The prior had required only proof of at least 20% equity at completion before finalizing the permanent loan). But nowhere in the discussion had this detail emerged. This was frustrating, but we took out a quick line of credit on our Utah home to meet the requirement, and once again, we were set. Then the bank began pushing back on our builder, as the reviews of their work had been for projects completed before the Covid lockdown began. Without reviews from recent months, the bank refused to proceed. Flurries of letters from subcontractors and vendors ensued. The bank relented. But during the delay, prices spiked. Material costs had gone to the moon, and contractors were suddenly rarer than gold. Even getting updated bids was now impossible for projects not already begun. Our builder couldn't offer a further extension unless we jumped to a higher price or a smaller house and a year-long build. It was untenable. I was out. But I was now holding a conditional mortgage approval. A glimmer of hopeOur agent (the builder's wife) began to offer suggestions for alternative solutions among existing homes that were slightly smaller but still ideally located and near completion or recently built. A smaller build would stay within the right price range, she reasoned, would be ready to occupy and would have the advantage of being constructed before the cost of materials soared. It made sense. The fewer rooms could serve additional functions. A bonus room could be a media room, a workout area and when needed, an additional bedroom. A home office could offer flexible space for additional sleeping as well. But now an entirely different challenge emerged. Most listings in Ada County (and other booming locations) were no longer entering the market in the traditional way. They now emerge for a single open house on a weekend. Agents collect offers over a three to four day period configured as ""bids"" for the price above asking the buyer is willing to pay. Many are cash offers from out of state, sight unseen, with appraisal and inspection requirements waived. Any buyer getting a loan must make a higher bid to offset the 30 days required to complete a deal (if the bank is even able to close the deal within contractual limits) or the risk of failed funding. Even worse, a bidding buyer has to verify the ability to pay for any portion of the purchase that exceeds the appraisal in cash. The highest known bid, I was told, was for $150,000 over asking. In searches, I found 49 new homes that met the criteria I was seeking. All 49 had gone under contract within days. 


""But you now have an approval from the bank in your pocket,"" our agent said. She was right. With the help of her ability to attend open houses and answer our questions through photos and FaceTime, we pressed on. In 30 days, I made 5 offers, all for tens of thousands above asking and our realtor drew up purchase agreements for each. All five failed. And then … a winning contender At this point, our conditional approval was nearly expired. But our agent presented a final idea. She'd found a home that had been a model home with nearly all of the upgrades I wanted. It had been occupied by just one owner for one year who'd been searching for horse property. Like us, the couple had attempted and failed on five offers. Finally, they'd gotten a deal, but it would require the successful sale of their current home to succeed. Our agent learned of the home prior to its listing and sent photos from its showings in the year prior. The asking price was reasonable. She suggested presenting our best offer with pre-approval in hand at the moment of opening with a time limit of 24 hours. It was brilliant. The seller accepted. The journey was on. Our mortgage agent spoke to the seller's agent, assuring him with words that later proved to be fatal, ""This deal will happen. We already approved the buyer for a larger project than this."" 50 days of anguishBecause the new project was a purchase, not a build, we'd need to reapply, the banker informed us. But with our records already in the system, we were assured the new approval would be a certain slam dunk. Then the bank went quiet. A week later, an identical home appeared and went under contract for $102,000 more than our deal. Of course, our sellers were fully aware. Two more weeks went by. Our appraisal was late. In the market flurry, we learned, it had to be provided two ways — one, to assess the value by traditional methods and another to express the ""new value"" in the bidding model of sales. Finally, it was complete, and thankfully, it supported our sale. But the bank remained nonchalant about our contractual deadline. Our seller agreed (reluctantly) to allow two additional weeks to close, which required them to board their horses and extend the lock on their loan at a cost. I offered to pay. They obtained an agreement to occupy their new property early, at a per diem rate, and extended the same offer to us. It was a wonderful favor, but a deadly risk, we later learned, with our loan still awaiting final approval and not yet scheduled to close. Still, the mortgage agent remained nonchalant. Privately, he acknowledged the tension between central underwriters and outlying teams of mortgage agents who don't get paid unless a mortgage succeeds. He assured me, however, that all sides get highly motivated in the final week of the process, as all sides lose if funding should fail. But as the final week ticked by, approval was still pending. With the seller's stress sky-high, the bank finally provided a letter and disclosures for signature, but still labeled ""conditional approval."" Then the other shoe dropped. The final approval, now down to the final possible day, was denied.  


Related: 4 Simple Tips for Finding Incredible Real-Estate DealsThe death knell As I'd gathered final updates for the underwriting assistant, I heard a small gasp as she reviewed the credit union dashboard that confirmed our down payment funds. ""Oh, no,"" she said. ""You've had PPP loans."" ""Yes, of course,"" I replied. Our agency had been an ideal candidate. The grants had been a great boon during the lockdown. The two loans (we have both an S Corp and an LLC) had been documented clearly in our tax returns, had not been counted as revenue and the lender had verified forgiveness. ""Surely this isn't a problem?"" I asked. I sent links of documentation from the SBA describing the way loans are forgiven, lenders are reimbursed and confirmation is received from the lending provider. All was well. Except that it wasn't. As one of the largest banks, the lender's final process was so highly regimented, no deviation from the standard template for borrowing could fly. From the bank's standpoint, no forgiveness would be acknowledged without a printed statement from the SBA about our specific loan number, which, of course, the SBA doesn't provide. Then the agent's final message revealed all. ""We have documented your personal revenue at $XX,XXX. With these items subtracted, it is now a negative number. You can't buy a home."" 


There was no opportunity for a discussion and no potential recourse. He invited me to resign my application or face the consequence of negative credit reporting on the fact I'd been turned down for the loan. I was stunned. And I was even more stunned when I learned the revenue number he'd avoided disclosing during the six weeks of our process. It was my W2 income, which, as an entrepreneur, was barely more than a third of the sum I'd confirmed. Now the picture was clear. In an attempt to put the loan through in the easiest way possible, the agent had accepted only W2 our income and avoided disclosing the rest, saying only that we'd need to bring 31% of the loan to the table to close. The denouement – never say die My story, thankfully, had a happy ending, though I would not wish the 10 days that followed on any living soul. On top of my angst at the prospect of losing our deposit and the mounting compensation to the seller, was the fact I had fully moved into the home. In desperation, realizing we'd already gathered 31% of the purchase, I contemplated what it would take to get from 31% to 100%, eliminate the bank and finish the purchase in cash. My mother and my brother provided loans. A dear friend provided a significant short-term loan from his own line of credit. Still, we were $183,000 short. On the next day, which was to have been our closing, we arrived instead with two-thirds of our purchase in hand and an offer to provide the balance in 10 days by increasing the line we'd just obtained against our primary home. It was one of the most humbling moments of my life. While I held no legal obligation for the deals above mine, as worried as I was for my own deal, I'd have felt even worse if I'd caused two additional projects to fail. Our realtor reminded me how risky this new offer would be. If I failed, I'd forfeit the entire amount now in escrow. The seller could remarket the home and probably sell within days for $100,000 more. The seller's seller could pocket their sum, subdivide their property and make as much as 5 times their original sale. 


I understood the risk and was prepared, if I had to, to secure the final funds from our retirement accounts. It would have been a terrible loss and a giant hit to our taxes but would have allowed our deal to succeed. Our last-ditch offer succeeded. An officer of the credit union that granted our HELOC loan weeks before was sympathetic, and in an all-time record, was able to double the loan. In seven days, this small organization had accomplished what one of the largest U.S. banks could not, as one entrepreneurial team supporting another.  I am grateful beyond words for that effort and for each of the individuals who helped us to weather an unbelievable storm. In that light, I am hoping this story can be of help to many additional entrepreneurs. If you are contemplating the purchase of a home, I applaud you. Property ownership continues to be a significant investment and for many, continues to represent the American Dream. But if you are planning this step without a traditional job history, I urge you to do your homework and be savvy and aware of the market and ecosystem you're working within to ensure your success.

62,5 Proven Ways to Make Money Starting With Just a Small Loan,"Jul 6, 2021",Asim Mughal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/5-proven-ways-to-make-money-starting-with-just-a-small-loan/372406,"
More often than not, loans are perceived negatively. The mention of debt is often accompanied by horror stories of bankruptcy and other theaters of financial distress. It's no wonder, then, that people tend to consider loans as last-ditch efforts at paying for emergency expenses. But is this bad rep justified? After all, if a loan can save a dying business, and in turn, help secure a profit, it's a savvy and often indispensable move. Of course, there are also instances in which borrowers are faced with not being able to pay off a loan, but as long as liabilities and forecasts are carefully planned, good debt can be a lifeline, and can be used additionally for investment organizing.When you ""leverage"" debt to maximize a return on an investment, you are, put succinctly, using borrowings at a lower rate to fuel a return at a higher rate. Though there is a risk of losing capital, using debt to gain profit is an often underrated means of making money. Once you review your risk appetite and perhaps change preconceived notions regarding loans, it's possible to turn debt into profit-making investment instruments.Five relatively safe ideas to get you started:Related: What Does ROI Really Mean To Entrepreneurs?

63,This Is How Purchase-Order Financing Can Unlock Your Small Business's Potential,"Jun 21, 2021",Avi Levine,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/this-is-how-purchase-order-financing-can-unlock-your-small/374847,"
Purchase-order financing provides access to funding for undercapitalized, small-to-medium-sized businesses that have high-growth opportunities. This type of financing allows these companies to fill orders that they otherwise wouldn't be able to handle.In the world of manufacturing and distribution, cash flow is king. Without cash on hand to fund purchase orders and fulfill contracts, growth is often stifled and customer relationships can be jeopardized.Small-to-medium-sized companies looking to scale their businesses need capital to make those gains possible. Purchase-order financing is a way for companies to grow their businesses and fill large orders that they likely wouldn't be able to afford on their own.



When we started purchase-order financing at Star Funding, Inc., more than 20 years ago, we viewed that manner of business as an interesting and dynamic means of helping small businesses realize their dreams. Now, more than two decades later, we've been able to help several dozens of companies scale their businesses and reach dreams they never thought possible.       Related: You Can't Get VC Funding for Your Startup. Now, What?Here are some answers to the questions that companies most often have about purchase-order financing.What is purchase-order financing?Purchase-order financing is when the production of goods for resale that are pre-sold to end customers is financed by a third party, such as Star Funding, Inc. Once a client gets a purchase order from a credit-worthy customer, he or she is able to purchase the inventory and materials needed to fill the order through financing.Rather than working with a bank that will focus on assets, cashflow or past finances before authorizing financing, purchase-order finance companies will analyze specific opportunities and orders already in place.By doing this, purchase-order finance companies attempt to unlock new forms of leverage for entrepreneurs. For these rapidly growing businesses, it's all about growth capital. This alternative option could allow a company doing $1 million in sales to potentially grow the business to $10 to $15 million in sales via the proper purchase-order financing plan. 


What businesses are best suited to utilize purchase-order financing?Purchase-order financing is for any company that is selling a product to another business. It's not a direct consumer sale.  That could be a company that is buying bikes out of China and selling them to Walmart or a company purchasing raw materials to produce a product domestically. Purchase-order financing can help provide cashflow for the purchase of the materials that will be used to make products to be sold.What are the first steps that a business needs to take in order to secure purchase-order financing?First, a business must secure a purchase order or be close to securing one from a customer. That business then needs to make sure it has access to acquire the products that it's reselling or producing in a timely manner.A company offering purchase-order financing will then examine the buying and selling sides of the transaction to make sure that the deal is a sound and profitable one. In most instances, purchase-order financing can be secured within days, propelling a business toward the growth that it has only previously dreamed of accomplishing.


Related: How to Choose the Best Small-Business Loan for Your NeedsWhy should we use purchase-order financing instead of securing financing through a bank?In most instances, companies using purchase-order financing can cover entire transactions without a client having to put any money down out of his or her own pocket.Also, here's another important reason to consider purchase-order financing: Small-to-medium-sized businesses can get financing help without having to sell equity in their company. Being forced to sell to investors often dilutes a company's power structure and threatens a loss of control.What advice do you have for small-to-medium-sized companies in this post-Covid business world?In today's world, success and sustainability are all about planning properly. Not just having a general idea of what you want to accomplish as a business, but having a monthly plan, a six-month plan and an annual plan — all with contingencies built in.  


These days, logistics is one of the biggest concerns. Shipping has been troubled with all of the delays for various reasons. There's a lot of planning that needs to be done on that end, and you must build in contingencies for when something goes wrong. A big part of that is making sure that you have the proper financial support to fall back on in the event that you need it.A lot of our clients will say to us, ""I was able to scrape together the funds needed to fill this P.O."" But then, they call us 10 days later and say, ""Well, something else came up and now I have to scramble for Plan B.""If they were planning ahead of time, they would already be set up with a purchase-order financing company. Then, there would be a structure in place so cancelled orders and cashflow shortages could be avoided.Purchase-order funding, still a relatively new option for businesses looking for creative ways to increase their finances, can ultimately help clients reach their growth goals. Best of all, it's a safe way for companies to scale their businesses without having to put down money or by diluting their equity stakes for short-term loans.

64,How to Avoid Getting into Debt in the First Place,"Jun 15, 2021",Melissa Brock,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/how-to-avoid-getting-into-debt-in-the-first-place/374601,"
It seems like summer always becomes the most expensive month of the year for my family. Between summer vacations, landscaping projects (why are rocks, found in nature, so expensive?!) and more… Yikes. It's easy to slide into debt. The truth is, no matter how savvy of a trader or investor you are, you can still end up in debt. When these extra expenses come rolling around, I need to add a few mental checks and practical preparation to my repertoire so I can avoid the summer slide. I thought they might help you as well.  Here's how not to let that gorgeous back patio trigger a few panic moments.



Tip 1: Don't buy it if you can't pay cash.No matter what ""it"" is, don't buy it if you can't pay for it with a wad of cash. My dad taught me that simple trick when I was a kid. It's such good advice that it bears repeating: If you don't have the money for it or you're tempted to buy it on credit, don't buy it at all. A credit card might make you think you have the money for a couch, new TV or an expensive phone, but you still have to pay back that money later. It's a simple lesson, but it's one that so many adults never learn. No matter how much money you earn, you can still get caught up in this need to have more ""stuff"" — and can still go into debt.


Tip 2: Fluff up, don't flub up, your emergency fund.Experts recommend that you beef up your emergency fund to the tune of three to six months' worth of living expenses. Put another way: Have at least six months' worth of salary saved up. This will help you if you lose your job or encounter another emergency that causes you to need money quickly.You might scoff at the idea of building up an emergency fund if you have plenty of assets. However, how liquid are those investments, really? If you've got money stashed away in an IRA or another type of non-liquid asset, you could pay penalties to take your money out. You may not want to do that because it could set you back even more. Tip 3: Pay off your credit cards every month.This kind of goes back to the first tip. Don't charge what you can't afford to pay back. You probably already know about the damaging cycle of high interest rates over the course of time. But did you know that carrying a high balance on your credit card also affects your credit utilization ratio? Credit utilization refers to the amount of credit you have used compared with how much credit a lender gives you. That ratio helps determine your credit score. In other words, if you have a $10,000 limit on your credit card but consistently charge $9,500 on your credit card every month, you'll have a high credit utilization ratio. 


The general rule of thumb involves keeping your credit utilization as low as possible — around 30% — and even less is better.Oh, and by the way, never, ever use your credit card for cash advances. What a money pit!Tip 4: Get your needs vs. wants straight.Got a clear idea of your wants versus your needs? For example, I just bought these super cute outdoor pillows for my front porch. I thought I ""needed"" them because one of my neighbors has (guess what?) super cute pillows on her front porch. I ordered them anyway. However, could my adirondack chairs survive without the super cute pillows? Of course. (I don't even actually need adirondack chairs, either.)


The more you get clear on needs versus your wants (no boat versus new boat) you will start to cull the debt creep. Does that mean you never satisfy your hunger for the things you want? Of course not! Take a look at the 50/30/20 rule below for more information. Tip 5: Standardize your budget. Make budgeting so normal and such a part of your life that you never buy anything without checking the budget first. Why not try the 50/30/20 rule for budgeting to get started? Here's how that works:Allocate 50% of your income toward needs (these could include groceries, rent/mortgage, utilities, car loan or other transportation costs, insurance, child care, child support, alimony, etc.)Allow 30% of your income to go toward wants. Put 20% of your income toward savings and repaying debt (toward your emergency fund, retirement fund, excess debt and more).You don't have to categorize all of this by yourself. In fact, just go straight for the budget app. A great budget app should connect your checking, credit and savings accounts and automatically categorize your recurring expenses. Good budget apps also give you some goals by creating custom categories for short- and long-term goals. Tip 6: Don't overspend on the little things. It's not always the boats or the new cars that get people into trouble, though those things can be major culprits. It's the little things (like super cute outdoor pillows for the front porch) that add up and end up causing credit card debt to balloon. 


You may have heard of your latte factor. Every little bit adds up in the form of lattes, new shoes, golf clubs and other ""little"" expenses. You could cost yourself hundreds of thousands of dollars when you spend. Don't Start Inching Toward DebtIf you get started with a clean slate, you'll never have to worry about inching toward debt from the very first day after you graduate from college. The earlier you start good money habits, the more likely they'll carry you through the rest of your life. Just remember that you can always start over with a clean slate and get out of debt. (You can get into debt at any point in your life. After all, terrible illnesses and accidents can come out of nowhere and bankrupt you.) However, taking these tips into consideration might help you put yourself into a position where you're never underwater again.  Featured Article:  What are earnings reports?

65,How to Qualify for an SBA Loan in 2021,"May 19, 2021",Thomas Smale,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-qualify-for-an-sba-loan-in-2021/370453,"
When you don't have the personal or investment capital necessary to start a business that requires a good chunk of it, the logical answer is to look into a business loan. And although just about any loan involves receiving a lump sum of cash and paying it back over a period of time, not every loan program is created equal. Out of all the business loan programs out there, many entrepreneurs tend to enjoy the accessibility and simplicity of SBA loans.But how do you qualify for an SBA loan? The current economy is volatile, and following the financial losses caused by many coronavirus-related closures, more and more businesses are competing for precious capital. Here's how to get in on what's available. Related: I Went to Prison for SBA Loan Fraud: 7 Things to Know When Taking COVID-19 Relief Money



Ensure your business meets the basic requirementsThe SBA doesn't actually give out loans; instead, it works with individual lenders to distribute loans to small businesses by setting guidelines set by its partnering lenders and community development organizations. As such, it's crucial that your small business meets these ""hard guidelines"" in order to even be in the running for an SBA loan. The SBA requires that businesses are for-profit, based in the United States, and ""small"" (per its size standards) to start. Founders need to have invested time and money into the business, exhausted other lending options, and established the ability to repay the loan over a reasonable period of time. The SBA's lending partners do not consider businesses that don't meet these criteria, so if your business is technically an enterprise or you're legally a nonprofit, you may be out of luck. (Other less common characteristics can disqualify a business as well, such as being faith-based, gambling- or marijuana-focused, or discriminatory, like any business that focuses its resources on clients of a certain gender or race.) Iron out your creditLike with any other loan, the SBA will examine a founder's credit score and history to determine their likelihood and ability to pay back the loan amount. As such, SBA loans aren't available to business owners whose credit scores are under 670, or whose credit histories recently show delinquent payments. Try retrieving a copy of your credit report prior to applying for an SBA loan, and if your credit score is on the lower end, take steps to improve the score over time.


Prepare everything on the loan submission checklistApplying for a loan is a lot more complicated than just asking for it. The SBA requires that any business looking for a loan completes an extensive loan application, a credit memo, a cash projection document and more. Some of these items are dependent on the amount of the desired loan, the age of the business or the number of borrowers on the loan application. Although less common, 504 loans (which are used for major fixed assets that frequently involve construction or long-term machinery) require different application items, so make sure to look out for the appropriate checklist for your desired loan. Related: 5 Best and Fast Small-Business Loans (Some of Which You've Never Heard of)Offer collateralThe SBA generally requires that business owners offer up some type of collateral to secure a loan. This is required of anyone who owns 20 percent or more of the business. Collateral can include assets such as real estate or office equipment, and can also cover things like accounts receivable, inventory and an owner's second mortgage on their home. In the SBA's own words, this is a founder's way of proving that they have ""skin in the game.""Similar to any financial decision, taking on an SBA loan also comes with its risks. Offering up collateral can result in personal consequences if you can't make your payments. SBA loans often have relatively high interest rates as well, which means more money paid back over the long-term (even though those interest rates do have a cap). And just like mortgages, SBA loans often come with origination and appraisal fees that tack onto the down payment before you can receive the actual cash you've applied for. All of these factors are important to consider before biting the bullet. 


If you do ever take out an SBA loan, remember that they can be put to use in a variety of different ways, including recovering from the impact of Covid-19, hiring new staff, investing in new technologies and even purchasing another business. As your business continues to grow, it is worth considering how this type of loan might best benefit your business. Related: His Criminal Record Disqualified Him From Receiving PPP.

66,This Is Why You Should Never Ignore Customer Feedback,"May 18, 2021",Neil Peretz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/this-is-why-you-should-never-ignore-customer-feedback/371454,"
In the era of social media, never has the phrase ""everyone's a critic"" been more accurate. Reputation matters — even in purely transactional businesses where you may never deal with the same customer ever again. People visiting your city for the one and only time who buy a coffee from your shop are still capable of posting a review on Yelp! or telling a friend via a public comment on Facebook.  It's inevitable that occasional customer experiences don't go as planned, sometimes for reasons beyond your immediate control. What you can control is your business's response and ability to learn.  



First and foremost, you should always consider negative customer feedback a gift. Customers can go away angry or dejected and not mention it to you. Offering feedback takes effort for customers; while they may be upset, they're showing that they care about you. More importantly, negative criticism creates opportunities for your organization to learn and improve and possibly even discover new market opportunities.Related: How to Make Negative Feedback Work for You


Creating opportunity out of criticismWhen someone offers your organization feedback, you need to make sure you have channels to capture it and share. Have a system for everyone in your organization to record and circulate customer feedback —  even the hourly, temporary workers should be taught about this system and how to access it.At one company where I served as general counsel, we provided financing to users of prepaid cell-phone service so they could acquire a smartphone, which helped them apply for jobs and manage their lives when they might not have regular Internet access at home. We monitored customer feedback carefully. In addition to fielding and responding to occasional queries and potential concerns about how our service might work in particular circumstances, we identified a pattern within the feedback: customers expressing dismay that the store they visited was out of stock of the smartphone the customer most desired.  The solution to this problem fell outside the bailiwick of our responsibilities; however, it still impacted our business, so we seized the opportunity to investigate. We asked the cell-phone retailers where our cell-phone financing was offered why they didn't have a deeper inventory. What we learned was that while the stores were often profitable, smartphones — even at a wholesale price — are expensive and these stores, many of which were independently owned and operated by small business people, lacked working capital to carry a large inventory.


The lightbulb went off. We were already in the business of financing and had developed extensive relationships with capital sources and banks. Could some of them help the independent cell-phone stores we dealt with? What we discovered was that certain banks could provide quite affordable financing if the loan application qualified for a Small Business Administration (SBA) guarantee.  Related: A Beginner's Guide to Qualifying for an SBA LoanHowever, the process of applying for an SBA-guaranteed loan could be challenging for these small retail businesses. They needed to assemble a wide range of background materials to support their application and then find out which banks were comfortable with that type of business.A new ventureA new business, called SmartBiz Loans, was born. SmartBiz focused on helping small businesses decipher what could otherwise be a long, complicated application process filled with demands for documentation not readily at their fingertips. After ensuring completion of the most accurate and high-quality application, SmartBiz helped identify which banks were the right fit for each type of business applicant.  


Rather than saying, ""Hey, that's someone else's problem,"" we identified an opportunity to use our unique skills and relationships to help more people in the small-business ecosystem.  Related: How Silicon Valley is Changing the Fintech SpaceNow, in addition to cell-phone retailers being able to support greater inventory for their customers, a broad range of small businesses across America have a better opportunity to avail themselves of affordable, SBA-guaranteed financing, even if they lack the financial and accounting prowess required for typical commercial-loan applications and don't have relationships with or geographic proximity to banks that can understand their business model.  It all began with paying attention to customer concerns.

67,How to Obtain an SBA Coronavirus PPP Loan and Have It Forgiven,"May 17, 2021",Mat Sorensen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-to-obtain-an-sba-coronavirus-ppp-loan-and-have-it/348552,"
The number-one pressure on small-business owners right now is payroll. Whether you're a sole proprietor one-person-show or a company with 500 employees, you've certainly felt the pressure. Maybe you've already stopped paying yourself, have laid off workers or cut hours. Well, you can thank your federal government for the best aid program recently offered for small business, the Paycheck Protection Program loan (aka Coronavirus Stimulus Loan, or PPP Loan).The PPP Loan was signed into law on March 27, 2020. On March 31, the SBA issued its guidance and sample application for the loan to be used by banks. Here's a summary of the details you need to know.Who Qualifies? A small business with fewer than 500 employees that was in business on or before February 15, 2020. This can be an S Corp, C corp, LLC, sole proprietorship or independent contractor. It also includes certain nonprofits, tribal groups and veteran groups. When obtaining the PPP loan, you need to certify that your business has been economically affected or that economic uncertainty make the loan necessary.



Related: New Stimulus Bill Unlocks IRA and 401(k) Dollars for Financially AffectedHow Much Can I Get? Up to $10 million dollars. But the amount each business gets is based on its payroll costs. The amount you qualify for is based on 2.5 times your average monthly payroll costs. Your monthly average payroll is calculated based on your prior 12 months of payroll costs. You take that average monthly payroll number and multiply it by 2.5. For example, if your monthly average payroll was $20,000, then you would qualify for a $50,000 PPP Loan.


What's Included in Monthly Payroll Costs? It includes salary, wages, commissions, payment of vacation, sick, parental/family/medical leave, payment of retirement contributions, group health coverage premiums and state and local taxes assessed on payroll. It doesn't include federal payroll taxes though. It also doesn't include payroll costs for those making more than $100,000. Their first $100,000 is considered, but anything in excess is not considered for determining average monthly payroll costs.  What Can I Use This Money For? First and foremost, payroll for you and your employees, but you can also use the money for rent, mortgage obligations, utilities and other debt obligations you may have.What Is the Interest Rate? Half a percent. that's right. It's nearly an interest-free loan. The bill allowed for a maximum rate of 4 percent, but the guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury is stating that the maximum rate would be 0.5 percent. Your government is stepping up as they're backstopping these loans for the banks. Now, this rate could certainly change, but under the law it cannot exceed 4 percent. When Do I Have to Pay It Back? The loan term specified by the treasury guidance is two years. Loan payments are deferred for the first six months. There is no pre-payment penalty though, so you can repay or have the loan forgiven earlier.


Do I Have to Put Up Collateral or Sign a Personal Guarantee? Nope. I told you this was a good deal, right?How Do I Get This Loan Forgiven? This is the critical question. The loan forgiveness provision is the best part. You are eligible for loan forgiveness for the amounts you spend over the next eight weeks after receiving the loan on certain qualifying expenses. The qualifying expenses of the business over the eight-week period includes payroll costs, rent, interest on mortgage debt and utilities.If the number of full-time employees is reduced over this time period or if your payroll costs are reduced 25 percernt or more, then the amount of the loan eligible for forgiveness will be reduced.The bank who granted the loan is who will determine the loan forgiveness amount based on the criteria above. The business will request forgiveness of the loan with evidence to the bank, and the bank will have 60 days to approve or deny the forgiveness.


Will the Business Get Forgiveness of Debt Income Via a 1099-C? Now, this is a question only your tax lawyer or account would ask. In other words, will I have to pay taxes on the amount of debt forgiven on the loan? Nope. The new law specifically stated that forgiven PPP Loans will not be considered forgiveness of debt income.Do I Still Qualify If I Already Have an SBA Loan?You can have more than one SBA loan. You just can't exceed the total SBA loan maximums when all loans are combined.What About the SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL)?  This is another good loan option. It is up to two million dollars and is the loan typically used for natural disasters that has been approved for businesses effected by the coronavirus pandemic. If you have a low payroll or need funds in excess of the amounts you qualify for under PPP, consider the EIDL loans, as they have low rates, longer repayment terms and can be used for more purposes than the PPP loans. However, they do not offer any form of loan forgiveness. But they do include a quick $10,000 grant to effected businesses that does no need to be repaid. So, let's run a quick scenario on the facts above for a PPP Loan. Let's say your total ""payroll costs"" over the prior 12-month period is $240,000. As a result, your monthly average payroll is $20,000. We then multiply $20,000 by 2.5 and get the maximum loan amount of $50,000.


Let's further assume that over the eight-week period after you receive the loan that you use $40,000 for payroll costs, $9,000 for rent and $4,000 on utilities. You would then have totally qualifying expenses for forgiveness of $53,000. Since you have qualifying expenses in excess of the loan amount, you would be eligible for forgiveness of the entire loan. Not bad, huh? Not bad at all. Finally, we have a stimulus bill that small businesses can be excited about.So, What Should You Do Now? Jonathan Morris, President and CEO of Titan Bank, an SBA Preferred Lending Partner based in Texas recommends that, ""It is important that you apply early on. There are 30 million small businesses in the U.S. and $350 billion allocated to the program. We expect funds may run out before everyone can receive a loan.. I'd suggest only applying to FDIC-insured bank for PPP loans. Many non-banks are taking applications, but in almost all cases they are simply trying to broker this information to banks in return for a fee."" Related: 7 Ways to Train Your Business to Make Better DecisionsWhat I'd suggest is that you gather your payroll records for the prior 12 months, check the sample loan app linked above and be ready to be amongst the first in line to get a PPP Loan. And by getting in line, we presume this will be with an application completed online, as most banks have limited in-branch capability right now. I'd recommend working with your current business bankers, if you have one, as they will have your business bank accounts and an established relationship. I have already seen notices from banks with increased questions and demand on these loans saying they are only working with existing customers first. If you don't have a good business-banking relationship, consider small community banks who tend to specialize in SBA loans and are more eager to get local businesses as customers. Open a business checking and savings account there to show them you want to be a customer for the long haul. And finally, consider banks who are SBA Preferred Lending Partners, as they'll be familiar with navigating the new SBA rules. Not all banks provide or have SBA loan expertise and the ones who do can usually move faster.  


Many business owners have learned the hard lessons of carrying too much debt. However, this isn't just any debt. This is debt eligible for forgiveness by the government. It's debt that will keep your employees on payroll, and it's an effort by our federal government to ensure that small businesses and their employees can survive the coronavirus financially. So, step up and take advantage of this program while it's there. We don't know how long the coronavirus will impact our economy, small business and entrepreneurship, but what we can do is work hard, work smart and take advantage of programs like this that can give us all a better chance at bouncing back and staying open for business.

68,I Went to Prison for SBA Loan Fraud: 7 Things to Know When Taking COVID-19 Relief Money,"May 14, 2021",Jeff Grant,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/i-went-to-prison-for-sba-loan-fraud-7-things-to-know-when/350337,"
In the months after 9/11, I was frantic.But my fears had less to do with the tragedy at the Word Trade Center and more to do with the fact that, after 10 years of rampant prescription opioid abuse, my business was failing. I was searching desperately for an out. Meanwhile, the television and radio were blaring with ads for 9/11 FEMA loans administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration.So, on an especially bad day, I lied.



I said I had an office near ground zero. I received the SBA loan I requested, and immediately paid down the personal credit cards I had run up while waiting for the SBA money. Even so, the loan did little to stop my spiral into drug addiction, mental health issues, marital problems and magical thinking.In 2002, I resigned my law license and started on the road to recovery. But it all caught up with me about 20 months later, when I was arrested for the misrepresentations on my loan application. I served almost 14 months at a Federal prison for wire fraud and money laundering.


My objective in writing this piece is to offer some insight on what business owners should consider before they take out disaster loans. Certainly, the majority of people requesting these loans are honest and upstanding entrepreneurs who have immense need for the aid, and will use the funds properly. I am very glad there is help for them. That said, history has shown us again and again that when people are in dire need, they're more prone to make impulsive, ill-advised decisions. My hope is that sharing my experience will help others avoid the consequences I faced. Here are seven takeaways.Related: How My Life as an Entrepreneur Shaped My Time in Prison1. Desperate people do desperate things.There were thousands of fraud prosecutions after 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, Superstorm Sandy, and so on. Why? Whether because of overwhelming business issues, poor personal judgment, or just plain bad luck, people were wounded, desperate and willing to do anything, anything, to stop the bleeding. But if the wound is too deep, a Band-aid is not sufficient. Practice point: In any situation, behaving desperately is unlikely to save your business.


2. Beware of the belief that rules are suspended in times of emergency.The government is advertising that huge amounts of money are available to save our businesses. I recently sat in on a webinar run by a very reputable business consulting group that recommended that attendees get their SBA disaster loan applications in immediately, regardless of the facts or the actual needs of their business — they said we could always modify our applications prior to taking the money. State unemployment websites are actually giving instructions, in writing, on how to mislead and circumvent the system in order to get approved. Don't take the bait! If you default two years from now, this ""good-meaning advice"" won't matter to prosecutors. Practice point: Be truthful at all times.3. Beware of magical thinking.This is a tough one because entrepreneurs are inherently optimistic. We believe that things will always be better tomorrow than they are today. It drives us, makes us successful, informs our risk-taking. But in times of trauma, that voice can be an entrepreneur's worst enemy. Does this sound familiar? We have learned the hard way that there is no shortcut, and yet we desperately want there to be one right now.  Practice point: Instead of immediately reaching for a bailout or other quick fix, develop a good solid business plan. Maybe a disaster loan will fit into this plan; maybe it won't.

This paradigm shift will affect all small to mid-size businesses.We are in the midst of a massive reordering that has already had a huge effect on small and mid-sized businesses. Business owners are being called to closely examine if our business models are still viable, or if we must pivot to new ways of doing things. Example: the Swiss watch industry completely missed the shift to digital watches. Have we waited too long to have a robust online presence? Are our products or services even needed anymore? Have we been holding on by a thread for years, unwilling or unable to look at the hard facts? Practice point: Get real, now. Don't borrow money to save a business that can't be saved.5. Be cautious when borrowing from the government.As is the case with any loan, the devil is in the details. The terms and covenants in the loan documents dictate what you can or can't do with the money once you get it. You can only use the funds for the purposes you stated in your application — that is, to pay operating expenses of the business to keep it afloat until it starts bringing in sufficient revenue again. You (and your spouse) will probably have sign for the loan personally, and will probably have to pledge all available collateral, including a second (or third) mortgage on your house. If you maxed out your personal credit cards while anticipating your disaster relief funding, you can't use the money to pay off your cards. 


Practice point: Read the terms and covenants of the loan closely. Whatever the loan terms say to do, do, and whatever they say don't do, don't do. No exceptions.6. We can't save our businesses and our lifestyles at the same time.Here's the big trap. We have mortgages, car payments, school tuitions, and other personal expenses that have to be paid, and soon. But simply put, SBA loans are meant to save your business, not your lifestyle. Discuss all your options with advisors and friends you trust  — ones that will tell you the truth! It's like going to the doctor. Your diagnosis will only be as accurate as the history you provide.  These are trying times, with a triage system designed to be more expeditious than thorough. Practice point: There is no such thing as a free lunch. Borrowing money comes with responsibility and accountability.7. Get acquainted with acceptance.I hope we are all great entrepreneurs who can figure out ways to make our businesses survive and flourish. But let's face it. Some of our businesses will not make it, even with the infusion of government funds. What should we do? We can pare down, embrace change and do things differently as we start a new chapter. Never forget that there will always be opportunity to start again, and to live a fuller, more abundant life.

69,Is the UK the World's Top Destination for Franchise Brands?,"Apr 29, 2021",Andy Cheetham,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/is-the-uk-the-worlds-top-destination-for-franchise-brands/367818,"
The United Kingdom has always had a good franchise economy, but this year everything changed: Now the UK franchise economy is turbo-charged! The global health crisis has left in its wake plenty of room for growth. But the UK in particular — with its lack of franchising regulations, high vaccination rates, Brexit and loans aplenty — is primed for expansion.An unregulated franchise economyIf you're looking to expand your franchise brand into the UK, then you'll find that, unlike with many other economies around the world, you don't have to worry about franchise-specific laws or regulations. There aren't any. What laws we do have aren't state or federal laws either. It's the same contract-based law for everyone with only very minor changes in Scotland that really don't make much difference. Franchise brands coming to the UK don't even have to create a Franchise Disclosure Document. There's just one franchise agreement, and the majority of brands have a version of the same precedent agreement. So legally, relatively speaking, it's quick and inexpensive. Compared with the complex and expensive legal obligations in many other developed economies, the UK is simple.The UK furlough schemeWhen the global health crisis struck, the UK government launched a furlough plan to pay the wages of the nation's employees. It was a way to protect jobs, but limited for three months. As the crisis continued, the government extended the plan. However, employers could only claim 80 percent of wages. This is now being scaled back and will eventually end later this year. Many businesses have laid off staff, despite the generous plan, and even more businesses are going to lay staff off as soon as it gets scaled back further. There are countless estimates from reliable sources predicting huge redundancies just around the corner. For new franchisors this is nothing but good news as laid-off employees are covering their own backs, using that time to research franchising, they are laying the groundwork for a redundancy they know is coming. Franchisors who get in the shop window before plan ends later this year will be reaping the benefits. To a degree they already are.



Related: Why Now Is the Perfect Time to Rethink Talent and LeadershipVaccination ratesThe UK has forged ahead with Covid-19 vaccinations, freeing up its workforce and opening up the economy. The vaccination rate in the UK alone was higher than the whole of the EU combined for a period, and well over half the population has been vaccinated. Crucially, the vaccine has now been received by the 40-plus age group, who are statistically a very big demographic group of franchise buyers. The UK is well ahead of the entire EU region on vaccinations. The health crisis has brought a huge economic downturn to the UK, but knowing what I know, that's good news for new franchise brands irrespective of which country they've come from originally. It is normal that recessions create more franchise buyers out there as displaced workers look to self-employment. This downturn has been the biggest of the lot. UK franchise specialists have seen inquiry rates for new franchises more than double through the pandemic.Potential new franchise brands are seeing an upturn in demand and so there are also more companies launching franchise systems as a result. Those new franchisors are in every sector, even sectors that are currently closed for business due to the pandemic, because a percentage of new franchise owners in the UK see this as an entrepreneurial opportunity for when things return to normal. (Whatever normal is.) Franchise consultants and other advisers similarly have never had it so good. 


Brexit In January, the UK left the EU, and the main consequence — from what I and my franchisey friends are witnessing — is a renewed vigor for entrepreneurship. Naturally, a proportion of entrepreneurs look to franchising, and Brexit has stirred up a renewed fighting attitude among the UK's business owners. The UK has always been a nation of small business owners, we like small businesses and we love franchises.Related: How the UK Has Set Its Sights on Becoming a Fintech Haven in the Wake of BrexitGovernment-backed loansThere's this thing in the UK called the government startup loan scheme. It's basically an unsecured personal loan for business purposes up to £25,000 ($34,000 USD) per applicant. It's increasingly being used by franchise buyers, and several specialist firms can facilitate access to the funds. The plan can also provide up to £100,000 ($136,000) if four people are in the company. UK government startup loans are available to any business that is under two years old, which means even if a business is already in existence, its owners can still apply.If you own a successful company outside the UK, and are wondering whether there will ever be a better time for a UK franchise — in my professional opinion the answer is a resounding ""No.""There isn't another country that has this perfect storm for a new franchise brand now. With a strong appetite for new franchises, no barriers to entry and a vaccination program that is the envy of many countries, the UK is open for business and a place where every successful franchise brand should be.

How to Get Out of $1,000 of Debt QuicklyDid your 2021 start off like mine? We had to put our golden retriever down (I know, the worst!) and replaced the alternator on my van. So, we had a pile of vet bills. My long-suffering husband took care of the van but we still had to buy the new alternator.Luckily, we were able to cover those expenses, but I often like to run through what-if scenarios, which drives my husband crazy:What would we do if we didn't have the $1,000 to cover those expenses? What if we had to put it on a credit card? And couldn't pay the credit card at the end of the month?



I tell you this story because it's so easy to find yourself in $1,000 of debt — or more. However, don't let it spiral out of your hands. Take these steps to relieve a small debt problem so it doesn't blow up into a bigger one. Step 1: Find out how much debt you really have.I know this article promises a quick fix to squashing $1,000, but do you really only have debt to the tune of $1,000? When you start peeling back the layers of credit card debt and other consumer debt, you may realize there's more than what meets the eye. Do you have payday loans (golly, I hope not — those can wreak havoc on your life) or student loans as well?


While you're looking at your $1,000, you might as well pull out the balances for the other debt you have and make a plan to pay it all off.Step 2: Commit to paying over the minimum balance.You always want to try to pay more than the minimum balance you owe per month. Credit card companies want you to pay the minimum amount — but you don't want to do that because you want to get out of debt faster using this method.Why? Let's go over a quick example. Let's say you have $1,000 of debt with a credit card interest rate at 13%. Let's say you make the minimum payment of $50 per month. It will take you 23 months to pay off your balance and you'll pay a total of $133 in interest.


Now, let's say you make more than the minimum payment — $70 instead. It will take you only 16 months to pay off your debt and you'll only pay a total of $96 in interest. Paying off your balance ahead of schedule expedites your payoff process and can save you a lot of money in interest over the long term. Step 2: Tackle the highest interest rate first.Now that we've got you fired up about paying more than the minimum balance on all of your debts, what interest rates do you see on your debts? You should clearly see the interest rates printed on your statements if you have student loan or credit card debt — or any other debt, for that matter.Important to note for any type of debt you owe: Paying down debts with the highest interest rates first will save you on interest. Doing so also directs a larger portion of your payments toward the principal — the full amount you owe. 


Step 3: Ask yourself how you can cut back.What can you do to budget your already existing money so you can put extra toward your debt? Budgeting isn't exactly the most exciting buzzword that ever existed, but you can make it more fun by using a budgeting app to see where you spend and how you can curtail it. For example, Mint jolted me back to reality one day — I realized I was spending $250 a week on groceries! Most of it was junk food! Grocery runs (not to mention Target runs) can suck a lot of cash per week. And are you really using that gym membership? Step 4: Ditch the plastic.Did your credit card debt get you into trouble in the first place? If so, you want to part ways. Give your credit card to a trustworthy friend, put it where you can't easily access it, or even cut it up if you can. Don't give into the temptation to spend!Step 5: Put together a spreadsheet. Or track your progress in your app.It's easy to have a lofty goal in your head. But when it comes down to it, you actually need to see your goal in action. It also helps you get more excited about your progress. 


Write down your overarching goal, then every month, figure out what it's going to take to get there. If you can contribute $50 extra toward your debt, how long will it take to pay off $1,000 — with interest? If you have trouble making these calculations, your budget app can do it for you.Step 6: Get your side hustle on. You know a side hustle can generate additional income each month, but it does more than that. It can wow your employer and even build your personal brand. What do you love to do? Whatever it is, turn it into your side job. Maybe you have a knack for designing company logos. Maybe you love tutoring kids in algebraic equations. Your options run the gamut.Funnel all of your extra income toward your debt — not those new shoes! You'll find that $1,000 can melt away effortlessly with a little willpower.


You Can Zap $1,000!Debt really is a four-letter word (especially when my husband is under the car, trying to put in a new alternator). However, you can't deny that you feel super satisfied when you accomplish your goal of paying off $1,000. Employ all these steps. Get them working well, and you should say sayonara to your debt. You can do it!Featured Article:  What are momentum indicators and what do they show?

71,4 Ways the Biden Administration Can Better Support Small Businesses,"Apr 15, 2021",Eyal Lifshitz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-ways-the-biden-administration-can-better-support-small/367850,"
We are now a year into the global health crisis and one thing hasn't changed: Small businesses are suffering. While small businesses are a vital economic driver and account for 47 percent of employment across the U.S., about one in six has closed since the start of the crisis and those that remain open are facing severe dips in revenue. Initiatives such as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) have provided short-term relief for many businesses, and President Biden's sweeping Covid-19 relief law will provide further aid. The law earmarks billions for small businesses, providing emergency funding, new grant programs and extra PPP reserves.Related: Why Aren't Struggling Small Businesses Taking More PPP?



But still, the road to recovery will extend long after the end of the health crisis. Even with the benefits of a predicted post-crisis boom, driven by the money consumers saved over the past year and the fact that the economy sustained less structural damage than feared, we must invest in long-term solutions to better support the smallest of businesses. The Biden administration has numerous opportunities to do so, starting with these four areas:1. Implement a progressive corporate tax rate, driving a more equitable economyAs part of his ""Build Back Better"" agenda, President Biden is exploring an increased corporate tax rate, reversing tax cuts from 2017. The country's corporate tax rate is currently 21 percent, and Biden suggested increasing it to 28 percent. The recent relief package included a number of tax updates, including revisions for multinational corporations and taking away deductions for certain public companies, but none as headline-grabbing as a corporate tax increase that could be funneled back into small business support. 


If the Biden administration wants to truly level the playing field for small businesses, a progressive corporate tax rate could be a start. Today's tax code levies the same rate on all businesses, ranging from locally owned bookstores and boutiques to national banks and software companies. A better approach would be to tax the largest corporations at a higher rate than the smaller ones, using a tiered system. Likewise, we need to prevent the largest corporations from using loopholes to pay nearly nothing in federal taxes. If Biden wants to give small businesses a fighting chance, rethinking the tax code is a promising, if difficult, way to do so. Related: America's Billionaires Got $1.3 Trillion Richer During the Pandemic, While Over 76 Million People Lost Jobs2. Increase funding for the SBA to invest in the long-term health of small businessesThe Small Business Administration (SBA) oversees PPP, which has undoubtedly played a crucial role in helping businesses through the crisis. The rollout wasn't perfect, as the SBA had to mobilize quickly without compromising the integrity of the program. Crucial updates, such as revisions for Schedule C filers, came too late for many. To help the SBA provide aid after PPP loans are exhausted, the Biden administration needs to increase SBA funding, perhaps through an updated corporate tax code. Disasters and recessions often dictate supplemental funding, but the agency's baseline funding typically rests at just over $1 billion. The health crisis led to the agency's highest annual budget of $762 billion in FY2020, but FY2019's budget was $1.2 billion. For perspective, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service receives $1.5 billion annually on average, and the largest federal agencies receive hundreds of billions each year. While PPP provided much-needed temporary relief, far too many small businesses shut down over the past year. These businesses generate almost half of the U.S.'s GDP, and they deserve a robust federal agency with the budget and resources to help them weather any storm rather than one that relies on temporary programs in times of crisis.


3. Allow fintech companies to participate in more federal aid and loan programsFull disclosure: This is my industry. But fintech startups are a prime example of how agility and speed can better serve small businesses. During the rollout of PPP, fintechs played an outsized role in genuinely helping the smallest and most vulnerable businesses. Almost 70 percent of PPP loans from fintechs average less than $150,000, signaling that they reached the smallest of small businesses. Likewise, fintechs played an outsized role in extending PPP loans to minority-owned businesses. PPP was one of the first of the SBA's programs that fintech could easily participate in. Greater funding would allow the agency to build infrastructure that easily integrates with other technologies, allowing fintechs to participate in even more programs, such as 7(a) or 504 loans. Businesses would benefit from a digital approach, which allows for faster loan approvals and more inclusive access to capital. 4. Refresh programs to ensure small businesses can easily and quickly apply for aidWhile fintechs' participation can greatly improve loan programs, the Biden administration should also consider whether the biggest loan programs actually accomplish their intended goals. Take for example 7(a) loans, the SBA's primary financial assistance program for small businesses. With a stack of paperwork involved, applying for these loans is incredibly challenging. And qualifying has proven even more difficult for many businesses. To truly serve the businesses that loans like these were created for, this administration should revise programs and go beyond a one-size-fits-all approach. As PPP proved, certain industries such as restaurants need individualized support, and more specialized programs can benefit the entire economy. They should update programs' respective rules, including a simplified application, clearer criteria for qualifying and an expedited approval process. These moves, combined with a push to digitize the infrastructure that supports them, will further democratize the loan process, helping small businesses access the capital they need to get started. 


Businesses can emerge from this global health crisis and its economic fallout stronger than before as long as the country puts the right support structures — like updated loan programs and more equitable tax codes — in place. The promise of a post-crisis recovery is starting to be realized, but we need to strengthen our small businesses if we want our economy to thrive.Related: 5 Ways to Be More Strategic and Successful in 2021

72,How Entrepreneurs Can Solve the Higher Education Problem,"Mar 18, 2021",Vivek Sharma,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-entrepreneurs-can-solve-the-higher-education-problem/365775,"
Higher education is in need of a transformation. The trifecta of tuition inflation, increasing student debt and diminishing confidence in the value of a traditional degree leaves the industry ripe for reimagination. Federally subsidized 2- or 4-year college degrees have been discussed as part of a new agenda to help increase access to education. Yet, companies also have the unique opportunity to play a role in increasing equitable access to higher education — and their businesses can benefit as a result.Corporate America already spends more than $180 billion annually on educating and training employees, but most business leaders don't experience a significant return on the investment. Instead, most training programs are poorly aligned with business and learner objectives, such as addressing specific skills gaps or improving employee recruiting and retention.When enterprise education programs are mutually aligned, employees are able to access life-changing opportunities without the traditional barriers to higher education, while companies can achieve their strategic business objectives. 



Most corporate-sponsored training and tuition assistance programs underperformAmong the billions of dollars that are spent annually on inside and outside training programs, $28 billion is allocated for traditional tuition programs — typically developed to address employee recruiting and retention — yet less than 2 percent of employees actually use them. These programs are simply outdated. According to an InStride/Bain & Co. survey, 80 percent of employees are interested in going to school while working, but only 40 percent knew their employer offered a tuition assistance program. Navigating enrollment and financial aid is difficult enough, on top of full-time professional responsibilities. In fact, survey respondents cited filling out applications, completing financial aid forms and locating transcripts as the most difficult barriers to overcome, and most corporate human resource departments don't have the infrastructure in place to manage every employee-learner's journey. Barriers for employees ultimately become the company's problem as programs are woefully underutilized or employees simply choose to leave and look for their desired employment benefits with other companies.


How does an organization truly capitalize on workforce education? Companies should consider these three points in creating training and education programs for its employees:1. Organizations should develop enterprise education programs intentionally.Enterprise education programs should be specific to an organization's goals. These opportunities should give learners multiple options for advancing their education, whether through degree programs, certificates or credential attainment. When done so, companies can double their return on investment in higher productivity, lower recruiting costs, longer retention and stronger brand perception for every $1 spent.Related: 9 Employee Education Resources Every Entrepreneur Should Know2. Program development needs to account for a realistic adult learner journey.After working with more than 34,000 employee-learners over the past two years, I've learned that the decision to go back to school is just as much an emotional decision as it is logical. Learners need assistance navigating the entire journey, from the initial decision to potential enrollment barriers and defining a clear return on investment alongside their employer. Commitment to this lifecycle of support starts at the top with touchpoints actualizing through management, mentorship and connections made to a strong company culture.


Related: How to Create a Learning Culture in the Workplace3. Companies should align enterprise education programs to the broader company culture.Companies that align education programs to their culture provide employees with the professional meaning and employer relationship they crave. As reiterated in the 2020 Brandpie CEO Purpose Report, this feeling of purpose can be a significant motivator for employees and leaders, which contributes to high productivity and longstanding relationships with an employer. Access to education can provide the meaningful connection an employee is looking to have with their employer, and ultimately affects workforce recruitment, retention and training needs.Employee education delivers more than improved company performance. The opportunities that stem from workplace education investments reverberate through employees' lives and into society at large. Research by the American Action Forum quantifies the impact of college degree attainment on broad scales, suggesting that had states increased their population's bachelor's degrees by 1 percent over the past decade, nationwide economic growth would have increased by about $130.5 billion.A strategic approach to enterprise education offers bold business leaders the chance to cultivate the workforce they need to be successful in a rapidly changing global economy, gives their employees academic experiences through high quality universities across the world, and, most importantly, alleviates the overbearing burden of debt through fully funded access to higher education.

73,"PPP Paid Over 4,000 Businesses Twice, Government Watchdog Says -- and They'll Have to Pay It Back","Mar 15, 2021",Ayelet Sheffey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/ppp-paid-over-4000-businesses-twice-government-watchdog/367169,"
The Paycheck Protection Program was established under the CARES Act to provide aid to small businesses suffering during the pandemic. But it provided too much aid, it turns out. But the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) found that the Small Business Administration's program has a major flaw: duplicate loans.A report released on Monday by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), a government watchdog, found that of the PPP loans approved between April 3 and August 19, 2020, lenders made more than one loan disbursement to 4,260 borrowers, including 2,689 borrowers with the same tax identification number and 1,571 borrowers with the same name and business address. Those potential duplicate disbursements totaled about $692 million and involved 8,731 PPP loans.



Related: Why Aren't Struggling Small Businesses Taking More PPP?The SBA responded to the findings in the report by saying it will resolve duplications by recovering improper payments and and preventing loan forgiveness on the duplicate loans. That means small businesses will have to give back the duplicate loans, if they can.


According to the report, the SBA identified issues in 2020 that had caused duplicate loan applications to be processed. The SBA had turned off controls for its electronic loan application system, leading to duplication, even though the office had said it would rely on loan reviews to eliminate the issue. The report looked at the PPP's first round in August 2020.""Establishing strong controls to prevent improper or duplicate disbursements from occurring during initial loan processing is more effective than attempting to identify and resolve improper disbursements in the loan review phase,"" the report said. ""SBA's efforts should focus on safeguarding funds up front, as it is more prudent and effective to prevent a loan from occurring than attempting to recover funds after the loan has been disbursed.""The OIG recommended that the SBA:Review potential duplicate loans and take action to recover any improper payments;Review controls related to all PPP loans to ensure duplicate loans are not forgiven;Strengthen the SBA's loan servicing portal controls for future PPP-type programs;And strengthen controls and guidance for lenders to ensure lenders meet program requirements.The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis had requested that the OIG conduct the report to review the vulnerabilities in the SBA's loan processing system. Along with the duplicate loans, the PPP faced issues shortly after it was implemented in March, famously including fast-food chain Shake Shack receiving a $10 million loan it ultimately gave back, despite the loans being intended for businesses with 500 employees or fewer. 


However, lawmakers have advocated for the PPP and its importance in helping small businesses recover financially from the pandemic. In the $1.9 stimulus plan President Joe Biden signed on Thursday, $50 billion was set aside for small businesses, with $7.25 billion to be used specifically for the PPP. And the House Small Business Committee on Thursday introduced legislation to extend the PPP through May 31, ahead of its current expiration date on March 31. ""The demand for PPP loans right now is a testament to the program's effectiveness and the lingering impacts of this pandemic,"" Small Business Committee Chair Nydia Velázquez said in a statement. ""That's why we cannot cut off aid now and this short-term extension is so important.""
"
74,New Stimulus Bill Includes Second Round of PPP Loans for Small Business and Forgiveness Rule Changes Favorable to Borrowers,"Dec 22, 2020",Mat Sorensen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/new-stimulus-bill-includes-second-round-of-ppp-loans-for/362143,"
Congress at last passed a second stimulus bill this week — as of this writing, it is still awaiting President Trump's signature — and it includes a second round of PPP loans for affected small businesses as well as loan-forgiveness rule changes that are favorable to PPP borrowers. The second round of PPP loans for affected small businesses are referred to as ""second draw loans."" While the rules for these second draw loans are familiar, they have changed drastically from the original program, so small businesses and lenders need to get up to speed quickly on who qualifies. In addition to providing a second draw of PPP loan funding for qualifying business, the legislation includes favorable changes to loan-forgiveness taxation and adds a simplified one-page forgiveness application for loans of $150,000 or less.Second Draw PPP LoansThe most significant development in the legislation for small businesses is a second round of PPP loans. The new legislation allocates around $284 billion and refers to the new loans as second draw loans. The loan limit is $2 million, and the amount a small business will qualify for is determined by taking their average monthly payroll in 2019 and multiplying it by 2.5. In other words, the second round of PPP loans is meant to fund 2.5 months of payroll expenses. The bill has a special calculation for restaurants and food businesses and provides those businesses a larger loan amount of 3.5 months of average monthly payroll. So, for example, if you had an average monthly payroll in 2019 of $100,000, then your small business would qualify for $250,000. If you were a restaurant or other qualifying food business, then you would qualify for $350,000.Related: Joel Osteen's Church Received More Than $4 Million In PPP Loans



To qualify for a second draw PPP loan, a small business must have 300 employees or less, down from the original 500 employee maximum in the first round. And a small business must have already used or plan to use their original PPP funding. Similar to the original PPP loan program, the small business can use the loan proceeds over a period of 24 weeks and can use the funds for payroll, rent and mortgage expenses. The bill also adds some new expenses to the list of ""qualifying expenses."" These new qualifying expenses include operating expenses, workplace protection costs to protect employees from Covid and covered property damage.25% Loss of Revenue Required to Qualify To qualify for a second draw loan, a small business must certify that they have had a loss of revenue of 25% or greater. This criterion is drastically different from the original qualification rules for PPP, which simply required the small business to state that economic uncertainty made the PPP loan necessary. Under the 25% loss-of-revenue test, the small business will compare their 2020 quarterly revenue (aka, gross receipts) against their 1st, 2nd and 3rd quarters of revenue in 2019. In order to qualify for a second draw PPP loan, a borrower must be able to show a loss in revenue of 25% or more from at least one quarter of 2020 as compared to that same quarter in 2019.


Second Draw Loans Eligible for Forgiveness Under 60% Payroll RuleThe second draw loans are forgivable but must be spent 60% on payroll costs. Since the loan amount is based on 2.5 months of average payroll, which is 10-11 weeks, and since the small business can use the funds over a 24-week period, it seems very likely that most small businesses will be able to use 60% of the PPP funds on payroll costs.Original and Second Draw PPP Loans Will Not be Taxable When ForgivenThe new legislation provides that forgiven PPP loans will not be taxable to the small-business borrower. This applies to all existing PPP loans under the original CARES Act as well as the new second draw PPP loans. Prior to the legislation, the IRS had issued guidance to small businesses saying that PPP borrowers could not expense their wages and other qualifying costs that they used their PPP funds on if they ended up getting their PPP loan forgiven. By denying the deduction, the IRS was effectively taxing the small business for its PPP loan. This position seemed contrary to what Congress intended with the CARES Act and the original PPP legislation back in March, but it literally took an act of Congress here to correct the interpretation from the IRS. The good news for small businesses is that borrowers can have their PPP loan forgiven and they will still be able to deduct their payroll and other qualifying expenses that they used their PPP funds on.The legislation also states that emergency EIDL Grants and Advances, which are considered forgiven and, in most instances, do not need to be re-paid, are also not taxable to the small business borrower.  Loans of Less than $150,000 Will Get Simplified Forgiveness ApplicationThe legislation mandates the SBA to create a simplified PPP forgiveness application for small businesses whose PPP loans were less than $150,000. The simplified application must fit on one page and will include loan information as well as a certification from the business owner that the funds were used properly and are eligible for forgiveness, but will not include calculations or other additional information. The SBA already has a simplified one-page PPP forgiveness application for borrowers of $50,000 or less. It is likely that the SBA will utilize a similar application for borrowers with loans of less than $150,000. See my prior article on the simplified forgiveness application here.

75,5 Strategies for Reducing Overall Business Debt,"Dec 18, 2020","Kedma Ough, MBA",https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/5-strategies-for-reducing-overall-business-debt/361071,"
A healthier bottom line is what every company strives for, and maintaining an active focus and strategy on managing financial debt is a critical factor in reaching that goal. As I counsel my clients, ""debt"" need not be a dirty word — it's a healthy part of any sustaining enterprise when leveraged appropriately. Reducing debt and, by extension, its potential for an adverse impact on company stability should always be top of mind for business leaders. These are the considerations I always recommend for my clients to pursue towards that end.1. Renegotiate and restructure loans with existing lendersThis is an option that is not commonly known and rarely communicated by debt servicing agencies, but plausible for businesses of all sizes to pursue. In all cases, lenders are making the same considerations as other business owners. Retaining clients through difficult periods via margin reduction on servicing costs is generally preferrable to having a loan in default or passed to a collection agency with an indeterminate outcome. In certain cases, additional context may be needed to explain to the lender the negative impact that current fees or loan terms have on the solvency of the borrowing company (sometimes called a ""Hardship Letter'). Outcomes may include reversing or reducing administrative fees, lowering interest rates or changing payment schedules — all of which can be beneficial.Related: 7 Steps to Reduce Business Debt in 90 Days



2. Consolidate and reduce servicing costs to a more favorable loanAssessing ways to alleviate a company's debt is a very viable option, depending on if the terms are favorable and any additional administrative or termination/setup fees do not introduce new, short-term burdens. One recommended option for small businesses is the 7(a) loan program from the Small Business Administration (SBA), which has very straightforward qualification criteria (that may be more stringent than other lenders) and an application process that can be more intricate, but with compelling rates and the benefit of being able to be serviced via local lenders with the SBA providing the guarantee. A business line of credit (something also offered via the SBA) can be another attractive option with favorable rates and longer payment terms than traditional lines of credit.Related: SBA Loans: A Primer


3. Pursue grants as an option to transfer debtGrants or similar forgivable loans should not be overlooked as options to offset debt. In addition to highly publicized grants launched in reaction to exigent circumstances (like the current pandemic), there are numerous ongoing grants available that are applicable to nearly every business segment. These grants may come from both national and regional economic development groups, as well as nonprofit or other non-governmental industry agencies. As these grants can sometimes be narrowly focused on support for a specific region and/or industry segment, reading the fine print on applicability is a must.4. Manage accounts receivableA dedicated focus on collecting outstanding payments owed to your company is critical to assuring a healthy financial baseline for continued operations. Enforcing shorter payment terms (for example, net 30 days as opposed to net 90 days) can provide additional certainty into the state of company finances. While renegotiating payments for established clients can be infeasible, there may be opportunities to consider prompt pay discounts or leverage a certified receivable company willing to provide 85% or greater of the amount owed upfront and take on the burden (and risk) of delayed payments.Be mindful of the balance of long-term client retention and your company's opportunities to ""pay it forward"" and garner loyalty by allowing for reasonable flexibility with payment terms for clients also facing challenges in the current business environment.5. Find creative options with your vendors and suppliersWhere your company debt is being directed to support expansion, inventory or services from suppliers, consider finding deferred payment arrangements with these entities. These models can include risk-sharing arrangements with payments based on downstream conclusion of the service or product sales. This is something that is rarely considered when suggested to my clients, but rethinking and evolving business relationships from one of simply supplier to that of partner or investor can be transformative, often in times of threat. Entering into such arrangements should be done with a clear understanding of risk and reward, and as much objective legal and financial expertise as is required to assure mutually beneficial outcomes to both parties.


Again, it is important to understand that debt is a healthy (and necessary) part of the sustained operations and growth of any viable enterprise when managed appropriately. Where debt reduction can provide additional vigor to your company's longer-term viability, one or more of the strategies outlined above should be applied to foster that outcome.

76,The CEO of a Company That Owns More Than 100 Wendy's Allegedly Used $1 Million in PPP Loans on a New House in Montana,"Jul 9, 2020",Kate Taylor,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/the-ceo-of-a-company-that-owns-more-than-100-wendys/353041,"
The CEO of a major Wendy's franchisee used funds meant to keep workers employed to fund a newly purchased home, according to a lawsuit from a former vice president at the company. On June 30, The Starboard Group's former vice president of legal affairs and human resources, Sandi Adler, filed a lawsuit against Starboard, as well as CEO Andrew Levy and officer Kevin Holbrook. Starboard is a major Wendy's franchisee based in Florida that runs 101 locations of the fast-food chain in seven states, according to the company's website. According to Adler's complaint, Starboard received roughly $9 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. Government records show that numerous Starboard entities based in Branson, Montana and Coral Springs, Florida, received loans in the range of $150,000 to $2 million. 



CEO Levy diverted roughly $1 million in funds to finance a recently purchased house in Montana, according to the complaint. (Business Insider found that a company created by Levy and Heather Levy owns several parcels of land in Livingston, Montana.) Related: SBA and Treasury Release Names of PPP Loan Recipients


""Levy directed Adler to place certain personal employees in Montana as corporate employees,"" the complaint says. ""The effect of this, in view of the PPP funding, was to defraud the United States and the Small Business Association.""Adler says in the complaint that Levy told her to tell creditors, landlords, vendors and suppliers that the company had not received PPP funding and therefore could not meet its financial obligations. When Adler complained about Levy's orders to Holbrook, her superior at the company, she says he fired her. The complaint also alleges that Holbrook sexually harassed Adler, including describing oral sex, saying he liked big breasts and pressing Alder to go on vacation with him to Europe. According to the complaint, Adler told Levy in late fall she objected to Holbrook's advances. Adler says Levy responded: ""Why don't you guys just f--- already and get it over with?"" Wendy's did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Starboard said in a statement that Adler's allegations were ""false and hurtful,"" and that the decision to terminate Adler ""was not made in haste or without reason.""


""With regard to our handling of PPP dollars, our financial records are clear and complete and will refute any claim of misuse,"" Starboard said in the statement.""More troubling, however, is the accusation of sexual harassment. Despite an initial desire to simply view this as being the words of a disgruntled former employee, we must take all accusations of this nature seriously and, as such and in accordance with our corporate policy, have launched an independent, internal investigation,"" the statement continues. ""In order to protect the privacy of those involved and to preserve all legal recourse at our disposal moving forward, we will have no further public comment on this issue at this time.""Related: How to Navigate the Volatile Business-Funding EnvironmentThis week, the SBA released information about companies that received $150,000 or more in PPP loans. A number of franchisees applied for loans, as did a few major chains such as P.F. Chang's and TGI Friday's.


In April, chains such as Shake Shack and Sweetgreen returned PPP loans after facing backlash when the first round of funds ran out. However, with $134 billion left in unused loans, neither P.F. Chang's nor TGI Friday's has hinted at prematurely returning the funds.

77,Supreme Court Overrules Law Allowing Debt-Collection Robocalls,"Jul 7, 2020",Stephanie Mlot,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/supreme-court-overrules-law-allowing-debt-collection/352929,"
If there's one thing that can unite Americans, it's a disdain for robocalls. You can expect fewer autodials, though, since the Supreme Court this week struck down a 2015 law allowing automated messages by debt collectors.Nearly 30 years ago, Congress passed the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA), which generally prohibits robocalls to home and mobile phones. A recent amendment, however, allows pre-recorded messages to be made if collecting debts to the government—including student loan and mortgage balances.The robocall restriction survived strict scrutiny because of the government's ""compelling interest in collecting debt,"" according to this week's Supreme Court decision. ""Severing this relatively narrow exception to the broad robocall restriction fully cures the First Amendment unequal treatment problem and does not raise any other constitutional problems,"" the ruling, written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, said.



This case began when the American Association of Political Consultants and three other organizations—which ""make calls to citizens to discuss candidates and issues, solicit donations, conduct polls, and get out the vote""—filed a declaratory judgement against the U.S. Attorney General and FCC, claiming the 2015 law violates their First Amendment rights. Plaintiffs believe their outreach would be more effective and efficient, the court document said, if they could make robocalls. But, as they are not collecting government debt, the law prohibits it.""As the government concedes, the robocall restriction with the government-debt exception cannot satisfy strict scrutiny,"" the July 6 ruling said. ""The government has not sufficiently justified the differentiation between government-debt collection speech and other important categories of robocall speech, such as political speech, issue advocacy, and the like.""


A majority of conservative justices—Kavanaugh, John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, and Neil Gorsuch, as well as liberal-leaning Sonia Sotomayor—agreed that the 2015 government-debt exception violates the First Amendment. Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Elena Kagan, meanwhile, would have upheld the government-debt exception, ""but given the contrary majority view, agreed that the provision is severable from the rest of the statute,"" according to the decision.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, who previously opposed the Obama Administration's 2015 ""carve-out"" for federal debt collectors, praised Monday's ruling: ""I am glad to hear that Americans, who are sick and tired of unwanted robocalls, will now get the relief from federal-debt-collector robocalls they have long deserved,"" he said in a statement.Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel—often in opposition to Pai—also agreed with this week's decision, tweeting that ""robocalls are OUT OF CONTROL."" ""Now let's do something radical,"" she added. ""Let's use it to finally stop these calls and the scams behind them.""The FCC has been working to combat illegal robocalls and malicious caller ID spoofing through policy initiatives, enforcement actions, public and private partnerships, and consumer education.

After months of withholding information on exactly which businesses received precisely how much from Congress's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) — and considerable consternation after multiple publicly held companies were outed for accepting sizable sums before ultimately returning them — the Small Business Administration (SBA) and U.S. Department of the Treasury today released detailed information on nearly five million PPP grantees. The sum total of loans amounts to in excess of $521 billion, and in a statement, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin remarked, ""The PPP is providing much-needed relief to millions of American small businesses, supporting more than 51 million jobs and over 80 percent of all small business employees, who are the drivers of economic growth in our country.""He then added, ""We are particularly pleased that 27 percent of the program's reach in low- and moderate-income communities, which is in proportion to percentage of population in these areas. The average loan size is approximately $100,000, demonstrating that the program is serving the smallest of businesses.""



Related: SBA Releases New EZ PPP Loan-Forgiveness ApplicationDespite the sudden rush to transparency, there is bound to be intense scrutiny. Some mom-and-pop restaurant owners, for example, might wonder why between $2-5 million — the information was released both by state and assorted loan-amount thresholds, ultimately ranging from less than $150,000 to as high as $10 million — was allocated to the Diocese of Alabama in Birmingham. 


And a cursory scan through the available documents (as user-unfriendly as the process of downloading and parsing through them might be) indicates a very small minority of owners willingly answered questions about their race, ethnicity or gender, and that a minority of overall respondents identified their businesses as black-owned or female-owned. The SBA's language concerning the disclosures is also a bit convoluted, at one point assuring, ""This disclosure covers each of the 4.9 million PPP loans that have been made,"" but later adding that its various loan amounts ""account for nearly 75 percent of the loan dollars approved."" Furthermore, the single document purporting to contain information across all 50 states in alpahabetical order currently concludes after California.

79,3 Federal Loan Programs You Can Take Advantage of Right Now,"Jun 25, 2020",Tom Wheelwright,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/3-federal-loan-programs-you-can-take-advantage-of-right-now/352220,"
The coronavirus pandemic has affected nearly every industry, and while business may be beginning to pick up, we have a long road to being fully recovered. Within this recovery period there will likely be ups and downs until the virus is under control, so now is the time to prepare for the uncertain. Do you have enough cash on hand to survive until the end of the year? If the answer is no, here are three loan programs you should be maximizing to make it through the pandemic.Paycheck Protection ProgramAt this point, most of us are familiar with the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a loan program for small businesses created by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). While the initial funds went quickly, there are still billions of dollars up for grabs for businesses affected by the pandemic and it's 100% forgivable as long at least 60% is spent on payroll and no more than 40% is spent on mortgage interest, rent and utilities. In addition, the new law on PPP guidance extended the eight-week period to spend the loan to 24-weeks. This change provides welcome relief for business owners who were being threatened with jail time or fines if they didn't use the funds appropriately and had a requirement to use them within 8 weeks even if they couldn't open due to government restrictions.Related: SBA Releases New EZ PPP Loan-Forgiveness Application



Economic Injury Disaster LoansAnother program to utilize is the recently reopened Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL). This low-interest federal disaster loan can be used by small businesses and non-profits to pay debts, payroll, accounts payable and other bills that can't be paid and aren't covered by a PPP loan. The first payment of the loan is deferred for one year and can be paid over 30 years with an interest rate of 3.75% for small businesses and 2.75% for non-profits. Within the loan application, you can also request an advance on the loan of $10,000 that doesn't have to be repaid. In fact, if your small business isn't approved for the EIDL, you may still receive the $10,000 advance.Related: Which Public Companies Have Returned Their SBA PPP Loans and Which Kept Them


Main Street Lending ProgramThe newest opportunity that targets businesses of all sizes is the Main Street Lending Program. Created by the Federal Reserve, the program offers 5-year loans from $250,000 to $300 million to businesses with fewer than 15,000 employees or 2019 revenues of $5 billion or less. While the interest and principal can be deferred for one and two years respectively, the loan can't be forgiven like the PPP loans.Crisis-proof your businessI strongly recommend that all businesses consider the current coronavirus relief, even you think you don't need the funds. We have all seen how fast the economy can change, so we must do everything in our power to prepare accordingly. By having access to funds in a time of crisis, you're setting up your business to survive in unpredictable times.

80,Still Need PPP? This SBA Tool Will Match You With Lenders In 2 Days,"Jun 24, 2020",Frances Dodds,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/still-need-ppp-this-sba-tool-will-match-you-with-lenders/352364,"
On May 14, the Census Bureau released survey results showing that although 75 percent of American businesses had applied for assistance through the SBA's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), only 40 percent of businesses had received it.Many small businesses have had trouble accessing PPP through the big banks — which largely prioritized pre-existing clients and bigger ""small"" businesses. But entrepreneurs in underserved communities had an especially hard time getting relief. In the early months of the pandemic closures, when they needed it most, huge numbers of minority-owned, women-owned and rural small businesses were widely ignored by big banks. Meanwhile, the SBA failed to give adequate funds to smaller asset lenders and nonprofits like Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) that serve businesses in disadvantaged communities. As the dust has settled, and the sweeping inequities become more apparent, the SBA has been trying to make up for lost time with funding and programs directed at vulnerable businesses before the PPP application deadline on June 30. The SBA gave a total of $10 billion to CDFIs to loan out under the PPP. And most recently, the administration created a tool meant to connect business owners with small asset lenders (less than $10 billion in assets) such as CDFIs, Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), Certified Development Companies (CDCs), Farm Credit System lenders, and Microlenders. The SBA tool, called Lender Match, will reportedly match borrowers with lenders within two days, and it will help borrowers apply for PPP as well as other SBA loan programs like 7(a), 504, Microloans and Community Advantage loans — which currently fall under the SBA's debt relief program. ""The SBA is focused on assisting eligible borrowers in underserved and disadvantaged communities and connecting them with forgivable PPP loans, especially before the June 30, 2020, application deadline,"" said SBA administrator Jovita Carranza in a press release. ""As communities begin to carefully reopen across the country, there are still many more opportunities to provide this assistance to businesses who have yet to access these forgivable loans.""

Debt is extremely cheap nowadays. The federal government and Federal Reserve are injecting trillions of dollars into the U.S. economy, which means entrepreneurs can access loans at historically low rates. (In March, the Fed cut interest rates to zero.) And I don't know what you've heard, but angels and VCs are still active. Moreover, the $2.2 trillion stimulus package signed into law on March 27 is extraordinary legislation that attempts to avert another Great Depression. (The 1930s crisis saw 25 percent unemployment.) Last month, nearly 10 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits, and that's after millions more were turned away by clogged application systems.Because of the huge expansion of the money supply, companies have financing options at a time when some economists say the jobless rate could soon approach 20 percent. Former Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen recently said unemployment is now at least 13 percent and that gross domestic product (GDP) will decrease by 30 percent.

Businesses can get a tax credit up to $5,000 per idle worker for keeping him/her on the payroll during the pandemic. 


There's extra funding if your business belongs to a hard-hit industry. For example, healthcare firms will be awarded $100 billion in grants, while airlines will get $58 billion in loans and grants. Finally, employers and self-employed individuals can defer the 6.2 percent tax on wages that fund Social Security. More help could arrive as Trump is pushing Congress to cut the payroll tax for companies and employees. Even though I'm of the mindset that you should sell and build to increase revenue, I still know there's value in getting the support that you need. Here are tips for business owners who are seeking funding during the lockdown.Use idle time to research government loansMore liquidity means record-low interest rates. Small businesses can use cheap debt to pay bills, employ Americans and keep doors open. You may have a great product or service, but still go bankrupt for lack of cash. When taking out government loans, like Economic Injury Disaster Loans, it helps to be organized.Felix Polanski, a partner at the banking platform CreditPilot, recently explained in an email interview that entrepreneurs should research loans aimed specifically for small- and medium-sized enterprises, elaborating that, ""Most small businesses don't have enough liquid reserves on hand to handle even two weeks of expenses. It's imperative to leverage loans like the SBA's Paycheck Protection Program so that owners can get cash as soon as possible."" (The SBA program gives incentives to businesses to keep workers on their payroll.)


To see all options and expedite the borrowing process, you may want to call the bank where there's an existing line of credit. ""Do your homework because there are numerous options,"" says Polanski, whose Cyprus-based venture works with mobile network operators (MNOs) who then provide mobile banking services to subscribers. ""If you go with the option of turning a loan into a grant, make sure you can meet the requirements. And if you use payroll services like Gusto, info can be collected very fast."" He also adds to submit all paperwork as soon as possible.""Entrepreneurs should be wary of big banks that offer credit products,"" says Zon Chu, CEO of Constant, a peer-to-peer lending platform. ""Traditional financial institutions have grown inefficient and greedy. They lend depositors' money for interest, but keep most of the profits. And they charge high fees when selling complex products that confuse rather than inform borrowers.""Related: 10 OG Prison Tips to Get Your Mind, Body and Soul Right During QuarantineThere are other ways to increase working capital without a bank loan. According to attorney Mat Sorenson, the stimulus ""increases the dollar amount you can loan yourself from your own 401(k) … and also creates a penalty-free early distribution rule whereby IRA or 401(k) account owners ... can take a penalty-free retirement account distribution.""


The $2.2 trillion in stimulus money and the Fed's quantitative easing are designed to increase employment. Business owners have access to cheap cash in today's challenging environment. The bottom line is the bottom line –– get money.

82,SBA Releases New EZ PPP Loan-Forgiveness Application,"Jun 19, 2020",Mark J. Kohler,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/sba-releases-new-ez-ppp-loan-forgiveness-application/352104,"
Needless to say, it's been a roller coaster ride for business owners over the past couple of months understanding how to navigate the CARES Act, but there are now signs the ride may be coming to an end.On Wednesday of this week, the Small Business Administration (SBA) released a revised, and hopefully a final, forgiveness application for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), including a new EZ application that appears many business owners may qualify for.Also, just the day before, the SBA issued a new Final Interim Rule with guidance for determining payroll costs and owner compensation forgiveness under the new 24-week covered period.



These new rules and procedures were in response to the Paycheck Protection Flexibility Act of 2020 that became law on June 5. The biggest changes in that law being the extension of the eight weeks to a new 24-week covered period, and a reduction of payroll costs from 75 percent to 60 percent. For a more in-depth analysis see ""New PPP Law Extends 8-Week Period and Reduces Percent Payroll Cost Rule.""If you feel daring enough to dive straight into the Applications and Instructions before a little summary of the notable items, they are available at the following links: Revised PPP Loan Forgiveness Application and Instructions EZ PPP Loan Forgiveness Application and InstructionsRelated: New PPP Law Extends 8-Week Period and Reduces Percent Payroll Cost RuleWhat we knew before the New EZ Application and Interim RuleNow before I add a new layer of complexity, or simplicity as the SBA hopes to do, let's summarize what we understood the rules to be before this week started:


If you haven't yet applied for the PPP loan, the application deadline (not for forgiveness, but to receive money) is still June 30.You have 24 weeks, or until December 31, to spend the loan proceeds on certain authorized items (mostly payroll).In order to get your entire loan forgiven, 60 percent of the proceeds must be used on payroll costs.It's OK to spend less than 60 percent on payroll costs, but whatever amount of the Loan you do apply to be forgiven, 60 percent of the amount must be payroll costs.Payroll costs are defined differently depending on your type of business entity, and it's critical you understand the equation and what is, and is not, included.The other 40 percent of the loan proceeds could be spent on rent, lease payments, utilities and interest on longterm business debt.You're penalized on the amount forgiveness amount if you reduce the number of hours worked by your employees compared to the average before the crisis. This has generally been referred to as the fulltime equivalent employee (FTE) rule.You're also penalized on the amount that can be forgiven if reduce the salaries or wages of your employees by more than 25 percent.If you received the EIDL Grant of up to $10,000, it reduces your final PPP loan forgiveness amount.Of course, this list above simply summarizes the general rules or notable items in the PPP law. It's critical that business owners get professional guidance during the process or make sure they understand the details of the various laws passed by Congress and all of the interim rules and guidance issued by the SBA and Treasury before proceeding with the application for forgiveness.The New PPP EZ Application I think it's important to first determine if you qualify for the EZ PPP Loan Application before getting bogged down in some of the other provisions and rules. The whole goal of the EZ App is to require less documentation, fewer calculations and simplifies the process dramatically for a large number of business owners.In fact, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tried to sell the beauty of the EZ App this week, stating to Wisconsin reporter Charles Benson, that, ""I think we put on there it should take 20 minutes to fill out,"" adding, ""And by the way, I think it's 10 minutes to collect your documents and 10 minutes to fill out the form. I think that's down from like two hours.""Here are the major takeaways and general instructions:To qualify for the EZ App, the business owner must meet one of three tests. Essentially, you need to be able to check the box under any of the following three options:You are self-employed and have no employees; orYou had employees, but did not reduce their salaries or wages during the covered period by more than 25 percent AND did not reduce the number of hours worked by employees (essentially meeting what's come to be known as the FTE employee rule); orYou had employees, but did not reduce their salaries or wages during the covered period by more than 25 percent, AND due to complying with essentially shelter-in-place laws during the covered period, you were unable to operate during the covered period at the same level of business that existed before February 15, 2020.If you are able to check any of the three boxes above, you are allowed to use the SBA Form 3508EZ.For those of you that are an S-Corporation and wonder where you fit, if you are the only employee, than by definition you still would have employees and thus qualify under #2 or #3 above, and need to fill out the sections of the EZ App listing yourself as the only employee.Next, you need to decide if you are going to apply under the eight-week covered period or the 24-week period (not to exceed December 31, 2020). Only borrowers that received loans before June 5 can choose between the eight- or 24-week period.Then your personal compensation is limited before you can add to it other employee payroll costs, rent, lease payments, utilities and mortgage interest.  Your personal compensation is the maximum of the following:$15,385 if you choose the eight-week period.$20,833 if you choose the 24-week period.Also, payroll costs for S-Corp owners does not include health insurance premiums for themselves, but only the premiums for their employees can be included in the definition of payroll costs. This may be confusing because when you applied for the PPP loan, S-Corp owner/employees were allowed to include this in their calculations for loan, but not on the forgiveness app.Finally, remember you apply for forgiveness with the same lender you applied with and received the PPP Loan. Some banks are already working to create online/digital applications to simplify the process on their end as well.Example 1.1: Mary is a sole proprietor running a flower shop with no other employees. Her net profit on her 2019 Schedule C was $50,000. She applied for the PPP and properly received $10,417 ($50,000/12 x 2.5= $10,417). She received her loan amount on April 14 and is able to use the eight-week reporting period (if she so chooses OR the 24-week period, whichever is more advantageous). She qualifies for the EZ PPP App, and her maximum owner compensation replacement is limited to what the eight-week reporting period would allow (even if she chooses the 24-week period) $7,692 ($50,000/52 x 8). Thus, on the SBA Form 3508EZ, she would put $7,692 on Line 1. Then, she would hope to report an additional $2,725 on Lines 2, 3 & 4 with Mortgage Interest, Rent/Lease Payments or Utilities.(This is why Mary may choose to use the 24-week period, so that she can accumulate this additional allowable expenses.. Thus, if things go well, she will then put $10,417 on Line 5, 6 & 8.  The result of the calculation on Line 7, would be 74 percent, and Mary's entire PPP Loan would be forgiven.Example 1.2: Same facts for Mary as above, except she also received a $1,000 EIDL grant. Because Mary received both the PPP and the EIDL grant, she will enter the amount of $1,000 in the top section of Form 3508EZ, and her PPP loan-forgiveness amount will be reduced by $1,000 to $9,417. Thus, she will have a loan owing her bank $1,000, at 1 percent per annum, with a minimum two-year maturity date, unless her and the lender agree to extend it to a maximum of five years.Example 1.3: John is an S-Corp owner/employee and operates a web design business with three other employees. His payroll costs in 2019, including himself was $242,000 as follows:$120,000 personal gross payroll;No 401(k) matching by the company.$2,000 in State Unemployment Insurance (SUTA); and$18,000 health insurance premiums for his employees;$12,000 health insurance premiums for himself;$90,000 payroll for employees;$242,000 TOTALJohn's proper PPP loan amount was $50,417 ($242,000/12 x 2.5= $50,417). He also received an EIDL grant of $4,000 (himself plus three employees). John received his money on May 5. He also qualifies for the EZ PPP application because he maintained the same level of employees and didn't reduce anyone's salary or wage. He could use either the eight-week or 24-week covered period because he received his funds before June 5. He documents and estimates his expenses for the two options as follows:

(140% of Loan amount)Total Loan Forgiveness Request: $50,417 (total loan amount)(minus) $4,000 for EIDLRemaining Loan with Bank - $4,000 (1% per annum, two-year term)Clearly, John should elect to use the 24-week period if he wants a chance at full forgiveness of the PPP loan. In fact, this is the very reason Congress wanted to increase the time period and decrease the percentage to 60 percent of the funds needing to be payroll costs.Other Notable Guidance and ProvisionsBusiness owners and tax professionals from around the country were grateful to receive much-needed clarifications and guidance from the SBA. Moreover, most would agree that the new EZ Application and provisions were generous and many business owners will be able to take advantage of the much simpler procedure. Other important provisions to note are as follows:Any leftover PPP loans owed by business owners were to be paid back at 1 percent per annum over two years. Now, loans made after June 5 are raised to a five-year term at the same interest rate. Business owners who received loan proceeds before June 5 are allowed to negotiate with banks for a five-year term if both parties agree.For nonowner/employees, payroll costs are limited to a maximum amount of $15,385 per individual if using the eight-week covered period (the same amount for owner compensation replacement). However, if business owners elect the 24-week covered period, the maximum payroll cost for a non-owner employee is limited to $46,154 per individual (much higher than the $20,833 for owner compensation replacement).Health insurance costs for S-Corporation owners themselves cannot be included in calculating payroll costs, but the health insurance premiums for non-owner employees are included.Finally, business owners can apply for forgiveness anytime they feel they are ready and qualify to do so. Moreover, if relying on safe harbors for salary or wage reductions and calculating FTE employee levels, business owners can use the date the loan forgiveness application is submitted and don't have to wait until December 31 to use the safe harbor.In the end, and an important note of caution, is to not be fooled by the simplicity of the one- or two-page PPP EZ Application. Business owners are still required to collect and submit a number of supporting documents with the application to the bank. Yes, we hope banks will create portals with online applications and the ability to upload or submit supporting documents digitally, but they may not be easy to track down if you wait to the last minute.Related: That Money Network Envelope Isn't Spam; It's Your Stimulus Debit CardWe've been recommending to all of our clients that they start early in the process and utilize the help of an accounting, tax or legal professional if necessary.

84,5 Strategies for Avoiding PPP Legal Blunders,"Jun 5, 2020",Arkady Bukh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/5-strategies-for-avoiding-ppp-legal-blunders/350718,"
The CARES Act was a landmark, $2 trillion piece of legislation that not only provided every American with a $1,200 stimulus check and an extra $600 a week in unemployment benefits, but also put aside money for the Small Business Administration (SBA) to cover the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program (EIDL). This program provides forgivable, low-interest loans to small businesses that qualify and has already been a lifesaver for many businesses that have been forced to shut their doors during the quarantine.But as with all good things, there will always be those who take advantage, which means that these loans come with strict standards and regulations for those applying to and receiving federal funds. Although most business owners would do anything to avoid an accusation of fraud, it can be tricky to navigate this complex area of finance and legislation. Mistakes can happen. To avoid any issues cropping up in the future, here are five strategies to keep your business safe from PPP loan blunders.1. Keep careful records regarding your PPP loan spendingDon't wait until your business is large to keep meticulous records of your spending, especially when it comes to this type of loan. Because of the strict stipulations that come along with a PPP loan, it's imperative that you keep careful records of how it is spent so you can prove your compliance with the letter of the law. Your business is no doubt suffering due to this economic downturn, so do not shoot yourself in the foot by being careless when it comes to record-keeping.



Related: PPP Forgivable Loans Will be Unforgiving for Many2. Don't use less than the minimum mandatory funds for payrollOne of the most important stipulations of forgiveness for SBA loans is that 75% of the funds must go towards payroll if the borrower is looking to get full forgiveness. Although you are allowed to include your own salary in this accounting, do not underestimate the time and effort it will take to re-hire the employees you had to let go during this time. Even if you cannot re-hire everyone, you are still required to use that same percentage of the loan towards payroll.


3. Pay yourself a typical salaryAs we mentioned above, you are allowed to calculate the cost of your own salary into your PPP loan and pay yourself from these funds. If you are keeping careful records, there should be no issues producing evidence to support your calculations.Be careful to not overspend in this category, however. You can be sure that it will be found out somewhere down the road. If you are caught embezzling these funds, you will be subject to the heavy hand of the law, including felony charges and a hefty fine, so ensure your t's are crossed and your i's are dotted on every single document to avoid any issues along the line.4. Including 1099 workers Is unnecessaryIf your business often utilizes independent contractors, it is important to remember that their wages are not covered under your payroll for PPP loan funds. 1099 workers can apply for their own loans should they experience financial hardship, so there is no need to calculate extra funds to cover their expenses. Only employees who file W-2 forms each year with your company are eligible for these payroll funds.5. Do not use PPP funds for unrelated purchases It may be tempting to put a few more things on your company card during this tough time, but it's not a good idea to use PPP funds towards non-business-related purchases, even if it's an emergency. Careful record-keeping will expose small mistakes like this one, so be sure you keep your PPP funds separate from your personal expenses in order to avoid any nasty consequences down the road.


Related: 8 Legal Requirements When You Start A BusinessThe consequences of PPP loan blundersIf you are accused of PPP loan issues, there is no need to panic just yet, especially if you've kept records and done everything by the book. But you should know what type of punishment you are looking at even if you inadvertently commit a crime related to your SBA loan. You may be subject to not just fines, but federal felony charges that come with prison time. Here is just a brief list of the issues you could run into after receiving a PPP loan, along with the consequences you may face.For dishonest statements made on federal applications, you could be subject to charges brought against businesses by the FBI and Inspector General. These will lead to arrest as well as felony charges. These include: FEMA fraud, SBA loans fraud, and PPP fraud. When it comes to unemployment benefits and unemployment insurance, any business caught defrauding these systems will be subject to arrest by the district attorney and prosecution by the AG or even the FBI. 



  Another issue that you may run into is tax fraud, which can come about from lying or submitting dishonest information to the IRS in order to receive more funds. No one wants an issue with the IRS, and these charges can come with an arrest by the IRS Criminal Division. These also include payroll fraud, 1099 fraud, and W2 recipients fraud as well.Any business that is shown to be committed fraud related to the health crisis, whether it's a dispute between partners and investors or employment fraud, will be subject to charges as well. Don't use the pandemic to take advantage — it's not in your best interest. Keeping your business safe Although the consequences to these types of criminal actions are extremely serious, a skilled criminal defense attorney should be able to clear your name if you come up against false charges of fraud. Remember: The more meticulous and exact your record-keeping has been, the better off you'll be in a situation like this.Taking the strict regulations surrounding these loans seriously is not just a good idea — it's essential if you're looking to run a trusted and successful business whose legacy you can be proud of.Related: How to Stop a Frivolous Lawsuit From Sinking Your Business

This story was updated to reflect new information on May 26.The SBA released its Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loan Forgiveness Application and clarified a few critical definitions and documentation requirements in their instructions. The forgiveness application is completed by the small-business borrower and is submitted to their bank or lender whom they received their PPP loan from. The application consists of 11 lines that when calculated results in the amount of forgiveness a small-business owner will be eligible for. The forgiveness component of PPP is what attracted small-business owners to take out PPP loans in droves, as the program promised forgiveness of amounts loaned so long as the small business used the funds for payroll, business mortgage interest, rent and utilities. For a summary on forgiveness rules please refer to my prior article here.Three-Part Calculation MethodThe application consists of a three-part calculation to determine the amount eligible for forgiveness. First, the application asks for the payroll and qualifying non-payroll costs that the business has spent over the eight-week period since it received its PPP funds (more on the updated definition of these costs later). The second step is a reduction in the forgiveness amount if you have reduced pay for employees greater than 25 percent or if you have not brought back the same number of full-time equivalent employees (more on that definition later). The full-time equivalent employee (FTE) rule requires a small business to reduce its forgiveness request if it does not bring back the same number of employees that it had pre-pandemic. The application does provide for a waiver of this reduction if the business failed to bring back its same employee count during its eight-week period but later brought back the same number of employees by June 30, 2020.



Related: Today Is Officially the Day for Companies to Return Their SBA PPP LoansStep three is the 75 percent payroll cost test, which states that the forgiveness request must be comprised of at least 75 percent payroll costs. The other 25 percent can only be rent, mortgage interest debt and utilities. If the forgiveness request in step three exceeds 75 percent, then you will instead take the amount of your payroll costs and will divide that by .75, and this will give you your total forgiveness amount. For example, if you had payroll costs of $70,000 and non-payroll costs $30,000, you would only be at 70 percent and would not meet the 75 percent rule and the $30,000 in non-payroll costs would need to be reduced. The application calculation ($70,000 divided by .75) would bring the total forgiveness amount to $93,333. This calculation is effectively reducing the non-payroll costs from $30,000 to $23,333, and now the forgiveness request consists of 75 percent payroll costs ($70,000) and 25 percent non-payroll costs ($23,333).Rent Includes Leases of Personal and Real PropertyMany small-business owners and their accountants and lawyers were unclear whether the lease of personal property was an amount that could be included in rent, and thus forgiven. The forgiveness application specifically states that rent incudes the following: ""Business rent or lease payments pursuant to lease agreements for real or personal property in force between February 15, 2020 (business rent or lease payments).""It was clear that rental payments for office, storefront and other real property was going to be included, but the application now makes it clear that personal property items such as copiers, servers, autos and other common items of personal property that are leased by a business will be includable in the bucket of non-payroll costs that may be forgiven. Similarly, a business ""mortgage interest payment"" includes loans for real property and personal property, and as a result interest paid on loans for equipment, autos and other personal property items are includable and can be forgiven.   Utilities Definition Includes Internet, Transportation and TelephoneThe application also defines what utility expenses may be added to the application. These expenses include ""...electricity, gas, water, transportation, telephone or internet access, for which service began before February 15, 2020.""Most of these utility expenses are straightforward. What falls under transportation is uncertain, but SBA guidance appears to define transportation costs as gas and other auto expenses that would usually be part of the auto deductions on the business-tax return.


Average FTE CalculationIn determining your full-time equivalent employees before the pandemic and during the eight-week period, the SBA has given two alternative methods of calculation. The first method takes some math and seems complex at first, but will give flexibility and will meet the intent of the rule — that those small business who retain or bring back all of their employees during the eight-week period or by June 30, 2020 will not have their forgiveness request reduced.  The first option is to take the average number of hours paid each week for each employee, divide by 40 and round the total to the nearest 10th. The maximum number of hours per employee is 40 or 1 FTE. Let's run a quick example for a small business with three employees.                Employee 1 Average Weekly Hours = 40                40 hours divided by 40 = 1                1 FTE                 Employee 2 Average Weekly Hours = 35                35 hours divided by 40 = .875                Round to nearest tenth = .9                .9 FTE                 Employee 3 Average Weekly Hours = 21                21 hours divided by 40 = .525                Round to nearest tenth = .5                .5 FTE                 Total FTE = 2.4 FTE Since the calculation method tracks each employee by the hours they worked, and since it is the same method to use pre-pandemic and during the eight-week period, it will fairly reflect the small businesses payroll costs and the hours worked without having to worry about whether an employee makes the cut as a full-time equivalent or if they are part-time.  The SBA is also allowing for a simpler method that assigns 1.0 for employees who work 40 hours or more per week and .5 for employees who work fewer than 40 hours. While this may work for some small businesses, there can be some losers in this method, as you may have someone who worked working 35 hours who is now only being counted at .5 under the simple method but would be .9 under the traditional method.Documentation of Payroll CostsThe application outlines what documentation will be required with the forgiveness request. For payroll costs, the business must outline these in a PPP Schedule A Worksheet and must identify each employee paid during the eight-week period. The business must also identify employees paid at an annualized rate below $100,000 in 2019 on one schedule and employees paid at an annualized rate over $100,000 on another schedule. The business owner's compensation is included on a separate line on the forgiveness application, but still calculates into the application like any employee. Because of the per employee compensation restriction $100,000, no employee or owner can have cash/wage compensation that is forgiven greater than the annualized eight-week amount of $15,385. Consequently, the maximum cash compensation forgiveness request per employee on the Schedule A worksheet will be $15,385. Note that this $15,385 cap does not include health insurance and retirement contributions paid by the business.The forgiveness application gives flexibility to small businesses who have a bi-weekly payroll, such that they will be able to ensure that they can get four pay periods of two weeks into their eight-week covered period regardless of when they receive their PPP loan funds and when their regular bi-weekly payroll schedule hits. This was an important provision and instruction in the application, as many businesses were realizing that their payroll schedules weren't in synch with the eight-week period, and as a result of their loan funding date and their regular payroll dates, they were only going to have three pay periods representing six weeks covered.To document the payroll costs, the SBA is requiring each of the following:Bank accounts or third-party payroll service reports documenting the cash compensation paid to employees.Tax forms (or equivalent third-party payroll service provider reports) for the periods that overlap with the Covered Period or the Alternative Payroll Covered Period. For tax forms, the SBA is requesting payroll tax forms (usually 941) and state quarterly wage and unemployment filings.Payment receipts, cancelled checks or account statements documenting the amount of employer contributions to employee health insurance and retirement plans.For many small businesses, there will be a significant time lag from when their eight-week period will be up and when a small business will file its quarterly 941s. As a result, many small businesses may have to wait for a month or two after the eight-week period before filing their forgiveness loan application. For example, if your PPP loan was funded on May 15, your 8-week period will run into July and will be part of second quarter (April-June) and third quarter payroll reporting (July-Sept.). This means you won't have complete 941s to submit to your bank with the forgiveness request until October even though your eight-week period was up in July. We will have to see what flexibility the SBA is going to allow in this instance or if small businesses will just have to wait until October to submit their forgiveness application.


It is unclear what documents a sole proprietor or partnership that does not have payroll and does not file 941s will use.Related: News Organizations Sue SBA for Refusing to Reveal Which Companies Received PPPDocumentation of Rent, Mortgage Interest and UtilitiesTo document the approved non-payroll costs of rent, mortgage interest and utilities, the SBA is requiring existence of the obligation/service prior to February 15, 2020 and evidence of payments during the eight-week period. To document a business mortgage obligation, the business would provide a lender amortization schedule and receipt of payments as well as statements from February 2020 and during the eight-week covered period.To document rent or lease payments, a copy of the lease agreement must be produced showing it was in force before February 15, 2020. To document the payments, the small-business owner will need to produce copies of account statements from its landlord/lessor showing the payments or cancelled checks evidencing the payments made during the eight-week period. Small businesses who are paying rent monthly will generally be able to request two months worth of expenses during the eight-week period.The documentation required for utility payments includes an invoice or statements from February 2020 showing the utility service in place. To document payments made during the eight-week period, the business can use account statements showing the payments made, cancelled checks or bank-account statements showing the payment.Small-businesses owners will submit their forgiveness application and their supporting documentation to their bank, and their bank will have 60 days to approve or reject the forgiveness request. Attention to detail and a correctly completed forgiveness application will be key to ensuring the maximum amount forgivable. Understanding what is in the application now will greatly increase a small business's chances of receiving maximum PPP loan forgiveness. There are still many unanswered questions, but seeing the PPP forgiveness loan application is a big step ahead.

86,5 Personal-Finance Mistakes That Kill Promising Companies,"May 12, 2020",Rashan Dixon,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/5-personal-finance-mistakes-that-kill-promising-companies/350323,"
For most people, personal-finance mistakes affect only themselves. For entrepreneurs, a personal-finance slip-up can have far-reaching consequences. People who get into tight financial spots while running their businesses must make difficult choices about which bills to pay, which opportunities to let go and which partners to leave.Founders of startups are no strangers to running lean, but that's no reason to add to the pile. Good personal-finance habits set entrepreneurs up for success by empowering them to focus their energies on the growth of their companies. Bad habits take their attention away from their businesses and hinder their ability to expand. Don't let your focus on your company lead you to neglect your own affairs. Watch out for these common personal-finance mistakes, and take proactive measures to keep your life (and your startup's growth) on track.



Letting your credit score slipNo matter how far off the grid you try to run, your credit score follows you. Business loans, personal loans, credit cards and even insurance premiums all depend at least partially on your credit score. Fail to pay attention to yours, and you could quickly find yourself paying exorbitant interest rates — if you qualify for credit at all.Take time to familiarize yourself with the different aspects that contribute to your credit score. According to Chime, there's more than one model that can be used to determine your score, but overall, total credit usage, balances and available credit are most influential. Understand the contributors to your credit score so you can take advance measures to keep your numbers high.

Student loans tend to have reasonable rates, even though high balances can make them look intimidating. Payday loans and credit card balances carry much higher interest rates than comparable lines of credit. According to WalletHub, the average credit card interest rate hovers around 19 percent; Debt.org reports that payday loans charge several times that, sometimes as high as 500 percent.Take inventory of all your outstanding debts, along with their interest rates. Then, start paying the minimum amount on all but the debt with the highest rate, pouring as much toward that bill as you can. When you finish paying that one, rinse and repeat the process.Related: Ways to Make Money Online That Seem Great but Just Aren't Realistic


Not building an emergency fundEntrepreneurship carries substantial risk, even for people on solid financial footing. Go in without a backup plan, and you could find yourself wondering how to pay rent tomorrow. An emergency fund insulates you from short-term problems and gives you wiggle room when you have to wait a while between income sources.Vanguard recommends keeping an emergency fund to cover three to six months worth of essential expenses. Depending on your personal situation, you may need more or less. Someone with a working spouse and a modest living situation may not need more than a month of backup, while a single person living in an expensive apartment should keep several months of funding in reserve.Failing to separate your accountsYou've probably heard stories about successful founders who poured their life savings into their companies and came out on top. Many entrepreneurs fund their companies from their own accounts, and that's a perfectly healthy way to start a company. However, if you start depositing funds from your customers's orders in the same account you use to pay your electricity bill, you invite massive financial (and legal) headaches into your life.Even if you're a solopreneur doing freelance work, make the effort to open and maintain a separate account for your business. Instead of taking funds directly from your company coffers, Square recommends paying yourself a salary. When you cap your income, you can get a better understanding of where your business stands and build up savings to grow and invest.


Allowing accounts to go to collectionsDon't like to look at your bank accounts until absolutely necessary? Throw away bills without opening them? You're not alone. Avoiding the reality of bills and budgeting can reduce stress in the short term, but the longer you avoid looking, the worse the situation becomes. Bury your head in the sand long enough, and a bill that you could have easily managed could move to a collection agency. Not only does a bill in collection severely harm your credit score, but it can also lead to massive stress as debt collectors begin hounding you for payment. Schedule a time on your calendar once a week to go through your mail and check on your online accounts. That 30 minutes of financial upkeep per week could save you and your business thousands in the long run.Related: Here's Why You Should Have Separate Business and Personal AccountsBetter personal finance means better business finance, and better business finance means a smoother ride to the top. You deserve to focus on your company's growth, so don't complicate the matter with missed bills and poor credit.

87,"PPP Loan Developments: Only $120 Billion Left, Favorable Forgiveness Guidance from SBA and IRS Tax Pitfall","May 11, 2020",Mat Sorensen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/ppp-loan-developments-only-120-billion-left-favorable/350444,"
The SBA Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is the most significant small-business relief effort in modern history. A key component of the $600 billion-plus (and counting) stimulus rollout is that beneficiaries can have their loans forgiven so long as they use the funds for qualifying expenses, which can include payroll, rent, mortgage interest and utility payments. The program was extremely popular in round one, and the initial $350 billion in funding was claimed in only 13 days. The SBA began approving an additional $310 billion from the second round on April 27, but as of May 10, only $120 billion in funding remained. (A good chunk of which is owed to dozens of publicly traded companies having returned multi-million-dollar loans.)Related: Should I Return My Small-Business Loan?



Only $120 Billion in Round-Two PPP Funding LeftHere's a quick table summary of PPP round-two data as of 5 p.m. EST on May 10.


Banks have been reporting that thousands of applications remain in their internal ques. In fact, many large banks are no longer taking new applications, as they are uncertain if they will be able to get their current inventory of applications funded before round-two money is allocated. Larger banks have told customers that they may be better off working with a smaller bank. Chase alone has said they have received more than 300,000 applications.Forgiveness Rule UpdatesThe most enticing feature of the PPP loan is the ability to qualify for forgiveness. A small business that receives a PPP loan has eight weeks to use it for the qualifying expenses of payroll, rent, mortgage interest and utilities. However, as small-business owners begin to use their PPP funds, many have found that the rules governing whether those funds will be forgiven are more complex than they first thought. (For a detailed outline of the forgiveness rules, please refer to my prior article here.)The SBA's rulemaking relating to loan forgiveness created a requirement whereby a loan-forgiveness request must contain 75 percent payroll costs. The remaining 25 percent can be approved non-payroll costs, such as the aforementioned rent, mortgage interest and utilities. So, for example, if you received a $150,000 PPP loan and spent $70,000 on payroll costs and $30,000 on rent, mortgage interest and utilities — such that you had a $100,000 forgiveness request — your loan forgiveness request would fail the 75 percent test, as payroll costs in the forgiveness request were only 70 percent.The forgiveness request would be reduced until payroll costs equal 75 percent of the total amount. In this example, that would be a reduction of approved non-payroll costs from $30,000 to $23,333. The other $56,667 not spent on approved costs would generally be returned to the bank or kept as a loan and paid back later under a two-year term at 1 percent interest.


Related: You Now Have An Extra Week to Return Your SBA PPP LoanFTE Reduction RuleThe 75 percent payroll-cost provision seems easy enough on the surface, but there is an additional rule that has caught many small-business owners by surprise and is one for which the SBA has recently provided relief. Under this rule, you are penalized if you do not bring back the same number of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees you had pre-pandemic. (Please refer to my prior article here for more details on the FTE rule.)So, for example, if you had 10 FTE employees pre-pandemic, but you only bring back six during the eight-week period that you have the PPP loan, you must reduce your forgiveness request by a multiple of the percent of FTE employees you have brought back. If you had a $100,000 forgiveness request, assuming it first met the 75 percent payroll cost test, that request would be reduced to $60,000. The effect of this rule is that small businesses are punished for not bringing back the same number of employees or more when it comes to loan forgiveness.In many cases, re-hiring employees has proven to be difficult for small businesses, many of which remain restricted by shelter-in-place orders and may not be able to utilize their employees in a remote work environment. Others are finding it difficult to hire back workers who are receiving generous unemployment compensation, or who are worried about health conditions at the workplace.


It's important to note that there is a workaround built into the law that says you can use the total number of FTE employees you have on June 30, 2020, instead of the number of FTE employees you have during the eight weeks. This rule will help small businesses that are unable to open entirely or otherwise unable to maintain their FTE staff now, as they are receiving their PPP loan funds, but that will be back up to their regular workforce by June 30, 2020.Favorable SBA Guidance Will HelpThe SBA recently issued favorable guidance addressing problems small-business owners have faced in bringing back workers. The guidance, issued last week, states that if a small business makes a written offer to re-hire a worker and that worker chooses not to accept, then the employee will not be counted against the small business for purposes of the FTE forgiveness-reduction rule. This guidance is significant for small businesses that are struggling to recover and are counting on loan forgiveness. For most small businesses, obtaining loan forgiveness, as opposed to debt that must be re-paid in two years, will be critical to their future and whether they can stay in business and maintain their payroll.Tax PitfallA recent IRS Notice will have the effect of a tax on small businesses that have their PPP loan forgiven. The CARES Act itself states that a forgiven PPP loan will not be considered taxable income to the small business. In essence, when you are forgiven debt by a bank or other party, the lender will typically issue the borrower a 1099-C for the amount forgiven, and the business or its owner will end up having to include that 1099 on their tax return and will have to pay tax on the amount forgiven as if it was income. Congress didn't want this outcome, and as a result the CARES Act clearly states that forgiven loan amounts will not be considered forgiveness of debt income.


Despite this provision in the CARES Act itself, the IRS issued Notice 2020-32 and stated that while the forgiven loan is not income, the business cannot expense the use of those funds if the funds are later forgiven because of tax rules already in existence regarding loan forgiveness and business expenses. The net effect of this is that small businesses will be taxed on their PPP loan forgiveness, as they will not be able to write off those expenses (payroll costs, rent, mortgage interest, utilities).This issue is still developing and is one that has been a surprise for small-business owners and their accountants and lawyers. There are already bipartisan bills pending in Congress to overrule the IRS interpretation, and leading lawmakers on the Senate Finance Committee — including Sen. Grassley (R) of Iowa and Sen. Wyden (D) of Oregon — as well as House Ways and Means Committee Chairman, Rep. Neal (D) of Massachusetts, have been working with the IRS to try to correct the guidance so that a bill would become unnecessary.  It's unclear how this will play out, but there appears to be clear bipartisan support to overturn the IRS Notice so that small businesses are not taxed on their PPP loan amounts.Related: Self-Employed With No Employees?

The PPP forgiveness rules will be the critical issues on the minds of small-business owners as PPP loans are being funded and put to work. Owners need to stay on top of the rules and guidance from the SBA and Treasury, and we all hope to see the SBA pivot more towards forgiveness rule issues and guidance as the second round of PPP funding is winding down.

Many small business owners who have been approved for Paycheck Protection Program loans (""PPP"") are realizing that the loan isn't as forgivable as they'd hoped.The amount a small business can qualify to have forgiven must primarily be payroll costs. The SBA's rule making has stated that at least 75% of the forgiveness request must be payroll costs but can also contain up to 25% of other approved expenses under the law such as rent, mortgage interest and utilities. That rule seems to be widely understood and so long as small business owners are spending 75% of their PPP funds on payroll this rule won't frustrate small business owners when it comes time to forgiveness. Unfortunately, there is an additional restriction on loan forgiveness requests which penalizes a small business if they do not bring back the same number of workers they had before the pandemic.Watch our free on-demand webinar, as our experts, Mark J. Kohler and Mat Sorensen, nationally respected tax lawyers, guide you through the ins and outs of your PPP loan.

89,Self-Employed With No Employees? You Can Still Get a PPP Loan,"May 7, 2020",Mark J. Kohler,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/self-employed-with-no-employees-you-can-still-get-a-ppp/350314,"
There has been a tremendous amount of frustration by small business owners operating as sole proprietors and trying to obtain a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan. To make matters worse, many bankers and loan officers have been overwhelmed by the number of applications, the speed of the stimulus roll out and sporadic SBA guidance regarding protocol for sole proprietors.Then there is the historic, perpetual confusion shared by many of the self-employed regarding the difference between independent contractors and employees. Regrettably, all of these factors converged simultaneously over the past month, making it very difficult for small-business owners to apply properly for the PPP — and many have simply given up trying to apply.My hope is to provide some clarity for sole proprietors across America desperately trying to obtain a PPP loan before the money runs out. Let's start by getting a few facts out on the table before proceeding.



Related: You Now Have an Extra Week to Return Your PPP LoanKey Concepts for the Self-EmployedBeing an independent contractor means you are a small-business owner or sole proprietor.Receiving one or more 1099s constitutes being an independent contractor.As an independent contractor or sole proprietor, you would file a Schedule C with your 1040 tax return each year.Paying workers with a 1099 is NOT having employees. If you did have employees, you would issue W2s and pay employment taxes and Workers Compensation Insurance.You can have a Limited Liability Company (LLC) and still be a sole proprietor or independent contractor.The PPP Calculation for the Sole Proprietor As stated above, this article applies to those of you filing a Schedule C as a sole proprietor/independent contractor, NOT if you are filing as an S-Corporation and taking a salary. I mention this again, because it's important for sole proprietors to not get confused by some of the rules that apply to corporations and not to them. Please note the following:


No calculation on the PPP application will involve payroll, because you don't have employees, and thus no payroll numbers for you or others will exist.Again, paying others with a 1099 is not considered payroll.Health-insurance premiums will not be considered in any part of the calculation.Contributions to retirement accounts, whether a SEP, Solo 401k or IRA, are irrelevant.(These four items above only apply to corporations with W-2 Payroll)Next, in order for a sole proprietor to properly apply for the PPP loan, it is absolutely required that they have their 2019 1040 Personal Tax Return filed and the accompanying Schedule C.Regrettably, in the early weeks of the stimulus plan, some banks anxious to help their customers would allow sole proprietors to apply with a simple 1099, a profit-and-loss statement or even a 2018 tax return. If any of these situations applied to you, and you ultimately received a PPP loan based on this information, it's important you get professional advice immediately on how to move forward in the forgiveness stage and subsequent application.Once the business owner has their 2019 Schedule C in hand, the calculation is actually quite straight forward.  The math is as follows:        2019 Schedule C Income (line 31)        -------       Total Divided by 12 and multiplied by 2.5       --------       PPP LoanFor example, if a Sole-Proprietor has the following net-income in 2019, the PPP would be as follows:        $80,000 net-income, equates to $16,666        $40,000 net-income, equates to $8,333        $20,000 net-income, equates to $4,1666Again, keep in mind this is tax-free income and can be entirely forgiven if the business owner spends the money according to the guidelines under the CARES Act.Related: PPP Forgivable Loans Will Be Unforgiving for ManyHow to Obtain Loan ForgivenessOn the face of it, the process seems quite simple on how the loan is forgiven. Essentially, the business owner has eight weeks to spend the money on specific expenses in order to have it completely forgiven. The money is to be spent on payroll (presumably compensation for the owner of the business), as well as some portion for rent, utilities and interest on fixed-debt obligations.  


However, the loan-forgiveness procedure is still somewhat hazy for a sole proprietor. A significant amount of direction has been provided for business owners with payroll, but how do self-employed individuals actually pay themselves in order to comply with the law? Only time will tell, and I will be publishing more articles and videos on the topic as the SBA and Treasury Department issue more guidance.The Takeaway: Determine if the PPP works for your business, and do so by calculating the numbers based on your Schedule C for 2019. None of this happens, nor does the application even get underway, until the sole proprietor files their 2019 1040 Schedule C. Get in line as soon as you can if you are seeking the PPP loan, and have a consult with a professional while you wait.Mark J.

90,A Leaked Powerpoint Suggests the SBA Is Denying Disaster Loans to Anyone Arrested in the Last 10 Years,"May 6, 2020",Frances Dodds,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/a-leaked-powerpoint-suggests-the-sba-is-denying-disaster/350232,"
The PowerPoint appeared on Reddit on April 24, posted by an ""SBA Insider."" The presentation, which was reportedly circulated inside the Small Business Administration, gives guidelines on how to disperse the Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) that Congress has funded for small businesses around the country.One slide, titled ""Character Determination,"" instructs SBA administrators to ask applicants if they had ever been convicted of a crime, and when the arrest occurred. If the applicant was arrested over 10 years ago for a misdemeanor: ""Approve."" But if the applicant was arrested for any crime in the past 10 years, or was ever arrested for a felony: ""Decline.""If these guidelines are accurate, they reveal a shocking overreach on the SBA's part. One in three Americans has a criminal record, and these sweeping restrictions are at odds with broad bipartisan support for loans to reach rehabilitated citizens who have paid their dues and moved on to start businesses that contribute to the economy. These entrepreneurs also often hire other formerly incarcerated individuals who can't find work elsewhere, which makes them vital in the fight to reduce recidivism. The leaked guidelines also run contrary to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's own recent claims that, while giving out stimulus loans, the SBA has eased up on its typical restrictions for small business owners with criminal records.



When Entrepreneur asked the SBA about the eligibility guidelines laid out in the PowerPoint, a spokesperson from the press office didn't deny or confirm their veracity. We were simply referred to the SBA's policy of obtaining more information from small business owners who have answered ""in the affirmative to questions in the application about prior convictions."" Experts in the re-entry space say that the PowerPoint's guidelines line up with everything they've seen happening on the ground. Margaret Love is executive director of Collateral Consequences Resource Center (CCRC), a nonprofit that promotes public engagement on the impacts of arrests and convictions. She says that, ""The questions that applicants for disaster loans are being asked are tracking with the questions in these PowerPoint slides, which suggests that they really are agency operating documents."" Kevin Gres, the CEO of Expunge America — which works to secure record-sealing and expungements, early termination of probation, pardons, etc. — agrees. ""Certainly that seems like what's going on,"" he says. ""The vast majority of people who've applied have not received anything from the EIDL yet, so it's tough to say... But we are having just an overflow of calls because of all these issues coming up. People are freaking out and saying, ""Get me as eligible as you possibly can.'""Related: Hiring Formerly Incarcerated Employees Helps Your Bottom LineAn opaque discriminatory process becomes more overtEver since the first stimulus package allocated funds to two SBA programs — the PPP and the EIDL — there's been a cluster of confusion around eligibility for those with criminal records.Before the COVID-19 crisis, when entrepreneurs applied for an SBA loan, they were only technically disqualified if they had an open criminal case (were incarcerated, on parole or probation, awaiting conviction, are under community supervision or in a diversionary program). However, there was also an opaque ""good character"" clause that asked if the applicant had ever been convicted of a crime. If they had, the SBA required them to send in details to be vetted on a case-by-case basis. Once that happened, there was little transparency into the decision-making process. 


The SBA gave its most recent rule for the PPP on April 15, which said that applicants were ineligible if they had an open criminal case, per usual, but also broadened the restriction to disqualify anyone convicted of a felony in the last five years. ""If somebody has been convicted in the last five years, they may have completely finished their sentence,"" Love says. ""And it's bad enough to exclude somebody on parole or probation, but these rules even exclude people in non-conviction diversion programs. Frequently, the reason people are diverted is so that they will not end up with a disabling conviction and unwarranted collateral consequences – like the ones the SBA is imposing on loan applicants.""The EIDL eligibility requirements have been harder to pin down. The official regulation doesn't seem to have been updated since 2002 (the EIDL was a pre-existing loan and grant program used for other disasters), and it states that applicants are only ineligible under very narrow circumstances: ""You have been convicted, during the past year, of a felony during and in connection with a riot or civil disorder or other declared disaster.""And yet, on the current EIDL application, there is a ""yes"" or ""no"" question as to whether applicants have an open case, have been arrested in the last six months or have ever been convicted of a crime other than a minor traffic violation. Stephen Jackson is the CEO of the New York-based Workshop in Business Opportunities, which serves many returning citizens, and he says, ""What I've heard from many re-entry individuals is that once they saw that [question about convictions at any point], they didn't even want to apply because in their minds it was an automatic, ""No.'""""It's upsetting,"" says Lucinda Cross, president of Activate Worldwide, a leadership services and marketing firm. ""Because once I read that, I was already like, ""Oh, I'm not going to be able to get this."" Cross came home from federal prison in 2000 and founded Activate in 2006. As her business, which is based in New Rochelle, N.Y. has grown, Cross has made it a point to hire other women who were formerly incarcerated, and she had five contracted employees when the pandemic hit. Cross has applied for the PPP and EIDL loans, but has yet to hear back about either — not to mention she hasn't received a stimulus check. ""There's absolutely nothing coming in,"" she says. ""I have a family that I provide for. It's been a really tough time as a taxpayer, and as a citizen, to still be punished for something that happened so many years ago. A lot of people always reach out to the men [who advocate for returning citizens], but as women, we have the families and we're kind of the backbones for many of our communities.""Lucinda Cross (middle) with two of her contracted employees // Image Credit: Lucinda Cross Despite bipartisan objections, the SBA maintains its restrictionsAs the SBA's eligibility restrictions on stimulus loans become more apparent, many groups on both sides of the aisle are voicing their objections to rehabilitated business owners being cut out of aid opportunities. A bipartisan group including the ACLU and the Justice Action Network wrote to Mnuchin on April 17, and a group of nine conservative organizations wrote to the SBA, Mnuchin and Congress on April 20. The same day, a coalition of evangelical and Catholic organizations wrote to Senator Marco Rubio. The list goes on. These organizations recognize there are two ways to remedy the issue: Convince Mnuchin and the SBA to ease restrictions, or convince Congress to include a bill in the next stimulus package that forces the SBA to ease restrictions. ""In this highly partisan atmosphere, it's wonderful to have such incredible bipartisan support for this,"" says Love. ""It's really very gratifying.""President Trump has said that he would look into the SBA eligibility problem, and at a White House press conference on April 21, Secretary Mnuchin received a question about it from a reporter. To the confusion of many following the issue, Mnuchin insisted that the SBA had already loosened restrictions on small business owners with criminal records. 


""We worked with the White House on this,"" he said. ""There were actually much more onerous restrictions in the SBA program. There were people who had misdemeanors that weren't allowed to access the program, it was much longer than five years. Because of the criminal reform legislation that was passed and the work that's been done in the White House by Jared [Kushner] and others, we specifically designed the program and the five years was significantly shorter than what had been done before. So we'd already taken that into account…. There were a lot of people who wouldn't have had access previously, and we changed those regulations.""In a blog post the following day credited to its staff, Collateral Consequences wrote that, ""The Secretary's explanation is so wildly off the mark that it is hard to believe he was simply misinformed. More likely, he was reporting on how the SBA's 7(a) loan program has been administered in practice, unwittingly revealing an unwritten policy of categorical exclusion in spite of formal policies calling for individual review.  That peek at how a risk-averse bureaucracy actually operates out of the public eye would be no surprise to people who have experienced it.""Related: Which Public Companies Have Returned Their SBA PPP Loans ...Press attention and political pressure can make a differenceBased on the eligibility restrictions in place, it's safe to assume that huge numbers of small business owners with criminal records are not receiving any assistance from the SBA programs.But I did speak to two formerly incarcerated business owners who have received different types of stimulus funds within the past week, much to their surprise. Both have also received press attention and advocacy from powerful legislators. Robert Sherrill is based in Nashville, Tenn., and he started his business, Imperial Cleaning Systems, after serving five years in federal prison for a non-violent drug-related charge. Sherrill hires other people with criminal records and founded a nonprofit for at-risk inner city kids called Impact Youth Outreach. In 2018 the Nashville Business Journal named him a ""Most Admired CEO"" of the year, and in January 2019, the governor of Tennessee gave Sherrill a pardon.When COVID-19 happened, Sherrill had to lay off most of his 21-person staff, and in a matter of weeks he was staring down bankruptcy. He applied for the EIDL through the SBA, and the PPP through his bank, and didn't hear anything for weeks. Then, finally, on April 28, his PPP request came through. Because Sherrill's case isn't active and his felony charge was over five years ago, he qualifies for the PPP under the SBA's rules — but he points out that the SBA's guidelines for banks aren't laws. Lenders can still make their own policies and refuse, for example, to lend to anyone with a felony charge. Many do.


""And at the end of the day, I got PPP because I have a relationship with my lender,"" he says. ""I went through my bank that my business account is at, that I've been with for four or five years now. They gave me the PPP, because ultimately it's up to them.""Three hundred miles away in Cincinnati, Ohio, Troy Parker has been scrambling to make sure that his 60 employees are getting enough to eat. After Parker was released from prison in 2015, he founded Innovative Labor and Cleaning Services with the intention of hiring people who need the work most. ""My goal was to remove the issues that keep people out of the workforce,"" he says. ""In the lower income community, there's people who have mental health issues, but they can still work. People have convictions and struggle with addiction, but they can still work. So my thing was to map out how to take these obstacles away. If you don't have transportation, we provided it. If you don't have boots to start working, we'd give you the boots and take it out of your first check. Most people who return from prison or come out of rehab have mental health appointments, substance abuse appointments, probation appointments. So we make the schedule flexible.""Troy Parker (middle) with some of his staff // Image Credit: Troy ParkerIn the fourth quarter of last year Parker had 120 employees on staff, but now he's down to half that and has been doing everything in his power to take care of the people still on his payroll. His felony conviction is over seven years old, but because he has six months of probation left (of five years total), he was disqualified from the PPP program. He applied for a $235,000 EIDL loan, but when he saw the question about past criminal convictions, he figured there was no way he'd be approved.After his story made it into the Cincinnati Enquirer on April 19, he received some donations from locals, which he gave to employees who needed food or internet to homeschool their kids. Then, through the Cincinnati African American Chamber of Commerce, he was connected to Ohio senator Rob Portman, who said he would write a letter on Parker's behalf to President Trump's staff and the SBA.On the morning of May 1, Parker woke up to find $10,000 in his account: the EIDL grant, which you can request while filling out the EIDL loan application. The grant is a fraction of the full EIDL loan Parker needs to make it out of the red, but he's grateful he can pay his employees' health insurance a little longer.Of course, there's no way of knowing if Parker received the grant because of the press exposure, or because his senator wrote to the president and the SBA on his behalf. But certainly, the more attention and advocacy this issue receives, the more difficult it will be for the SBA to continue with its pattern of discriminatory lending. ""I take responsibility for my crimes,"" Parker says. ""It all happened for a reason. But when you're trying to raise people up — especially African American people — it's like, don't you guys want us to help in the community and pull the load with you? When you say, well, he's on probation so we won't help him, you're just paying for people to become part of the load that everyone else has to carry.""

Stop us if you've heard this one before: After returning a $4.6 million loan paid out as part of the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program relief fund, a Los Angeles Lakers spokesperson commented to CNN Business that their organization ""qualified for and received a loan under the Payroll Protection Program. However, once we found out the funds from the program had been depleted, we repaid the loan so that financial support would be directed to those most in need. The Lakers remain completely committed to supporting both our employees and our community.""The $4.4 billion basketball franchise's statement is a riff on the mea culpa we've grown accustomed to hearing as numerous large companies voluntarily return their multimillion-dollar PPP allocations. (Whether they're compelled by a conscientious awakening, corporate optics or the need to avoid federal penalties per updated SBA guidance is up to the imagination.)Related: Which Public Companies Have Returned Their SBA PPP Loans?As we have documented, the majority of companies who've given back the money — which will be placed back in the SBA kitty for disbursement to other businesses — are publicly traded, but the Lakers are unique in that they are privately held.

Privately held fast-casual salad chain Sweetgreen announced last week that it was returning its $10 million loan, with its co-founders — one of whom made the news last year for purchasing a $21.4 million home in Beverly Hills —  writing on Medium, ""We learned that the money had run out and so many small businesses and friends in the industry who needed it most did not receive any funds. Knowing that, we quickly made the decision."" Other non-publicly traded PPP loan returnees have included the housing association representing a private island for wealthy residents off the coast of Florida, and there are even reports of individual homeowners who employ domestic staff putting their hat in the ring for funds.

92,How to Get Second-Round PPP Funds as a Sole Proprietor,"Apr 23, 2020",Mark J. Kohler,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-to-get-second-round-ppp-funds-as-a-sole-proprietor/349684,"
The initial round of Paycheck Protection Program funding authorized last March focused on S-Corps and C-Corps due to the simplicity and ease of the calculation based on payroll figures. Now the system is ready for Schedule C sole proprietors.But just because it's available doesn't mean it's for everyone. However, if you decide the PPP is a perfect fit for you, the application has some unique characteristics compared to that of a corporation with payroll. It all comes down to the equation.What a Sole Proprietor Can Get Under the PPPThe calculation for a sole proprietor is really quite straightforward. The math is as follows:     2019 Schedule C Income (line 31)     + Wages for employees reported on a W-2 — Not you (Schedule C line 26)     + Pension & Profit sharing for employees — Not you (Schedule C line 19)    + Health Insurance for employees — Not you    --------   Total Divided by 12 and multiplied by 2.5    --------    PPP LoanRelated: 10 Ways Business Owners Can Take Advantage of the Federal Stimulus PackageFor example, if a sole proprietor made $75,000 last year (without any employees), the calculation would simply be $75,000/12, multiplied by 2.5, for a total PPP loan of $15,625.



Next, business owners who receive the PPP loan then have eight weeks to spend the money on specific expenses in order to have it completely forgiven. Regrettably, the equation of what a business owner can receive and what will be forgiven is still extremely complex at best. The SBA has contradicted themselves several times, and frankly, who even knows what the final application to get funds forgiven will look like? More on this here.How to QualifyIn order to receive the PPP loan, the biggest requirement for a sole proprietor is to prove their net income for 2019. This most certainly is going to require the filing of 2019 1040 tax returns, with the Schedule C and supporting schedules.Next, the proprietor needs to show that they were in business on or before February 15, 2020, and certify that the business has been economically affected by the coronavirus, or even that economic uncertainty makes the loan necessary.This loan is NOT to start a business, but to save a current business and help it get back on its feet.


How to Obtain Loan ForgivenessThe true beauty of this loan is that if you use the money for payroll, rent, mortgage obligations, utilities and other fixed-debt obligations in the first eight weeks after the loan funds, the debt is completely forgiven.Now with that said, we all understand the biggest expense and purpose of the PPP is to encourage hiring of employees, yet it creates a problem when the primary ""employee"" is the actual proprietor and they aren't allowed to put themselves on payroll with a Schedule C. As such, many tax advisors and bankers are still waiting for guidance from the SBA on how to substantiate these amounts.In the end, whatever funds the proprietor doesn't get forgiven converts to a two-year loan that is nearly interest-free. The bill allowed for a maximum rate of 4 percent, but the guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury is stating that the maximum rate would be 0.5 percent.Related: A 10-Point Small-Business Survival Plan


Finally, it's reasonable to assume that business owners who receive PPP funds are going to face a difficult challenge when they have eight weeks to spend the money, yet can't open their business due to a shelter-in-place order and their employees are making more on unemployment. Go figure.The Takeaway: Determine if the PPP works for your business by calculating the numbers based on your Schedule C for 2019. None of this happens, nor does the application even get underway, until the sole proprietor files their 2019 1040 Schedule C. Based on SBA guidance, the bankers are requiring the tax return to do the math for your PPP. Get in line as soon as you can if you are seeking the PPP loan, and consult with a professional while you wait.Mark J.

93,Minority-Owned Small Businesses Aren't Getting Stimulus Loans. Could That Finally Change?,"Apr 22, 2020",Frances Dodds,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/minority-owned-small-businesses-arent-getting-stimulus/349583,"
For four months in 2018, Danielle Edwards drove past the brownstone on the corner of 6th Avenue and St. Marks in Brooklyn. There was a ""For Rent"" sign in the window of the second-floor storefront, which caught her eye because the whole facade is enclosed by vintage curved glass. ""I call it the fishbowl,"" she says. ""I fell in love with it when I first saw it. But I thought, I'm not going to be able to afford that."" Edwards was looking for a new location for her boutique gym, The New Body Project, which claims the distinction of being the only all-women's boot camp in Brooklyn. Edwards, 35, started The New Body Project in 2017, after the local women's gym she worked for shuttered suddenly. For the members — many of them women of color — the gym had been a kind of neighborhood home, and its closure was devastating. 



""Literally, a lot of the women had breakdowns,"" Edwards recalls. ""I just felt like a ton of bricks was falling on me, so I said, I've gotta do something."" She decided to start her own gym and went to a number of banks to try to get a loan. It did not go well. ""Even though my credit is good,"" she says, ""if you haven't been open for a year, no one wants to look at you — let alone looking at you [if] you're black and a woman."" So she launched a Kickstarter campaign, and her community rallied to raise $3,000. Still, the location they landed in wasn't ideal. (""We were doing burpees and there was mold dripping from the ceiling."") So one day after driving past the fishbowl, she finally called. Just to see. ""His original asking price was astronomical, but my community came together,"" she says. ""We wrote a letter to the landlord and expressed to him how we're going to build this community, and he dropped the price significantly."" Even so, it was a stretch. To lock down the space, Edwards had to sell her house that she'd bought in her 20s, when she worked at a bank on Wall Street before getting laid off in the market crash. ""I went to the SBA. I was denied. I went to TD bank. I was denied. I went to Capital One. I was denied,"" she says. ""So I was like, you know what? I have this place in Jersey. I hardly ever go back. I'll sell that and use the money to secure a new location.""She did, and for a year, it was wonderful. The New Body Project grew from 12 to 62 dedicated members, and Edwards hired four trainers. Her clients were not the Lululemon-y ladies at boutique studios up the block. They were all shapes and shades, from all different backgrounds, at all different stages in their fitness journeys. From early morning to evening, they could be found barefoot on the big squishy mat in the sunny fishbowl, swinging kettlebells and doing tire squats.Then COVID-19 hit New York City. ""Monday, we were open and doing business as usual, Tuesday I was closing my doors, and Wednesday I was remote teaching a third grader and a sixth grader,"" Edwards says. ""I was like, wait, what just happened? For nearly a week and a half I just went into the bathroom and cried. I couldn't process that everything I sacrificed, everything I worked so hard for, could be gone.""


Danielle Edwards instructing at The New Body Project. Image Credit: Sideline.com A legacy of prejudice, compoundedMinority-owned small businesses stand to be hit the hardest by the pandemic's economic fallout. Early reports suggest that upwards of 90 percent of minority and women-owned businesses are not getting the relief loans promised from the government.In the best of times, entrepreneurs of color face a multitude of unique obstacles, many of which are embodied in Edwards' experience. Taking straightforward racism out of the equation — of which there is plenty — it's always difficult to get a loan without already having significant capital behind you. The facts are that the average white family in America has 10 times the wealth of the average black family, and eight times that of the average Hispanic family.  In 2019 the SBA found that 49 percent of loans from banks go to white-owned businesses, 23 percent go to Asian-owned businesses, 17 percent undetermined, 7 percent to Hispanic-owned business, 3 percent to black-owned businesses and 1 percent to American Indian-owned businesses. Because it's hard to get loans — much less attention and strategic advice — from banks and investors, many minority owners also have more difficulty growing their businesses. In New York City, the virus's long-standing epicenter, only 2 percent of all small businesses are black-owned, and only 3 percent have employees (compared to 7 percent of businesses that are Hispanic-owned, 21 percent that are Asian-owned, and 22 percent of white-owned businesses). Many businesses started by entrepreneurs of color also operate in lower income areas, and on narrower margins. In immigrant communities, there are language impediments. Now those obstacles are compounding at an alarming rate. In the chaotic scramble to disperse the first $350 billion of relief loans from the Small Business Administration (SBA), banks prioritized clients who already have loans with them, as well as ""small businesses"" that are, in reality, anything but. (See this week's Shake Shack fiasco.) The SBA had been essentially offering two types of loans: Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL), of up to $2 million (with advances of up to $10,000, dispersed to businesses within three days of applying, but those advances have yet to materialize) and the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which offers small businesses loans of up to $10 million to help businesses cover their payroll. Initial PPP funds ran out on April 17, and on the night of April 21 the Senate passed a new stimulus package that replenished the PPP with another $320 billion — including $60 billion for community banks, credit unions and even smaller lenders like Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs). This last specification is absolutely key in the effort to reach minority small businesses, the vast majority of which have been left out in the cold so far.CDFIs are some of the only lenders firmly rooted in communities of color, and their inclusion in the PPP is something that Gregg Bishop, New York City's Commissioner of Small Business Services, has been pushing for. ""The overwhelming needs of New York City's small business community can only be met by the resources of the federal government,"" he says. ""We fought for more support in the next stimulus and won an additional $60 billion for our CDFIs and local banks. Our smallest businesses who rely on their community partners for support and service now have a greater chance at accessing the capital they need to remain open.""Hopefully, that money will make it to those who need it most, fast. But in the past three weeks — as banks overlooked small businesses with no safety net — many minority small businesses have already plummeted too far into the red to make it out.

The less you're asking for, the less likely you are to get itBack when the first round of SBA stimulus loans were announced in early April, many entrepreneurs were optimistic. James Heyward, a CPA in Durham, North Carolina, certainly was. Heyward is a black business owner, and the majority of his accounting firm's clients are minority business owners. He spent two days studying the bill and applied for PPP through his bank, Wells Fargo. He didn't need much to cover his payroll; he was only asking for $5,000. But as the days passed, he just received more emails from Wells Fargo telling him that, in his words, ""I was still in the queue, but because of their lending cap, I might need to go apply somewhere else.""For many entrepreneurs of color, their first obstacle in accessing stimulus funds is that they don't have loans or a line of credit with a bank. But Heyward is an exception to that rule. He actually has a fairly extensive relationship with Wells Fargo. He has two business accounts, a line of credit, a business credit card, his personal account, his mortgage and a certificate of deposit. So when he wasn't getting that little check for $5,000, he started thinking something was off. ""Banks are for-profit businesses, right?"" Heyward says. ""They're only making 1 percent interest on these loans. They don't have the infrastructure for small loans, so their underwriting process for my $5,000 is the same for somebody requesting $500,000. So which one do you think they'll spend the manpower on? If I was a bank, I would say yeah, okay, I could just give you this money. But it's better for us to give larger amounts to sure bets than smaller amounts to a whole bunch of risky borrowers. Especially if your business isn't really open right now. Not to be doom and gloom, but this may cripple you forever, and the bank will be left holding the bag. Because I don't get the sense that they necessarily believe that the government will get the SBA money to them in a timely fashion.""Heyward isn't alone in this conclusion. Benjamin Burke is a senior tax consultant at Snappy Tax, in Ocala, Florida. In an email he said, ""I have been told off the record that banks are prioritizing the [PPP] loans first for people that have pre-existing loans with them. Then the bigger clients. Then everyone else. Additionally, some banks will not even touch PPP loans under $30,000. If a business owner did not have reserves, it won't be long before they have to close for good. We are already seeing clients in this position.""One of Burke's clients is Brooke McGee, a Latina business owner based in Ocala. A 33-year-old single mom with six kids — one of whom is disabled and severely immunocompromised —  McGee worked for a trucking company for 13 years until she got laid off in 2019. So last October she founded her own company, First Watch Dispatch, a carrier, shipping and dispatch service. She started out running the business from home, but that quickly proved impractical since, as she puts it, ""I don't have a big house in a nice neighborhood, and having 20 semi trucks pull up to my driveway was not conducive."" She tried to secure a loan for an office space but couldn't. ""So in January,"" she says, ""I took my life savings and leased a building."" This February, after maxing out her credit card and having the lights turned off in her home, McGee was finally able to pay herself for the first time.Then, the pandemic started to spread, and McGee had no choice but to shut down. Even though her company plays an important role in the supply chain, a big part of McGee's job is handling truckers' paperwork, which ""has been through literally thousands of hands, at stops from New York all the way to Florida."" The risk to her daughter's life is simply too great. ""I'm trying to work from home,"" she says, ""but I can't have the truckers come to my house. Plus I have six kids in six different grades and only two computers."" As of our conversation, McGee had tried for weeks to get through on the government site to file for unemployment. Burke, her tax consultant, has helped her apply for the EIDL and PPP loans through her bank, the Florida Credit Union, but she hasn't heard back about either. Because McGee's truckers are all private contractors, her PPP request covers only her salary, and Burke worries the request won't be worth her bank's time. ""My fear is that these smaller sized loans are being overlooked,"" he says plainly. Now, McGee's landlord is threatening to evict her. 


Brooke McGee and her six children. Image Credit: Brooke McGeeBeware predatory practices amidst of information chaosWhile reporting this story, I talked to many minority small-business owners who assumed that they'd have an easier time getting approved because the amount they were asking for was so negligible. But as time went on and stimulus funds dwindled, some owners inevitably turned to outside parties for help, leaving them exposed to an entirely different threat.The New Body Project has five employees including Edwards, and she requested $12,500 to cover payroll. As soon as the SBA loans were announced, she called TD bank, where she had her business checking and savings accounts, to ask about next steps. She waited on hold for over an hour to be told that ""they don't know because they have not been guided by the government yet."" As she waited for help from TD Bank, and panic-researched online, Edwards got an email from Groupon saying that she could apply for the PPP through their partnership with Fundera. Fundera is an online loan broker, similar to Kabbage or Lendio, which connects businesses to lenders for a ""finder's fee"" from the bank. Edwards was dubious, but figured it was worth a shot and applied, and got a response that she'd made it to the next step with one of Fundera's lending partners, Cross River Bank. Edwards had never heard of Cross River Bank, so she was hesitant. But she decided to move forward with the application because she still hadn't heard anything from TD Bank, and knew the loans were first-come, first-serve. Then the PPP money ran out.While it's not always a bad idea for business owners of color who are being underserved by their banks to look for funding through legitimate brokers like Fundera, attorney, stimulus analyst and Entrepreneur contributor Mat Sorensen points out that borrowers should be aware that the SBA-approved lenders these brokers will connect you with are still likely to put their established clients first.Of greater concern is the lack of information and reliable advice available to desperate business owners, particularly immigrant entrepreneurs for whom English is their second language. The Renaissance Economic Development Corporation is a CDFI, and affiliate of Asian Americans for Equality. They've been lending to minority business owners in New York City since 1997, and their managing director, Jessie Lee, says she's seen a surge in predatory practices. ""A lot of our borrowers are getting secondary information from their ethnic media,"" she says. ""It's so confusing that a lot of them have turned to brokers and accountants for guidance, and some of these brokers are predatory. I just found out that one of our clients went to a loan broker who said that they do the PPP program, when they don't, and then took $2,000 from my business owner.""Her advice for dealing with third parties? ""Always verify — are you an agent of an SBA lender? Do you have an SBA lenders agreement?""Related: These City Programs Are Giving Minority- and Women-Owned ...The case for giving CDFIs capitalRenaissance is one of roughly 2,500 nonprofit Treasury-certified CDFIs across the country. CDFIs have long played a critical role in dispatching federal and state funds to the businesses in underserved communities that need them most. And in past crises like 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy, CDFIs dispersed substantial public relief funds (they gave out $12 million in emergency funds after 9/11, and $6 million after Sandy). But as the COVID-19 crisis has played out, Lee says that Renaissance has had to rely on private funds, like part of a recent $1 million commitment from Chase to minority-owned NYC businesses. It hasn't been nearly enough. When we spoke a week ago, Lee told me that, ""Over a thousand businesses have submitted interest forms, and we're only going to be able to help maybe 200 of them.""Bishop, the Commissioner of NYC's Small Business Services, says giving CDFIs nationwide the capital they need to lend in their communities would be a game-changer for minority-owned small businesses. ""CDFIs and small community banks are really the only lenders operating in communities of color,"" he says, ""They look beyond the credit score. They're very flexible."" Until this point, however, most CDFIs haven't been able to offer PPP loans. ""We've been advocating for them to be allowed to participate, but it's really about liquidity,"" Bishop explains. It's a catch-22: Because CDFI borrowers are often small businesses in communities of color, many operate with very narrow margins and are now struggling to pay their rent, much less their business loans. Consequently the CDFIs are too low on cash to offer PPP. Now, thankfully, the Senate's latest stimulus bill  — which should move through the House quickly — has allocated $30 billion of the new $320 billion PPP funds specifically to community banks and credit unions, and another $30 billion to even smaller lenders like CDFIs (a total of $60 billion intended to reach minority and women-owned businesses). Lee is cautiously optimistic. ""We believe this legislation is a step in the right direction because it gives smaller businesses a fighting chance at securing funding and enables CDFIs to help minority-owned business owners in our communities,"" she says. ""That being said, $30 billion will go quickly and will not come close to meeting the needs of millions of distressed businesses. In the weeks ahead, we will need more financial resources to stabilize our neighborhood mom-and-pop businesses."" One thing Lee is sure of is that, ""The eight week time period for PPP is unrealistic in New York. We believe businesses will need more funding over a longer period of time, given the city and state timelines for reopening the economy. And payroll assistance helps but businesses still must figure out how to pay their rent. This is a big issue they're having to confront even after securing a PPP loan. Businesses need flexible capital to address their unique needs.""Still, while the money is there, any minority small business that hasn't yet submitted an SBA application with another lender should reach out to a community bank, or find a CDFI near them (you shouldn't apply for the SBA loans with more than one lender).


Heyward, the Durham-based CPA, thinks that moving forward, CDFIs and community banks should play a bigger role. But he also thinks this should happen in tandem with the SBA creating more permanent classifications of small businesses, so that truly small businesses with no capital aren't competing for loans with companies 20 times their size. ""You can call them microbusinesses, or main street businesses, but people with gross revenues under 2 million or something like that,"" he says. ""Because when anyone in Washington gets on TV and says, ""We're doing something for the small businesses,' I'm looking at the qualifications for a small business and thinking, ""So what am I, a blip?' And maybe that could be the domain of the community banks and CDFIs, because the commercial banks could care less about those loans anyway.""""The systemic prejudice in this situation, in the beginning it's not racial,"" Heyward continues. ""But we all know it's not right. I don't have to go beat the drum on that."" To the bigger banks, his message is, ""I'm just saying that you have to be honest. You have a lot of business owners who are truly expecting to get this money. Their margins were so small to begin with. For minority-owned businesses, this is crushing.""Edwards is still waiting to see if her PPP application gets approved at Cross River Bank. But in the meantime, after working through the initial shock, she's been characteristically resilient. In a matter of days, she designed an entire online fitness program for The New Body Project, complete with a weekly family karaoke session.""I won't throw in the towel,"" she says. ""I believe this will make us better when we come out of it. It's never easy to get help when you need it, so I'm blessed my business is something that can be continued online. It's actually given me the opportunity to tweak my business model. I'm really proud of what I created.""Related: How to Submit Your SBA PPP Loan Application and Calculate the ...

Shake Shack has decided to return a $10 million loan they received from the U.S. government as part of its coronavirus stimulus, after being among a few big chains criticized for taking money from a program meant to help struggling small businesses.Shake Shack is one of the most popular burger chains in the world, operating more than 200 restaurants across various countries, and last year making nearly $595 million in revenue.In a statement posted to LinkedIn Sunday night, chairman Danny Meyer and CEO Randy Garutti explained that while their company qualified to receive assistance as part of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), they had no idea that the fund would run out in less than two weeks, and are returning their loan to help businesses that need the money more.



Before the announcement, Shake Shack received criticism for winning PPP funding when so many businesses were shut out of the program. Other big chains like Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, Potbelly Sandwich Shop and Taco Cabana were also called out for taking advantage of the program.My friends who run small businesses have applied for ppp and heard back from their banks that they ""ran out of money"" and they aren't able to release funds for ppp...yet this.

Having laid off or furloughed hundreds of workers during the coronavirus crisis, and operating at a loss of $1.5 million a week, Meyer and Garutti said they decided to apply for the loan so as ""to protect as many of our employees's jobs as possible.""But what they didn't realize, they wrote, is that the program was ""underfunded"" and that ""many who need it most haven't gotten any assistance.""""There was no fine print, anywhere, that suggested: 'Apply now, or we will run out of money by the time you finally get in line,'"" Meyer and Garutti wrote.Meyer and Garutti said they decided to return their loan in full after securing what they believe is enough money to keep them afloat for now.

They added that they are glad Congress is about to approve another round of PPP funding, but wrote that businesses who need the money more should be put to the front of the line this time.

95,8 Ways to Set Yourself Up For Financial Freedom in Your 20s,"Feb 20, 2020",Oliver Isaacs,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/8-ways-to-set-yourself-up-for-financial-freedom-in-your-20s/346566,"
Your 20s are a pivotal age. It's a time to enjoy the greatest freedom you'll ever know until retirement. It's also the ideal age to begin investing because you have so much time on your side and can enjoy the magic of compound interest. Over the years, I have built 7-figure businesses for myself and made strong investments with significant returns. But making the right moves in my 20s saved me years of pain, heartache, and frustration —and it can for you, too. There's a saying: ""The more you risk, the more you can earn."" Here are eight financial principles you can start practicing in your 20s that will help set you up for long-term success. 



Related: Mark Cuban Says the Best Investment Is Paying Off Your Debt1. Understand compound interest and valuationOne concept that usually gets overlooked when people are making long-term financial decisions is the impact and concept of inflation. My parents always told me to put at least 10 percent of earnings into a savings account and another 10 percent into a retirement account. Saving small today can add up to real wealth in the future thanks to compound interest. But be warned: Compound interest is a double-edged sword: A small debt today can add up to a large debt tomorrow.


In addition, try to make financial decisions based on valuations. Buying a home is not always a bad decision. In fact, one study from Harvard University found that homeowners have a higher net worth than renters. In contrast, investing in stocks at higher valuations is not a good decision. You should aim to invest in assets that are available at an attractive valuation.2.  Generate passive income The quicker you can get your money working for you and generating revenue while you sleep, the quicker you'll be able to live the life of your dreams, reduce your stress, and likely live longer too. This one is hard to grasp especially for high earners. Every dollar that you earn passively is worth $10 that you earned by trading your time. When you generate passive income, you create the ultimate form of freedom. Your time on this planet is limited, and it's important to find ways to ensure you can maximize earnings while minimizing your time spent on working. 3. Avoid bad debtWhether it is credit cards or student loans, make smart decisions when borrowing money. Borrowing money using credit cards, payday loans, and short term loans from a bank have the potential to lock you into a cycle of debt that seems impossible to overcome. This type of debt comes with a high-interest rate and should be avoided except in emergencies, and this type of debt should never be used to finance conspicuous spending.4. Make friends with good debtNot all debt is bad debt. Take, for example, a mortgage on a home. The median home price in the U.S. is around $310,000. If you take out a 30-year mortgage on a home at this price with a 20 percent down payment at 4 percent interest, you'll end up paying a total of $532,795.47 (including interest). However, the inflation-adjusted value of the home after 30 years is expected to be $613,240.33 -- so you actually earn a 15.1 percent profit on your debt. In contrast, had you spent that money on rent over the same 30-year period, you would own nothing.


5. Save to investSome young people, especially millennials who came of age during the 2008 financial crisis, are understandably wary of stocks, mutual funds, and other financial instruments. They would rather hold their money as cash instead of risking it in the market. But history has shown that, over long periods of time, giving yourself exposure to the market is the best way to ensure your money grows faster than inflation.Sure, markets fluctuate over time. But on average, the S&P 500 has earned an average annual return of 4.2 percent since 2000, while average annual inflation over this period was 2.3 percent. One dollar invested in 2000 would have turned into $2.10 today. This is despite the recession following the dot-com bust and the Great Recession in 2008. If that same $1 was held as cash, it would only have 66.4 percent of its buying power today.I would also recommend investing in assets that have these three benefits:Increase in value over time which can later be sold for a profitPay you positive cash flow monthly/quarterlyHave tax benefits like a 1031 exchange on real estate properWhile making investments, you should always think about the worst-case scenario and be ready for it. People generally expect handsome returns considering the best-case scenario but have no strategy in place when things go wrong. Diversification is also key —remember to never to put all your eggs in one basket.Related: 5 Strategies for Entrepreneurs to Steer Clear of the Debt Trap


6. Only borrow what you needWhile having the right degree opens up opportunities for earning more over your lifetime, no one educated me on the debt I would accumulate in the process. Student loans can be a form of good debt, but only if your future income can support it. The debt you take on to finance higher education should never exceed your expected future income.7. Avoid conspicuous consumptionThe simplest principle that will help you gain immediate control over your financial destiny is to embrace minimalism and shun consumerism. Truly wealthy people don't flaunt their wealth. They save and invest their money instead of spending it on trinkets to make themselves appear wealthy. You might have to forgo that new pair of Nikes or eat in more often, but at least you won't be stuck eating cat food at age 70. This study from Integer Group reveals that 64 percent of consumers don't necessarily think that brand-named products are better than more affordable options. Truly wealthy people are not concerned about what others think of them and have no desire to impress others around them. The way that I define minimalism is simple: Only spend money on the things that you need or that bring real value to your life.8. Be patientWhen I was younger, I wanted success and I wanted it now -- and I was willing to go into debt to get it. If you watch a lot of television, you might have the impression that people become financially independent and amass the trappings of an upper-middle-class lifestyle overnight. Later, I realized that wealth accumulates over a period of time. I had to learn to be patient and disciplined with my investing and spending.


Your health and mental peace are your biggest assets. Never compromise your health for money—even though you think you can when you're 22. We all have potential. We're unique, but we're not so different from one another. We all can be someone, but how much we want to become that person is what shapes your actions from today. And there's no better time than your 20s to dream big, think big and, most importantly, act big. Related: The Keys to Cannabis Retail in an Internet-Driven World

96,A Beginner's Guide to Qualifying for an SBA Loan,"Feb 6, 2020",Levi King,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/a-beginners-guide-to-qualifying-for-an-sba-loan/345840,"
If you're looking for financing for your business, loans backed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) can be a good place to start. However, it can be daunting with so many different types of SBA loans. It's worth it to dive into the details of each program in order to understand what program and lender are right for you.In this article, we'll cover the basics you can take action on now to improve your chances of qualifying for funding through an SBA-approved lender.1. Improve your personal credit scoresAccording to the SBA website, even individuals with bad credit may qualify for funding. Having great credit scores, however, will significantly increase your chances of approval. Remember that SBA-approved lenders can add certain qualification requirements to the SBA loans they distribute, which often means more strict credit requirements for borrowers.



Related: SBA Loans — A PrimerGet started by reviewing your credit scores and reports (here's a list of more than 130 places to get your scores for free). There are three major credit reporting agencies, so be sure to understand which agency's score you're looking at when reviewing your credit data, and be mindful that your scores can vary based on the scoring model used.


Your credit score often comes with a list of reasons why you didn't achieve a perfect score, such as having an imbalance of types of credit, paying a bill late or having a delinquency on your account. No matter what your scores are, you can take these measures to boost them:Pay your bills on time. (This is huge.)Keep balances low. You may want to consider paying down some of your debt early so that when your balances are reported to credit bureaus, it's reported that you have little to no debt usage.Make sure your report is error-free. If you do find errors, you can dispute them with the credit bureaus reporting the error.Take care of any reported collections accounts. Try contacting the collection agency to discuss payment options and to see if they're willing to stop reporting the account to credit reporting agencies.Open a new credit card, or ask an existing credit-card issuer you work with to increase your limit. This can lower your debt-usage ratio, often resulting in higher scores.If you have blemishes on your reports that you can't take care of now, be prepared to discuss these with your lender.2. Establish credit scores for your business.SBA lenders want to know that your business can repay its debts, and do it on time. Your business credit may be part of this evaluation. In fact, the FICO LiquidCredit Small Business Scoring Service (FICO SBSS) is a business credit score used by the SBA to pre-screen applicants to its 7(a) loan program for loan amounts up to $350,000. 


This score can evaluate personal credit data for all owners with ownership of greater than 20 percent, as well as the business-credit data of the business itself. It may even include financial data for the business. Applicants who fail to meet the minimum score requirement may find it more difficult to get approved. (The SBA minimum FICO SBSS score is 140, and many lenders want to see a score of 160-165 or above.)3. Make sure you meet the size standards for an SBA loanThe SBA has pretty strict definitions of what does and does not count as a small business. They've accordingly developed a size standard — which is generally calculated by your number of employees or how much your company makes annually — but which varies by industry. You can figure out how to calculate your small small business size here. Make sure you follow the SBA's other general requirements, including:For-profit company.U.S.-based operations.SBA-approved industry (see here for more information).4. Invest what you can into your business.SBA lenders want to know that you've put money into your business, because it's one of the strongest signs that you really believe in its potential. The less you invest, the less a lender will be willing to invest.5. Prepare or update your business financial statements.A lender will likely want to look at your profit and loss statement, or P&L, as well as your projected financial statements.


6. Make sure all owners have updated personal resumes.A bank or lender will likely want to see your business experience. For startups, they're looking to see if you have experience in an industry or line of business that closely relates to the one your new business operates in. If none of the owners have experience in the field, consider involving someone that does.Related: How to Choose the Best Small Business Loan7. Determine how you'll use the loan.Will you be using the loan as working capital, or do you need it for a specific project such as purchasing fixed assets like equipment and supplies? Your lenders will want to see that you have an actual plan for the money you're seeking. I've gotten 30 different types of loans over the course of my career, ranging from equipment loans to SBA loans. It wasn't easy getting my credit in good shape, and the process of applying for the loans themselves was often complicated and frustrating.


I can also say that every single one of those loans was instrumental in helping me grow four businesses. SBA loans, in particular, feature some of the most generous terms available. It can take a while to get approved for one, however, so be sure to start the ball rolling well before you need it.

Before I tell this story, I want to say up front that I used the student loan mentioned to pay tuition. Taking this into consideration, let me detail how that monetary sum lead to a multi-million dollar company, reinforced by leverage and hard-nosed discipline.As a founder, most people know me from my business BNI. However, I actually started a property management company three years before I launched my own company.I was recently going through my old files and ran across the paperwork for an old student loan that I took out during graduate school. It was 1982, and I had applied to USC for a doctoral degree. I really wanted to do my Ph.D. there, but I also had to figure out how I would pay for it if I was accepted. Several years earlier, I had been accepted to Occidental College for my bachelor's degree. I was offered a 50 percent scholarship to go to there, but I couldn't afford the other 50 percent (nor could my family). So I went to a community college and then a state college, because that's what I could afford; by the way, they were still great schools. Although I didn't know how I could pay for the doctoral program at USC, I didn't care. It was my big goal, and I later I applied and was accepted. I received a couple small scholarships, but the lion's share of my tuition still had to be paid for by me.

So, I took another job and worked as many hours as I could so I could save up enough money to pay for that semester's tuition. I discovered that one semester at USC shockingly cost me more than my entire bachelor's degree. 


I worked the two jobs and I applied for a student loan of $5,000 to help pay for a semester at the university of my dreams. I had no idea if I'd get the loan, but I applied, and I worked to make the money in case I didn't get the loan.A few months later, right before I was to start at USC, I was approved for the loan. The thing is, I had also saved $5,000 from my extra work to pay much of the tuition in case I was not approved. So, I had $5,000 in cash and $5,000 available as a student loan. What should I do? Should I use my $5,000 cash to pay for school, or should I take the low interest loan for school?Related: The Importance of Getting Along With OthersI knew I couldn't keep working long hours for the next several years, so I decided to take the low interest loan and use the $5,000 in cash that I had earned and apply it as a down payment on a condominium. And that's where my journey began in the investment property business. You see, I flipped that condo a few years later for a larger house. I then flipped that house a few years later for another larger house, which I then flipped for another two homes. Eventually I flipped those two homes to pay about 50 percent of a commercial property that I was building in Texas.


The original loan allowed me to take my $5,000 in cash and turn into a $1.8 million dollar commercial property. Of course, my wife and I made other cash investments over the years that turned this little company I started into a multi-million dollar business with nine commercial properties and dozens of tenants. All of this happened because I got a $5,000 student loan (and of course, I worked really, really hard to earn money and invest it versus blowing it on things that wouldn't matter in a few years). By the way, I paid off all my student loans including interest years ago. It was a proud day for me. However, four weeks after the day, I got a letter from another university that read: ""Congratulations Dr. Misner, your daughter has been accepted to our school. You can go to this portal to make the tuition payments on her behalf.""This time around, I didn't need student loans.

98,The Best Way to Borrow From Friends and Family to Grow Your Business? Here's How to Do It Right,"Jan 10, 2020",Levi King,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/the-best-way-to-borrow-from-friends-and-family-to-grow-your/344650,"
The first time I borrowed money from family to start a business, I made a complete fool of myself. I asked my dad for $2,000 to secure a position in a multi-level marketing (MLM) scheme that was sure to earn me millions. I was young and naive, but he trusted me and agreed to help me out. Sorry, Dad. How was I to know that hawking magnets with magical healing properties wouldn't make me rich? A few years later, I founded a legitimate business repairing commercial signs. I had some success, but my complete lack of credit history meant I couldn't secure the financing needed to take it to the next level. Once again I went to my dad, and once again he came through. This time, his faith in me paid off. My business grew rapidly thanks to his largesse, and life was never the same.If you're considering borrowing money from friends or family, here are some recommendations.Related: How to Keep Family and Friends Loans Strictly Business1. Be clear about the risks.The first time I borrowed money from my dad, I was so cocky about my ability to repay him that the fact that he was taking a significant chance never even came up. That was a mistake. I was lucky in that he forgave me and that there was no lingering resentment or mistrust, but I felt terribly ashamed about my failure and wished I'd been more pragmatic with him when pitching the MLM.



Be absolutely certain that your friends and relatives are aware of the risks inherent in lending you money for your business. Be painfully honest that you might not pay them back. Make sure that everyone is okay with the potential consequences, and keep the transparency going once the money changes hands. Provide updates about your progress and continue to earn their confidence. 2. Seal the deal in writing. Memory is a funny thing. Let's say a friend assures you that he's 100 percent cognizant of the risks involved in lending you money. He's ready to accept a worst-case scenario. You shake hands over the deal while looking each other square in the eye. Fast forward a year. Your business has gone under and you're broke. Your friend is probably going to remember just one thing: He lent you money and you promised you'd do your damndest to pay it back. In these situations, it helps to have done some paperwork. A formal agreement ensures that everybody's on the same page about the loan. You've dotted your i's and crossed your t's down to the last detail. A formal agreement is also a tool for helping you stay organized regarding both spending and repaying the loan. It should spell out the size of the loan and a schedule for repayment.If you really want to be thorough, hire a lawyer to inspect your contract. Have everyone sign on the dotted line and take a copy for their records. It's not uncommon for family or friends who provide business loans to assume that they now have a say in how you run your business. A formal agreement can nip that sort of headache in the bud. 


3. Be proactive about repayments. Oftentimes when you borrow money from family or friends, you set up a payment plan. Never put them in the position of having to remind or harass you to keep up your end of the bargain. I remember a friend who had a small business that was doing pretty well. He got a little tangled up in some financial complexities, and I lent him a pretty significant amount of money to help him extricate himself from the situation and keep growing his business. We wrote up an agreement about repayment terms. I told him that I didn't ever want to chase him down for a repayment. If he had a slow month and couldn't come up with the funds, I didn't want to have to look for him. Our personal and business relationships were stronger for it. Communicate proactively if you get in trouble. Remember who your lenders are and what they mean to you. Be open and honest about your situation; they're much likelier to be reasonable and understanding if you face them directly rather than hide from them and stop returning calls.

Borrowing from friends and family to grow your business is a sensitive, complicated, uniquely emotional transaction. As I know from personal experience, it can also be a hugely rewarding experience for both sides.

99,The Best Funding Resources for Disabled Entrepreneurs,"Jan 8, 2020",Janet Gershen-Siegel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/the-best-funding-resources-for-disabled-entrepreneurs/344596,"
Are you an entrepreneur with a disability? The term ""disability"" covers many conditions, including limited mobility, deafness, blindness, PTSD or autism. You may qualify for funding even if your disability isn't physical. Ad don't forget: You can also apply for financing not set aside to address your disabilities. Here are a few potential resources to help ensure your disability is no longer and impediment to achieving your entrepreneurial goals.Grants for Disabled EntrepreneursThe federal government offers grants for disabled persons for starting a business, and those don't need to be repaid. Also check the Small Business Administration (SBA) grants list and Department of Health and Human Services for private foundations and organizations, many of which fund such grants. Or try the National Arts and Disability Center if you're an artist with disabilities needing money to promote your creative work. Corporate grants are another option.Loans for Disabled EntrepreneursNonprofit community lender Accion Opportunity Fund offers small business loans ranging from $300-$100,000. They can help with assistive technology, accessible workplace and adaptive work vehicle costs. Businesses must guarantee the loan, and personal guarantees are often required. Requirements differ depending on locale, so be sure to check.



Related: I Have Dyslexia, and I Became a Successful EntrepreneurLoans Unique to StatesCheck out local options. For example, the Advantage Illinois loan program is designed for disabled-owned businesses, and the Iowa Able Foundation has credit-builder and business-assistance loans. To combat the high cost of assistive technology, the Maryland Department of Disabilities runs an Assistive Technology Guaranteed Loan Program that provides low-interest loans on everything from cars to home modifications for eligible state residents. And the purchase of assistive technology like screen readers, Braille translation, TTYs and voice-recognition software can be applied toward the startup costs of a small business.


Nebraska also has a microlending program offering resources for people with disabilities pursuing self-employment.SBA LoansThe SBA Community Advantage Loan is a subset of the popular 7(a) loans. Amounts run from $50,000-$250,000, and they're intended for established businesses with under 100 employees or partly funded startups needing a large loan to scale. They help small-business owners in underserved groups, including the disabled population. These funds can be applied toward vehicle purchases, inventory, equipment, working capital, marketing, expansion, etc.The SBA also works with nonprofits to provide microloans. Many of these nonprofits help underserved groups, including disabled entrepreneurs. You can get up to $50,000 for hiring staff, remodeling work spaces and more, though these loans may demand personal collateral. (For non-SBA microloans, check the Association for Enterprise Opportunity or try the AEO's DreamFund, meant to address the funding gap for underserved communities.)USDA Business LoansThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) helps rural businesses and can be a good source of funds, as a large share of disabled Americans live in rural communities. The most popular USDA program is the Business and Industry Loan Guarantee Program, which partly guarantees loans for rural businesses in towns with under 50,000 residents. 


You must have good credit and enough business revenues to qualify, and collateral may be necessary.Assistive Technology Business LoansThese are good for persons with less than 550 FICO scores. Often, lenders are local, like the National Disability Institute, which offers assistive technology loans of up to $30,000 for New Jersey and New York residents at below-market interest rates. Credit history can impact eligibility.StreetShares Short-Term Business LoansFinally, StreetShares is a short-term lender providing business loans to veterans and service-disabled veterans. Small businesses must have low revenue and be in business for at least a year. You also need at least a 600 personal credit score. Term loans are $2,000-$100,000. The most funding you can get is 20 percent of annual business revenue.Related: 5 Best and Fast Small-Business LoansIf applicable, any of the above resources will help you demolish any barriers to owning your own business.

100,How to Get an SBA Loan Approved Before the Looming Government Shutdown,"Dec 17, 2019",Mark Abell,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-get-an-sba-loan-approved-before-the-looming/343921,"
Year-end is approaching, which means it's time for businesses to start worrying about the prospect of another government shutdown. Sadly, it seems like this has become a perennial pain, reflecting worsening political dysfunction and animosity.Small businesses across the country are only just recovering from the record five-week government shutdown that began in December 2018. The Small Business Administration, which guarantees loans worth $28 billion a year, has to freeze all loan applications during a shutdown, throwing many businesses' plans into disarray.The impact of the shutdown reverberated for much longer than the five weeks because it upended people's plans to invest in new projects, forcing businesses back to the drawing board. And unlike federal workers who received back pay for their downtime, small business owners and workers don't get a cent in compensation for their losses.



Here we go againAlthough a shutdown isn't a certainty in the coming months, the signs aren't auspicious. On November, 21, Congress approved a short-term bill to extend government funding through December 20.Related: 5 Tips to Improve Your Odds of Getting a Small Business Loan


But this only kicks the can down the road a few weeks into a period when the House could likely be voting on the president's impeachment. With both parties still at odds over key funding issues like border security, the trigger for last year's shutdown and a significant issue for a full-year budget accord, small businesses should start preparing for the worst again.What can businesses do?For any business that has a loan application underway with their bank or is considering applying, the first priority should be to get it approved before a shutdown hits. Pick up the phone and ask your bank if they can get your project approved and get SBA's approval prior to the December 20 deadline.Options to considerHere it's advantageous to be applying through a bank that is a preferred lending partner (PLP) of the SBA, also known as a delegated lender. PLP lenders have the authority to make lending decisions on behalf of the SBA, which enables them to obtain the authorization once certain minimum requirements are met.Businesses that can't get their loans approved in time need to be prepared to change their tactics, perhaps by delaying projects, extending contracts or obtaining interim financing. If the bank you're working with also provides conventional loans, it may be possible to apply for and receive a bridge loan to cover the gap in funding.


Related: Multiple Owners? Here's How to Prepare for Your Loan Application. If the SBA loan you are seeking hasn't been approved by the SBA, then when the SBA is again operating, the bank must submit the loan to SBA for their direct approval to refinance it. If a shutdown results in a delay of 90 days or more after submission, the application will be past the maximum time allowed. The SBA would likely still honor the lending request but it creates uncertainty by putting businesses on the wrong side of the rules.Finding an alternative lender is an option, though the disruption and costs this imposes on your plans may vary widely depending on the type of loan. For something straightforward like a real estate purchase or a line of credit based on accounts receivable or inventory, there are plenty of good lenders available, though their rates may be higher.For things like financing tenant improvements or general working needs not supported by collateral, it will be more of a struggle to find a reliable lender. That may lead down the perilous path to alternative lenders in the fintech space, where businesses will face significantly higher interest rates and have to be mindful of potentially onerous repayment and prepayment terms.


There are potential problemsIt's important to be aware that some forms of alternative financing can jeopardize the chances of getting SBA-guaranteed lending. If your business gets long-term financing elsewhere, the SBA views that as demonstrating that you don't need their guaranty.If partners put additional equity into the business in order to qualify for alternative lending, the SBA won't reimburse them over the amount that it would have required itself. If you put up special collateral for the alternative loan, such as your primary house, the SBA is required to use that as collateral if it refinances the loan.Related: A Succinct Guide to Qualifying for an SBA LoanThe good news is that all of these potential headaches can be avoided if Washington works hard enough to prevent another shutdown. So here is one last piece of advice: pick up the phone and call your congressman and senator to make clear how opposed you are to a shutdown and the damage it would do to your business and employees.


Lawmakers are genuinely sensitive to concerns and complaints from their constituents, especially from businesses that provide jobs in their district or state.

101,Should You Take out a Loan for Commercial Real Estate? How to Decide.,"Jul 21, 2019",Jared Hecht,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/should-you-take-out-a-loan-for-commercial-real-estate-how/331640,"
If you're the owner of a successful brick-and-mortar business, you may one day face a ""good problem"": Is it the right time for you to expand and/or renovate?If indeed the time is right to expand or overhaul your current space, or even move to a new location, your business is likely thriving. That's the good part. The problem is that buying or renovating commercial space can be an expensive endeavor.Related: Real Estate Strategies for Small Business Owners as Rates Rise



But it's not an impossible one: To upgrade, you typically have two options: Save up funds over a long period to eventually pay in cash; or take out a loan to speed up the time line and strike while the iron is hot.Whether you should or shouldn't take out a real estate loan isn't a cut-and-dried question.The answer will depend on your needs as a business owner, of course, but also the costs of your commercial real estate, the types of loans you qualify for and other factors such as the time you'll need to pay off your financing.


Here's what you need to know about real estate loans before making that decision:Why take out a real estate loan?The most simple answer to the question of ""Why take out a real estate loan?"" is that commercial real estate is, for many small business owners, prohibitively expensive. According to Green Street Advisors, commercial property prices were at an all-time high as of early 2019.Related: A Succinct Guide to Qualifying for an SBA LoanDebt financing in the form of a real estate loan is one of the few options for small business owners who need access to enough capital to buy or renovate real estate. Other options, such as the receipt of venture capital or a grant, are highly competitive and difficult ways to acquire funding.


Commercial real estate loans, meanwhile, can run anywhere from tens of thousands to tens of millions of dollars. Part of your loan application process will be to explain to your lender why you need the amount you've applied for, and you'll need to take into account the fees and expenses related to your loan.Investing money into an initiative centered around real estate requires careful planning. Your expansion or renovation must bring a return on investment that matches -- or better yet, exceeds -- what you spent on your loan.   What types of commercial real estate loans are available?Not every commercial real estate loan is created equal. Different lenders and agencies offer a variety of terms that may cut your costs by thousands of dollars, or require you to put down a smaller down payment upfront  -- if you qualify.Traditional commercial real estate loans: Banks offer commercial real estate loans the way they do other business loans. Real estate loans from a bank will typically offer the most money, with the lowest rates, of any financing you might find.


The down side? It's difficult to qualify for a bank loan. At a minimum, you'll need to show excellent personal and business credit, and own a business that's operated with strong margins for at least a few years.SBA commercial real estate loans: When small businesses need affordable financing and they can't get approved by a bank, they turn to the Small Business Administration. The SBA has two loan options that may be used for real estate: The SBA's general purpose 7(a) loan program and its 504/CDC loan program.Both offer rates that are far more affordable than what you would get from a hard-money lender (more on that option below), with payment terms that can last as long as 25 years. Of the two programs, the 504/CDC loan is the better choice for real estate loans: Interest rates start at around 5 percent, compared to 7 percent to 10 percent for 7(a) loans.  Hard money real estate loans: A hard-money loan is another term for a short-term loan from private lenders and investors. Typically, a hard-money loan will be for a smaller amount, and come with higher interest rates than does a loan from a bank or the SBA.


The upside? Hard-money loans come with less stringent qualifications than bank loans. Newer businesses that can't demonstrate the business history or strong credit scores that more established business owners can tend to start with hard-money loans.Commercial bridge loans: A bridge loan is a short-term loan that is meant to be paid off quickly or refinanced into a longer-term loan. You might take out a commercial bridge loan to quickly capitalize on an opportunity for expansion, rather than waiting for a traditional or SBA loan application to get approved.You can get a bridge loan from a bank or a hard-money lender, but know that this is a stop-gap solution before you find a better option.Commercial real estate crowdfunding: An increasingly popular way to raise funds for any kind of venture or project is through crowdfunding. Receiving many small loans or donations from lenders and investors can add up to an amount similar to a hard-money loan -- or more, if you're savvy.  


Do I qualify for a commercial real estate loan? As noted, your qualifications for a commercial real estate loan will depend on what kind of loan you're looking for. Getting approved for a bridge loan from an online lender will be easier than for a traditional bank loan, for example.That being said, there are some factors to keep in mind when you apply for a real estate loan; these factors will help improve your chances of getting an affordable loan offer, no matter where you apply:Credit score: The higher your personal credit score, the more likely you'll be approved for a traditional or SBA loan. Around 700 is the minimum. For a hard-money real estate loan, most lenders want a credit score of 550 or higher.Real estate collateral value: What is the value of the property you're looking to purchase? Real estate loans are ""asset-based,"" which means the property itself will act as collateral on the loan and can be sold off if you don't make payments. Therefore, lenders will want to know how much this property is worth. That way, they'll know whether they'll make their money back in the event that you fail to pay them.Time in business: The longer your business has been around, the less of a risk you'll appear to be to lenders.Debt service coverage ratio: Your DSCR is a calculation of your net annual income, divided by your loan payments. This gives lenders an idea of whether you'll be able to make your regular payments each month. A DSCR of at least 1 tells lenders you're a good bet.What else should I consider before applying? When considering a real estate loan, here's what else you should consider besides the types of loans available and their relative qualifications:The more affordable the loan, the longer the repayment term: Typically, affordable real estate loans will have longer repayment terms. For example, 504/CDC SBA loans can have repayment terms lasting decades.


This is a double-edged sword: On one hand, no one payment will take a massive chunk of your monthly profits. On the other, you'll be in debt for a long time before you have the ability to pay off your loan in full. Make sure that you're comfortable with this reality before embarking on a multi-year endeavor.The bigger your down payment, the better: If you recognize an excellent opportunity for expansion or renovation but don't have the necessary funds on hand, you get a real estate loan. That doesn't mean, however, that you can approach a lender with zero cash or no collateral.The loan-to-value (LTV) of your loan is affected by whatever down payment you can afford to contribute to your loan. The bigger your down payment, the lower your interest rate -- and, of course, the less you'll have to pay back. Related: Rising Interest Rates Are Creating Refinancing Headaches for Small Businesses


Loans as a stepping stone to success A real estate loan might be the stepping stone you need to take your small business to the next level. Without careful planning, however, it can put you on the path toward increased financial debt without a viable return on investment. That's why careful planning is essential in order to determine whether a loan is an option you can afford.

102,Bootstrapping? 2 Funding Sources Entrepreneurs Overlook,"Jul 1, 2019",Jeremy Sopko,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/bootstrapping-2-funding-sources-entrepreneurs-overlook/336037,"
One of the biggest challenges every entrepreneur faces is finding the capital to fund his or her vision. If you're one of the lucky few to land a major VC investment, congratulations! You're part of the mere .05 percent of startups that have successfully navigated the venture capital route.Related: How to Get Banks to Say Yes to Your Small Business LoanFor the vast majority of startup founders, however, the road to funding is a stressful and arduous one. In fact, only about half of all startups -- according to the National Association of Small Business -- survive to their fourth year, and one of their biggest reasons for failure? You guessed it: running out of cash.



Still, every startup needs capital, and there are dozens of ways to get it. What's shocking, though, is how often entrepreneurs forgo the cheapest, most readily available money in favor of high-interest credit cards and personal loans. Indeed, home equity is an option that's consistently overlooked by the startup community; just 7 percent of all small business owners who apply for loans or lines of credit do so by tapping into a home equity line of credit, and only 6 percent go for a mortgage refinance, according to a recent report from the Fed.To be clear, the home equity option isn't for everyone, and as with all loans and lines of credit, there are strict repayment terms that carry some financial risk. But founders in a position to carefully consider and mitigate that risk may find that tapping their home equity is one of the easiest and most affordable sources of funding for a startup.


In fact, I speak from personal experience. Here are the details:HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit)My partner, Bill Osborne, and I started Nations Lending in 2003 with $35,000 from a home equity line of credit and an $18,000 personal loan from my mother. Nations Lending now originates nearly $2 billion in loan volume annually with the help of nearly 700 employees. Without that original home equity line of credit, we wouldn't have grown into what we are today.Related: 5 Best and Fast Small-Business Loans (Some of Which You've Never Heard of)A home equity line of credit is exactly what it sounds like. If your home has increased in value, you're able to borrow against the value increase, or some portion of it, like a credit card. But unlike its plastic cousin, HELOCs come with a substantially lower interest rate than any business credit card out there. With a HELOC, small business owners don't have to take the money they qualify for all at once, either. Rather, they can draw on it as it's needed.


This is one of the things that makes HELOCs ideal for funding a small business, because it's hard to predict today what your capital needs will be a month from now. As an added bonus, some of the interest payments may be tax deductible.In 2003, our company couldn't show a small business lender or the Small Business Administration the $50,000 to $150,000 in annual revenue that we needed to qualify for a loan. That HELOC proved to be our proverbial lifeline; in unlocking that $35,000 in home equity, we got the money we needed in a matter of days to continue growing the business.This is not to say small business loans are a bad choice, of course. But they simply aren't for everyone, especially because many entrepreneurs won't meet revenue requirements and the loan itself could take months to materialize.Case study: Scott Raybuck, serial entrepreneur and founder and CEO of Zuri, a CBD supply company in Ohio, knows the advantages of a HELOC quite well. He tapped $300,000 in the form of a home equity line of credit, along with other substantial savings, to start his company Zuri.


""Most people don't think that way --it's more traditional to keep personal finance and business finance separate,"" Raybuck told me. ""I think it simply boils down to the nomenclature of the loan or line of credit -- the fact that it's called 'home' equity. People think they have to use the funds for something home- or family-related. That's not the case.""A home equity line could be a great option for entrepreneurs. Just make sure you understand the terms and the risk.Cash-out refinanceWhile the home equity line of credit is the superior product for funding small businesses, entrepreneurs need to also be aware of the more ubiquitous cash-out refinance option. This basically turns your home's equity into a one-time loan, which you start paying back in the form of a new mortgage payment.Let's face it, if you're starting your business at a young age, maybe you haven't owned your home long enough for the equity to grow for a HELOC. That's where a cash-out refinance comes in because it can still beat most small business loans and credit cards in terms of interest rate and repayment terms.


In a cash-out refinance, a homeowner gets a brand new mortgage to pay off the old one, while at the same time withdrawing accumulated equity in cash. The difference between the two mortgages is given to the homeowner in cash. Translation? I'm talking money to fund your entrepreneurial dreams, typically available at a significantly lower interest rate than your average 15 percent to 20 percent business credit card.Case study: In an interview with MortgageLoan.com, Sam Craven, owner of Senna House Buyers in Houston, Texas, discussed how he used his home to get the ball rolling on a business that's since done close to 300 real estate deals.""It was an easy process,"" Craven told the website. ""They lent me 80 percent of my home's value and that was enough seed money to get the ball rolling. I would highly recommend people unlock the dead equity that is sitting in their home to chase their dreams.""Every day, small business owners come to the shocking revelation that the amount of capital they thought they'd need to get up and running is insufficient. When this happens, home equity can be the gamechanger they desperately need.

103,Cash Advance Apps Can Be a Short-Term Bridge for People Short on Money,"Jun 21, 2019",Andrew Medal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/cash-advance-apps-can-be-a-short-term-bridge-for-people/335591,"
Around 78 percent of Americans found themselves living paycheck to paycheck, according to a 2017 study by Career Builder. Perhaps it's no coincidence then that cash advance apps, which give people access to their money before payday, have become a hot trend in recent years.These apps allow users to temporarily borrow the money they need to bridge the gap until that invoice money comes in or payday hits, at a cheaper cost compared to overdraft fees and missed payment penalties from banks. In this respect, many entrepreneurs and early stage startup employees are finding these apps genuinely helpful.For example, I recently learned of a startup team that is building a company that gets paid on the performance of their work, so their accounts payable is in the rears each month, and they depend on these apps to provide them cash until their customer invoices get reconciled. Learning about this team and how they use cash apps for creative financing gave me the inspiration to write the article and share more apps that can help more startups. 



A drawback to using cash advance apps though is that they can potentially encourage bad money habits. For example, some users may rely on accessing their cash early too often and end up with very little in the bank when money comes around.Here's a short list of a handful of apps that can be used to support your cash needs.


PockBox appWhat sets PockBox apart from many others is that users can borrow up to $2,500 -- up to 10 times higher than the amount typically offered by cash advance apps. PockBox works as a connection to multiple lenders, which may lead to increased chances of getting approved. Users can apply even if they have bad credit, and if approved, they'll usually get their cash the next business day. Interest rates vary by lender.Float appFloat is a new app that offers 24/7 bank account monitoring and will push a variety of alerts to help users keep track of their balance more easily. Float also offers a high loan amount of up to $2,000 and is connected to multiple lenders which may increase the likelihood of getting approved.Dave appThe Dave app is the first app of its kind, created to help Americans avoid ridiculous overdraft penalties. Dave lets users borrow up to $75 at a time in return for a $1 per month subscription fee. No credit check is undertaken. There's no interest charged, but users are ""gently"" encouraged to leave a tip. The loan is simply repaid on payday. The Dave app has some handy features such as alerting the user when their bank balance is running low, and it also helps them plan for future expenses.Earnin appWith Earnin, it's possible to get paid early (up to $100 per day) for hours already worked -- and it's entirely free to use. Workers are encouraged to leave a tip if they can afford to -- but this isn't compulsory. The caveat? Users must receive wages on a regular basis via direct deposit into a checking account and also have an online timekeeping system at work or a fixed work location.


MoneyLion Plus appUsers can download the MoneyLion app and sign up to the Plus service to get access to a $500 loan with a low APR of 5.99 percent whenever they need to. The Plus service costs $19.99 per month, but this fee is waived providing the user logs into the app every day.To be eligible for MoneyLion Plus, users must verify their identity, have a consistent source of income, have a bank account that's been open for more than 45 days and they must be able to show a positive bank balance. Credit scores are considered but a good score isn't required.Brigit appThe Brigit app costs $9.99 per month and allows users to access up to $250 instantly. Additional features include the ability to set up automated advances, free instant transfers and free extensions for those who need a little longer to pay back what they've borrowed. Brigit doesn't look at credit scores as part of their qualifying criteria, but users must have a bank account and a recurring income from a single source.Are these early paycheck apps appropriate for more substantial borrowing?In short, no. Low-cost personal loans are the route to explore for larger borrowing, as opposed to the short-term lending solution that cash advance apps offer. LendingClub or Prosper are examples of lenders that provide longer loan lengths and better terms for this type of borrowing -- but they're not suitable for giving access to money in a pinch.


Cash advance apps and responsible useEarly paycheck apps and apps such as Dave can be a useful temporary solution to help entrepreneurs and startup employees avoid unpaid bills, operational expenses and even dirty little overdraft fees. However, they shouldn't be relied on regularly, as transfer/subscription fees can add up over time and leave users even more out of pocket. Think of these tools as a rich uncle that can help you in a bind. You can get a loan from him once and a while, but you don't want to depend on him every month.What's more, frequently using these services can lead to a vicious cycle of dependency, especially for those on low incomes in impoverished areas, or anyone building a startup. Entrepreneurs who often resort to constantly borrowing money will no doubt find it hard to develop good money habits, such as building up savings, because they'll be trapped into living invoice to invoice and paycheck to paycheck for the long term.The bottom line: like all types of loan products, cash advance apps should only be considered if absolutely necessary. If you're in that pinch, I hope these tools come in handy.On another note, do you know what's used for money in prison? Top Ramen or a book of stamps.

1. Find a Bank You Can Grow With From James Short, director of food franchise finance, BBVA CompassOur franchise-specific team exists as a vertical system within the bank, which means when people come to us looking for financing, we start off with a Small Business Administration program that will finance single units to individual franchisees. One of the toughest things for a franchisee is growing from one unit to multiple units, whether it's two or 10. But we can help them do that through our SBA program, and once they reach a certain size, we flip that into a conventional loan, where we have a little better availability to capital. So franchisees can have a full life cycle within our bank. But we also see plenty of owners come to us, and they've grown and grown but have never taken the time to collapse their capitalization structure. We've seen a 50-unit operator using 20 different credit facilities -- that's incredibly stressful! We recommend collapsing that all into one loan, taking advantage of embedded equity, and finding a bank that can offer a development line of credit that can be used for a multitude of projects. We, for example, don't require budgets, and we don't require invoices: It's all true enterprise lending based on the value of the brand. Our franchise clients, they operate restaurants -- they're not finance people. We know what they need. If you go from 20 credit agreements to one, you get so many efficiencies. Your life will be easier, and you'll save money, too.
