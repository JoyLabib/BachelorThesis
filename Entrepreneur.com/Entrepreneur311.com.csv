0,How to Own Your Place at the Table as a Minority Leader,"Apr 22, 2024",Charity Hudnall,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-own-your-place-at-the-table-as-a-minority-leader/472620,"
I remember when I got a job at my first big tech company. Walking into my office on my first day, I was brimming with excitement and ideas. I was going to work directly with the CEO — amazing, right? But it didn't take long for me to realize that the environment I had joined was vastly different from what I had anticipated.First, I was the only minority woman in the boardroom, which made me feel like I had to accept the role I was given. Then, at a company led by an overpowering CEO whose mantra was ""execute, don't elaborate,"" I often felt more like a parrot than a partner. I became really good at capturing my boss's voice. I knew exactly the stories he wanted to tell and how he wanted to articulate them. But I didn't own the role, and most of my ideas were left unsaid.In my over 20 years of marketing leadership and management experience, I have learned to stand up for myself in rooms full of people who looked nothing like me. To minority women entrepreneurs and executives still establishing themselves, here are three steps to own your place at the table rather than be content to just be in the room.

Understand the landscapeEvery workplace is like a little world, complete with its own secret codes and power players. If you take time to observe and learn the lay of the land, you will find yourself getting around way smoother.


Get social, ask many questions, and start building relationships with those around you. This is your chance to see where you fit in. What are your strengths and weaknesses? How do your skills complement others'?To truly own your place at the table, it's crucial to grasp the immediate tasks at hand and the broader context in which your work sits. What are the industry trends? How competitive is the landscape? How does your individual role contribute to the organization's long-term goals?Remember, humility in the workplace means recognizing that there is always more to learn. It's about being open to feedback, being willing to admit when you don't have all the answers, and being eager to grow from each experience.Related: How I Earned My Seat at the Table


2. Do your homeworkImagine if someone new came into your company and said: ""I've been working for 25 years in this industry. We're gonna do it my way or the highway."" Wouldn't you be turned off?So, take the time to research and understand your organization's business model, history and culture. Studies show that ""people-first"" cultures can drive amazing outcomes. According to Gallup, companies that prioritize culture see a 33% increase in revenue.This means understanding your company's culture can make a massive difference in how your performance is graded. For one, this knowledge will help you do your job better and also enable you to make informed contributions during discussions. Then, you are showing that you are more than just a participant — but an invested and knowledgeable team member. I always tell my team that your product is going to be so much better if you have done your due diligence rather than if you go into meetings cold. Be prepared.3. Approach what you know with confidenceMichelle Obama once said: ""Whether you come from a council estate or a country estate, your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude."" Obama had to endure some of the most unfair criticisms as First Lady. She was called ""strikingly ungracious,"" not ""classy enough,"" and a ""feminist nightmare"" by people with half her talent. But did she let those words stop her? Of course not, because as she's demonstrated time and time again, confidence starts with you.


Owning your achievements and standing tall in your space is crucial, but there is a magical balance between confidence and humility that makes interactions richer and more productive. Envision yourself walking into a room, head held high with the knowledge of your successes, yet your heart is open, ready to listen, learn and grow. This balance isn't just about being approachable; it is a powerful leadership style that fosters a culture of respect, collaboration and mutual support.Anybody can be a good soldier. Anybody can participate in the way they think is best for their boss. But in my experience, I had to ask myself: Am I really growing? What part of myself am I adding to this organization? My experience at the tech company was a glaring example of the nuanced barriers that minority women executives and leaders face in the corporate world.But I want to take this opportunity to change this narrative a bit. Stereotypes exist, but the unfortunate reality is that they are not going anywhere anytime soon. So, we must protect our confidence as minority women by realizing that we are worthy and capable of overcoming these wrongful assumptions. If you are not believable, how do you expect anyone to value your words? Understanding the value you bring and having the confidence to do so is crucial.Related: 3 Ways to Support Minority-Owned Businesses


Shaping your reality through mindsetYour mindset is more powerful than any list of stereotypes you can muster. It is the foundation upon which you construct your reality, break down barriers and redefine what is possible for yourself. To my fellow minority women leaders, you do know what you are talking about. You took the time to build those relationships. You do have the experience. So, leave the stereotypes at the door.The journey towards owning your achievements and asserting your presence is as much about inner work as external actions. By committing to changing your mindset and dedicating yourself to thorough preparation, you lay down the stones on the path to building unwavering confidence, even amid the loudest naysayers' objections.

1,The Simple Thing That the Owners of This Pizza Spot Do Every Day That Put Them on Yelp's Top 100 List Three Years in a Row,"Apr 18, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-secret-sauce-of-this-pizza-spots-success/472903,"
When the Farrugio family opened il Canale in Washington, D.C. in 2010, their goal was to make the best pizza in the world.Giuseppe Farrugio, who's known as Joe, immigrated to the United States in the 1970s and has been working in the pizza business ever since. Having owned and worked at several Italian-American spots, he saw il Canale as his opportunity to provide a more authentic, Neapolitan-style experience to D.C. diners while working alongside his son, Alessandro. Listen to the Behind the Review episode below to hear directly from Alessandro and Sydney and learn their recipe for success.The Secret SauceThe Farrugio family knew a key part of achieving their goal was sourcing quality ingredients. Il Canale's flour, tomato sauce, and mozzarella are all organic and imported directly from Italy.



Beyond good food, the restaurant offers a warm environment and quick service, making for a high-quality dining experience. Despite serving thousands of people each week, the Farrugio family and their staff make sure to personally greet and check in on their diners throughout the meal. This is part of what makes the il Canale experience so special for Yelp Elite and Community Manager Sydney G.""There's always a member of the family to greet you,"" she said. ""I've been for dinner, lunch, and happy hour, so I feel like I've gotten a really good experience across the board of the different service options. They do a great job of walking you through the menu.""


Related: The Little Coffee Shop That Asks Customers Not to Be QuietManaging a team of hundreds of employees isn't easy. Co-owner and general manager Alessandro has found success by focusing on thorough training, thoughtful hiring, and achieving work-life balance. He makes sure to not only support his staff with key resources while they're on the clock but also to hire enough people to give both himself and his team the time off they need to recharge.""We just try to [be] a family. We try to be supportive. The biggest challenge is having such a large team and having every single person follow your vision, follow your path, follow the requests that you make. But it's just [about] providing the tools, providing the resources.""Related: How This California Hot Spot Grew From Delivery-Only to Pop-Up Shop to Storefront


Another one of Alessandro's strengths as a business owner is that he's always willing to try new things. When he noticed some diners weren't just looking for a pizza place but for a full-service Italian restaurant, he added new items, including gluten-free pastas and premium Italian wines, to the menu. This has allowed the restaurant to attract a wider clientele that includes locals and tourists alike.""It's nice when you have a big table. A few guests are gluten free, a few guests are not, maybe [some are] vegetarian or vegan, and everybody looks on their menu and they find something that they like,"" he said.Il Canale is also not afraid to find new ways of connecting with customers. Sydney admires the restaurant's eagerness to use a variety of marketing tools, including Yelp products and resources, social media campaigns, and conversations with as many guests as they can.""One of the ways you stay successful is to just never stop innovating and trying new things,"" Sydney said. ""If it doesn't work, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't try something else, because you never know what is going to reach somebody.""


Along with using paid features like Yelp Connect to share custom posts and photos with his customers, Alessandro uses Yelp reviews to keep a pulse on his business. With the Yelp for Business app on his phone, he receives a stream of notifications that alert him to any issues and give him a confidence boost when he gets positive feedback.Reviews paint the most accurate and current picture of a business, helping both owners and future customers make informed decisions. Even when you're visiting a restaurant like il Canale, which has thousands of reviews, adding your voice to the conversation is a valuable way to contribute to the Yelp community.""Things change over the years,"" Sydney said. ""Businesses evolve, menu items change, service turns over, especially how things work pre-pandemic to now. So you really want to make sure that you're giving people the most up-to-date information based on your experience.""Although Alessandro enjoys getting an overview of his restaurant's performance through reviews, he also makes an effort to check in with diners during their experience to make sure everything is to their liking.


For the customer's part, Sydney recommends diners speak up while they're in the restaurant so staff can address issues right away. Mix-ups are not uncommon in the restaurant world, and providing in-the-moment feedback can be incredibly rewarding for both the diner and the restaurant. For example, Sydney mentioned in her review that she received the wrong dessert. While she didn't bring this up to il Canale staff because it didn't have a huge impact on her experience, she wishes she had.""They take service so seriously. I know they would have rectified it and made it right with us. I kind of robbed them of that opportunity by not saying something. People are human and there [are] plenty of ways to bring it up without being rude and give them the opportunity to fix it so that everybody walks away having a positive experience.""Related: The Owners of This Texas Farmers Market Took a Big Gamble. Here's How It Paid Off Bigger Than They Dreamed.By focusing on quality food, service, and marketing, il Canale has earned a spot on three Yelp Top 100 lists over the last three years. Most recently, the restaurant achieved #14 on the Top Pizza Spots list, which is voted on by Yelp Elites. These accolades encourage Alessandro to keep thinking about how he can elevate his offerings.


""It sets our bar higher because we know the next year we need to do something better. Il Canale five years ago, six years ago, seven years ago is not the il Canale today. We're continuously evolving, continuously getting better, continuously increasing our standards.""In addition to investing in quality food and service, il Canale believes in:Staying on top of customer trends and requests. Modifying your offerings based on guests' needs and desires is key to growing your customer base.Engaging with customers online. Whether you're using specific marketing features like Yelp Connect or responding to reviews, the internet is a great place to find your target audience and encourage repeat visits.Maintaining a work-life balance. When you and your staff have enough time off to stay healthy and recharge, you can avoid burnout and achieve top-tier service on a regular basis.Subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.

2,How to Make the Most of In-Person Gatherings for Remote and Hybrid Teams,"Apr 17, 2024",Cheri Beranek,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-make-the-most-of-in-person-gatherings-for-remote-and/472430,"
In February, at our annual ""Return to the Mothership,"" as I call it, our team came together to spend three days at an airport hotel in Minnesota. We wanted attendees to be able to fly where they needed without stepping outside into the cold Minneapolis winter. There was even a direct connection via mass transit to the Mall of America for sightseeing, but the place itself was not where everyone found the most value.Since the pandemic, people have been less engaged and more disconnected from their company's mission and purpose. A strong workplace culture can create healthier, happier, and more productive people who stick around and increase profits. Still, as leaders adopt greater remote and hybrid flexibility, that culture becomes harder to achieve.Regular in-person gatherings help us bridge that gap for our mostly hybrid company. We spend a lot of money on our annual event, but the cultural boost and energy lift we receive in return is always worth the investment. Rather than considering the cost of holding these in-person experiences, I evaluate if I drew out the most possible value from them. Here's what I consider:



Related: 5 Things You Need to Bridge The Gap Between In-Person and Remote MeetingsDo what is digitally impossibleDesign in-person activities that can only be done in person. Rather than on-screen product demos, we put products into people's hands. Instead of speakers in big lecture halls that could be watched over Zoom, we rent many small rooms for round-robin exchanges between small groups. In-person training should go beyond skills development to ensure alignment around the leader's vision, direction, and path. At the heart of every activity, consider all possible ways it can drive and blend culture.


Even lunch can be an opportunity. Encourage team members to get to know coworkers with whom they might not normally socialize. Gallup data has long connected having close friends at work to higher engagement, a stronger culture and increased profitability. These are business outcomes that, since the pandemic, have become even more pronounced. Some experts estimate a high degree of belonging among employees can save a 10,000-person company $52 million a year. Taking every advantage to promote meaningful connections in person can be an effective way to build that sense of community.Related: The 3 Meetings You Should Have for Remote WorkersConsider everyone in the roomPlan activities with the needs of all attending groups in mind. Most of our salespeople are remote and might need more support to feel connected. Rather than keeping them separate, we plan their time with others by considering shared needs. We held one large group sales training but restructured the conversation to accommodate the inclusion of non-salespeople. By helping accountants better understand the goals of the people requesting commission checks, they can more easily build relationships and improve cross-departmental collaboration.What people want out of in-person gatherings may be different, so ask. When our company was smaller, we knew one another's spouses and families and often included them in team gatherings. Today, our workforce is larger, younger, and less oriented toward spousal or family events. Compared to an in-person gathering of 200 employees, a 400-person event, including spouses, is much more expensive. By asking what my team members want, I can determine if that extra cost is needed or if $100 gift certificates to recognize a spouse's support would be more appreciated.


Related: 5 Unconventional Ways to Boost Remote Work Culture and Enhance ProductivityTiming is everythingWe used to hold our annual gathering in October at the launch of our fiscal year, but last year, we were in transition and unable to dedicate our focus to the event. So, we delayed until February, but cancellation fees cost us an incremental 20 to 25% of the whole event. Still, if we had paid the full expense and called everyone into the field without being ready to offer them an event worth attending, the negative energy in response would have been much more devastating.As it turned out, rescheduling the event gave us an energy boost, leading to our busiest time of year and maximizing our annual opportunity. To help sustain that elevated energy, we also encourage smaller gatherings throughout the year as needed. Our regional sales teams meet several times a year, while our inside sales group prefers to meet quarterly. Schedule in-person events with enough frequency to sustain the resulting energy from one gathering to the next and, if lagging, adding another might be a valuable investment.Related: Don't Make Your Team Dread Meetings — Try These Tips Instead


Follow up and improveAsking for feedback ensures that efforts to bring people together in person are most effective. Our leadership team monitors the event throughout for signs of enjoyment or discontent. We also ask people to share what they liked most as the event wraps up. Within the week following, we send out a formal survey requesting feedback on each part of the agenda, including factors like the environment, hotel, and event dates. Finally, we discussed our notes as a planning committee to adjust and improve for the following year.This year, we tried to help people mitigate agenda conflicts with their day-to-day jobs. Rather than setting aside another 15 minutes of unassigned free time, we built intentional breaks into the day dedicated to doing work. We also asked people to prioritize that time for work and free themselves from distractions the rest of the day. Be direct in asking employees for buy-in and start early, long before the gathering happens. By getting people to invest their focus on the special environment, we better ensure they get as much out of it as we do.Despite a mild winter, we got lucky this year, and it snowed — a picture-perfect dusting. We had attendees from across the country and beyond, including from our Mexican manufacturing team, who had never seen snow. We all watched with shared joy as they got on the ground to make snow angels for the first time — a moment I could never have planned and will probably never be able to recreate. As long as we set the stage to maximize authentic connections, some of the most meaningful interactions happen when we simply sit back and let them.

3,Successful Brands Use These 4 Radical Practices to Attract Loyal Customers,"Apr 17, 2024",Adam Kroener,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-successful-brands-should-embrace-radical-transparency/472395,"
In today's marketplace, consumer trust has become paramount for businesses seeking lasting success. A study by Edelman found that 81% of buyers cite brand trust as a deciding factor in their loyalties and purchasing behaviors. With the proliferation of information sources, companies can no longer maintain opaque practices obscuring key details. They must operate in full transparency to earn customer confidence and allegiance.As the CEO of Carbliss, an alcoholic beverage brand, I've witnessed firsthand how radical transparency around all production and business operations drives powerful consumer loyalty and business growth. From our earliest days, we committed to an unwavering open-book approach that has helped cement valuable, long-lasting relationships with our customer base. Below are the four criteria and best practices we prioritize to maintain transparency and customer loyalty.1. Hands-on customer dialogueToday's empowered consumers can easily see right through that disingenuous smokescreen. What they crave from the brands they embrace is true candor about every key aspect, including the ingredients, sourcing practices, pricing rationale, regulatory challenges, and more underpinning the products they consume.



One key way I nurture this culture of authenticity is by being directly involved with a huge volume of customer inquiries myself. This past year alone, I answered around 8,000 emails from Carbliss distributors, retailers, consumers and fans.Ongoing candid dialogue is critical for comprehensively understanding how customers perceive our brand identity, product qualities, and customer service experiences in an unfiltered way.


Through raw, unapologetic honesty in these interactions, even when the facts may be unfavorable or unpleasant for the customer to accept, we actively cultivate invaluable trust. The simple truth is that you cannot build enduring customer loyalty through automated and impersonal responses or convoluted corporate jargon.Related: Don't Talk to Another Customer Until You Learn This Simple Customer Service Secret2. Shining light on complexitiesEmbracing this level of radical transparency means being prepared sometimes to face intense scrutiny from confused, perhaps deflated customers seeking simpler truths. We've found that the payoff is an extraordinarily powerful brand reputation anchored in truth that ultimately breeds sacred trust and loyalty.At my company, we willingly spotlight the very details that other brands may conceal or try to downplay, like our need to use ""artificially colored"" labels on cans despite the colors being derived from natural sources, like the brilliant blue of butterfly pea flowers.


We take every opportunity to explain the nuances of regulatory complexities that result in obligatory technical labeling jargon. We balance that by reaffirming our core principles of prioritizing high-quality ingredients that we legitimately consume ourselves and provide to friends and family without hesitation.3. A culture of authenticityAs you grow and scale, it's important to maintain transparency throughout your team. This can be in the form of understanding the intricacies of the product, the runway to profitability, or the purpose of their unique role in the overall strategy. Our employees, regardless of role, deeply understand the ingredients, sourcing, and production methods behind our products so they can convey that knowledge accurately and credibly in their customer-interactions activities.Our detailed FAQ content clarifies common misconceptions, from our avoidance of artificial colors to our premium pricing rationale based on operational costs and premium product positioning. While some buyers may be dismayed at certain realities we present, we insist on honesty because we've learned it's the only path to fostering long-term customer understanding, respect and allegiance.Related: How to Lead With Authenticity and Build a Thriving Workplace


4. Transparent best practicesFor companies in any industry aspiring to foster powerful brand loyalty by operating in total transparency, below are my personal principles:Be unconditionally open about all business practices by prioritizing clear, forthright communication with customers at every opportunityHave customer-interaction teams be prepared to personally respond to every inquiry with unvarnished candor, excluding no unpleasant truthsThoroughly educate and train all employees on the paramount importance of authenticity in all their customer-interaction words and actions.Embrace both positive and negative customer feedback as a welcome opportunity to demonstrate a real commitment to constant improvement.Ensure all marketing content and messaging accurately reflects the true nature of your products, services, and practices without ambiguity.Be unafraid to openly discuss your company's genuine challenges, as this humanizes the brand relationship.Related: 5 Examples of Companies Succeeding Through TransparencyWeathering backlash to cultivate loyaltyCertainly, this radical embrace of transparency sometimes means facing backlash from those who are displeased with newly revealed information that clashes with their expectations. Cultivated ironclad trust and loyalty far outweigh any short-term friction. When you deal truthfully and withhold nothing from your customers, you attract buyers aligned with your values who appreciate your courage and unwavering integrity.If you're ready to foster true customer loyalty and propel sustainable growth, it's time to embrace radical transparency across your organization. Don't complicate realities; shine a light on every aspect of your products, operations, and business practices. Deal in truth relentlessly, even when facing scrutiny. Your authentic soul and unwavering integrity will attract devoted brand advocates aligned with your values.

4,"Building a Culture of Quality — How to Ensure Your Products, Processes and Teams Meet the Highest Standards","Apr 16, 2024",Itzik Elbaz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-build-a-culture-of-quality-in-your-organization/472014,"
How do you judge the quality of a product, organization or business? I recently heard a story about someone from the hospitality industry. He would enter a hotel lobby and head towards the public restrooms. If they were clean and in good condition, the hotel would get his seal of approval. What's the rationale behind the toilet test? Many hotels will make an effort with their lobby and their rooms, but the shared restrooms are a relatively hidden part of the building that many guests will never see.The theory goes that if the hotel staff are making an effort to keep even its public bathrooms clean, you can safely assume the hotel is in good shape overall. In the words of Henry Ford, ""Quality means doing it right when no one is looking."" Quality matters to all of us. We think about it in decisions we make every day, particularly if we're thinking about buying a product. And the higher the price, the more important quality becomes — you have to justify that premium. As business owners, we need to build trust with our customers in the quality of our products so they will make the decision to choose our offerings.So, how do you ensure that the quality of your products meets the highest standards? It starts with building a culture of quality in your organization. If you focus on quality in every aspect of your organization, from the people to the processes, to the work environment and beyond, you'll be well-placed to create a high-quality product and a superior overall experience for your customers.



Related: Discover How Product Quality Can Distinguish Your Brand From CompetitorsDefining quality in your organizationIt's important to spend some time thinking about how your company defines quality in order to hold yourself accountable to that high standard. There are some areas where this is easier than others. For example, all developers know that they need to avoid ""spaghetti code"" — disorganized coding that's hard for other developers to read, understand and fix if needed. You need to write your code in a clear, clean and organized way, aligned with your internal R&D standards so that anyone can quickly understand it and edit it in the future.


With areas like content, where quality is much more subjective, you need to create and deploy clear company guidelines. For example, you can create a design system and a brand book to maintain a consistent quality of your design and text assets across your product and marketing materials.You'll also need to define quality for specific domains that are relevant to your company. Early on in building our business, we had to create a standard for songs in our catalog. We identified three areas to focus on: technical (the mixing and mastering), the production, and a comparison with similar music externally. Each of these areas was further defined to make sure that our entire music team would be able to evaluate music in a similar way and maintain the standard.Creating an environment that supports qualityQuality is in the details, and that also goes for your work environment. The right lighting, temperature and furniture can make a big difference to your employees' comfort, concentration and productivity. And there are many other areas where you can focus on getting the details right. For example, the overall cleanliness of the office, the produce in your kitchens, your company events and even branded merch. When quality is felt in every aspect of your organization, you create a culture.It's also essential to create an atmosphere that supports continuous improvement. By providing your teams with actionable data and an environment that encourages people to act based on these insights, you'll empower them to raise the quality of their results and your organization as a whole. By supporting measured risk-taking, you'll energize people to try new things and learn from their successes and mistakes. They'll then implement what they've learned into their work, elevating the quality and giving them a sense of personal development and fulfillment. And this matters.


In general, people want to feel that they're doing good work. So, if you create a culture of quality, it makes people feel like they're doing quality work, which in turn makes them proud of their work. This makes them perform better, which makes your product and brand better. And the effect trickles down everywhere.A quality product makes customer support better as well — their job is easier as they're able to stand behind the product with confidence, and they get fewer tickets.Related: Why Quality Over Quantity Matters When You're Scaling a BusinessBuilding teams and processes with quality at the centerIf a team has one standout star performer, it creates a bottleneck. You need to build teams with a level of quality that's evenly spread so that if people are sick or on vacation, you don't miss them or feel the need to stop work. Here it comes back to your definition of quality, which should also apply to your employees. You need to make sure that you hire people who fit your definition, to have fantastic teams, not star solo performers.


Quality is also measured in the places your customers won't see, such as your processes. Rigorous quality assurance (QA) needs to be built into every aspect of your workflow. Encouraging peer-to-peer QA inside teams has the added benefit of helping people grow and develop based on feedback from their colleagues.If we apply the hotel restroom example to a SaaS company, I think the equivalent is their customer service. I look at what channels are available to contact them, how long it takes them to respond and the way they communicate in their replies. These interactions give you an indication of the quality of the company. Consider that for every person who complains, there are probably hundreds, or even thousands, who have the same frustrations but don't have the energy to reach out.Related: Why Establishing High Expectations Is a Quality of Good LeadershipIn conclusion, quality drives impact. By giving your users the best content, tools and experience, you'll build a sustainable brand with quality at the center. It's important early on in the development of your business to define what it means in the context of your organization and to align the whole team. It's something you'll need to track and measure, and you will probably need to update your definition as you grow.


By focusing on quality, you'll have better people working with better processes and creating a better product. You'll be able to be more agile and adjust to new challenges and opportunities. And best of all, you'll have happier customers who'll trust your brand and become your biggest advocates.

5,"How to Leverage Business Awards to Foster Innovation, Build Your Brand and Retain Top Talent","Apr 15, 2024",Mike Szczesny,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-leverage-business-awards-for-innovation-and-growth/472270,"
The traditional mechanisms of business recognition are undergoing a transformative renaissance. Today, as organizations navigate through the complexities of digital transformation, environmental sustainability and corporate social responsibility, the criteria and modalities of business awards have adapted to reflect these new priorities. This shift underscores the increasing significance of such honors in promoting innovation, recognizing excellence and providing companies with a competitive edge that resonates with modern consumers and investors alike.A 2023 Pew Research Center survey revealed that a significant portion of workers see diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as positive, with variations across demographic and partisan lines. Such statistics can underscore the growing importance of DEI initiatives as integral components of business recognition and honors, highlighting how companies are being acknowledged not just for financial performance but for fostering inclusive and equitable work environments.Historically, business awards were often based solely on financial metrics and market share. However, the past decade has witnessed a seismic shift toward a more holistic approach. Awards now frequently incorporate criteria such as innovation, sustainability, diversity and inclusion, and social impact.



A prime example is the B Corp Certification, which evaluates companies on their overall social and environmental performance, public transparency and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose. This recognition has spurred a movement toward more ethical business practices, influencing companies worldwide to reassess their operations and strategies.Related: Redefining Business In The Modern Era: The B Corp Movement And The Quest For Authentic Sustainability


Measuring the impact of awards on businessesThe evolution of business honors has had a profound impact on companies across the globe. For instance, being listed on the Fortune 500 has always been prestigious, but newer accolades like Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies list or Forbes' Just 100 ranking of America's best corporate citizens play a significant role in shaping corporate identities and consumer perceptions today. These awards validate a company's efforts in innovation and corporate responsibility but also enhance its reputation, attract talent and open doors to new partnerships and customer segments.Take the example of Patagonia, a brand that has been consistently recognized for its commitment to sustainability and ethical practices. This recognition has bolstered its brand reputation and been a key driver in attracting a loyal customer base that values environmental stewardship.Similarly, technology giants like Google and Apple frequently top the lists of most innovative companies, reinforcing their status as leaders in technology and design thinking. This recognition serves as a testament to their commitment to pushing the boundaries of what is possible, attracting top talent and securing their position at the forefront of technological advancement.Related: If You Want to Build the Next Patagonia, Here's What Not to Do: 'We Realized We Were Turning Everybody Off'


Finding new ways to show gratitude for excellenceYou don't have to be a big brand with a boardroom to leverage and implement innovative recognition practices across various aspects of business honors. As the owner and vice president of an awards company that creates a multitude of employee recognition products, I've seen a lot of creative ways to bring innovation into the equation. Here are a few places to start:1. Embed innovation into corporate culture:Encourage a culture of continuous improvement and innovation within your organization. Recognize and reward employees who contribute innovative ideas or improvements, regardless of their department or role. This can be through innovation-specific awards or acknowledgments during team meetings.To that end, choose to participate in awards that align with your company's strategic goals and values. Winning such awards can boost your brand's reputation in specific areas, whether it's sustainability, technology, customer service or community involvement. This alignment ensures that the recognition you receive advances your overall business objectives.


Digital transformation solutions provider UST is a great example of a company that has successfully embedded innovation into its corporate culture. Recognized by the Business Culture Awards for the fourth consecutive year, UST has demonstrated excellence in fostering a culture of sustainability and inclusivity, alongside innovation. They've won accolades for being the Best Large Organization in Business Culture and for their initiatives to build a culture of innovation. Additionally, their leadership and collaborative team efforts have been recognized, further underscoring their commitment to positive societal impact and corporate success.2. Create internal recognition programs:Beyond external honors, develop internal recognition programs that celebrate small wins and major milestones. This could range from employee of the month awards to innovation challenges. Internal recognition programs can motivate your team and foster a positive workplace environment.A standout company with an excellent internal recognition program is Cisco. Its ""Connected Recognition"" program is notable because it's funded at 1% of the company's payroll, which allows for substantial rewards as employees nominate their peers and managers for various accolades. This program showcases how peer-to-peer recognition can foster a positive work environment and contribute to a sense of community and appreciation among staff.


Make sure to involve your employees in the nomination process for both internal and external awards. This can increase engagement and give employees a sense of ownership and pride in their workplace, enhancing team spirit and collaboration.3. Reflect and build upon your wins:Use each award as a stepping stone for further improvement. Reflect on what contributed to the win and how you can build upon this success. This approach ensures continuous improvement while keeping your team motivated and focused on achieving more.There are organizations like the Management and Strategy Institute which issue Continuous Improvement Awards. These awards recognize individuals and organizations that demonstrate a commitment to the principles of continuous improvement. The Organizational Continuous Improvement Award, for example, is presented to organizations that not only streamline processes but also invest in change management, long-term strategies and professional development.


Related: How to Leverage Industry Awards in Your Marketing StrategyRemember, awards often offer networking opportunities with fellow nominees, awardees and judges. Take advantage of these opportunities to build relationships, share best practices and even explore potential partnerships. And try to stay updated on industry trends and new award opportunities that may arise. Being among the first to apply for or win a newly established award can position your company as a leader and innovator in your industry.The continuous celebration of excellence and innovation through these honors encourages organizations to strive for a higher standard, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and sustainable growth. In this way, business honors inspire a future where innovation, responsibility and excellence remain at the forefront of the corporate agenda. By adopting these strategies, companies can effectively leverage awards and recognitions to foster innovation, build their brand and create a positive work environment that attracts and retains top talent.

6,"This Emergency Room Doctor Has Seen It All — And in Moments of Failure, He Shares The 2 Things That Help Him Start Again","Apr 15, 2024",Jon B. Becker,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-a-trauma-doctors-death-ritual-can-change-your/471605,"
If you are an emergency room physician, death and the fear of failure are constant companions. A countdown timer starts when a patient arrives with a fatal wound or condition. If that timer reaches zero, the patient will die. If it is prevented from reaching zero, the patient will survive and live to fight another day.It is literally a race against the clock, and the role of the ER physician is to battle that timer directly through medical interventions that either solve the problem or keep the patient alive long enough for a trauma surgeon, interventional cardiologist or other specialist to solve the issue that is killing them.As you might imagine, when the ER staff wins that fight and saves a life, it is a fantastic feeling, but when they fail and lose a patient, it is devastating. Worse yet is when they lose a patient who could have been saved because they either made an error or did not have the required resources to save the person. Every ER Doctor has memories of the patients that they lost. In fact, a requirement for a long and healthy career in emergency medicine is the ability to find peace with this notion.



I recently had the opportunity to spend time with Dr. Dan Dworkis, an ER physician, Professor at the USC Keck School of Medicine, Medical Director of the Mission Critical Teams Institute, Podcast host and the author of The Emergency Mind. Dan has spent his career working in emergency rooms. In fact, not just emergency rooms but a busy trauma center in Los Angeles.As you might imagine, Dan has seen it all and, as a result, carries the stories and memories that come with working at a hospital that is frequented by children who have been shot, traumatic car accidents and people with life-threatening injuries and illnesses.


Dan has spent a big part of his career studying how we make decisions under stress, how to operate in high-stress environments and how to create a culture of continuous improvement. Not surprisingly, I learned a lot from Dan. But, by far, the most profound thing I learned from Dan was a unique way to approach failure and, in the process, open ourselves up to growth and learning.Related: The 5 Key Qualities of a Good LeaderThe ritual: Learning by embracing lossAs you can imagine, trauma physicians see quite a bit of death. No matter how good a doctor you are, you will lose patients, and some of those people certainly could have been saved with different skills or different resources. It would be easy to simply block yourself off from these feelings, to harden your heart, and to put these bad experiences into a mental box that you lock away. While this might not be great for your mental health, it is certainly a seemingly easier thing than confronting these memories and feelings. Yet, Dan actually advocates doing the complete opposite, leaning into the failure and attacking it directly.When a patient dies, there is an awkward moment immediately afterward where the team that treated the patient must transition away from that fight and move on to another. Despite just a few minutes before waging a war to save their life, the team must move on from this person. Machines must be turned off, tubes and wires removed, and each team member must emotionally reset and get back to work.


It would be easy at that point to block the feelings and doubts that arise, place them in a box and move on to the next task while hoping never to think about those feelings again. But that is not what Dan does or advocates. Instead, he engages in a ritual that he was taught as a young doctor, which is to gather the team at the bedside of the patient, place a hand on the deceased patient, and utter the following phrase: ""Thank you for teaching me. I am sorry that all I could do for you today was learn.""This seemingly simple act and brief statement is more than just a ritual to clear the mind before moving on. Instead, it is a deeply profound approach to situations where we cannot succeed and lays a strong foundation for learning and growth.Related: 2 Phrases I Learned From a Senior CIA Officer That Changed My Leadership StyleEmbracing failureThe first significant thing that this ritual does is acknowledge and embrace failure. Rather than moving on and pretending that something profoundly negative didn't just happen, this ritual looks failure square in the eye and leans into the discomfort of the situation. It embraces failure and immediately triggers the learning process.


The first step to growth is the recognition and admission that what we currently do or know is not sufficient. To learn from others, we have to accept our own shortcomings, and this practice opens the door to that and to discovering something better. If we do not admit to our shortcomings, we cannot improve, and this is precisely the point of this ritual.Simply look at the phrase, ""Thank you for teaching me. I am sorry that all I could do for you today was learn."" By its nature, it says I failed you today, and I wish I had more to give. It doesn't say, ""It's too bad you died,"" or ""Wow, rough break you got."" It says, ""I am sorry."" It embraces that the team didn't have enough to save the person (and to be fair, no one may have been able to save them), but simply that acknowledgment doesn't go far enough. Rather, it says I ""learned from you."" It implicitly says, ""I will be better next time"" and ""I am growing and improving my skills."" It is active, not passive, and immediately takes the first step toward learning. ConclusionA profound lesson extends far beyond the medical field and this single ritual to all of us. Whether you are an entrepreneur, a business leader, or even a parent, creating a culture of learning from mistakes and continuous improvement is critical to getting better. We should never run from our errors or try to hide them. We should embrace our failures and view them as perfect opportunities to grow. By establishing a process that immediately addresses our failures or shortcomings, we also immediately focus our attention on how we can improve, where we have deficiencies and perhaps most importantly, we immediately begin the process of learning and growth.

7,"When Customers Balked at High Prices, This Bubble Tea Maker Educated Them About Quality Ingredients. Now His Flea Market Stand Has Turned Into 3 Permanent Locations.","Apr 15, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-his-company-grew-from-a-flea-market-stand-to-3-locations/472688,"
Mathew Wong, owner of Tea and Milk, initially struggled to meet high costs and customer demand when building his New York City bubble tea business. But by educating his customers and providing quality products, he transformed a single shop into a well-known, values-based brand.The shop's original 10-by-10-foot space at the Long Island Flea Market has given way to three permanent locations across New York City, including storefronts in Chelsea Market, Brooklyn, and Astoria. In the process, Mathew built out a centralized kitchen for sandwich making, an event catering service, and a huge community of boba lovers.Related: The Counter Service at Yo' Mama's Is Just As Unique As Its Name. Here's Why People Come Back for the Experience as Much as the Food.



One of the biggest keys to success for Tea and Milk is their focus on integrity. Mathew and his business partners travel to Asia to source and learn more about their ingredients, visiting tea farms to learn about everything from the tea-making and manufacturing process to the ceremonies that celebrate the cultural role of the ancient drink. Mathew then uses his travel experiences to educate his customers about the products so they feel good about their purchases.Even though Mathew and his team believe in the importance of well-sourced ingredients, the right tea leaves can be quite expensive, and they've had to learn to work around the rising cost of goods.


Mathew reads all of Tea and Milk's financial statements to keep up with margins. His background in accounting has taught him that even though it can be overwhelming to face discouraging numbers head-on, it's crucial to understand how your business is performing so you can make necessary adjustments.""[If] you're reading a [profit and loss statement] and it's scaring you, it's very likely because you're not doing something that you need to do, such as marketing, educating the customers, training your staff,"" Mathew said. ""You need to have standard operating procedures in order to push forward. There's no other way around it.""Related: The Little Coffee Shop That Asks Customers Not to Be QuietIn terms of educating customers, one of Tea and Milk's biggest obstacles is that customers often aren't used to the taste of premium ingredients, so the more they know about the product, the more likely they'll be satisfied with their purchase. This goes hand in hand with getting to know customers' preferences as well.


""We want [customers] to trust the brand,"" Mathew said. ""So [when you] order something that you didn't like, you get something else that you do like. Then you build trust with that person, and eventually, maybe [they'll] try it again.""Despite the challenges that using authentic ingredients has posed, Mathew sees his products as a worthwhile investment. He has situated his shops intentionally across the city to fill gaps in bubble tea offerings in several New York neighborhoods.""We go into neighborhoods that we believe are starving for a certain type of brand. We saw Bay Ridge (Brooklyn), we saw what it was lacking, and we wanted to go in there to be the brand that can offer something different.""He encourages customers to support the local businesses in their neighborhood however they can. If you're not able to spend money at a local spot you enjoy, writing a review or telling your friends to visit can have a lasting impact.


""If you want the business to stay, you have to help support in a way,"" Mathew said.Mathew is a big believer in the power of acknowledging and engaging with customer feedback. While critical reviews can sting, he makes sure to respond to as many as he can to show that he cares about his customers, commenting back in a timely manner while giving himself room to cool off if he needs it.He also encourages business owners to lean on friends and partners for support. Having started Tea and Milk with two of his friends and now operating the business with a co-owner and general manager, Mathew finds it invaluable to have people to brainstorm with about new ideas and improvements. He has also built a network of other small business owners for conversations about business challenges and potential collaborations.Related: How This California Hot Spot Grew From Delivery-Only to Pop-Up Shop to Storefront


""There's always going to be times where people don't agree. But at the end of the day, you have to be very open to these conversations,"" Mathew said. ""The type of people who want to be in your ecosystem will always be there.""In addition to the importance of authentic ingredients and products, Tea and Milk believes in:Staying on top of your schedule and finances.

9,Here's How Business Leaders Can Cultivate Happiness in the Workplace,"Apr 12, 2024",Adam Markel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-leaders-can-cultivate-happiness-in-the-workplace/472123,"
To improve workplace well-being, businesses are implementing new techniques to encourage employee satisfaction. These innovative strategies prioritize inclusive activities that support a happier and more satisfying workplace because they recognize the critical relationship between productivity and a positive work environment.Learn some of these progressive tactics business owners use to promote a more joyful and productive work environment. This article offers doable strategies for establishing a happy workplace, from developing a supportive atmosphere to putting well-being initiatives into place.Related: 3 Proven Ways to Keep Employees Happy



The link between happiness and workplace productivityProductivity and job happiness have a proven relationship that is important to organizational effectiveness. Studies have indicated that contented workers demonstrate increased levels of involvement, innovation and efficiency.Individuals are more likely to perform at their peak in a supportive work environment that promotes independence, interpersonal relationships and a sense of purpose. Reduced stress, increased job satisfaction and enhanced morale all have a direct impact on productivity and are linked to the general pleasure and well-being of employees.


Promoting independence in the workplace is about empowering employees to make decisions and take actions that align with the company's goals and values. One effective strategy is implementing a decentralized decision-making process. This approach involves delegating authority to individuals and teams closer to the action, rather than maintaining a top-down hierarchy.Building strong interpersonal relationships among team members is another cornerstone of a thriving business. One tactic that has proven successful is fostering a culture of open communication and feedback. Encouraging regular, honest dialogue between employees at all levels of the organization helps to break down barriers, build trust and strengthen team cohesion.Instilling a sense of purpose in your employees is about connecting their day-to-day work to the larger mission and impact of the company. One way to achieve this is through storytelling. Sharing stories of how your products or services have positively impacted customers or communities can inspire and motivate your team. It humanizes the work they do, making it more meaningful and rewarding.Teams and productivity all increase when employers put their employees' health and welfare first. Investing in employee well-being benefits not only the employees but also the business overall, whether it be through chances for professional development, assistance with leadership or a happy work atmosphere.Building a positive workplace cultureEstablishing a joyful and productive work environment requires the promotion of a positive work culture. A positive work culture is characterized by open communication, mutual respect and a shared commitment to fundamental values. The first stage in the process is to have strong leadership that exhibits transparency, compassion and a genuine concern for the well-being of coworkers.Below are some of the other effective tactics business owners can implement to build a positive work culture:Recognition and appreciation:Acknowledge and appreciate employees' hard work and achievements regularly. Implement employee recognition programs to highlight outstanding contributions.Inclusive environment:Promote diversity and inclusion within the workplace. Create an environment where everyone feels valued and respected.Flexible work arrangements:Offer flexible work schedules or remote work options when possible. Support a healthy work-life balance for employees.Professional development:Provide opportunities for ongoing learning and skill development. Invest in training programs that help employees grow in their careers.Collaborative team environment:Encourage teamwork and collaboration among employees. Foster a sense of camaraderie through team-building activities.Social events and celebrations:Organize social events and celebrations to build a sense of community. Mark milestones and achievements with positive and enjoyable activities.Fair and consistent policies:Ensure that policies are fair, consistent and applied equally to all employees. Address issues promptly and consistently.Related: 12 Ways Happiness Increases Productivity in the Work EnvironmentThe importance of implementing well-being programsImplementing well-being initiatives and programs is a smart investment that comes with a lot of advantages both for businesses and employees alike. These activities, which range from fitness programs to mental health support, help promote a positive work atmosphere.Organizations can improve overall morale, lower stress levels and increase job satisfaction by placing a high priority on employee well-being. Tools like wellness seminars, counseling services and flexible work schedules show a dedication to the overall well-being of employees.


Furthermore, well-being programs frequently boost employee output while lowering absenteeism, which creates a more resilient and engaged team.Measuring and sustaining workplace happinessEnsuring employee well-being and organizational performance depends heavily on measuring and maintaining workplace happiness. Metrics like productivity, retention rates and employee satisfaction surveys can be used to gather important information about how satisfied people are in general.Business owners can quickly address complaints and come up with development opportunities when they have regular feedback channels in place. A happy and rewarding work environment is facilitated by the implementation of sustainable practices, such as professional development opportunities, flexible work schedules and recognition initiatives. Sustaining workplace happiness requires persistent efforts to promote transparent leadership, open communication and a supportive company culture.Related: 3 Ways to Establish a Positive Company Culture


Businesses can see gains in morale, engagement and productivity by implementing innovative strategies to foster a happy work environment. Happiness and productivity are related in so many ways, from developing a healthy workplace culture to implementing well-being initiatives.In the end, putting employee satisfaction first is not only a wise strategic move, but it is also a key factor in the success of the company as a whole.

10,The 3 Keys Needed to Improve Your Employee Loyalty and Retention,"Apr 12, 2024",Tripp Westbrook,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-keys-needed-to-improve-employee-loyalty-and-retention/472129,"
We recently won the Ad Age Best Places to Work award for the first time. After the shock, surprise and overzealous company celebrations, it got me thinking — how the heck did that happen? Well, looking back, it wasn't by accident.This award means so much to us because, unlike prizes for creatives, it comes directly from employees. To even be considered for the award (we were in the category of 200 employees or fewer), over 75% of people have to rate their satisfaction with pay, benefits, culture and leadership extremely high. To me, winning left no doubt that the people who walk the halls with us every day are feeling satisfied and fulfilled.Reflecting on our success, I recognized that it was a silver lining from COVID. At that time, we asked people what help they needed to get through the pandemic and then provided them with real support. But what we did next may underlie why we went from being placed in the top 25 the previous two years to ranking first in 2024: As we emerged from the pandemic, we kept asking questions, we kept listening, and have been doing so ever since.



Related: Is Your Leadership Team Failing Your Employees?1. Set up listening mechanismsThe lessons of this experience are worth sharing not just for the productivity gains of an engaged workforce but because these are the folks we put an arm around when they are having a tough day — we care about them. After ranking the top three to five things that mattered to our employees, we ended up giving stipends to set up home offices and covered mental health care completely. We also polled people on when they wanted to come back to the office and what form that should take — hybrid or completely remote.


We wanted our employees' participation because they were the ones who had to live the solution. As a business owner, assessing if we could afford the costs involved was a simple equation: Is it more expensive to provide for the people who work for us now or to replace them later? There are challenging and soft costs to training, recruitment and delays as work gets shifted while someone is replaced. Frankly, the decision was easy: We did what we could to make them happy.When leaders set up mechanisms to find out what employees need, people feel a sense of ownership in the outcome. We have since overhauled our parental leave policy so that birth mothers get 12 weeks and birth fathers get six weeks; we now cover adoption fees and give adoptive parents leave, too. Now, we ask human-centered questions on a regular basis. The design is to foster a culture where both employee and employer are looking out for the needs of the other.Related: How Listening Can Help You Build a Culture of Trust in Your Business2. Align communication and actionCOVID was a great wake-up call, particularly for larger organizations, that employers couldn't expect one-way loyalty. Culture, rather than compensation, is a much bigger predictor of turnover, so people need to feel heard, and leaders need to explain the thinking behind their decisions. Employees value leaders who listen and act substantively, not just performatively.


Of course, any action leaders take is not going to make everyone happy. So when you take steps to implement an initiative, be clear about the intention behind it — the benefits. We have also found that people ought to be reminded of how the company is helping them (""Don't forget to take advantage of x"") because they're not always top of mind.Our controller, Marla, keeps a running list of all the things we do for employees, big and small. If it's important enough to implement, it's important enough to record. But it doesn't end there. The other major piece of engagement is keeping an open line of communication and feedback.3. When in doubt, state your intentionAs a manager, don't view employees' raising issues as ""chirping"" — those issues matter to them. However, we do have to find a balance between entertaining their concerns and not enabling a culture of complaint. It requires knowing when you have heard enough of the same issue to escalate it for action.We also have to make sure we're really communicating, not just throwing information out there. To that end, we have put our leadership group through training focused on understanding personality and communication styles and showing how people receive and interpret information differently.


I'm a perfect example: A creative person by heart, I tend to be very off the cuff and feed off my audiences. But we have leaders who process information in a very logical, process-centered way. In the past, these differing styles may have produced misunderstanding, even conflict. The key is making it a practice to state the intent behind your communication at the beginning of meetings.If a leader states upfront, ""I intend to share my experience, not be critical,"" it defuses what might be interpreted as low-key criticism. This process allows people to give and receive grace for how they communicate. So, when in doubt, state your intention. While we have evolved this kind of transparent leadership over time, we are now enjoying the open, vibrant workplace culture it has created.Related: How to Build a Company Culture That Retains Loyal EmployeesBalancing the employer-employee relationshipThe dynamic between employers and employees has shifted often since COVID. Still, hopefully, we're coming to a place where people can find fulfillment at work while giving companies the resources they need. We have seen that a lot of the folks who prefer remote or contract work are starting to miss the in-person camaraderie and unscheduled moments that help us learn and be better. The irony is that creating an even better environment for that to occur was facilitated by the challenges of the pandemic. In our experience, if organizations listen well and find the right balance for both parties, the rewards will follow.

11,HR Could Be Withholding The Critical Data You Need to Boost Retention and Drive Results. Here's How to Take Control and Gain Access,"Apr 10, 2024",Ryan Wong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/hr-could-be-withholding-the-critical-data-you-need-to-drive/472002,"
Have you ever waited longer than you'd hoped for a package? You've experienced the proverbial ""last mile"" problem. A parcel zips all the way across the country, but then somehow, it gets stranded at the post office a few blocks from your home — so close, but still out of reach.To borrow a term from the field of logistics, HR departments have a ""last mile"" problem, too, and it's just as frustrating. Companies are generating more people data than ever — insights about everything from how employees work best to ways to boost retention — but that intel isn't getting into the hands of the managers who need it most when it's needed.For example, let's say a manager needs to know what kind of raise to give a valued employee. The clock is ticking. HR has relevant data, but often, it takes weeks for someone to tally industry averages and cross-reference the employee's specifics. In a fast-moving business environment where competition for top talent is scarce, companies can't afford such delays, which can end up impacting the bottom line.



Related: A Practical Guide to Increasing Startup Success Through Data AnalyticsThat lag reflects a broader sluggishness in getting people's data into the right hands. A recent global survey found that about three out of four companies are driving business innovation with data. But less than half have created a data-driven organization, the key to unlocking insights about people, their most precious resource.


As the co-founder of a business that helps companies use people's data to drive results, I know there's a better way. Here's why the last mile problem exists and how businesses can solve it to ensure timely delivery of HR data that makes an impact.What's behind HR's last mile problem?The fundamental reason HR data doesn't travel that last mile: It's languishing in silos.Essentially, there's a wall between HR and the rest of the company. Many HR departments hoard their people data, on the grounds that it's personal and confidential. At large companies, this siloing problem even happens within HR itself. Recruiting, talent management, compliance, learning and development, compensation — all have their own data fiefdoms.To make things worse, that data may not be very meaningful to anyone except HR pros. Even when it is shared, it often lacks context and is hard to interpret. That's partly because it's rife with HR jargon, not framed in the language the rest of the business speaks. Don't know what utilization analysis is, or featherbedding, or negligent referral? You're not alone.


Even familiar concepts like turnover rates can be confusing or misleading in the absence of context. HR might report that your department has a 10% turnover rate. Sounds terrible — but is it really? How does that compare to competitors? Is it impacting revenue or performance? The underlying problem: data is shared in the language of HR, not the language of business.Companies that lack the ability to connect HR data with business impact risk falling behind. Over a three-year period, businesses that made sophisticated use of people analytics reported more than 80% higher average profits than their less data-savvy peers.How to solve HR's last mile problem Getting over HR's last mile hurdle calls for both a culture and technology shift.Culturally, HR leaders need education around the idea that using people analytics doesn't mean sharing personal information — far from it. In fact, the data in question can be readily aggregated and anonymized, so nothing sensitive gets divulged.


It's also essential to drive home the message that HR's contributions can and should go well beyond compliance and administration. After all, people are a company's biggest line item and greatest resource. HR is ideally positioned to help connect the dots between talent and results.Technology can help, too, especially when it comes to getting the right insights in the right hands. Believe it or not, many companies still rely on old-fashioned charts and spreadsheets to manage HR data. I've seen how this creates challenges for frontline managers, many of whom lack the time, training or inclination to sit down and crunch numbers.The good news is that new generative AI technology is finally helping liberate that data. Using the latest tools, managers can quickly find the answers they need by asking a question in plain English. Is an employee being paid fairly? Rather than poring over a dense chart or waiting for a data analyst to weigh in, managers can get answers in real-time, with data specific to their company and the employee in question, along with industry benchmarks.Finally, the best companies find ways to integrate people data into the rhythms and routines of daily company culture. Instead of quarterly blasts, they share insights with decision-makers on a consistent basis, whether it's weekly or monthly. They're selective, tailoring reports to the department or business need in question, and they put the data in context by telling the story behind it in business language. If turnover will be 10% this year, what does that number mean for the company, and how does it stack up against the competition?


Related: Using Data Analytics Will Transform Your Business. Here's How.The payoff for closing the last mileWhen people data gets where it needs to go, fast, the entire organization benefits.HR can now focus on the ""art"" of the profession rather than rote, time-consuming requests for information that can easily be handled by analytics tools. That means fewer hours spent on admin, compliance and tickets — and more time for the people who drive the business.Managers get the information they need when they need it. For instance, they can use people analytics to find out who's most likely to leave the company before it actually happens. Thanks to today's generative AI tools, which many executives see as a profit booster, that's no longer a guessing game. Ask, and you get a straight answer about individual employees' engagement levels based on data pulled from chat, email, calendars and other workplace apps.


For the business at large, fixing HR's last mile problem equates to a sea change in efficiency and performance. Talent decisions can be made in real time, not months (or even years) too late. Best guesses and gut instinct give way to data-backed insights. Ultimately, the ability to draw a straight line from people to business results boosts customer satisfaction, employee retention and the bottom line.Granted, we're not there yet. Institutional biases linger — from HR's warehouse mentality toward data to frontline managers' aversion to being analyzed and judged.Wariness of AI is another potential blocker, especially in the context of privacy and misinformation — areas where the right guardrails are essential. (At my company, for example, we do ethics testing of our generative AI tools to ensure that their guidance is free of racial and other bias.)Ultimately, however, solving HR's last mile problem is well within reach. We have the data. We have the tools to share it safely and responsibly. Now, it's time to get it into the hands of the leaders who need it most.

12,Employees Are Burning Out — and the Culprit Isn't What You Think,"Apr 9, 2024",Rob Cross,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/employees-are-burning-out-and-the-culprit-isnt-what/471340,"
Imagine you're headed home from work, unwinding by listening to your favorite podcast. Your phone chimes with an email from your boss. They want you to revamp a slide deck. Rather than resting, you spend the evening working and come into work the next day fried.All of us have encountered this kind of microstress — a term I coined with my co-author, Karen Dillon, in our recent book ""The Microstress Effect."" Microstressors are small but stressful moments that add up to harm our health, work performance and personal lives. Data suggests that these small negative interactions are up to five times more impactful than positive ones.Very stressful events trigger our brains' fight-or-flight mode, a response that helps us identify and deal with stress. But microstressors are minor enough that our brains don't always notice them, even as our bodies produce stress hormones like cortisol. Research suggests that microstressors can accumulate in our bodies. Our brains then pick up on the fact that something's wrong, but without always knowing what's responsible for our mood.



Microstress helps explain why employees are so burnt out. As a professor at Babson College who has studied the workplace for decades, I believe every company needs to tackle microstress if it wants to reduce burnout and boost productivity. Here are three ways you can reduce stress in your organization.Related: I Was Experiencing Extreme Burnout Until I Practiced These 3 Things to Come Out Stronger


Reject ""toughing it out""High-performing people are used to toughing it out. Push through the next deadline, convince yourself it will ease off after that and repeat as another deadline emerges. But no one can work at a perpetual sprint without sacrifice. I've spoken to some executives who worked their way to exorbitant wealth at the cost of multiple divorces and ruptured relations with their children.Toughing it out also falsely assumes that working longer and harder means working better. This isn't always true. My research suggests that we spend up to 85% of our time on collaborative work — from check-ins to project meetings to all-hands and more. We can cut down on that time and boost output by being more intentional and efficient in how we collaborate.Reject a culture of toughing it out in favor of one that focuses on working smarter. And recognize that burnt-out employees innovate less and are more likely to leave their jobs.Related: How I Pulled Myself Out of Burnout and Turned My Ambitions Into Reality


Identify and target microstress through team interventionsMessages from the top signal organizational priorities. But the best place to address microstress is at the team level.I recently worked with a group of employees to tackle microstress. Each Monday, the employees emailed me describing a new microstressor they wanted to focus on that week. Maybe a colleague was asking for too much help on projects. Maybe their boss kept shifting expectations. Maybe family obligations were creating too much pressure. On Fridays, they sent me an update on their progress in tackling that microstressor.For three weeks, I noticed only incremental movement. But in week four, employees began to see how working to control microstressors could make a big impact in their lives. There are three important lessons from these experiments:First, awareness of microstress can help us solve it. Employees need examples, a list they can look at and say, ""Oh, yeah, I know that feeling!"" In my work, we used ""The Microstress Effect"" app, which catalogs different sources of microstress.


Second, because microstress consists of dozens of small things, don't try to solve everything at once. Reducing stress shouldn't cause more stress. Take microstressors one at a time and begin with an easier one — not the most impactful — to build momentum.Third, microstress should be addressed at the team level. Teammates should be paired up in groups to generate ideas for actions to reduce microstress, as well as to build accountability by updating one another about their progress. This team structure also recognizes that we can be a source of microstress for others and that the only way we can communicate about our stress is in a supportive, open environment.Related: Improving Yourself Takes 9.6 Minutes of Work Each DayBe proactive, set new norms and change cultureToo often, it's easier to absorb microstress than to do something about it. If you've ever shied away from an uncomfortable conversation—even though avoidance led to lingering stress — then you know what it's like. But microstress accumulates in ways that are devastating to our well-being, so it's important to be proactive. One very effective step in tackling microstress is to change the culture to avert stressful moments.


In one exercise I do with companies, we list out collaboration tools in one column, from video chats to instant messaging to email. The second column focuses on the positive ways these tools should be used. In the third column, we brainstorm norms of use we'd like to improve.Let's take emails for example, one of the most common causes of microstress. Employees often feel like they're drowning in emails that take too long to read and respond to. Moving forward, a team might agree to write emails only in bullet points to prioritize brevity.Some people might see this as silly. Who has the time to set up systems for how we email one another? When we're in constant firefighting mode, we feel too busy to think of tweaking systems. But not tweaking those systems and changing culture is why we're so busy. A few hours of proactive work now can save hundreds of hours and prevent microstress down the line.Microstress can harm you, your team and your business. The stressors may seem small, but that doesn't make them any less important. So, reject toughing it out. Encourage teams to identify and target microstress. And then work together to generate new norms and change culture.

13,You Need a Community With Shared Values to Find Long-Term Success — Here's How to Cultivate It.,"Apr 6, 2024",Megan Thudium,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/everyone-wants-long-term-success-heres-how-to-find-it/470976,"
Don't underestimate the possibilities of growing a purpose-led community. It's one of the most influential tools in the entrepreneur's toolkit to help guide your business toward longevity and long-term happiness.Because let's be honest — no one wants to be unhappy in their business. In this article, you will learn the importance of building a community of shared purpose and how it impacts the continued success of your business.Entrepreneurial success sits at the heart of purposeI would like to see more purpose-led businesses being built in the world.



Purpose-led businesses are run by entrepreneurs who lead from the heart and with the conviction that their business is doing good in the world. The business solves an important problem — maybe one that is societal or environmental. Purpose-led businesses aren't driven solely by profit but by the change the entrepreneur wants to see in the world.Surprisingly, my entrepreneurial journey didn't start with purpose. It began with the idea of starting a marketing agency and solving complex marketing problems. But as my business grew, I became less driven by profit and success. Over time, my main driver became purpose, or the value that I want to bring to the world. It doesn't matter where you are on your business journey. You can take the alternative path and refocus your business on purpose.


Building a community of shared purpose-driven entrepreneurs helped me forge this path of success. It was their inspiration, advice, and support in tough times that got me to five years in business. Remember, 2 in 10 businesses fail in the first year of operating. If you're past this point, you're thriving!When you forge a community of shared interests, you see more business projects aligned with your values, better collaboration opportunities and new service verticals emerging. Don't underestimate the power of collaboration and aligning with other business leaders on purpose. Nurturing this community is a successful ingredient to business growth — equally compared to organizational, marketing and sales tactics.Related: Why a Purpose-Driven Business Is the Real Key to SuccessIdentify your communityWho will you build your purpose-led community with? That question is answered by identifying your values and purpose as an entrepreneur.


Start the process by identifying the purpose of your business. It took me hours of reflection to narrow down my purpose and values, which then fed decisively into my business. Personally, my purpose is to forge meaningful connections, lead by example and support marketers and creatives on their path to climate work — and become an ecomarketer, someone who puts people and the planet at the center focus of all their marketing campaigns.Understanding my purpose has equipped me to identify a community of like-minded entrepreneurs interested in sustainability. It also helped me to connect with them on a deeper level. When you have a shared purpose, community connections go deeper, from transactional to building a world collaboratively for the better.Once you've identified your purpose, find your community. The LinkedIn community is a great platform to connect with entrepreneurs and to identify those who might share the same values as you. It's truly the largest business networking social media platform in the world with 1 billion members. You can use the search function to identify members sharing and talking about similar topics to yours.But being engaged actively in the community will help you identify those with common values. These individuals are pure gold and will help your business grow. They champion your ideas, connect you to opportunities and push your industry forward. Remember, identifying the group is only the beginning. As mentioned, your long-term success comes from fostering relationships with those having a shared purpose.


Related: 3 Reasons Why Purpose-Driven Businesses Can Help You Find Better Hires, Mentors and InvestorsHow to build a community of shared purposeOnce you've built the bridge, you can follow these three pathways to building a community of shared-purpose entrepreneurs.Change of mindset: Long-term — To build a community, you must have the right mindset. First, put personal gain aside and focus on the community. You will be surprised to see that the community-first mindset leads to more authentic connections that build long-term business growth. It also focuses your sights on the future, building connections that last years and don't stop at the end of a transaction.Step up: Contribute — Contributing is another important step toward building a community of purpose-driven entrepreneurs. You can't ask for value from others if you're not willing to step up and give the value yourself. Meaningful connections are made by giving a helping hand, passing along business opportunities to your community and offering collaboration opportunities. To build a community of shared purpose, you must embody your values and practice them openly.Pass the torch: Champion other entrepreneurs — Long-term entrepreneurial success comes from taking you out of the equation. Your growth goals, objectives and business strategy aren't the most important things in the entrepreneurial circle. Champion others' work, give referrals and forge meaningful connections.Find entrepreneurs with the same values and a similar journey as yours. Then, work on forging a community of shared purpose with those entrepreneurs. It's this one business tactic that will bring you longevity and long-term business success.

14,3 Customer Service Trends to Follow this Year,"Apr 4, 2024",Michelle Van Slyke,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-customer-service-trends-your-business-needs-to-follow/471717,"
Customer service has never been more important. Today's customers not only desire fast and seamless service but also expect a personalized and delightful customer experience (CX). To add even more to the mix, the stakes are high for businesses that don't measure up. According to a recent PwC report, one-third of customers would leave a brand they love after one bad experience.The good news is that succeeding in customer service can reap incredible benefits for businesses. In fact, 86% of customers are willing to pay more for a great CX, per the Tempkin Group. Due to these factors, customer service has become one of the top priorities for businesses in 2024. Here are three CX trends every business leader should buy into to help them excel in 2024.The evolving role of self-service technologyToday's customers expect fast, seamless and convenient service. One recent study found that half of all customers will not wait more than 3 minutes in a store. It's unrealistic to expect businesses to provide instant, in-person service all the time – that's where technology has to play a role. Gone are the days when these technologies were viewed as taboo. On the contrary, many of today's customers prefer customer service, which technology supports in some way. Per a recent study by Aspect, 73% of customers want the ability to solve product or service issues independently. Even many small businesses and franchises should invest in technologies like self-service kiosks or technology tools that support customer service efforts.



If your business hasn't invested in self-service technology for customers, 2024 might just be the year to do so. A great place to start is with self-service kiosks onsite. This is a tool that The UPS Store recently introduced, with over 1,800 self-service kiosks now installed at franchise locations across the country. These kiosks streamline online returns and item drop-offs for The UPS Store customers and offer an option to get in and out of the store faster than ever. Whether self-service works into your business plan or not, technology will be a key player in customer service in 2024.Related: 10 Reasons Why Good Customer Service Is Your Most Important Metric


Connecting with Gen-ZYou may not realize this, but Gen Z is growing up fast. The oldest members of this generation will be much closer to 30 this year than 20. With Gen Zers becoming a bigger sect of most companies' customer base, one of the biggest CX trends in 2024 will be the importance of appealing to this group. So, where should you start? One place is on social media. As the first actual digital-native generation, Gen Zers are often most comfortable interacting with companies on social media. A survey by Hubspot found that 90% of Gen Z expect brands to be active on social media, and 13% claim social media as the preferred form of customer service. If you're not on social media, 2024 is a great year to use it.This shouldn't just be reserved for large national brands; even small businesses should find ways to be active and interact with younger customers on social media. LinkedIn or Instagram are great places to start for most companies, but consider where you feel most comfortable or which platform your customers are most active on. Authenticity must be prioritized in social media customer service, especially when interacting with Gen Z. In addition to responding to customer needs, being active on social media will allow your company to build more trust with Gen Z and interact with customers more often.Related: What You Must Know About the Next Generations of ConsumersHarnessing customer insightsOne CX trend that has persisted in its importance is using customer service interactions for their insights. While customer service should prioritize the customer experience, all companies should also look for ways to learn from these interactions. This can be achieved through high-tech and low-tech means. For example, businesses can use data intelligence software to get real-time insights or social media analytics to collect information. Plenty of data intelligence vendors can offer real-time insights based on customer touchpoints. On the other hand, businesses can also tap their customer service employees for their insights following a customer interaction.


Employees often have some of the best feedback to offer since they interact daily with customers. All businesses should view their customer touchpoints as an opportunity to not only make their customers happy but also as a chance to learn and adapt for the future. In 2024, you should consider finding ways to better obtain customer insights, whether that be through investing in data analytics or looking for insights from your employees.Providing great customer service should always be a priority for business leaders, but it continues to be more important each year. As we move through 2024, be sure to keep tabs on customer service trends, especially when it comes to the importance of self-service, appealing to Gen Z and harnessing customer insights.

17,"Here's What You Need to Create a Dynamic, Innovative and Resilient Work Environment","Apr 2, 2024",Adam Markel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-create-a-dynamic-innovative-and-resilient-work/471671,"
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) is crucial for promoting innovation, satisfaction and success. To build a dynamic and resilient work environment, it is important to embrace different points of view and encourage inclusivity because such actions foster a positive culture, improve teamwork and draw in top talent.A change-proof mindset, on the other hand, is a strategic approach that promotes resilience and adaptability in the face of ongoing corporate change. A change-proof attitude is crucial for organizations to effectively navigate uncertainty and embrace innovation.These two concepts play pivotal roles in achieving innovation, something we will talk about in detail in this article.Related: Great Minds Think Unalike — 3 Ways to Drive True Innovation Through DiversityThe power of diversity in driving innovationThe power of diversity in driving innovation is immense and undeniable. In the realm of business and creativity, diversity acts as a catalyst for innovation, igniting the spark that leads to groundbreaking ideas and transformative solutions. It's not merely a matter of including different races, genders or cultural backgrounds, although these are crucial aspects. The essence of diversity's power lies in the amalgamation of varied perspectives, experiences, and ways of thinking and harnessing the collective wisdom that emerges when people with different viewpoints collaborate towards a common goal.



Industry giants like Microsoft, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson credit part of their success to a diverse workforce, and they did it by harnessing the power of varied perspectives not just to drive innovation, but also to create products that cater to a wider range of needs.Embracing a change-proof mindsetEmbracing a change-proof mindset in business is akin to preparing a ship and its crew for a voyage across uncharted waters. It's about cultivating resilience, adaptability and an unwavering commitment to navigating the inevitable storms and uncertainties that lie ahead. This journey begins with leadership that not only embraces change but sees it as an essential ingredient for growth and innovation.Leadership must embody the change-proof mindset. This means demonstrating a genuine openness to new ideas, a readiness to pivot when necessary and a deep-seated belief in the power of resilience. Leaders must be the torchbearers of adaptability, showing by example how to embrace uncertainty rather than shy away from it. They must create a culture where failure is not seen as a setback but as a stepping stone to greater success. This culture encourages experimentation, where every attempt, successful or not, is valued for the lessons it brings.Embracing a change-proof mindset is about more than just surviving the storms of change; it's about setting sail toward new horizons with confidence and resilience. It requires leadership that inspires, a culture that empowers and an unwavering commitment to growth and innovation.


Related: From Passive to Resilient — These 7 Strategies Will Empower Your Team to Thrive Through ChangeSynergy of DEI and a change-proof mindsetThe synergy between Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) and a change-proof mindset is not just a strategic advantage; it's a transformative force that can redefine the landscape of any organization, propelling it towards unparalleled innovation, resilience and success.Diversity in thought and experience challenges conventional wisdom and pushes boundaries, leading to breakthroughs that would be impossible in a homogenous setting. Equity ensures that this diversity is more than just present; it's active, with every voice having the weight and the platform it deserves. Inclusion binds these elements together, creating a culture where everyone feels valued and empowered to contribute their best. This is the fertile ground on which innovation thrives.Now, when you infuse this DEI environment with a change-proof mindset, you amplify its potential exponentially. A change-proof mindset is characterized by resilience, adaptability and an unwavering commitment to growth and learning. It's about seeing change not as a threat but as an opportunity. This mindset ensures that the organization is not just surviving but thriving amidst change, leveraging the diverse perspectives and ideas that DEI brings to navigate and capitalize on the uncertainties of our world.


The synergy of DEI and a change-proof mindset creates an organization that is dynamic, resilient and innovative. One good example is the American multinational technology company, Google, because it promotes DEI and a change-proof mindset through its ""Unbiasing"" efforts, for example. This approach contributes to the creation of new products and services, such as AI-powered language translation tools.The same goes with IT and networking giant, Cisco, which exemplifies DEI and a change-proof mindset with its commitment to inclusivity through programs like the ""Conscious Culture Initiative."" Cisco encourages adaptability and innovation, which is largely evident in its networking solutions.Practical strategies for implementationWhat can organizations do to enhance DEI efforts? Below are some actionable steps that can be taken:Leadership commitment: Secure leadership buy-in for DEI, making it a strategic priority.Training and education: Provide regular DEI training to all employees that will help promote awareness and understanding.Inclusive policies: Review and update policies to eliminate bias and promote inclusivity.Diverse recruitment: Implement diverse recruitment practices to attract the best talent in the market.Employee resource groups: Establish and support employee resource groups for networking and support.Organizations that celebrate resilience, support ongoing learning and encourage flexibility can also aid in the promotion of a change-proof attitude. Establish a culture where obstacles are seen as chances for development and where staff members are encouraged to accept change. Emphasize the advantages of adaptability, quick thinking and forward-thinking behavior regularly. Give diversity in hiring and team composition top priority to connect DEI projects with a more comprehensive innovation strategy.Related: How to Promote Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Your WorkplaceOvercoming challenges and building momentumThe use of DEI and change-proof programs frequently encounter obstacles such as the necessity for ongoing education and unconscious biases that impact decision-making. A lack of quantifiable measures, imprecise communication and inconsistent leadership commitment can all impede success. It will take consistent work, open communication and a dedication to fostering an inclusive and flexible working culture to overcome these obstacles.To overcome resistance and build momentum, start with transparent communication regarding benefits. Encourage leaders to set an example, create inclusive policies and come up with measurable goals. Promote open dialogue between individuals, address concerns, and celebrate small wins to gradually shift attitudes and build sustained momentum for positive change.

Olympic relay races are the apex of collaboration. If one person falters, it impacts the whole team.When it comes to order, there's no hard-and-fast rule. Some teams put their fastest runner first, but others opt to put them last. According to USC's director of track and field, Caryl Smith Gilbert, sometimes you need someone ""hard-nosed"" like Usain Bolt (formerly the fastest man on Earth) to close the race. Just watch Bolt's final Olympic relay race and you'll understand exactly what Smith Gilbert means. ""It's anyone's race,"" says the announcer before the final handoff. But as soon as the baton is in Bolt's hand, the race is over. Jamaica wins by a long shot.Imagine if runners were less likely to participate in relays if they had to run last because they figured they'd get less credit. That's the case when it comes to publications in the field of economics. Researchers found that people were less likely to collaborate on articles if their surname was lower down in the alphabet — meaning they would be listed later in the byline. The reason is that when people think they're receiving less credit, they're less inclined to collaborate.

At the heart of Philadelphia's culinary legacy stands Pat's King of Steaks, a landmark synonymous with the iconic Philly cheesesteak.Frank Olivieri, the executive chef and owner, traces the origins of this beloved sandwich to a serendipitous moment when his Uncle Pat grew weary of the daily hot dog fare and improvised with ribeye trimmings.""One day my uncle Pat got so tired of eating hot dogs he said to my grandfather, go down to the butcher and see what trimmings he has from the ribeye and bring it back, and we'll make that sandwich that we always like to make,"" Olivieri told host Shawn Walchef of Cali BBQ Media. That sandwich, cooked on the same open flat top as the hot dogs, became what we know now as the Philly cheesesteak.

20,How An Unmarked Dive Bar in Vegas Became One of America's Must-See Destinations — Within 3 Years of Opening,"Apr 2, 2024",Kristen Bayrakdarian,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-an-unmarked-dive-bar-in-vegas-became-one-of-americas/471448,"
You might not guess that in Las Vegas — a place known for luxury resorts, opulent casinos, and just about any amenity imaginable — one of the city's most beloved establishments is in a single-story building a six-minute drive from the Strip.There's a sole neon sign in the window that says, simply, ""Open."" But inside is a bit of magic: a bar, called The Silver Stamp, that makes just about everyone feel like they're back home, no matter where they're from. And in a city like Las Vegas, that's a high-wire act. ""It's a transient city,"" says Andrew Smith, one of The Silver Stamp's co-owners. ""We have so many different people coming here."" And not just locals. Tourists seek the bar out in almost equal measure.The Silver Stamp has become so beloved that when Entrepreneur held a vote to select America's favorite mom-and-pop shop™ (out of 150 of the most popular small businesses in the country, selected in partnership with Yelp), the divef bar won first place.



Related: These Are America's Favorite 150 Mom & Pop Shops™, According to Yelp and EntrepreneurThis is all the more impressive given that Smith and his co-owner and life partner, Rose Signor, only opened the business three years ago, in February 2021. In that short time, they've paid off their two small investors, the business has averaged 23% revenue growth year over year, and by popular demand, extended their hours from 1 p.m. to 1 a.m.So what is the Silver Stamp getting right?""A lot of people say, 'I don't know what it is, but I just feel so comfortable in your space,'"" Signor says.Comfort — it's no small thing. It's possibly the most important feeling a mom-and-pop shop can evoke. But it's also mysterious. You can't simply buy comfort. You can't follow a checklist to create it. You have to understand, deeply, what it means to you.


Image Credit: Mike BellemeSignor and Smith met in 2017, when she hired him to work at Atomic Liquors, the oldest freestanding bar in Las Vegas. ""It was an instant connection,"" Smith says. They'd both been in the service industry for years — Smith had managed a nearby bar before coming to Atomic Liquors — and they both shared an interest in the craft beer industry. Smith had planned to move to the Northwest at some point, but when he met Signor, he had a good reason to stay. And Signor had actually moved from Las Vegas to Seattle back in 2011 — only to move back a year later. She missed Las Vegas and the desert, and was inspired to infuse Sin City with some of the wholesome beer culture she loved.But Signor and Smith's connection went deeper than a love of pilsners and IPAs. They'd grown up in small towns on opposite sides of the country — Peru, New York, and Yuma, Arizona, respectively — that instilled in them a strong sense of community and, perhaps more importantly, empathy. ""I remember seeing situations [growing up] where I felt truly bad for people getting treated poorly and embarrassed because they didn't have enough money,"" says Signor.Related: A Small Business Owner's Guide to Managing Funds and InvestmentsWhen Signor and Smith discovered that they had both, individually, been saving to open their own bars, joining forces was a no-brainer. ""We knew we wanted to do something together,"" Smith says. They started dreaming about the bar they'd open, and even collecting decorations. A vintage clock here, a disco ball there. A wooden toucan to hang from the ceiling, sock monkeys to dress in funny, seasonal outfits. Their nostalgic, oddball, something-for- everyone aesthetic was representative of their mission for the business. ""We'd been to so many establishments that have not made us feel welcome, or have made us and others feel like outcasts,"" Signor says. ""We wanted everyone to feel included.""In May 2018, they took the leap. They quit their jobs together and backpacked for nine months through Europe and the U.S. to learn more about the history of beer. When their former boss at Atomic Liquors, Lance Johns, reached out and told them he had bought a few buildings in the downtown area, and he would lease one to them, the couple jumped at the chance. They had a vision, and they were ready.  Image Credit: Mike BellemeConstruction on the Silver Stamp began at the end of 2019. A few months later, we all know what happened: The pandemic hit.Smith and Signor had planned to hold other jobs as they built out the space, but the shock to the service industry left them unemployed. They had already sunk $60K of their savings into gutting the space, buying materials and paying contractors, so they pressed ahead. But there were mistakes and setbacks during construction, and the funds dried up way before the bar was finished.

""I remember stepping outside and thinking, We don't really have any money left.""At some point, the couple assessed their situation. Nothing was going to plan, sure, and the money was gone. But they had their own two hands, and a community of friends who were willing to help.They began spending long nights repurposing old, torn-out wood, running electrical lines, and laying plumbing themselves, to cut costs. They sought out any help they could get. ""One of the biggest things I learned during this process,"" Signor says, ""and this is even after we've opened — is to not be afraid to ask as many questions and to reach out to as many people as you can. Sometimes you think you're bothering people, but in that dire moment, I remember panicking and hitting everybody up, asking for suggestions, and looking to people that have a little bit more experience with the situation. There were some really surprising people that came forward to help us just by mentioning what our situation was."" People coached them through different processes, gave them a discount on their services, or lent them materials and machinery. They turned to others for counsel or attempted to replicate, through trial and error, what seemed to have worked for other successful establishments.One person they leaned on a lot was Lance Johns, who knew how hard they worked from when he was their boss. ""Lance is somebody that will give back to people who give to him,"" says Signor. ""Having a mentor saved us a lot of time not having to second-guess ourselves.""One thing they never doubted was how they wanted their bar to feel: inclusive and, of course, comforting.Related: Experts Say This Is the Key to Marketing a Mom and Pop BusinessThey poured those values into every detail and decision. Christmas lights strung across the ceiling help keep the ambience neither too dark nor too bright. Bar stools are repurposed gaming chairs, designed for people to sit in one place for an extended period of time. The collection of cozy nooks and small seating areas encourages intimate conversations, and the music is kept at a low enough decibel that you can hear your neighbor talk. There are only two screens, an anomaly in otherwise tech-saturated Las Vegas. And this low-tech ethos extends to printing physical menus, even though the bar has served over 1,700 different beers in three years — averaging out to nearly two new beers a day. Finally, there's the diversity of decorations and memorabilia — a bubbling lava lamp, vintage beer posters, kooky seasonal decorations, scavenged beer-can art installations — that Signor and Smith had collected over two years before the bar's opening. They're now strewn across the wood-panel walls and, really, everywhere, so that customers have something fun and different to look at in each corner. Customers have even begun adding their own contributions to the decor.


""We have been to enough bars in our life to know what makes us feel comfortable,"" Signor says, ""So how we created the bar was based on our own preferences."" By trusting their own well-defined feelings, they built something universally relatable.Image Credit: Mike BellemeBut creating an environment that is comfortable and relatable is about more than just creative decisions. It's also about financial decisions, and from the start, Signor and Smith were determined to keep costs down. ""We have low overhead because our decisions weren't fueled by [trying to make] money,"" Signor says. ""We intentionally made choices like a cheaper building off the beaten path and being our own managers and cutting out that salary.""Being intimately involved in the day-to-day operations of the space has also helped them foster the spirit of the bar and its employees. ""Our definition of a bartender isn't someone just serving drinks,"" says Signor. ""It's about building a relationship with these guests. When we're hiring, we look for people who genuinely appreciate other people, treat them with respect and kindness, and create a really safe space that people want to come back to."" Their ideal hire is someone who has positive energy, is able to leave their personal life at the door, can laugh and joke with people, and is humble (which they define as ""not intimidating and able to put people at ease"").Related: 50 Amazing Grants, Accelerators, and Free Resources Being Offered to Entrepreneurs by Champions of Small BusinessIt's painful to let people go when they don't live up to those standards, Signor says. But it's also essential. ""When prioritizing what to do next, I always think of the guest sitting in that barstool,"" she explains. ""We tell the staff to pretend we're the guests on the other side. What are they seeing? Really envision it from their perspective.""But, while Signor and Smith want their employees to put themselves in their customers' shoes (or, rather, stools), they also believe that employees have to be happy for customers to enjoy themselves. They offer health benefits — something they say is mostly unheard of in their industry, but something they wanted when they were employed by others. They are also transparent with their employees about finances and business decisions, sharing numbers and providing reasoning for changes. They take their workers' thoughts into consideration, whether it be opinions on events or on shifts in workflow. And they don't ask employees to do anything they wouldn't want to do. (The pair continue to work bar shifts alongside their staff — including cleanup duty.)""Don't be afraid to get feedback,"" says Signor. ""Our staff is so important to us and really we wouldn't be the bar that we are without them. So we lean on them, and they lean on us.""


The same way she encourages her employees to look at things through the customer's eyes, she makes a habit of looking at a situation from the viewpoint of her employees. ""I've learned to always try to put myself in the mindset of the other person,"" she says. ""I roleplay with myself in my head: If I say this to them, what do I think their response will yield? And could I say it differently? I just really try to understand where they're coming from before we approach the situation."" She adds, ""And then if we're frustrated, we sleep on it. That was something that my mentor told me: 'Always take a couple of days to reflect.'""These days, when Smith and Signor reflect on their business journey, it's notable that, in a city known for its fabulous attractions, The Silver Stamp has become its own must-see destination. ""We've become a bar people bring their families to when they're in town because they have to show their parents, their uncle,"" Smith says.Signor adds, ""We've had grown people cry when they first come in here. The space touches them immediately.""People are always looking for comfort, and the Silver Stamp shows that if you devote yourself and your business to that quality above all, people will feel it — and deeply appreciate it. You just need a vision, and a willingness to get your hands dirty. ""Every single aspect of this bar we've had our hands in,"" says Smith. He and Signor think it's funny that one of the bar's quirks that locals and tourists love — the fact that they don't have signage outside their building, giving the bar that local, in-the-know vibe — came about because they couldn't afford the sign they had designed.That's the kind of thing you never could have planned for. So, while Smith and Signor have received offers to franchise the bar, they don't think what they've created can be replicated. They do have other plans in the works. But The Silver Stamp will remain dependably unique — news that is its own kind of comfort.Related: Here's the Secret to Growing Your Small Business, According to Execs at UPS, Airbnb, Mastercard, and Other Big Brands

21,"After a Life-Changing Experience, This Founder Discovered the Power of Gratitude. Now She and Her Co-Founder Husband Want to Spread Positivity to Classrooms — for Free.","Apr 2, 2024",Dan Bova,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/parents-nominate-your-school-for-free-gratitude-journals/472039,"
Former school teacher, business owner and mom of four Katie Wood has seen the power of gratitude first-hand. ""Our daughter had to have life-saving surgery, which led to my mind spiraling out of control,"" she tells Entrepreneur. ""That led to me embracing the power of a morning gratitude routine. It really helped me, and when Covid hit, one of our daughters asked me about my special mornings and if she could do it, too. I searched for a kid-appropriate tool for her to use and kept coming up empty. That's when the entrepreneur spirit — which is scary but so powerful — took over, and from there, I created A Simple Seed.""A Simple Seed of Growth, Gratitude & Giggles is a morning journal to help kids — and their parents — start the day with positivity, focus and accepting themselves for who they are. ""We hear so much about anti-bullying initiatives, which are great,"" Katie says. ""But daily gratitude can have a tremendous effect that goes even further. It has been studied by the University of Kentucky, and researchers found all kinds of benefits for children. They found that kids who practice gratitude are more empathetic, less likely to retaliate or be aggressive than kids who don't practice gratitude and are happier overall.""



The study spurred Katie and her husband, Steve, who is a paramedic fireman outside of Boston, to create a school edition of their journal and launch the company's 50-in-50 Challenge. ""Our goal is to give free copies of the journal to 50 schools in 50 states,"" Steve says.The 50-in-50 Challenge works simply: Teachers or parents can nominate their school by visiting the company's site and answering a few questions about why they think it's a perfect fit. There is no ""right"" answer to who would qualify, Katie says, but she does have a soft spot for those school districts that face financial challenges. ""I was a teacher in the South Bronx,"" she says, ""and I love the idea of helping schools in underserved communities.""


The couple hopes to get these books to schools with the help of sponsors. ""This is a zero-profit project for us,"" Katie says. ""We're simply looking for sponsors to cover the costs of the production and shipping of the books. And we believe between $10,000 and $15,000 would be enough to cover the entire United States.""Related: 'We're Curating Happiness': See How This Entrepreneur Is Transforming the Wellness SpaceThe Woods say this is an easy win for sponsors who want to do good in the world and gain positive exposure in the process. ""These books will be in all 50 schools, and every parent and child at those schools will know who provided them,"" Katie says.


""The great thing is that we've validated the idea,"" Steve says. ""We've seen it in action, and it works."" A school in New Jersey was gifted the journals, and the principal reported back ongoing tangible proof that they had a positive impact.""We heard that kids are leaving little nice notes on each others' lockers,"" Katie says. ""The teachers would walk down the hall and hear kids yelling out gratitude chants in the morning. It all just confirms that gratitude can have such a tremendous impact.""Related: 'Success All Comes Down to Storytelling' How Chef Adrianne Calvo Is Cooking Up Big Business Through Podcasting and Social Media""Our goal is to do a questionnaire at each winning school before and after they get the books to find out what they learned and what was most powerful,"" Katie says.

Each school gets the chance to plant a small seed that will grow for their entire state.""

      Key Takeaways    



        The business world is in step with a 5-day workweek, so any change will be sure to come with challenges. 
      


        After my experience with a 35-hour workweek, I can definitely see it working.
      












    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

4-day workweeks — it's the trend every worker is quietly rooting for. The concept is simple: one less day of work a week without any changes to remuneration, benefits or workload. Yes, workload. That means doing 100% of the work in 80% of the time. That's if you want to keep 100% of the pay.Proponents of four-day workweeks say that this should be possible thanks to transformative technologies such as artificial intelligence, better management techniques (e.g., not everything needs a Zoom meeting) and boosted personal productivity that stems from a better work-life balance.These proponents are also amassing a substantial body of evidence that not only proves the feasibility of the four-day workweek but also shows workers to become more satisfied and loyal. That's a powerful benefit to companies in a time when rampant worker burnout and disengagement may be costing the economy nearly $2 trillion in lost productivity.



One recent four-day workweek pilot program featuring 41 US and Canadian companies saw both worker satisfaction and business revenue go up. None of the participating companies had a desire to return to a 5-day workweek.A larger trial in the UK saw virtually identical results, with 92% of participating companies opting to continue with the four-day model post-pilot for the same reasons as above – greater worker satisfaction and a 35% average increase in revenue. A similar story goes for Spain and South Africa. Plus, Portugal, Brazil, Germany and other countries that are running trials right now are likely to corroborate these findings further.


Related: Want a 4-Day Workweek? This Scheduling Strategy is the First StepToo radical of a change?For some businesses, however, letting a fifth of their working week go may be too hard a pill to swallow. And there's no denying it — it's a radical shift.The business world is in step with a 5-day workweek, and whether it's customer expectations or communication with partners, operations can get messy if you find yourself out of tune. Moreover, startups and other high-growth companies that already expect 120% from their employees on a regular day risk completely overwhelming their people by shortening the week.This is to say nothing of shift workers or entire industries that simply don't currently have the flexibility to adapt. Nearly a third of UK businesses find a four-day workweek infeasible, with the manufacturing, human resources, and travel sectors being the most pessimistic.


It's not all or nothingLet's be real — nobody has any illusions about businesses suddenly adopting a four-day workweek en masse in the coming years, no matter how many positive test runs make the headlines. Rather, the message that should be gleaned from all these studies is that there's an overwhelmingly positive response to shortened workweeks that typically translates to improved business performance.Many businesses are taking an incremental approach to tapping into these benefits without undermining daily operations. Instead of going from a standard 40-hour week to a 32-hour one, they're taking the middle road, opting for 35 — or 36-hour workweeks.These can come in various forms:7-hour work days. 7 hours a day, five days a week. This is how we do it at DeskTime, and the practice has been received positively by the team.Summer Fridays. Fridays are half-days. This is a popular policy during the summer months, hence the name.Staggered Fridays. Nine work days a fortnight, or taking every second Friday off. Allows for alternating shifts, e.g., in customer support.Working four fewer hours a week sounds less radical than eliminating an entire day. For most white-collar workers, that's equivalent to cutting out two meetings, which is not only doable but maybe dearly welcomed.


Indeed, many companies looking to adopt four-day or even 4.5-day workweeks set their crosshairs on reducing and optimizing meetings. Simply following meeting best practices — no time overruns, everyone arriving prepared, and clear processes — can help reclaim a sizable chunk of wasted hours. The promise that it's their own free time that they're reclaiming is a good incentive for workers to take these best practices seriously.Every company I've talked to that has attempted shortened workweeks in one form or another immediately references a notable drop in employee turnover. Hiring also becomes easier, and the employees are happier. And others have had similar positive experiences, too.Related: That 9-to-5 Job You Hate Isn't As Safe As You ThinkA step closer to 4-day workweeksAs a CEO, I was skeptical when I heard that four-day workweeks were trending. Now, after my experience with a 35-hour workweek, I can definitely see it working. I still hear and understand the counterarguments of other business leaders, but I've learned that they're not insurmountable obstacles. It takes work, adaptation, and patience.


Shifting to a shortened workweek cannot be a snap decision. Even in the various national trials, the shift is typically preceded by a transitional period guided by experts who prepare the company and workers regarding expectations and practicalities. Get it wrong, and your transition to a four-day workweek may have the opposite effect — an overworked team struggling and failing to cram everything into four days, leading to heightened stress levels that fast-track burnout.But get it right – and you'll see it in your business results.

24,My Wife's Nutritionist Gets Better Sales Than You — Here's Why.,"Mar 26, 2024",Ramon Ray,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-win-over-customers-by-listening-and-following-up/471307,"
Recently, my wife hired a nutritionist to help her get healthy and improve her diet. My wife is not easily swayed, and she likes to weigh potential outcomes and consequences before committing to a course of action. So, I asked my wife why she had hired one nutritionist and not the several others she had interviewed.She said there were two main reasons: she felt heard, and the nutritionist followed up.Know what your customer wantsThe nutritionists my wife didn't choose seemed to be selling her something she didn't want. She felt it was like she was going to a painter to help her paint her house, but they kept wanting to do landscaping.



The other nutritionists were nice and pleasant. But my wife had a very special and specific need. She didn't want medicine or Weight Watchers. She wanted a guide and a coach to help her in her daily routine. This nutritionist who got the job actually listened and understood what my wife wanted.Related: Are You Really Listening to Your Customers? Probably Not, But You Should.


Follow up, follow up, follow up!Secondly, the nutritionist who was hired followed up. Often, your next customer will not buy from you the first time you have a conversation with them.Maybe they're not ready quite yet. Maybe they're in the middle of traffic when you speak with them. Maybe there are screaming kids in the car. Maybe it's simply a bad time.Whether you're a nutritionist, lawyer, accountant, web designer or any other type of entrepreneur, these two principles of understanding who your customers are — and what they want — and the power of following up are essential for the growth of your business.Related: How to Write Follow-Up Emails That Get Answered


How to better understand your future customerUnderstanding who your customers are and their problems and concerns is essential for small business owners and entrepreneurs to grasp. My best sales happen when I really listen to and understand the customer. Here are a few tips to help you do this better.1. The importance of questions. Understanding your potential clients is all about asking insightful questions. This practice isn't limited to the queries themselves but extends to how you ask the question. It is crucial to initiate conversations that make your customers feel at ease when expressing their preferences and thoughts.2. Active listening and engagement. Listening actively is as crucial as the questions asked. This involves tuning into not just the words spoken but also gleaning insights from the tone, the pauses and the enthusiasm behind them. Exploring their previous encounters with similar services or products can shed light on their preferences, helping tailor your service or product to better meet their needs. The nutritionist my wife hired did a great job asking the right questions and understanding her needs.3. Understanding customer expectations. Inquiring about your customers' definition of success gives you a clear picture of their goals. This not only aids in aligning your offerings with their expectations but also demonstrates your commitment to fulfilling their unique needs.


Related: How Top Sellers Anticipate Customer NeedsHow to use tech to follow up with future customers1. Utilize CRM Systems. CRM platforms can help you consolidate client data, including contact details, preferences, and previous engagements. They also enable personalized follow-ups. They can even help you know when it's time to reach out to clients based on predefined schedules or after specific triggers, ensuring no client feels neglected. Tools such as Hubspot, Keap, Zoho CRM, and Nimble are great for this.2. Task reminders for consistency. Task reminder apps are simpler tools but immensely powerful for keeping follow-ups on track. They can be set to remind you to reach out to your clients at optimal times, making the process more systematic. This approach is particularly effective for individual professionals or small businesses that might not need the full suite of CRM functionalities but still prioritize consistent communication. Tools such as Asana, Google Tasks, Outlook 365 Tasks and many others can help.3. Marketing automation. Marketing automation takes follow-ups to a new level. From sending personalized emails based on client actions to scheduling social media posts that keep your business in the loop, these tools make client engagement continuous and consistent. For instance, after an initial consultation, a nutritionist could set up an automated email sequence to share helpful tips, encouraging messages or gentle reminders to book a follow-up appointment, seamlessly maintaining the client relationship.


Related: 4 Insane Truths About Failing to Follow-upSummaryThis was a straightforward example of how a nutritionist ""beat out"" other nutritionists to ""win the sale."" She got my wife — who is not easily sold (I might add) — to buy a product.Follow up. Keep following up with the customer, especially if you know you're a fit for them and have the solution they need. Don't be annoying — but follow up. Understand who your customer is, their goals and needs, and how you can help them reach their desired outcome.

27,5 Delegation Strategies To Help You Flourish With Less Stress,"Mar 25, 2024",Jessica Fisher,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-delegate-as-a-business-owner/471260,"
One of the hardest parts about owning a business is getting it off the ground and establishing it. However, once you make it a success, the responsibilities increase, and you have to let others take control of certain tasks to maintain the business' momentum.Delegation can seem terrifying to a business owner. Taking someone into your company and trusting them to do a job is a big leap for someone who's been handling every aspect of the business from day one. Fortunately, there are strategies you can implement to maintain smooth operations while letting go of control.Related: Want to Succeed? Learn to Say 'No'



1. Find someone who excels at the task at handIt's crucial to find the right person for the job. When looking at resumes, pay attention to employment histories with similar duties to those you seek. During interviews, ask questions regarding their past responsibilities and follow up on their responses by asking them to elaborate on how their skill set would translate to the type of work you need them to do.If you're stuck between two or more candidates, closely consider those who have experience that aligns with your field. Prioritizing skill over availability is always a smart move, especially when the work you require is specialized or imperative. The ideal person is likely to complete their duties more efficiently than someone who is less suited for it but more available.


2. Maintain a watchful but trusting eye on their responsibilitiesWhen a team is small, it's especially vital to stay aware of everyone's duties and daily work. While you must delegate tasks and loosen up control on certain aspects of the business, you also need to be in the loop, as errors and overlooked responsibilities can have a detrimental impact if you don't pay attention.For a business that includes sales or frequent client interactions, one way to stay on top of events is to have your staff BCC you on every email they send. This way, you are still trusting that they can complete their tasks, but you can also look over things should any questions arise and quickly jump in on any conversations.Reduce mishaps by having your team utilize email templates when writing people outside of the organization. A business that involves continual back-and-forth with others often follows similar patterns of conversation. Identify those themes and copy the proper responses into a shared document that workers can reference when they're responding to someone. Google Drive is an excellent tool for this type of collaborative work.Related: 10 Simple Ways to Build a Collaborative, Successful Work Environment


3. Recognize their skill and adapt accordinglyEven if someone seems like a good fit, they may struggle at first to learn their responsibilities and how best to complete them. If the company is smaller, their job may have a larger scope, with many small but cumulative elements that require time to master. When a team member seems ambitious and reliable but slower in the first few days, offer more guidance and support. Thorough training of an individual with talent pays off.If they seem to be still struggling with specific tasks later on, it can be helpful to eliminate those from their job duties and have them focus on what they are good at. Hand those tasks to someone else on the team or hire another person who is comfortable doing them. When outsourcing is not an option, resetting your expectations may be beneficial. The job might be done differently than you would do it, but it is still getting done.Related: 5 Invaluable Soft Skills to Seek in Your Next Hire4. Set clear expectations and define successTo do their jobs well, workers need to know what exactly you need from them. As workers settle into their position, help them understand what is important to you as their superior and what you expect to see from them. Outline specific goals, such as 'we want to increase sales by 25% this year' rather than 'we want to increase sales this year.' Providing tangible measures of success will enable them to create a plan to reach those benchmarks.


Timelines are also useful, preventing staff from spending too much time on one task or not enough time on another. Each project or assignment should have an expected due date, helping to establish priorities.Provide workers with resources for support so they know who or what to turn to in case anything goes awry. Examples include going to their manager for advice, looking at company email templates or giving them access to specific company information so they can problem-solve on their own.5. Keep an open line of communicationFor staff to effectively take charge of a task, they need to be able to speak with you or a manager without difficulty. Similarly, you need to be able to come to them when you have questions about any of their responsibilities.There is no shortage of ways teams can stay in contact. Google Chat is especially useful for businesses using Gmail as their company email. Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zoom and Discord are other chat apps popular with businesses of all sizes. Try to only utilize the chat feature for quick questions, and always hop on a video or phone call for clarity. Typed words tend to get lost in translation and can seem ambiguous.


Regardless of the method you choose, workers need to know they can always approach you for advice, information or general dialogue. A company's success is synonymous with its ability to communicate effectively.Mastering the art of delegation is a transformative chapter in a business owner's life. When you can confidently pass on responsibilities to a competent employee, you can establish a healthy work-life balance and focus on what you do best: growing the company. By choosing skilled, reliable workers, adapting to their abilities, setting clear goals, and fostering communication, you lay the foundation for a thriving business environment.

28,Yelp Community Managers Share Their Best Tips for Black Shop Owners to Boost Business and Build Community,"Mar 25, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/tips-from-yelp-community-managers-for-boosting-business/471586,"
Telling your story is one of the most powerful ways to uplift your small business. When you share a piece of your life experience with customers, you open the door to authentic connections that can grow into long-term business relationships.Finding the right storytelling platform isn't always easy, but Yelp Community Managers are uniquely positioned to help. Stationed in regions across the country, Yelp employees like Erica Eubanks, B Busby, and Anitra Thomas serve as bridges between Yelp businesses and consumers, working with business owners in their local areas to launch events, social media promotions, and other opportunities for visibility.Related: The Counter Service at Yo' Mama's Is Just As Unique As Its Name. Here's Why People Come Back for the Experience as Much as the Food.



""For me, [the process] is: I know this really great business in this great area that might not get a lot of traffic to it. Let me start with bringing my own squad to this business,"" Anitra said. ""If it was a fun find, those people tell their social circle. And then those folks tell their folks, and now all the folks know about this great local business they wouldn't have known about otherwise.""As members of the Black community, promoting Black- and other minority-owned businesses is a priority for Erica, B, and Anitra. They know it's important for business owners to have someone in their corner who looks like them and understands the unique struggles they face.


Community Managers often work with Black-owned businesses to capitalize on marketing opportunities during Black History Month and on Juneteenth. Using holidays as a hook, Black-owned businesses can pitch timely stories to the media and create specialized content for their social media pages.If you aren't able to launch the initiative during the right day or month, Erica emphasizes to not let the idea go to waste. Supporting minority-owned businesses is a priority for many Yelp users, so don't be hesitant to champion yourself as a quality Black-owned business all year round.Related: The Little Coffee Shop That Asks Customers to Please Not to Be Quiet""Black History Month is 365 for us,"" she said. ""We don't take this skin off when we go to bed, when we go to events, or when we're writing reviews.""


This dedication means Community Managers are a valuable resource for Yelp consumers looking to support minority-owned businesses. While the Yelp website and mobile app make it easy to filter searches using identity attributes, like Black-owned, following your local Yelp social media page and keeping up with the Community blog can help you find even more local gems. Community Managers often hold—and post about—events in partnership with Black-owned businesses looking to gain more traction in neighborhoods where they are racially or culturally underrepresented.During these events, Community Managers handle attracting and engaging customers so business owners can focus on what they do best: providing authentic and quality customer experiences.The events are also a great way to network with your community. At one event, B recalled connecting a business owner who raised children with epilepsy with a clinic owner who works with epileptic patients. This interaction opened up an opportunity for the business owner to make custom macaroons for the patients and share her story with the clinic's community.Hearing first-hand about this kind of impact is one of the most rewarding parts of the job. Community Managers are passionate about creating lasting connections and encourage business owners to connect with customers on a personal level whenever possible.


""You never know where that string is going to really connect and attach to somebody, and that's where we really create momentum [for businesses],"" B added.Related: How This California Hot Spot Grew From Delivery-Only to Pop-Up Shop to StorefrontTo help businesses flourish in their communities, Erica always urges businesses to reach out to their local Community Manager, whether to host an event for Yelp Elites or score an Instagram feature on a Yelp-owned account. The Community team partners with entrepreneurs in a variety of areas, from restaurant owners to local artists, on initiatives that are entirely free to business owners. They've also taken the 15% pledge, dedicating at least 15% of their efforts to Black-owned businesses.In addition to the importance of building a strong small business community, Erica, B, and Anitra believe in:


Championing Black-owned businesses all year long. Don't feel like you need to restrict identity-related marketing initiatives to Black History Month. Many Yelp consumers are eager to support minority-owned businesses whenever they can.Having advocates you can see yourself in. Erica, B, and Anitra understand the opportunities and challenges that Black business owners have and are passionate about helping them navigate the small business landscape.Using Yelp to make connections.

30,How This Family-Run Company Has Thrived for Five Generations,"Mar 25, 2024",William Salvi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-al-capone-inspired-the-launch-of-a-95-year-old/471438,"
Creating our show The CEO Series has allowed me to sit down with some of the most innovative and inspiring business leaders in the world to get their insights on what it takes to launch, grow and sustain a meaningful business.This episode took us to Ozinga, the concrete and building material powerhouse. They're based in Chicago and if you're in the area, you're surely familiar with their iconic red and white trucks. They have approximately 2,500 employees and I got to have an amazing chat with the guy who oversees it all, Marty Ozinga, the fourth-generation CEO of this 95-year-old company.Below are some highlights of that conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity. Watch the full video above.



His approach to leadership""It's not the people are working for you, they're working with you. That's the way I was mentored and taught. We all need each other. We all have different roles and responsibilities, but we're working with each other.""Related: Why Notre Dame's Football Coach Tells His Team to ""Choose Hard""


Ozinga's 95-year history""Our family came from the Netherlands in 1893, the year of the World's Fair here in Chicago. The family was always in the delivery business. Then in 1928, my great-grandfather was working with the Cook County Sheriff's Department during Prohibition and dealing with the hazards of Al Capone and all of that. He had five kids at home and decided, ""You know what? I don't want to fight Al Capone anymore."" So he started a coal delivery business. And then around 1950, ready mix concrete became the era's disruptive technology. Ready mixed means that it is batched for delivery from a central plant instead of being mixed on the job site. And so Ozinga became one of the first ready mix providers in the region.""Related: This Entrepreneur Started Making Short Videos to Share Her Passion for Cooking. Now Her Food Company Is a Global Powerhouse.On their iconic trucks""We've supplied concrete to iconic Chicago landmarks like Soldier Field and Wrigley Field, so it's fun to be connected to places like that. And we're really proud of our trucks' red and white stripes. I think it was a combination of this keen sense of marketing, but also of national pride. But there's also some joke that they were Dutch and very frugal and those were the two paint buckets in the garage. So I like both those stories.""The power of peacefulness""Our dispatch office is the nerve center of the business. It's where all the orders come in from our customers, and then where we dispatch the trucks. It is intentionally very quiet inside. We've tried to get it as quiet and peaceful as possible because historically the dispatch office is a very intense, chaotic, loud and crazy place.""


Building and sustaining a legacy""There's an emotional connection for my family and this company. We've been really fortunate that we get to embed ourselves in communities throughout the Midwest. We're committed to our employees and our customers — we want to be here for the next hundred years and longer. That's our intention. And while change is necessary so you don't get disrupted and die and go out of business, there are certain things that you shouldn't meddle with. Our core principles are the foundation for who we are and why we do what we do — that should never change.""Related: How Personal Passions Fuel Business Success for the CEO of Vivid SeatsCheck out more profiles of innovative and impactful leaders by visiting The CEO Series archives.

31,It's Time to Clean Up Your Act — How to Manage Your Reputation in the Era of AI,"Mar 22, 2024",David Klein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-manage-your-reputation-in-the-era-of-ai/471258,"
The traditional method of reputation management was to create new, positive content to drown out negative news about a company, pushing it back in the search results. Either that or the company's attorney contacted webmasters to get the damaging content removed. But those days are quickly disappearing. Enter the Search Generative Experience (SGE) — the integration of Google's AI into search results. It was gradually rolled out in 2023, and it's about to turn the world of reputation management upside-down.SGE results are designed to help the user make better decisions faster. This means providing deeper context and more balanced information (good and bad) and placing it at the top of the page before organic results (non-paid or non-sponsored results based purely on relevance). With this change to the ground rules of reputational management, brands need to fundamentally shift how they manage their online presence.Related: Why Investing in Reputation Management is Crucial for Your Business Strategy



The SGE shift: Adopting an experience-first approachCompared to the ""old"" Google, SGE results rely more on third-party references than a company's website. Since SGE seeks to highlight more diverse viewpoints and sources, it is more likely to showcase both positive and negative perspectives about a brand. So, gone are the days of being able to bury a bad news day by flooding the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) with better headlines.In this new landscape, reputation management must center on addressing user complaints — and not just at the surface level. Responding to criticism is a start, but SGE is pushing companies to continuously listen to user needs and make an effort to grow and improve as a result. With CX now having more relevance to reputation management than ever before, meeting these expectations requires a three-pronged effort that starts and ends with the user in mind.


1. Stay accountable to your usersGoogle's complex algorithm still strives to cater to the user's needs but will now prioritize content from publishers that do the same. So, a user-centric approach will require brands to:Seek a deeper understanding of user search intent before creating articles and web pages. Only then can brands address users' specific questions comprehensively enough for Google's LLMs to assign value to them.Understand what customers are saying about brands via social listening.Build confidence in readers by offering the most complete and up-to-date information across the company blog and other channels. Verify sources and clearly attribute them (especially AI-generated excerpts), as well as conduct regular audits to identify obsolete or outdated information.Encourage reviews, comments and user-generated content (UGC) on and off your website. This helps user complaints rise to the surface (and, hopefully, get resolved).Related: 5 Ways to Optimize Your Content for Better Google Rankings2. Partner with trusted third partiesSGE prioritizes information from high-quality sources that align with Google's EEAT model, meaning sources that exemplify experience, expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness. With third-party voices holding even greater weight, brands need to partner with credible outlets to proactively:Ensure consistency in how the brand and its values are expressed across the web. This starts with demonstrating authority in your own content but extends to publishing clear initiatives and brand guidelines, so it is easier for third parties to represent your company accurately.Prevent misinformation by routinely reviewing content related to the company and contacting outlets to correct errors and provide context.Mitigate negative third-party information by quickly (and diplomatically) addressing critical feedback, whether from a journalist claiming greenwashing or a dissatisfied user.Related: How to Manage (and Monitor) Your Reputation on Social Media


3. Amplify your audience's diverse voicesAs the search experience evolves, brands don't have to wait idly to see how it changes public perception of their company. To continue maintaining and improving your reputation, focus on the user experiences that you can control by:Tailoring content and outreach to specific communities, especially underserved ones. This requires a nuanced understanding of audience demographics, user preferences and pain points that a brand can use to personalize content and the entire user experience.Collaborate and partner with a diverse group of voices. Avoid simply leveraging influencers and thought leaders for promotion and instead, build relationships based on shared values and mutual respect.Experimenting with new tools to improve the UX, like offering interactive content and real-time personalization. Harness data analytics and machine learning to deliver content that best meets each user's needs at the moment. As third-party cookies are phased out, personalization faces new challenges, but emerging tech also means new possibilities.Putting SGE principles into actionWhile the deeper causes of customer complaints will now surface more easily, your newsroom should not be the first responder to reputation challenges. Take the hypothetical case study of an online retailer for strategies likely to have the greatest impact in the SGE landscape:Empowering consumer confidence: When customers complain about inaccurate sizing and product descriptions, the brand responds by creating size guides, fit quizzes and virtual dressing rooms.Responding to customer concerns: Shipping delays and high shipping costs frustrate customers. So, the brand ramps up communications about wait times and offers transparent pricing breakdowns. Plus, they integrate a third-party app to keep customers updated on order status.Strengthening shared values: Journalists report on unsustainable manufacturing practices in the retail industry. In response, the company begins publishing quarterly reports on its ESG commitments and shares stats and stories on social media to improve transparency.Proactively shaping customer experiences: Unresponsive customer service reps and slow order processing fuel dissatisfaction. The brand rolls out social listening and sentiment analysis tools to act on real-time data. They also empower their team to offer fast, concrete resolutions.As SGE becomes deeply integrated into search experiences, reputation management is now a continuous conversation, not a one-time fix. Stay engaged with your audience, listen to their concerns and proactively address issues as they arise. Don't spin or bury negative information. Instead, take responsibility and demonstrate your commitment to improvement. For brands with the right mindset, SGE is not a threat but an opportunity to create better products, services and experiences that resonate with your audience.

Authenticity and trust are the foundations of successful customer relationships.

Cultivating an environment of authenticity and trust fosters customer loyalty, ensuring that individuals consistently return for products and services, becoming lifelong customers and brand advocates.Related: Considering franchise ownership?

Just one instance of perceived deception can unravel years of painstakingly constructed trust, leading to an exodus of customers and potentially irreversible reputational damage.Establishing trust and authenticity demands a proactive and firm commitment from businesses. It entails unwavering transparency in operations, ensuring that products and services meet the highest quality standards every time, and promptly and professionally addressing customer inquiries and feedback.

33,How to Build and Maintain a Truly Resilient Company Culture,"Mar 18, 2024",Roy Dekel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-build-and-maintain-a-truly-resilient-company-culture/470847,"
In business, resilience has emerged as a necessity rather than a regrettable afterthought. It's described as the ability to bounce back from challenges, whether they are based on adversity, conflict or failures.However, I believe resilience extends beyond personal capabilities. A truly resilient company cultivates collective strength as a culture, particularly beneficial for industries such as real estate with a cycle of unpredictable markets.At SetSchedule, resilience is not just a trait, it is an ideology woven into the fabric of our business strategy.Related: 8 Ways Successful People Master ResilienceRedefining strategic intent for fostering growth and reinforcementBeginning as a marketplace for realtors to meet and exchange leads, SetSchedule's scope was initially quite narrow.



As the company evolved, we noticed bigger challenges permeating the real estate industry. These challenges presented the opportunity to be more than just another real estate tech startup. Driven by a strategic intent for greater resilience, we recognized our duty to provide a more expansive solution for our clientele and the entire industry.Phil Rosenzweig adequately demonstrates the importance of strategic intent. In his book, The Halo Effect...and The Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers, he notes that reinventing strategic intent can guide companies as they adapt to fluctuating market conditions, growing needs and cultural evolution.We discovered this to be true on our journey to becoming a resourceful networking platform democratizing the real estate process.The challenges involved during the transition contributed to the strength of our culture, reinforcing its resilience.


A resilient company culture calls for a collaborative endeavorResilience must be embedded into the structures of the organization's culture, absorbing influence from every team member irrespective of their designation. This inclusive buy-in ensures everyone understands the company's mission, aims and values.Jim Collins, in his seminal business guide, Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...And Others Don't, describes the importance of getting the right people on the bus and in the right seats before defining the journey.This encapsulates our philosophy at SetSchedule. Endeavoring to ensure everyone's understanding of our vision, we cultivate a robust culture capable of navigating the stormy seas of the real estate market with composure.Embracing learning as a catalyst for resilienceIngraining the ethos of continual learning in the work culture engenders resilience. Challenges are viewed as stepping stones, opportunities to learn and grow.By fostering a culture that promotes learning, we're amassing collective resilience, which helps us recover quickly and efficiently after setbacks or failures.Carol S. Dweck, known for her work on mindsets, has noted that organizational resilience is tied to promoting a growth mindset. Unlike a fixed mindset, which views capabilities as static, a growth mindset values the journey of constant learning, evaluation and growth.Related: Resilience Is One of the Most Essential Entrepreneurial Traits. Practicing This Can Help You Build It.Building resilience through emotional intelligenceAt my company, another cornerstone for the development of a resilient work culture is emotional intelligence.


Steering through setbacks requires employees who can understand and manage their emotions. Emotional self-awareness, empathy and interpersonal effectiveness help not only in navigating personal challenges but also in fostering positive workplace relationships.Encouraging these aspects within our team has led to better stress management and conflict resolution, two crucial components of resilience.Resilience through social responsibilityEngagement in social responsibility initiatives enhances organizational resilience by building strong relationships with the community and stakeholders. It demonstrates a commitment to more than just profit, showcasing a dedication to societal growth and well-being.This, in turn, strengthens the brand and fosters a sense of pride and purpose within the team.


My company actively participates in and supports various community engagement programs. We've found that this not only uplifts the communities we serve but also enriches our company culture, imbuing our team with a sense of purpose that transcends the daily grind.Long-term vision for sustained resilienceFinally, resilience is not just about the short-term bounce back; it's also about sustaining that momentum into the future. It requires a clear long-term vision that can guide decision-making, strategy formulation and cultural development. This vision must be adaptable, capable of evolving as external conditions change, but always offering a beacon for the company's direction.We continuously refine our vision, ensuring it remains relevant and inspiring for our team. This long-term perspective helps us frame our everyday actions and challenges within a broader context, providing clarity and motivation even in tough times.Related: From Setback to Success — 4 Ways to Turn Your Struggles into Resilience


In wrapping up, SetSchedule's journey towards building and maintaining a resilient company culture is multifaceted, grounded in strategic intent, collective effort, continual learning, emotional intelligence, transparent communication, innovation, employee well-being, social responsibility and a steadfast long-term vision.These elements combined fortify our ability to adapt and thrive amid adversity, ensuring we remain relevant in the face of the unpredictable dynamics of the real estate industry.The path toward building such a culture is persistent and evolving but ultimately rewarding. It ensures that, regardless of the challenges we face, we have the foundation to not just endure but to grow stronger and more cohesive in our endeavors.

34,3 Ways Founders Can Connect With Their Customers to Drive Sales,"Mar 18, 2024",Thomas Strider,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-effective-ways-to-connect-with-your-customers/470871,"
In today's market, the bond between founders and customers is more than a transaction; it's the cornerstone of sustainable growth and brand loyalty. Modern consumers want authenticity more than ever. They find it difficult to connect with faceless entities and want to follow people rather than businesses.This shift towards personal connection in marketing stems from a saturated market where consumers are bombarded with choices and advertisements daily. Personal stories and authentic interactions cut through the noise in this crowded space, creating a memorable impression. Consumers crave realness and transparency at a time when these qualities are scarce in the world of business.So, how do you go about deepening your connection with your target audience? Here are three strategies that can turn your customer interactions into a powerful engine for sales growth.



1. Personalize your approach with behind-the-scenes storytellingIt's one thing to sell a product. It's another to tell a story and share fascinating details that resonate.Imagine a founder sharing their journey, the highs and lows, through a series of behind-the-scenes content. This narrative isn't about humanizing the brand; it's about creating a shared experience. When customers see the sweat and tears behind a product, they're not just buying an item; they're investing in a piece of your process and founder's story.


So, how do you start?Weekly emails or social media posts that peel back the curtain on your process make customers feel like they're part of your journey. To do this effectively, begin by mapping out key milestones in your company's history or product development process. For each milestone, identify a story or challenge you faced and how you overcame it. These stories form the basis of your content.Next, use visuals like photos, videos, or even simple sketches to bring these stories to life. Visual content not only increases engagement but also helps to humanize your brand further.In your communication, be transparent about the obstacles you've encountered and how you've addressed them. This transparency fosters trust and relatability. Moreover, invite your audience to contribute their thoughts or similar experiences through comments or direct messages, turning your storytelling into a two-way conversation.


Publicly tell people the ""why"" behind your products, services, and company by integrating customer testimonials or user-generated content that aligns with your narrative. This validates your claims and amplifies your community's voice, making your brand's story part of their own stories.Like successful pitch decks showcase the story behind your brand, so should your content marketing and advertisements. Bringing the ""real"" to your business breeds authenticity, and that authentic connection will drive your business's growth. Remember, the goal is to broadcast and engage in meaningful conversations that build long-term relationships.Related: 8 Effective Ways to Connect With Your Customers2. Leverage technology for personal connectionsAI tools are booming, so personal connection using automation seems like an oxymoron. Yet, technology can be the very tool that brings you closer to your ICP.


Consider implementing AI chatbots that do more than answer queries. Work with tools, consultants, and language model professionals to custom-tailor AI to chat with your customers.Implement these chatbots on your company website and train them to initiate conversations based on customer behavior. Offer personalized recommendations or even simply check in with website visitors. Sometimes, a simple ""How are things going?"" goes a long way, and this part of your customer experience can be automated.This approach won't replace human interaction, of course, but it will enhance it by making your brand present and proactive in your customer's lives.The key? Ensure these AI communications feel personal and specific, not just like another automated message in their inbox or as a popup. This takes a bit more effort to implement, but the investment is worth it for the long-term growth of your brand and business.

Create exclusive communitiesImagine a space where your customers can gather to discuss your product and share their stories, challenges and triumphs.There's a particular company on the rise called Skool, which enables businesses and personal brands alike to do just this. Other great platform choices, such as Circle, Mighty Networks or Kajabi, enable seamless community building. These platforms allow you to make posts and help your customers, but they also give users the flexibility to post and communicate with each other.An exclusive community for customer discussion could take many other forms as well: a Facebook group, a Slack channel or a dedicated forum on your website.


The goal for your community is to foster a sense of belonging and mutual support, turning your customer base into a tight-knit community. Offer insider access, sneak peeks, and the opportunity for feedback. The more valued and listened that customers feel, the more likely they are to advocate for your brand organically.Over the long term, these communities become a word-of-mouth marketing machine.

35,Laughter Is a Universal Language — Here's How to Use It to Empower Your Team,"Mar 18, 2024",Bradley Hook,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/want-to-boost-your-teams-performance-make-them-laugh/470237,"
Sir David Attenborough once observed, ""It is through play that the lion cubs develop agility."" When navigating meeting rooms of large corporations, I see the word ""agile"" scrawled on whiteboards almost everywhere. Yet I rarely encounter a culture that embodies play. In a time marked by burnout, chronic stress and overwhelm, perhaps laughter is the best medicine for cultivating a culture of calm readiness.But like well-being, you can't simply manufacture a positive culture. It requires active leadership participation. That's where you come in. Leadership is not management; it's about deeply connecting on a human level, inspiring a collective journey toward a shared vision. Laughter, in this realm, serves as a universal language, breaking down barriers of culture and rank to knit an environment rich in trust, openness and mutual respect. When leaders harness laughter with genuine intent, it doesn't just ease tension — it becomes a catalyst for collaboration and fulfillment.Related: Want to Build Relationships? Find Ways to Laugh Together.



Why laughter matters more than everLaughter is a strategic asset, building resilience and promoting a flourishing work environment. It boosts endorphins, lowers stress and forges strong social bonds, enabling teams to navigate challenges with flexibility and innovative thinking. Laughter also indicates an environment of psychological safety, where team members feel secure and valued, encouraging open communication and risk-taking without fear of ridicule or retribution. This psychological safety is foundational for trust and innovation, leading to significant ROI for organizations. Companies that prioritize a safe environment report higher levels of engagement, reduced turnover rates and increased productivity. In essence, laughter not only enriches the workplace culture but also serves as a catalyst for tangible, positive outcomes in organizational performance and employee satisfaction.A study by Bennett, M.P., & Lengacher, C. (2006) underscores this, revealing that laughter can significantly reduce stress and improve natural killer cell activity, thus enhancing the body's defense against illnesses. This aligns with the findings of Dunbar, R.I., et al. (2012), who discovered laughter's ability to increase pain tolerance — and I'm sure you'll agree that work can be painful sometimes.


Resilience through laughter and humorResilience isn't merely about bouncing back; it's about growing through adversity. It is the gateway to antifragility. Laughter and humor inject a sense of perspective and lightness into the workplace, enabling individuals and teams to view setbacks not as insurmountable obstacles but as opportunities for growth. This cognitive flexibility empowers individuals and organizations to navigate the uncertainties of the business landscape with decisiveness and agility.Research by Papousek, I., et al. (2017) showed that laughter immediately increases mood and well-being, emphasizing laughter's protective effect against mental health challenges. Moreover, a study by Tugade, M.M., & Fredrickson, B.L. (2004) highlights how laughter and positive interactions enhance social bonds and collective problem-solving abilities, promoting a collaborative and innovative work environment.Aligning humor with organizational valuesHowever, laughter and humor must resonate with the core values of an organization to be effective. Humor that is inclusive and respectful will strengthen team cohesion and uphold the dignity of all members. Therefore, leaders must model and encourage forms of humor that align with the organization's values, cultivating an environment where every team member feels a sense of connection and belonging. I recommend starting with observational humor and silly one-liners, perhaps of the eye-rolling ""dad-joke"" variety (even if you're not a dad). Some low-risk examples of workplace jokes are:""Lately, coworkers have been writing names on the food in the office fridge. I'm currently eating a sandwich named Kevin.""""You know what can really ruin a Friday? Remembering it's Thursday.""""What's the best thing about teamwork? Someone else to blame.""Avoid sarcasm or laughing at the expense of others — that includes a nightmare client or employee who has departed. Remember, jokes are inherently viral.Related: How to Use Humor at Work Without Acting Like a JerkA blueprint for leadersTo integrate laughter into leadership effectively, leaders can:Model behavior: Demonstrate the value of laughter, setting a tone that encourages light-hearted interactions. Start with a smile; sometimes, that is enough. Notice your posture and voice tone when you speak. Emotions are contagious, so be the change you wish to see.Cultivate a joyful environment: Build a culture where laughter and humor are normalized, ensuring they are inclusive and aligned with company values. Ask team members to share what made them laugh over the preceding week. Build humor as a micro-habit.Celebrate with laughter: Use humor to celebrate successes and navigate challenges, bolstering a growth mindset. Try starting and ending meetings with humor rather than diving straight into the agenda or concluding on a serious note. Ask, ""What went well?"" instead of dwelling unnecessarily on negativity.Embrace authenticity: Share moments of humor that are true to you, building trust and authenticity. Your trials and tribulations — and how you've learned to laugh at them — can inspire others to see the lighter side of their challenges.Integrating laughter into leadership is not just about adding moments of joy; it's about building a more cohesive and innovative team. Laughter, when aligned with an organization's core values, becomes a powerful tool in the leader's arsenal, increasing well-being and elevating performance. In the quest for organizational excellence, embracing laughter is embracing the future of leadership, where challenges are met with agility, resilience and joy.

36,3 Ways to Make Sure Every Aspect of Your Business Ties Back to Your Purpose,"Mar 15, 2024",Nancy Solari,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-ways-to-build-a-company-culture-based-on-your-purpose/470280,"
In the flow of a workday, it's easy to spend your time putting out fires — we've all been there. This reactionary brand of management results in a disconnected, chaotic feeling for everyone from the workforce to the customers. Focusing on your original vision for your company can create a synergy that connects your staff, your clients and the community you serve.It's possible to create a culture of purpose in your workforce and keep a positive, engaging reputation in the marketplace, but this will require that your executive team stays true to the original motivation you had in your mind and heart when you began your journey in business.Related: Embrace Your Purpose As a Path to Success



1. Capture standout employees in the interviewLeadership and staff can work together to discover common ground and agree on goals, but this process begins in the interview. One of the best predictors of loyalty is a candidate's desire to focus on meaningful work.I run my company as a blind CEO. When I interview a candidate, I mostly want to learn why they want to work for me. I'm always shocked when job seekers reveal they have never been to the website as opposed to those who are excited to share why they feel connected to our mission. When I interview a candidate, it's often the vulnerability in their answers that speaks to me. Sometimes the person I'm interviewing tells me of a personal disability or limitation, which to me is an act of openness and transparency. I love to hear people say they are passionate about working in an inspirational environment. When our conversation begins, I'm listening for a story.


What many candidates don't know is the interviewer is waiting for them to have their breakout moment. This departure from the usual Q&A often reveals their passion for the work or vulnerability.It's important to make sure your interview questions allow you to see a prospective employee's connection to your mission. You can start by asking candidates what measurable impact they would like to make in the position offered. You can also find out how they envision their work life five years from now.2. Create a culture of engagementDoing purposeful work means the executive team must create educational opportunities for staff as well as clients, extending engagement with the company beyond ""business hours."" This is a chance to show your team and your customers that their needs matter beyond the job description or the product or service you offer.Having a corporate reputation as a company that births new leaders and supports hard work and ambition will go a long way toward retaining good team members with the savvy to innovate, create and energize your workforce. Whether it is a group meeting or a corporate retreat, it's important to mix staff together, allowing employees from across departments and positions to collaborate, exchange ideas, rise as leaders and support each other.


This kind of shift can start by simply reassigning tasks or creating challenges that give employees a chance to spread their wings. You can take some projects off the administrative assistant's plate or reassign some items on the to-do list to a staff member who has shown initiative. A team member could send out invitations to meetings or reminders to committee members taken from a list of goals. A staffer could also create a committee to help plan a corporate event and see it through.Keep a watchful eye on employees who stand out and give them the opportunity to be seen as experts. Let some be advisors, coaches or provide support to other team members. This will make the staff feel recognized and encourage others to rise to that purposeful level. This kind of support will give you a ""pool"" of potential leaders, helping your team members feel that their contributions are noticed and rewarded.Related: 3 Reasons Why a Strong Purpose Is a Good Business Idea3. Build a positive online reputation for your businessAlthough you can never eliminate negative reviews, the best approach to a positive corporate reputation is actively implementing a variety of ways to get reviews from employees and customers alike. While it's estimated that 99% of customers read reviews from time to time, only 13% would choose a product or service from a company with a two-star rating.


There are several proven ways to generate positive reviews. The process can be as simple as using comment cards. You can also ask for an email address from the customer. Some businesses have a physical ""register;"" others have an email link where people can sign in and provide this information. From there, it's easy to follow up and ask for a rating or comment. Other stores offer rewards in exchange for reviews. This offer is usually seen on banners or signs within the physical store, on the receipt (physical or via email) or on the company's homepage. Some businesses use a QR code leading directly to the online review spot; you have likely seen a kiosk within the store allowing immediate feedback.Another way to generate rave reviews is to get endorsements or recommendations from businesses you have partnered with over the years. These allies can speak of important attributes of your company that go beyond a rating system or short comment and may attract traffic to your website and new clients responding to the positive vibes.The mantra ""If you don't ask, you don't get"" works well here. There are more ways to get positive feedback for your business than ever before thanks to evolving technology. Rather than running from a corporate fear of bad reviews, make it your business to seek and obtain the best reviews by engaging the community in the process.You can direct your company's reputation by finding new ways to engage your workforce and the people you serve. By promoting outstanding employees, offering training and opportunities for leadership and by making positive feedback a priority, your company can stop putting out fires and start basking in the culture of purpose you always intended.

37,Being Customer Centric Has Nothing To Do With Your Customers — Here's Where You Should Start.,"Mar 15, 2024",Andrea Olson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-customer-centricity-has-nothing-to-do-with-customers/470685,"
Many companies struggle to understand what it means to be a customer-centric organization. While a somewhat amorphous concept, the most common definition is ""to put the customer at the center of everything you do."" This idea is frequently translated into new policies, procedures and processes, all intended to establish a more customer-centered operation. However, many of these efforts will fail.In fact, according to McKinsey, around 70% of all customer-centric change initiatives don't succeed, not because of unclear directives but a lack of bottom-up support. Leaders continually overlook the power of culture and its gravitational pull to fight change.A customer-centric culture cannot occur simply through consensus or mandate, especially if it starts solely to increase top-line sales and earnings per share — these are merely outcomes of an inherent behavioral shift. Behaviors cannot change without all employees, management, executives and board members aligned on why a customer-centric culture is good business.



A successful customer-centric behavioral change strategy begins with understanding your change context — the pattern of influencing factors that shape how change is perceived and adopted within the company. Though change contexts vary widely across organizations, leaders can benefit from recognizing their unique context, from which more tailored strategies can be constructed.Related: 5 Reasons Why You Should Speak Up More — Especially If You Are a Younger Employee


For instance, Company A might identify its organizational change context as strong in tactical execution but weak in strategic thinking, with one specific team—information technology—being the most historically resistant to change. In addition, it might determine that the sales team will likely be early adopters and strongly influence other departments.Once the changing context is defined, leaders must identify its positive and negative aspects, where roadblocks and advantages may occur for customer-centric change adoption. This includes identifying behaviors, catalysts and inhibitors of customer-centric change.Behaviors are actions and conduct that would support or derail your customer-centric end state. Catalysts positively influence those behaviors, ranging from incentives to processes to make it easier for employees to perform customer-centric activities more effectively. Inhibitors include those elements which create resistance to change, whether social, operational, or cultural.Behaviors aligned with customer-centric objectives may include customer service team members staying on the phone to ensure a customer issue is resolved rather than attempting to meet call time metrics or an individual employee sending hand-written thank you cards to their assigned customers. Catalysts could include customer decision-making autonomy for individual departments or flexibility in customer satisfaction expenditures. Inhibitors might range from a rigid organizational structure, narrow compensation philosophy, or caustic leadership on key teams.Related: One of the Biggest Mistakes Aspiring Entrepreneurs — and Almost Everybody — Make


After these cultural influences have been fully mapped, leaders can create tailored interventions to shift mindsets, eliminate inhibitors, reinforce aligned behaviors and leverage change agents to introduce and model new ones. These interventions should be articulated as part of a change philosophy that fits the organizational change context. Depending on the context, interventions can include common elements such as organizational structure re-architecture or the implementation of new systems and tools to streamline customer interactions.In this situation, Company A could create a set of behavioral and mindset interventions, including amplifying beneficial behaviors by publicly highlighting employees who demonstrate desired behaviors, recognizing teams throughout the organization that create new ideas aligned with the customer-centric vision, and reshape the company's social network to link distinct individuals and groups around mutually beneficial goals or ideas.Related: Your Differentiators Suck. Follow These 5 Steps to Stand Out From Your Competition.Once leaders have expanded their view of possible change, they can better conceive and utilize more varied interventions. This can be supported through cross-industry research to identify relevant precedents and creative interventions rather than solely relying on personal experience.Until new behaviors and mindsets are rooted in the organization's social norms, they are subject to degradation. Interventions increase employees' interest and ability to accept and enact customer-centric change.

38,The Secret Sauce to Entrepreneurial Success — Why Your Business Needs a Diverse Team Now!,"Mar 15, 2024",Chris Kille,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-your-business-needs-a-diverse-team-now/470607,"
Have you ever considered why some businesses are just ""on point"" while others keep getting lost in the market? It isn't the product or even the service at all times. Sometimes, it is people who matter. No, not just spending the time joining and contributing to different clubs — what I meant was a diverse team!Regarding entrepreneurship, diversity isn't just one of those popular words; it's your most reliable tool. It makes us stand out, separates us from the rest and allows us to shine. Therefore, it is worth exploring why building a diverse team shouldn't just be considered an option. It should be considered a necessity, and in this article, I'll explain why.Related: Diverse Teams Drive Innovation in Ways Homogeneous Teams Just Can't



1. Humanize: The embodiment of ingenuityThe different perspectives and experiences of diverse teams make them innovation powerhouses. When you combine different backgrounds, experiences and outlooks, you're not just adding; you're increasing the possibilities that your team has to be creative. A blend of diversity, creativity and innovation is born, which can help you stand out in a heavily crowded marketplace.2. Decision-making becomes a lot betterA thing of the past is the moments when echo chambers prevail and groupthink happens. Working in a multidisciplinary team offers a broad base of possible perspectives during the decision-making process, where the final choices must be comprehensive, balanced, and most importantly, effective. It is almost like having an internal consultancy group!


3. Mirror the market, encompass the marketThe customers you have are diverse. Why don't you get a team that reflects this diversity? A team with a diverse background can be of significant value by offering in-depth insights into different market segments, thus improving the business's ability to connect with the public. It's a straightforward formula: Take your market knowledge to the next level, and serve your market better.4. Talent magnetThe top-tier professionals align with companies that highly value diversity and inclusion. You aren't just ensuring a multicultural workplace but also creating a new norm that will be a magnet for the best candidates in the industry. It's a unique selling proposition that will ultimately be your brand's trademark.5. Increase the employee satisfaction, and retain the employeesEmployees who are engaged and part of a culture that makes them feel valued and heard will succeed and thrive. A team with different backgrounds and identities automatically creates a sense of belonging for its members, which promotes employee satisfaction and helps with retention. The cheerful and productive employees are not just the best brand ambassadors, but they also multiply your profits.6. Enhanced problem-solving skillsDiversity is far more than just a mere representation of how we look. It brings a variety of problem-solving approaches to the table. Each team member might possess a wide range of such skill sets, which can allow the team to tackle problems from diverse angles simultaneously and consequently discover solutions that most people do not know.


Related: Diversity in the Workplace: Benefits and Why You Need It7. Global perspective for global successIn a world where globalization is being strengthened each day, the composition of a team with different cultural backgrounds is your access to success at a world level. They can overcome cross-cultural obstacles and master global markets to reframe the problems as economic chances.8. Resilience like never beforeThe variety of views in a team makes it a robust team. Due to various cultural views and their abilities, they can rapidly adapt and become more viable after a blow. This adaptivity is a factor that is necessary today due to the constantly changing business environment.9. Ethical leadership and corporate responsibilityEthical leadership and corporate social responsibility (CSR) have also become integral to business operations. Assembling a uniquely diverse team is not only good for business, but it is the right way to do things. It stands for the ethics and social principles of equal treatment and supports your brand's image and reputation.


10. Financial performance to envyLet's talk numbers. The studies continue to portray that diverse teams perform well and are connected to better financial results. Diversity isn't just a moral responsibility but also a financial responsibility.And so, how do you ensure that your concept becomes a reality? Be stringent with the hiring process you are employing. Look also at the ponds of creativity. Build an inclusive environment where various views are not only allowed but also appreciated. Offer training and development programs that allow the whole population to show their talent and share their qualities.Related: Diversity and Inclusion Best Practices for Your WorkforceHaving a diverse team is good and essential for the continuous success and innovativeness of any organization in a dynamic business environment. That is encouraging a work environment that mirrors our world, then drawing from the vastness of experiences, perspectives and skills to further boost your business.


So, leap. Many entrepreneurs mistakenly think that success comes from homogenizing their client base. However, I recommend that you embrace diversity and watch your business transform. In the conductor of a corporate symphony, it's a harmony of instruments playing together that gives the most beautiful music. Why not make your office be the exhibition of your artistry?

39,Making the Strong Business Case for Driving Human Brilliance,"Mar 15, 2024",Fasika Melaku,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-harness-human-brilliance-to-power-organizational/470753,"
Twenty years ago, when I first worked with my current CEO at a different company, she taught me what it truly meant to always think about the human element first. When she promoted me, she launched my professional journey, but she also did something I'll never forget — she invited me over for wine.At the time, she was a director, and I had only just started as a manager. I was one of two African Americans working at the company and an immigrant. I often felt that reality with others, but never with her. I remember asking myself, ""Does she not see that we're so different?""Her invitation was the first time I saw someone create a space for human brilliance. Fast-forward 20+ years, and she is at it again. As my current CEO, she is still creating spaces for me to do my best work, fueling my career to Senior Vice President of HR and Chief Learning Officer at Denny's. When human brilliance thrives, we create positive change: where we sit, work, and live in the world and for an organization.



Related: How To Attract (And Encourage) Brilliance In Your WorkplaceWe do our best when brilliantHuman brilliance is different for everyone. Like a stone polished to its gemlike core, bringing out an individual's brilliance is smoothing away externally imposed ideas to uncover raw, authentic thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. We bring out our strengths from that essence and polish them to our ultimate brilliance.


Human brilliance is not just what we get right, but all the times we fail, realize where we went wrong, and learn. Years ago, we ran the ""Surprise and Delight"" campaign, a marketing initiative that included surprising our guests by paying for their meals. By leaving extra cash in their pockets and treating them with unexpected kindness, we put our guests in a position to do better, achieve more and positively impact more people in their day.We considered the campaign successful, but reflecting, we realized we could have done more. Our current CEO joined the organization and established a new level of thinking: impact comes when those who create impact — our teams. She asked how we surprised and delighted the cooks, servers and staff. By not considering the rest of the team, that successful campaign missed an opportunity to create more points of exponential brilliance across the organization.Related: Eight Steps To Build Teams That LastMake the most of time and moneyIn my most challenging moments — heartache, illness, even death — I often realize the preciousness of time. These moments teach us that any time spent on being our most brilliant selves is an invaluable investment into who we can become and the impact we can have on the world. By helping others realize the value of investing time in developing their brilliance, I simultaneously help myself realize mine.


Time is a precious commodity in business, and the cost of capital has reached an all-time high. Not harnessing the full potential of a team's talents is a lost financial opportunity. When leaders focus on enhancing the brilliance within their organization, they unlock a competitive edge. It starts with just one person believing they can make a positive difference; this inspires others, creating a domino effect. When individual brilliance is connected and amplified, we cultivate collective wisdom, accelerate innovation, boost performance, and ultimately increase profitability.Related: Seven Ways You Can Establish Loyalty (And Even Love) In Your TeamBrilliance thrives in safetyBrilliance thrives in environments where everyone feels safe to authentically express their ideas and identity — to learn, fail, and cry ugly tears. When an organization provides such an ecosystem, it evolves into a community, and its people find a common purpose in doing their best work together. Upon this stage, we create places of brilliance. To build this foundation:1. Help remove self-limiting beliefsMany of us struggle with self-limiting beliefs that can hinder our ability to support ourselves or contribute effectively to others. I was recently diagnosed with chronic self-doubt. When leadership once presented me with an advancement opportunity, better pay, and an improved title that could open future doors, I hesitated and, ultimately, said no. This was not for a lack of qualifications but rather my self-limiting beliefs preventing me from fully committing to my organization and unleashing the full scope of human brilliance within me.


By cultivating gratitude and resilience, we can tackle these doubts head-on and inspire our teams to develop these crucial qualities. When facing self-limiting beliefs, I practice pausing and engaging in deep reflection. I ask myself, ""What's preventing my progress right now, and how can I navigate past it to unlock my true potential?"" Acknowledging obstacles and actively seeking ways to surmount them encourages growth.Related: Why Gratitude is the Missing Piece to Your Success2. Understand the existing frameworkEvery group of people has its own culture. When I greet someone from my Ethiopian heritage with three kisses on the cheek to represent warmth and connection, this customary gesture is unique to that culture. Similarly, within any organization, unique methods of connection and communication prevail, reflecting its distinct cultural environment. Leaders aiming to unlock the potential of human brilliance should first aim to understand and support the existing group connection.The approach must capture everyone for it to succeed, so get to know people and really listen. Putting in the work to understand them and meet them at their table helps pave the way for more authentic connections and a stronger foundation for collective brilliance.3. Build upon strengthsOnce at their table, I explore questions like: What is the general language of connection and can everyone easily understand it? How does our communication foster inclusivity? What rituals define and unite us? Just as childhood rituals shape our identities and lay the groundwork for trust and unity within our families, the same happens in a company.


We uncover hidden cultural strengths and insights by thoroughly examining how people learn, engage, and show vulnerability. When new leaders enter an organization believing a complete cultural overhaul is needed, when it isn't, they waste time and money. Instead, they should focus on enhancing existing strengths, nurturing and supporting them to unlock significant impact and foster human brilliance.Working with 12 million people or one, with $1 or $1000 in your bank account — anyone can foster environments that illuminate the brilliance in others. Make mindful decisions to craft spaces for individuals to reach their fullest potential. Progress towards brilliance is a mosaic of smaller yet significant achievements — each one a spark of brilliance deserving of celebration in its contribution to the larger glow of success.

40,The Counter Service at Yo' Mama's Is Just As Unique As Its Name. Here's Why People Come Back for the Experience as Much as the Food.,"Mar 15, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-customer-experience-at-yo-mamas-is-just-as-unique-as/471207,"
The environment at Yo' Mama's, a comfort food restaurant in Birmingham, Alabama, is just what it sounds like: a warm space that makes customers feel at home. Owned and operated by Crystal Peterson and her family, the establishment wins over customers through its quick and engaging counter service.Crystal and her mom got their start selling food at jazz festivals in Florida back in 2011. When they moved into a brick-and-mortar in 2014, Crystal developed her unique business model through market research.""I actually [ate] at every single restaurant I could think of that could be comparable to [mine] and [looked] at what was missing,"" she revealed. ""Was it the customer service aspect? Was it the portion size? Was it the flavor?""



What she found was that counter service is a win for both the owner and the customer. When guests aren't waiting thirty minutes to order their food, Crystal doesn't have to stress about turning tables and can provide the quality customer service that is so crucial to success.It's also important to understand your customer base. Crystal's restaurant tends to draw in travelers and workers looking for a bite to eat during their mid-day break. Because of this, she aims to create a ""getaway"" space where customers can relax in the middle of a busy day and enjoy a delicious meal without worrying about long wait times.


Yo' Mama's regulars, like Yelp Elite Delia S., love the way Crystal and her staff approach customer service, greeting customers at the counter and walking them through the menu.""I remember the interpersonal contact that this restaurant does on a consistent basis,"" Delia said. ""The vibe I got was, 'We're excited you're here. We appreciate your business, and we also want to make this an establishment where you will continue to visit and tell other people about it.'""Key to Yo' Mama's top-tier service is Crystal's involvement in the business's day-to-day operations. She knows that morale starts from the top and makes an effort to be at the restaurant as often as she can, engaging with her staff and customers.""What I've known is that workers work better when the owner's in the building,"" she said. ""You get a better product, so the customer is more satisfied.""


Crystal has also made her business a hit by focusing on a niche. Her gluten-free menu attracts people who can't satisfy their dietary needs at just any restaurant, and it also creates an element of surprise and delight for customers who don't come in looking for gluten-free food and still enjoy their meal.This focus on accommodating dietary restrictions has helped Yo' Mama's create a strong community where every diner feels included.""I've literally had customers that have come in and cried because their kid has never been able to eat in a restaurant because they are gluten intolerant. And they [can] actually sit there and enjoy a meal with them instead of having to bring a snack in for them to eat or get[ting] food from another restaurant [to] bring to them.""Building this kind of welcoming and accessible space for the local community aids Crystal's ultimate goal as a business owner to support the local economy. She emphasized that if you and your neighbors don't spend your money where you live, nobody else will, especially if everyone commutes to larger cities or towns.


""You have to be a citizen, and [being] a citizen equates to using your money right by your house instead of going to the other side of town,"" she said.Spending money at Black-owned businesses, who are often hindered by stereotypes, is especially important. Delia makes an effort not only to visit local Black-owned businesses but shout them out on Yelp whenever she can, letting people know that these spots are for everyone to visit and enjoy.""Oftentimes in restaurants, I don't think the playing field is fair. As a Yelp Elite, I am more drawn to trying as many of the smaller, often Black-owned restaurants that our city has to offer because there's such a large Black community—but that doesn't mean that only Black people are eating Black food. Restaurants are spaces that have the ability to traverse across class, race, region. You go into Yo' Mama's, and you see a diversity of people there gathering around this comfort food.""Delia also makes sure all her reviews are thoughtful, filling gaps on Yelp Pages by uploading missing photos of dishes and menus and choosing not to post about negative experiences unless she has valuable tips for owners or other guests.


Crystal brings this same level of intentionality to her review responses as an owner. She has found that some consumers only review a business when they want to express frustration or have expectations that Crystal can't satisfy, like an issue with her pricing. She chooses not to let these customers bring down her energy or service-focused mindset. By managing her emotions in the face of backlash, Crystal is able to engage with customers in a more productive way.""Some [customers] are coming in looking to lose. Some of the problems that people have don't even include me. So if I can control my emotions to change your emotions, then maybe we can win this and you can actually enjoy the experience.""In addition to an inviting restaurant atmosphere, Yo' Mama's believes in:Understanding your customers and your role in the business community. Gain an edge by researching your competitors and thinking about how you can fill gaps in their offerings.Restaurants as a space for diverse, inclusive community. Accommodating the needs of all your customers, including those with dietary restrictions, can help everyone who enters your space feel seen and welcome.Being flexible in the face of chaos. Navigate unexpected business obstacles by keeping the well-being of your customers and staff at the forefront.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Crystal and Delia, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.

These days, keeping good employees can be difficult. Two of the biggest concerns for small business owners are hiring the right talent (60.7%) and retaining and motivating employees (33%), according to survey data from the nonprofit organization SCORE.A study from The Society for Human Resource Management found that, on average, it costs a company six to nine months of an employee's salary to find a replacement — and a Gallup poll revealed that more than half of employees who quit said their manager or organization could have done something to prevent it.Related: 4 Ways to Boost Your Employee Retention in an Uncertain EconomyBut what does preventing a mass exodus of talent actually look like?It can literally pay to draw on examples from some of the world's most successful billion-dollar firms. Although they have many more resources at their disposal than the average small business, many of their strategies do translate — and could mean the difference between keeping and losing your next great hire.Online small business lending company OnDeck compiled a list of the best retention approaches from companies like Google, Netflix, Walmart, Whole Foods and more. From coaching and mentoring employees on the path to senior roles to allowing them to work in a remote or hybrid setup, there are plenty of ways to show employees their value.Related: This Is How to Boost Employee Retention With Lifelong LearningCheck out OnDeck's infographic below to learn what it takes to ensure your employees stick around:Image Credit: Courtesy of OnDeck

42,5 Surprisingly Critical Employee Skill Sets in Demand for 2024,"Mar 14, 2024",Jason Zickerman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-invaluable-soft-skills-to-seek-in-your-next-hire/470695,"
A reporter once asked professional development guru Dale Carnegie how he was able to pull off hiring 43 millionaires. Carnegie responded that those people were not millionaires when they were hired. Rather, he had identified their potential and cultivated them into the successes they ultimately became. Carnegie, whose leadership insight was clearly ahead of its time, added, ""Men are developed the same way gold is mined. Several tons of dirt must be moved to get an ounce of gold. But you don't go into the mine looking for dirt. You go in looking for the gold.""The trick for business leadership and hiring managers is knowing what great potential looks like. And in all likeliness, you can't glean that from a resume, as the promise of an employee's greatness isn't necessarily evident from their current skill set or perhaps even their past jobs. Sure, experience and hard skills are important, but there are more powerful indicators of long-term success — gold, if you will — that are far better telltales of an employee's ability to flourish.The interesting thing here is that employees often aren't even conscious of their capacity for growth. While it is surely in one's best interest to have self-awareness related to one's natural talents and deficits, the onus is on leadership to recognize the potential for greatness within their employees. But often, those who should know best simply miss the ball when assessing and nurturing talent.



Many people, particularly those new to management, focus too heavily on identifying weaknesses and overcoming deficits in their employees. This is the dirt that Carnegie was referring to. Regardless of how successful we are, everyone (and I do mean everyone) possesses at least some challenges and shortcomings. We also all have certain behavioral profiles that work wonderfully in certain situations and not so great in others.As managers grow into true and effective leaders, they recognize that focusing on employees' faults rather than their potential is a losing game for everyone. For instance, a performance improvement plan (PIP) aims to address an employee's deficits rather than how to leverage their talents better. True or not, many workers feel that PIPs simply document their failures as a precursor to being let go. So, while PIPs are ostensibly designed to foster progress and growth, they often have the opposite effect due to their focus on the dirt. While the stats don't currently seem to exist, it would be interesting to learn what percentage of PIP recipients ever move on to advanced positions within that organization. I imagine it is astonishingly few.


More evolved and successful managers instead work purposefully to find and foster the strengths in each member of their team. Their job is to identify that gold in each individual and put them in positions where they can maximize their strengths for the betterment of themselves and the company.I know, I know. Your pushback is, ""What if the employee is actually untalented or unredeemable in some way?"" That reflects as much on the hiring process and HR management as it does on the employee in question. If a business finds itself making lousy hires after bad hires, the process is broken or is ironically due to talent deficits within the hiring manager. Somewhere along the line, the wrong attributes are being favored instead of the right stuff.Related: High Performers and High-Potential Employees Are Not One in the SameThe following are a few soft skills worth their weight in gold that you should look for in your next great hire.


1. Adaptability and resiliencyAn employee's ability to adapt is an exceptionally valuable characteristic and a strong indicator of long-term success. Adaptability means that an employee is not only quick on their feet, but also reflects an innovative, agile and agreeable spirit. Resiliency is reflected in their capacity to bounce back from misfires and overcome obstacles.2. CommunicationVerbal aptitude, writing ability and listening skills are invaluable talents that you should look for in every employee, regardless of their pay grade. Your entire team's ability to express themselves to others ultimately leads to better connection, improved collaboration and a more compelling company culture.Related: How to Delegate Effectively Without Ruining Your Team3. CreativityCreative thinkers are natural innovators. They not only offer fresh ideas and approaches but also inspire others to do the same. Creative thinkers tend to be your best problem solvers and are catalysts for organizational improvement and growth.


4. Leadership potentialWhile leaders can certainly be developed, natural leaders possess some key traits long before they ever climb the corporate ladder. Those best positioned for future leadership roles are wired to inspire those around them, demonstrate initiative and take ownership of their decisions regardless of their current title.Related: Feel Like an Imposter? Practice These 5 Habits to Beat Your Imposter Syndrome5. Continuous learningA hungry mind is a tremendous asset and a clear indicator of a growth mindset. An employee's drive to attain new knowledge reflects an incredible array of transferable skills, including increased capacities in problem-solving, collaboration, critical thinking and innovation. So, keep a keen eye out in your hiring process for job candidates with curious minds.As you begin to focus on the right skills in your hiring and employee development initiatives, you and your entire organization will surely be rewarded with all the riches you deserve.

45,6 Ways I've Achieved a Healthy Work-Life Balance as a Business Owner,"Mar 11, 2024",Kartik Jobanputra,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-master-work-life-harmony-with-these-simple-steps/469893,"
Collaboration is a powerful tool that has become increasingly essential in the modern business world. Working together with others can help drive growth, innovation, and success. My journey with collaboration caused me to discover some hacks that have improved my work-life balance.This article will explore the importance of these hacks and provide some tips for re-prioritizing your work-life relationship and using it to achieve your goals.Related: Why Strong Collaborations Will Change Your Business



1. Set clear boundariesThe first step to finding balance is to set clear boundaries between your professional and personal life. When you're working, focus solely on business tasks without letting any outside influences distract you.Similarly, when you're out of the office, ensure that work doesn't infringe upon your other activities or relationships. You must understand what lines must not be crossed for both sides of your life to remain healthy and balanced.


2. Prioritize your timeWhen managing your time as an entrepreneur, it's important to prioritize the most important tasks first. This means taking some extra time during the day or week to plan what needs to be done ahead of time so that nothing is left undone or forgotten about. Doing this will help keep task-related stress at bay and give you more freedom in determining how best to divide up the rest of your day or week into a manageable schedule.Additionally, don't forget to add some non-work-related activities into your schedule, such as exercise or leisurely activities — these can help provide much-needed respite from your otherwise hectic workloads.Related: 15 of the Best Time Management and Productivity Books of All Time3. Take regular breaksIt's easy for entrepreneurs to get caught up in their work and forget about taking regular breaks throughout their day. But breaks are essential for maintaining both physical and mental health — they can help reduce stress levels while providing an opportunity for creativity, too.


Try setting reminders on your phone or computer so that you take regular breaks throughout the day – this could mean stepping away from the desk for 10 minutes every hour or even going for a walk during lunchtime, if possible! Taking regular breaks will refresh your mind and body alike, helping you stay productive yet balanced over time.Related: How to Achieve A CEO Level of Focus by Breaking Habits and Taking Breaks4. Learn to say noAs an entrepreneur, it can be easy to overextend yourself by saying yes too often when asked for favors or projects outside of work hours — but learning when (and how) to say no can ultimately save considerable amounts of unnecessary stress in the long run.Don't feel guilty if you need to turn down certain requests; just politely explain why it's not possible at this particular time, perhaps offering alternative solutions depending on what may be suitable instead. By knowing when (and how) to say no without feeling guilty, entrepreneurs can find greater peace of mind while still being able to give back where needed most.


5. Schedule regular 'me time'Making sure that there is adequate 'me time' built into each week is essential – regardless if it's reading a book in silence, going out with friends, or simply enjoying a warm bath after work hours — whatever activity works best for giving yourself some much-needed rest. Having this type of downtime allows entrepreneurs ample opportunity to recharge their batteries before returning to business mode — allowing them to manage better stress levels associated with being constantly busy with numerous tasks at hand.6. Don't neglect your health and well-beingLastly - one key area that entrepreneurs needn't forget about balancing is their health & well-being; don't neglect to eat nutritious food regularly during working hours nor avoid exercise altogether either — these are paramount needs necessary for keeping one's energy levels high while reducing any risks associated from sitting down all day — thus ensuring both physical & mental well-being remains balanced over longer periods.ConclusionManaging a successful career and a satisfying lifestyle outside of work can be difficult but achievable, no matter what stage in business development one might find themselves at now.The key lies in understanding where our limits lie and setting clear boundaries between our personal life and professional obligations accordingly—along with scheduling sufficient 'me' time each week where necessary. Following such guidelines helps ensure balance remains intact over extended periods while promoting productivity and achieving success simultaneously, too.

46,The Little Coffee Shop That Asks Customers Not to Be Quiet,"Mar 8, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-little-coffee-shop-that-asks-customers-not-to-be-quiet/470902,"
Nirvana Soul in San Jose, California is not a place you go to bury yourself in a book or work quietly on your computer. Colorful artwork lines the walls, and upbeat music fills the air. You're bound to meet someone new during your visit as the conversational baristas and owners float around tables to chat with customers.Sisters Jeronica Macey and Be'Anka Ashaolu started the coffee shop in 2018 to create a space for belonging. They wanted people to have a space where they could experience community or come to make a friend. From day one, they've poured their efforts into curating an energizing and welcoming environment at the shop.Related: How This California Hot Spot Grew From Delivery-Only to Pop-Up Shop to Storefront



Nirvana Soul's tight-knit community feel is a huge appeal for customers, including Yelp Elite and Community Intern Camy T. A local college student, Camy frequents Nirvana Soul to study, work on art, and hang out with friends. ""Downtown coffee shops were missing that community aspect,"" she said. ""But when Nirvana Soul came into town, things shifted in my perspective. It became a hub for many college students for studying, creating art, showcasing their talent at open mic night, and meeting new people, especially creatives.""Be'Anka and Jeronica's team laid the foundation for the shop's accessible and inviting feel. Their friendly staff is eager to answer questions and make an effort to ""table tap,"" walking up to every customer to ask how they're doing and offer them water. ""We just try to put in little joyful moments, so [people] have great coffee and a great experience at the same time,"" Be'Anka said.


The owners acknowledge that their departure from the coffee shop's traditional head-down work environment can lead to misunderstanding and sometimes critical feedback. They've had to learn how to respond when critiques come from someone who might not be in their target audience.""Change is hard, right?"" Be'Anka asked. ""So sometimes, it's almost like a culture shock. We've had reviews where people say, 'This is not what a coffee shop is supposed to be.' And we're like, 'Okay, I hear you, but maybe it's just different than what you're used to and we can be a little more open-minded.'""Related: The Owners of This Texas Farmers Market Took a Big Gamble. Here's How It Paid Off Bigger Than They Dreamed.Reviews like these can actually be a useful way to set expectations for future customers about the shop experience. By clearly communicating how your business operates, future patrons will have a better sense of what to expect and can decide if it's a right fit for their needs. In her time running Nirvana Soul, Be'Anka has learned the value of all feedback, both positive and critical, in helping her optimize the customer experience.


Be'Anka also stressed the importance of sharing your feedback in the moment. While Camy loves the environment and food at Nirvana Soul, she mentioned in her 4-star review that the sweet flavors in her drink were overpowering. Critiques like these are easy fixes that Nirvana Soul's baristas are happy to accommodate in the moment.""We'd so much rather [hear in person] than read about it later because now you're out there in the world with a drink that you hate. We could have gotten you something better, and you're already gone,"" Be'Anka said.As a consumer, Camy feels a responsibility to provide thoughtful feedback, always striving to help businesses improve.""I think people get a bit into the realm of people-pleasing,"" she said. ""You want to make people feel good, but you're also sacrificing your own needs as a consumer by not letting a business know if something could be changed. We're in an era of improvement, of growth, and I think it's important to critique every now and again.""


As a business, in addition to being responsive to feedback, creating touchpoints with your customers on social media is an important way to make them feel like a valued part of your community. As Be'Anka builds up Nirvana Soul's social media presence, she makes an effort to reshare posts from customers whenever she can. These expressions of appreciation go a long way with regulars like Camy.Related: This Mom and Pop Ice Cream Shop's Success Comes Down to This Simple Phrase""I think it's really beautiful to exchange that back-and-forth with a business,"" Camy said. ""I come here frequently. You recognize that, you appreciate me as your customer, and I'm dedicated to your business.""Be'Anka also emphasizes the importance of being consistent and active on social media. If you find social media intimidating, start small. It's better to post one simple photo every day than to let the need for a ""perfect"" feed hold you back from posting.


""I just snap pictures of anything. It doesn't matter what it is. It could be a drink, it could be artwork, it could be a scene in the shop. You don't have to say much. You can describe what's in the photo. You can say 'good morning.' It doesn't even matter because tomorrow's another day and you should probably just post the next picture.""Above all, Nirvana Soul is a space for community, a key part of which is representation. During their six years in business, Be'Anka and Jeronica have featured the work of over 65 artists, including female artists and artists of color, with the intention of creating a space where diverse voices are seen and uplifted.While the shop celebrates its role as one of a handful of Black- and woman-owned businesses in San Jose, Be'Anka recognizes that the quality of the Nirvana Soul experience is what shines through to customers at the end of the day.""We know there's going to be people who find us because we're Black-owned,"" Be'Anka said. ""We also know that it's not going to be a one-and-done with them because they're going to come in, love the experience so much, and know that this is a Black-created experience. And then they'll come back and bring more people—because after a certain point, it's just awesome coffee and a great experience.""


In addition to staying true to your mission and vision, Nirvana Soul believes in:Engaging customers during their visit to your business. Create a space where they feel comfortable chatting, asking questions, and raising any concerns they may have.Maintaining an active social media presence. Consistent posts and reposts welcome customers into your online community and show your appreciation for their support.Using online reviews to understand, optimize, and set expectations for the customer experience. Learn when to implement critical feedback and when to accept that you can't provide what a certain customer is looking for.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Be'Anka and Camy, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.Available on: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Pandora and Soundcloud.Editorial contributions by Callie Morgan and Kristi Lindahl

With people spending so much time on social media and the internet, consumers see more brands than ever, which means they also have a more finely tuned awareness of aesthetics and brand idententies. In a 2023 survey, market research firm Hanover found that 75% percent of companies have overhauled their visual identities since 2020, and Lucidpress found that 45% of customers ""expect great design across marketing and sales collateral."" In other words, an outdated aesethetic costs you money. At the same time, no company can afford to revamp their design every few years, so it's important to find a look that stands out, and stands the test of time. Here, we talked to six brands on how they found a look that sparkles while conveying their core values.Image Credit: Courtesy of Methodology

48,Employee Morale Is More Than Pep Talks and High Fives — Here's How You Can Really Capture the Power of Team Spirit.,"Mar 8, 2024",Lissele Pratt,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/heres-how-you-can-really-capture-the-power-of-team-spirit/469967,"
As the founder of a growing company, I've seen firsthand just how crucial team spirit is. In those early days of building our business, we faced all sorts of challenges. But one particular moment sticks out in my mind. We were up against an extremely tight deadline, and it seemed like every obstacle imaginable was getting in our way. Instead of giving up, though, my brilliant team banded together.That experience really drove home the importance of team spirit for me. It's about more than just getting along — it's about truly believing in each other's abilities and lifting each other up when things get tough. Without that kind of teamwork, I honestly don't think we'd be where we are today.So, how can you ensure that your team, regardless of its size, harnesses the transformative power of team spirit? Let's explore.Related: Life's Too Short to Work With Incompatible People — Follow These 3 Secrets To Building High-Performing TeamsWhat is team spirit in an organization?Team spirit isn't just reserved for sports teams. No, it's just as crucial in business settings. Essentially, it's about fostering unity, trust and a shared purpose among your employees. It's creating an environment where everyone feels valued and supported, where their viewpoints and opinions matter. And, when you have a strong and united team, it leads to a whole host of benefits for your company, including:



Improved communicationIncreased collaborationBetter job satisfactionActive problem-solvingHow to create a good team spirit at your companyBuilding team spirit requires deliberate effort and nurturing. When the bonds among your team members are weak, it's time to roll up your sleeves and get to work on strengthening them. Here are some key steps to fostering team spirit within an organization:Encourage collaboration and teamworkThink of your team as a well-oiled machine — each person has their own role and responsibilities, but together, they're unstoppable. To foster collaboration, consider implementing the following actionable strategies:Establish clear team goals: Make sure everyone knows what they're working towards and how their piece fits into the bigger picture. When everyone's on the same page, it's easier to work together towards a common goal.Host brainstorming sessions: Schedule regular brainstorming sessions where everyone can share ideas and challenges and explore new possibilities. No idea is too big or too small and you should encourage everyone to contribute their thoughts.Invest in team-building activities: Make some time to get to know your team outside of work. Whether it's a team-building workshop, an offsite retreat or just grabbing lunch together, building those personal connections can go a long way.Related: This Four-Part Formula Can Help You Build Great TeamsClear communication is keyYou've probably heard the phrase ""communication is key"" more times than you can count, but let me tell you, there's a reason it's such a timeless mantra. When your team can communicate well with each other, they can better bond with each other. Here's how you can make sure everyone's voice is heard loud and clear:


Create a culture of transparency: Nobody likes feeling left in the dark. Make transparency a top priority by keeping everyone in the loop about important decisions, changes and updates. When everyone knows what's happening, it builds trust and prevents rumors from swirling.Embrace two-way communication: Communication is not just about talking but about listening. Make sure you're not just broadcasting information, but actively listening to what your team has to say. Whether it's through one-on-one check-ins, open-door policies or mentoring. At Capitalixe, we hold monthly mentoring sessions to get to know our team and their dreams and aspirations.Lead by example: As the leader, your actions speak louder than words. Be proactive about sharing information and soliciting feedback, be your team's biggest cheerleaders and be open to new ideas.Recognize your team's winsIt may seem like a simple gesture, but employee recognition goes a long way in boosting morale and keeping everyone motivated. Here's how you can make sure your team feels appreciated and valued for their hard work:Celebrate wins, big and small: Maybe your team has hit a major milestone or landed a new client. Or, maybe an individual is experiencing a personal win like an engagement. Celebrate their success. Host a team lunch, throw a work party or even just give a heartfelt shout-out during a team meeting. Celebrating wins together can do wonders in boosting team spirit.Create a culture of recognition: Make recognition and appreciation a regular part of your team culture. Encourage team members to recognize and celebrate each other's successes through peer-to-peer shoutouts, kudos boards and other recognition programs.Reward achievements: As well as verbal recognition and praise, consider offering actual rewards for team successes. This could be an annual bonus, extra paid time off or other incentives that praise your team for their hard work and dedication. When team members see that their efforts are being rewarded, it motivates them to continue giving their best.Related: Why Acknowledging Your Team Members Is Critical to Your SuccessFinal thoughtsSo there you have it. We've unpacked how team spirit can make or break an organization's performance. From my own journey, I've learned firsthand that the results speak for themselves when the team's spirit is strong.Team spirit isn't just about high-fives and pep talks — it's about creating a vibe where everyone's rowing in the same direction. To get there, it's all about encouraging teamwork and collaboration. You want your team to feel like they're part of something bigger like they're all in the same boat and paddling together towards a common goal. Communication is also key. So keep those lines open and make sure everyone's voice is heard, and don't forget to sprinkle in some recognition and celebration along the way.


So, let's keep the energy high, the communication flowing and the good work rolling. With the right team spirit, there's no limit to what you can achieve together.

50,Are the Days of Good Customer Service Over? These 7 Hacks Can Bring it to Life at Your Company,"Mar 7, 2024",Micah Solomon,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-revamp-your-customer-service-with-these-7-hacks/470299,"
As a customer service trainer, speaker, and consultant, I am approached by all sorts of people who tell me all sorts of things. Some refrains are, ""Customer service is dead,"" ""Nobody provides customer service like they did back in the day,"" or even, ""Kids these days don't know how to give good customer service.""I don't buy into this negative strain of sentiment. I think what's going on is that customer expectations have grown higher and higher, and customer service levels haven't kept up. But to the extent that today's customers — your potential customers — feel this way about your competitors in the marketplace, there's an extraordinary opportunity for your business to get ahead of the curve and use exceptional customer service as a competitive advantage.Related: 4 Ways Brands Can Educate Their Customers and Win HeartsAs a start, consider this list of pointers.1. Stress a pro-customer purpose to all employeesEmployees need to know that you want them to step away from their functional tasks if a purpose-driven task requires a different use of their time at the moment.



The thing about above and beyond customer service is that it, by definition, requires extra effort. These extra efforts are elective; employees (no matter what their delusional bosses may believe) can contribute or withhold at their discretion. We all know people who keep their work level just above where HR would come in with a performance improvement plan and thus stay under the radar without contributing much at all.You need to get that additional, creative effort out of your employees, and a key factor in doing so is in stressing, from onboarding onward, the importance of a pro-customer purpose that takes you above and beyond your functional, checklist-style duties.2. Empower employees at every level of your organizationIf you get serious about employee empowerment, you'll move a lot further and a lot more quickly toward being an organization where purpose-driven employees contribute their elective efforts. Exceptional customer service requires room for interpretation, with your employees making those interpretations, deciding, and bringing to life what exceptional customer service really looks like in action.And if they lack empowerment — power, really — they'll remain hobbled, no matter how good their intentions.Related: Want a Customer Service Revolution? Start By Changing Your Culture3. Review and revamp your employee selection (hiring) criteria.Restaurateur Danny Meyer has written and spoken eloquently about the mix of skill and attitude criteria that can reveal an ideal new employee together. Personality traits are generally stable and unlikely to change once people reach their 20s, so it's valuable to look for a pro-customer orientation in every potential employee you consider, alongside whatever skills criteria you are also screening for.4. Celebrate your customer service accomplishments companywideI suggest you systematize this celebration along the lines of what has worked for years—decades, actually — for the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company. Twice a week, every Ritz-Carlton hotel and resort shares a ""wow story"" of over-and-above hospitality from one of its more than 100 properties. This works wonders in inspiring all the employees who hear these stories to contribute similarly wow-level customer service themselves.5. Adapt to the rapid pace of response that modern customers expectReview and, if necessary, update your response times to meet today's customer expectations: What was ""fast enough"" a couple of years ago is no longer.Related: 4 Keys to Satisfying 21st Century Customers6. Involve everyone in customer experience innovationGreat customer service should constantly be growing and adapting. Get people at all levels and all positions in your organization excited about contributing suggestions for innovation. At the very customer-centric insurance and financial behemoth USAA, employees have been responsible for over 1,000 patented innovations!These come from every corner of the company (one security guard alone is responsible for contributing 28 patented ideas!) Be sure to explain that multiple areas are available for (and need) innovation. While everyone thinks of innovation as product-based, it's only one of the three areas that are ripe for contributions:Product: what you sell or make; in spite of the name, this includes services as well as goods.Process: how you make your product or service and how you sell it.Business model: how your company is conceptualized and organized.7. Embrace the triangular model when considering technology, including AIIn the customer service triangle framework, the human agent occupies one vertex, the customer the next, and AI or other technology the third. These three entities should work interactionally rather than in an either-or manner. A customer who started interacting with your company via AI can switch to a human agent, for instance.

52,Your Employees Will Leave If You Don't Have Values — Why Organizational Identity is the New Hiring Battlefield,"Mar 7, 2024",Sam Rockwell,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-organizational-identity-is-the-new-hiring-battlefield/469680,"
Bruce was baffled. ""How did I get into this situation?"" he wondered. He urgently needed some additional talent for a vital but understaffed project and was relieved when he was awarded more headcount. But his relief had turned to confusion. Somehow, the tables had been turned, and he found himself in the hot seat.Shortly after the interview began, the young professional sitting across from him began asking him questions. First, he was asked to describe the firm's position on George Floyd. Then, he was asked to relay what the firm was doing related to climate events — other questions related to company actions on social issues ranging from geopolitical events to inequity. Bruce didn't know what to say, and his difficulty answering left him squirming. Afterward, he was left with a foreign, uneasy feeling that he had been underprepared.According to executive coach and consultant Michael Fischer, these are the experiences hiring managers across organizations have increasingly faced within the last five years when searching for talent — with most managers ""failing"" the interview. Young employees have flipped the script: Today, they weigh and evaluate prospective employers as carefully as employers evaluate them. When hiring managers cannot answer their questions about organizational identity, young talent moves on. Fischer summarized his observations by saying there was a war for talent — but the war is over, and talent has won.



These experiences reveal that, as organizational leaders, we cannot afford to be unaware or inarticulate about what is central, distinctive, and enduring about our organizations. Although brand identity has long been an element of strategy and marketing, we now must be equally clear about the messages we're speaking internally to our employees. While a positive and distinctive organizational identity attracts talent as well as the support and loyalty of our existing employees and stakeholders, lack of clarity or communication about identity can compromise our success and sustainability.Further, identity affects talent management not only among the young and at the frontlines but also extends to those at the highest levels of the organization. For example, H&R Block's current CEO, Jeff Jones, left the post of president at Uber after only six months: despite his initial attraction to its mission and strategic challenges, he soon discovered differences with the company's core values he could not reconcile. While turnover at any level is costly, such changes at a senior level can send shockwaves through the entire organization.


Related: Why Finding Your Place Is a Powerful Tool for SuccessWith identity-based talent management now an unavoidable imperative, here are three steps for enacting this aligning your organization:1. Know and communicate where your company standsUnlike years past, employees now demand to know where their organizations stand on critical issues, such as social justice, geopolitical tensions, and more. Companies can no longer leave these conversations at the door. Fischer warned that not taking a stand can be as damaging as taking a stand that conflicts with some employees' or employment candidates' views. For example, although communicating the organization's views in advance may reduce the candidate pool or prompt a candidate to decline an offer, this is preferable to costly turnover once the employee discovers who the organization really is.Sysco made this clarity about its identity and purpose a priority in early 2020. Over several months and with significant effort, the CEO, executive team, and senior leadership of global talent management collaborated to craft an 11-word purpose statement: Connecting the world to share food and care for one another.


To reach this clarity about your organization, begin to uncover identity by gathering the stories, milestones, and other artifacts that start to reveal the character of your organization and then identify the recurring themes surrounding what core, distinctive, and enduring about it is.Related: Why We Should Be Talking About Organizational Identity and Not Just Company Culture2. Evaluate identity-based positioning on key issuesRenewed clarity about your organization's identity enables you to understand where it stands on various issues and then to communicate and act accordingly. In the case of Sysco, having clarified its purpose, it could message differently inside the company, decide where to invest its resources outside the company and identify the issues that were important to them.When you clarify your purpose, managers can answer candidates' questions about who and what your company stands for. Once you have identified what is core, distinctive, and enduring about your organization, you can contemplate pressing social issues in light of these. While your organization may support some causes, it is possible that it may not align with other causes and may be neutral related to still other causes.


Related: 5 Ways to Uncover the Identity of Your Organization3. Determine identity-congruent actions in crisisThe lasting takeaway of COVID-19 is that we may never know when the next crisis will hit or what its nature will be. For example, Sysco's crisis planning scenarios neglected to account for a total system failure where all restaurants worldwide were affected at the same time by the same thing, resulting in Sysco's sales dropping significantly overnight. Yet, this crisis prompted the CEO to begin the search for Sysco's identity. Their newfound clarity ultimately enabled them to rise to the challenges of decimated sales by creating ""grocerants,"" where restaurants temporarily sold some grocery staples. This identity-aligned action relieved Sysco while helping restaurants stay in business and addressing neighborhood food shortages caused by the broken grocery store supply chain. Knowing your organization's identity may help you weather the next storm.Understanding organizational identity is no longer a nice to have. Instead, understanding, communicating, and acting on identity is now a talent management imperative. Implementing the three steps outlined above will help you craft a compelling identity statement and perform in identity-congruent ways, thus helping you attract talent committed to a common set of ideals and way of being.

53,Want to Scale Up Without Selling Out? Do This First,"Mar 6, 2024",Heather McLeod,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/want-to-scale-up-without-selling-out-do-this-first/470278,"
Ambition is a beautiful thing, but growing a business takes more than the will to succeed. As part of the team that launched Authority Brands in 2017, I knew that our trajectory would be explosive. Aggressively pursuing growth isn't just about the numbers, it's also about taking the time to build foundational elements of the business to support continued growth.Growth should strengthen, not dilute, the spirit of a company. Is your business ready to grow? Make sure you've done these three things first.1. Find true northA strong company vision is a beacon that each individual in the system can look to to guide their work. When everyone on the team knows exactly where the company is headed, they become stakeholders in the growth process.



All too often, the core values of a business are relegated to a slide in onboarding training and rarely heard of again. Instead, they should be woven into the fabric of the organization. The goal is an unshakable company-wide vision.However, it's easier said than done. According to Gallup, only 23% of U.S. employees strongly agree that they can apply their organization's values to their work. No matter the scope of any individual's work, they should clearly understand how their contributions are important to the vision. Every action, from marketing initiatives to operational support, has a part to play, and it's up to leaders to draw connections for their teams.


A vision is most powerful when it's a shared promise and commitment. It is worth the time it takes to articulate to each and every employee how they contribute to overall success.Related: Unlock the Secret to Crafting Compelling Core Values With This Step-by-Step Guide2. Invest in a culture of collaborationA business's culture is where vision is put to the test. A toxic culture can sap the promise out of a compelling vision, while a healthy culture offers a structure for success. A strong culture is especially crucial for growing sustainably.A true commitment to collaborative culture touches every element of the employee experience. Setting clear expectations about culture starts at recruitment and never stops. People should feel just as comfortable communicating pain points as sharing successes or floating exciting ideas.


A diverse range of perspectives arms a company with endless approaches to problem-solving. As a system grows, so does the pool of great minds you have to draw inspiration from. If you empower each team member to contribute their best and focus on cultivating a strong culture of collaboration.Related: The 4 Personalities You Need on Your Marketing Team3. Plan a flexible path for growthConstant growth means constant change, and your systems must account for that. A flexible path for growth is about planning in a way that serves your business's current state while actively shaping its future. Think of the way tall buildings are carefully constructed to flex rather than break in adverse weather.Every level of a growing business needs processes and procedures that can scale and adapt as the work changes. Because process planning and documentation can feel like it's not the ""real"" work, it's easy to overlook, especially when a team is small and focused. That's a grave mistake. Your goal is for that team to grow and grow, so it's never too early to give it a guiding structure. Build teams with an eye toward the future. Map out future improvements and what circumstances would allow you to implement them.


From day one, you must prioritize systems that accommodate the dynamic nature of a rapidly growing business. Our franchise system is an excellent example of the power of process and scaling. Back-of-house infrastructures like IT, HR, legal, and marketing are handled by best-in-class professionals so that franchise owners can keep all their focus on providing best-in-class service. With the corporate office focused on making business efficient and scalable, each brand levels up. Managing this kind of growth requires a holistic viewpoint and a high level of interconnectedness throughout the business.Related: How to Turn a Crisis into an Opportunity by Managing Negative Publicity

54,Big Businesses Take Forever to Pay Their Small Suppliers. These Founders Did Something About It: 'Nobody Had Seen Anything Like This',"Mar 6, 2024",Frances Dodds,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/these-founders-help-small-suppliers-get-paid-quicker-from/470341,"
It should have been a celebratory lunch — the kind where you order french fries and cheesecake, then go home to nap and don't even feel bad about it.Instead, Stacey Abrams and Lara Hodgson were sitting in an Atlanta restaurant, dazed with disappointment, talking in circles, returning again and again to the same confounding question: How did we not know this?It was 2010, and three years earlier, the women had cofounded a company called Nourish, which made grab-and-go baby bottles filled with premeasured, purified water for easy formula mixing. The company had been finding its legs, one wobbly step at a time. Then, Whole Foods placed a huge order of their product.



""It was, like, orders of magnitude bigger than anything we'd done before,"" Hodgson says. They were ecstatic. This is what they should've been celebrating. But then they read the payment terms. ""We discovered that we weren't going to get paid for three to four months. I mean, no small business can handle that.""The women had run headlong into an unspoken rule: the bigger the buyer, the longer they take to pay. And it didn't even matter what the official payment schedule was. ""If your invoice says net 30 or net 60 or net 90 — that's just a suggestion,"" Hodgson says. ""We know now that the average net 30 invoice pays in 54 days. But back then, when we realized all this, I just remember thinking, like, Was I sick one day in business school? Why does no one talk about this?""Related: 10 Small Business Marketing Strategies That Actually WorkThey had more questions, too. Why was this the status quo? Why did no one seem to think it was a big deal? And why — in a country that calls small businesses the backbone of the economy — had no one bothered to create a better solution?Suddenly, they couldn't stop talking about it. They talked with each other, and then with other small business owners, and then with academics and investors. And eventually, they decided to do something about it.Later that year, the duo cofounded NowAccount, a novel business-to-business financing solution that lets small business owners get paid for invoices right away, with low, flat-rate fees, while building up their credit and outsourcing the time-consuming task of tracking down payments. Since its inception in 2010, Now has fast-tracked almost $1 billion in payments for nearly 1,000 businesses, and in the past two years, more than doubled in growth.But getting to this point took a long time: years of asking, and listening, and explaining, and insisting that something could and should be done.""We had to convince people we could solve the problem,"" Abrams says, ""because it sounded like magic.""


Hodgson and Abrams met at a leadership program in Atlanta — but they might not have connected so fast if Abrams hadn't fessed up to her audacious ambition.It was 2004, and they were both enrolled in a tough session: The facilitator had researched attendees ahead of time, and made it his mission to target their insecurities, in order to prompt deeper conversation about biases. Hodgson is an extrovert who loves to talk — so the facilitator didn't let her do that. ""At the end of the weekend, he told me he needed me to know what it felt like to have no voice,"" she says. ""I did not like that.""Abrams is an introvert, so the facilitator treated her the opposite way — constantly pressing her to speak. Eventually, he asked Abrams a direct question: ""What is one great ambition you've never wanted to say out loud?"" She paused, then said she wanted to be president of the United States. Across the room, Hodgson remembers thinking, I always said that as a little girl, and girls don't say that out loud! When they broke for lunch, Hodgson made a beeline for Abrams in the buffet line.Related: 9 Tips To Grow Your Small Business With Social Media MarketingThe women were assigned to the same study group. ""We found that while we had different approaches to problems,"" Abrams says, ""we almost always aligned on solutions."" They became friends, and a couple of years later, founded a consulting company together, making use of Hodgson's business connections and Abrams' knowledge of local tax law. Then they founded Nourish. And that brought them to that bleak lunch in 2010, agonizing over how to get the money for their Whole Foods order. They were searching, once again, for an answer.They'd scrambled to find conventional bridge-funding solutions — a bank loan or invoice factoring — but found the first inaccessible, and the second predatory. Bank loans are hard to get for small business owners without solid credit, or for anyone who doesn't feel comfortable with personal guarantees. Recourse-factoring companies, which buy invoices from small companies, charge variable fees, along with additional accruing fees for late payments (which the small businesses can't predict or control), and often use invasive tactics like collecting money from the business's bank account on a daily or weekly basis. Plus, if a payment falls through, the small business is on the hook for the full payment plus late fees, which leaves a liability on its balance sheet for months.The best option Hodgson and Abrams had found — ""a creative factoring agreement from a community bank"" — also came with personal guarantees. This was uncomfortable for both women. Hodgson had a new baby and worried about losing her house because of the loan, and Abrams had a mortgage and a lot of student debt. Plus, she was financially responsible for her parents and niece.To both women, this situation just felt wrong. They knew they couldn't be the first entrepreneurs to find themselves suddenly ""growing out of business.""""When you encounter a massive problem that's been around forever,"" Abrams says, ""you tend to think, I can't possibly be the first one to see it. So you assume what's happening is your fault, or that the problem would have been solved if it could have been. And you usually stop there. But instead of critiquing ourselves, Lara and I decided to ask: OK, but why hasn't it happened?""


Image Credit: Nicolás OrtegaWhen Abrams and Hodgson began talking about solutions, the first thing they thought of was simple: What if Whole Foods could pay them with a credit card? In this case, Nourish, the seller, would be charged the flat 3.5% transaction fee, and get paid right away. Then Whole Foods, the buyer, would pay down the balance on their own time with interest.But therein lies the dilemma: Whole Foods doesn't want to pay its suppliers right away — and certainly doesn't want to pay interest. And because it's a giant company, it doesn't have to. That's the way the capitalist cookie crumbles. Bigger companies set payment terms, and the smaller companies accept them — until they prove critical enough to negotiate.But what if Hodgson and Abrams created something for small businesses that was like being paid with a credit card?This is the idea that eventually became NowAccount: Small businesses would apply to be Now's clients, and pay an annual membership fee of $750. When clients received an invoice from a new buyer, Now would assess the buyer's risk, and if they approved, the client could start uploading invoices. Now would vet each invoice, then pay the client the full amount almost immediately, minus a flat fee based on the payment terms (ranging incrementally from 3% for a net 15 invoice, to 8% for a net 120 invoice). And Now would be reimbursed when the payment is made.Related: 5 Things Not to Do When You're Running a Small BusinessThis would shrink the payment schedule from a few months to just a few days. In the case of Nourish and Whole Foods, it would have looked something like this: If Whole Foods placed an order of, say, $50,000 worth of goods from Nourish, with 90-day payment terms, Nourish would take that invoice to NowAccount, who would confirm its validity with Whole Foods, and then pay Nourish $50,000 right away (minus the 7% fee for a net 90 invoice). Then Now would be reimbursed in, say, 117 days, or whenever Whole Foods actually paid.For a small business owner, the advantages of this setup are numerous: No added interest for late payments you can't control, no liability on your balance sheet, no unforgiving credit checks or invasive debt collection strategies, and no personal guarantees. Unlike factoring companies, which hold you responsible if a payment falls through, NowAccount absorbs the risk of every invoice it accepts. In this way, Now acts as a kind of insurance for their clients.Hodgson and Abrams knew their concept was groundbreaking.Unfortunately, at first, the people they needed to join them were not convinced. Part of the problem was that the concept didn't lend itself to pithy, 30-second elevator pitches. ""It's complicated to explain,"" Hodgson says. ""And because nobody had seen anything like this, when they heard 'get paid fast,' their brains immediately went to, 'Is it a loan? Is it a payday loan? Is it factoring?'""From the finance side, there was also some confusion about why this was even a problem. What's stopping any small business owner from going down to their local bank to get a loan at a lower annual interest rate, or negotiating better terms with their factoring company or buyer?


What financial institutions often overlook are the countless variable barriers for small business owners. Many are becoming entrepreneurs for the first time, figuring it out as they go, without a lot of financial education or resources.Patricia Wilson is a NowAccount client who worked in technology for 20 years before deciding to start her own consulting business, Online Media Interactive. When she started out, she says, ""Honestly, going after a bank loan didn't even occur to me. I was still trying to feel out what I wanted to do from a business perspective. And with traditional factoring companies, I was very intimidated by the aggressive nature of how they collect the money. I just wanted a way to have consistent income coming in.""Another Now client, Mike Riordan, is the founder of Freeze Sleeve, a cold/hot compression therapy he developed for his daughter, a pre-Olympic gymnast. Riordan had previously run a struggling construction company that tanked his credit, so he couldn't get a bank loan for Freeze Sleeve. And he was put off by the ""loan-shark mentality"" of factoring companies.""I think there's a kind of business amnesia that occurs in the financial sector,"" Abrams says. ""The people making these decisions forgot what it was like to be a small business owner."" Moreover, Hodgson thinks there's a misconception in the finance world that you can take funding solutions for large companies and ""miniaturize"" them. ""I tell people, 'Small businesses are not miniature large businesses. You can't just, like, shrink a solution,'"" she says. ""Think about it: If I'm a small business selling to, say, Walmart, and they're demanding net 90, that means they might actually pay in 120 days. So I'm essentially Walmart's free bank for 90-plus days. My cost of capital is way higher than Walmart's, so efficient economic theory suggests the best solution for Walmart is to borrow money really cheaply, pay me faster, and get a discount. But anyone who's tried that knows a large company will just take the discount and still pay you late.""Related: This Is the Unseen Advantage Your Small Business Might NeedIn fact, Hodgson tried this kind of dynamic discounting with one large retailer when they were running Nourish. She'd offer, say, a 2% discount on a net 30 invoice if they paid her in 10 days. But in the end, she says, the retailer just took the discount and still paid her late.""What am I going to do, sue them?"" she says. ""My legal bill would be way more than the 2%, so it's not worth it. I could threaten not to sell to them again, and they'd be like, 'OK, move over! There's a line of people who would gladly take your shelf space.' When you have an imbalance in power, efficient economic theory just doesn't work.""Dr. Richard Bliss, a professor of finance at Babson College and the national academic director for Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses, confirms this. ""It's the classic 'because they can,'"" he says. ""There's a huge power dynamic, and big companies just take advantage. I often hear stories from small business owners who are so excited they got this big contract, but they lose sight of the fact that they still have to make this positive from a financial standpoint. A lot of them don't have the rudimentary forecasting tools to plug in their new contract, look four months down the road to say, 'Holy smokes, we're gonna run out of money.' By the time they realize the predicament they're in, there are very few options.""Slowly but surely, investors began to hear Hodgson and Abrams' message. First came credit unions, then equity investors, and finally Goldman Sachs. Taking different types of funding presented some tension, Hodgson says, but she thinks it made the business more sustainable. ""Equity investors usually prioritize growth more than profitability, whereas lenders want you to be focused on profitability. So at times, I was like, Oh my gosh, I can't make everybody happy! But in hindsight, I think it forced a kind of discipline.""The thing about discipline is that it doesn't exactly lend itself to meteoric change. It's an act of faith that, eventually, the baby steps will get you somewhere.


""You know when your shoelaces are tied together, and you can't take a step that's longer than the shoelace or you fall on your face?"" Hodgson asks. ""That's the image that comes to mind about starting and scaling NowAccount. We had to go get capital and then get some customers, then we needed more capital and then more customers. And if I tried to do either of those too big, I'd fall on my face. So we just sort of trudged along, little by little.""NowAccount's investors were pulling on one shoelace, and clients were tugging on the other. Small business owners didn't need convincing that there was a problem. But they did need some convincing that these two nice Southern ladies weren't selling them some fanciful money ""magic,"" as Abrams says, ""or worse!""Related: Here's the Secret to Growing Your Small Business, According to Execs at UPS, Airbnb, Mastercard, and Other Big Brands""The first question we'd get from small business owners is, 'Why would you give us this money?'"" Abrams says. ""They were trying to understand: 'If this other financial institution wants to charge me 30% on my entire inventory, or this one wants my DNA swab, or to mortgage my house, why would I trust you?' Entrepreneurs are trained to believe no one is coming to help them, so we were trying to convince people we could untie their shoelaces when they'd gotten used to walking that way"" — restrained, cautious, and slower than they should have to.But once NowAccount started delivering on its promises, they started getting more applications than they could accept. This was partly because they needed more funding, and partly because they needed to mitigate risk. ""We wanted to serve more businesses, because that's why we existed,"" Hodgson says. ""But if we went too far, someone's going to take the dollar and run. So in the early days, it was a lot of learning, like, what are the signs? And analyzing data to tell us if certain industries or company profiles are more prone to risk.""Now learned to spot certain ""behavioral indicators."" For example, if someone has a Gmail account instead of a business email, it's worth a closer look. Maybe it's a fly-by-night operation, or maybe it's a new business that just hasn't set up its website yet. But with each invoice Now processed, its system became more informed. ""Every data point we have about a customer and who their buyer is, and when they pay, that just makes the system incrementally smarter,"" Hodgson says. ""So mistakes happen less and less as we grow.""And this practice of mitigating risk isn't just for Now's benefit. It's also become a crucial service for clients.Riordan, the founder of Freeze Sleeve, says the buyer-vetting that NowAccount does is invaluable. In addition to being able to sell to big companies that are ""horribly slow"" at paying, Riordan says, ""We also use NowAccount almost like our credit check people. Every time somebody wants to come on board, I send them over to Now, and they do their due diligence on the company. One time we had a cryotherapy business that wanted to go national with our products, and they gave us a very substantial order. But Now wouldn't approve them. We were frustrated because it was a big order, so we ended up doing it on our own. Well, guess what? That company went out of business and left us with a big hole.""Meeting with team members Archie Jones and John Hayes in 2015, in an antiques shop next to their office.Image Credit: Courtesy of Stacey AbramsNow was always intended to serve small businesses. But a few years in, something surprising happened. ""We got a call from Coca-Cola's chief procurement officer,"" Hodgson says, ""who was like, 'This seems to be a huge benefit to suppliers. Maybe we could partner to make sure more of them know about it.'""


Coca-Cola had been trying to diversify its supply chain to include more women and people of color, but its payment terms made it impossible for many of these businesses to work with them. ""They're going to take 90 days to pay, and if that's going to kill you, they can't give you the contract,"" Hodgson says.But with Now, Coca-Cola saw an opportunity: If there was a small business they wanted to buy from, but the supplier couldn't afford their payment terms, they'd send them to NowAccount. That way, the small business didn't have to worry about how long it would take to get paid, and Coca-Cola would know they had the capital to deliver. It was a win-win for everyone.Not long after, the city of Atlanta began a push to boost the local economy by connecting Atlanta-based corporations with local small business suppliers. Now was perfectly positioned to partner with the city to make these connections.Then, in 2020, the George Floyd protests happened, and corporations across the country started making public pledges to spend more with minority-owned businesses. At that point, Now realized it was sitting on a goldmine of data.Sure, there are plenty of business databases out there — but only Now has years' worth of invoice data, giving them visibility into which suppliers can deliver at what level.Related: 7 Strategies to Scale Your Small Business and Achieve Sustainable Growth""If you're a procurement person, and you've bought a database of businesses, and you're looking for one with a Latina founder, there are probably hundreds of them,"" Hodgson says. ""How do you pick? And most importantly, how do you know which of those hundreds can do a million-dollar contract versus a $5,000 contract? Because that matters. If I give you a contract that's too big and you don't have the staff to deliver, neither of us win.""What if they created a curated platform that helped big businesses find diverse suppliers capable of meeting their needs? It would be free for the small businesses to join, while the big businesses paid a membership fee. And that's how the next Now product — NowNetwork — was born.When Hodgson and Abrams talk about Now, people often ask: Why is it like this? Why don't these big businesses just pay their suppliers faster?Hodgson likes to tell a story about a conversation she once had with a Fortune 500 CFO. They were talking about NowAccount, and the CFO said, ""You know, this is fascinating, but I could probably just pay my suppliers immediately for cheaper than you can.""


""Well for sure you could,"" Hodgson replied. ""You're a Fortune 500 company and we're a startup. But you won't.""The CFO paused for a moment. ""You're right,"" she said. ""I won't because if I turn around and paid all my suppliers immediately, Wall Street would take me down.""What Hodgson and the CFO were acknowledging is how common it is for corporations to beef up their capital stacks by leaning on ""accounts payable"" — the money owed to suppliers but not yet paid.""Take any public company and look at their financials,"" Hodgson says, ""If you look at their short-term debt, like what they're borrowing from the bank, compared to their accounts payable — what they owe suppliers — their accounts payable are almost always two to three times what they owe the bank. Because there's a smart CFO who knows he can delay payments for free versus borrowing money at some cost greater than zero. If you yanked that away, they'd have to turn to more expensive capital, their net earnings would drop, and Wall Street would kill them.""This notion — that it's common for corporations to deliberately delay payments — is provocative. But each year, the consultancy firm The Hackett Group does an annual analysis of something called Days Payable Outstanding, or DPO. It's an accounting measure that calculates the number of days it takes for a company to pay suppliers. And it sheds light on the pattern.Of the top 1,000 publicly traded U.S. companies, for the decade running up to 2021 (when payment terms started to shorten due to pandemic supply chain pressures), ""DPO was consistently increasing — around 5% year after year — which is significant,"" says Shawn Townsend, a director in Hackett's finance transformation practice. ""On a compounding level, that adds up to a 32% increase [in how long suppliers are waiting to get paid]. And you would assume the same trends are happening to an even greater extent to smaller companies, because it's about leverage.""Townsend says DPO can't distinguish between long payment terms and late payments. But when asked if it's common for corporations to deliberately delay payments, he says, diplomatically, ""It does happen. We hear some companies saying, 'This month, we told the accounts payable people, pay a certain group of suppliers, don't pay the others.' The most critical suppliers are always the first to get paid. And then the other ones, you know, they just stop the payments until the following month. It's very anecdotal, obviously, because nobody's going to admit that.""But Now's data is not anecdotal. They have unprecedented visibility into exactly when the biggest companies in the U.S. say they'll pay, and when they actually do.Related: 5 SEO Tips to Grow Your Small Business""We know what the normal behavior is for certain companies and certain industries,"" Hodgson says. ""I was talking to someone at a major bank and they said, 'Well, we typically pay in X days.' And I said, 'No you don't.' They said, 'Well, that's our policy.' And I said, 'But that's not what you do! I know because I've been watching you pay invoices for over a year.'""


More recently, the Now team has been asking what they can do with all this information. ""Could we partner with someone like Hackett, or start doing our own reports?"" Hodgson wonders. ""This data could be incredibly interesting to investors, because if you're investing in a company, and they are continuously paying very late, there may be a weakness in its business model. Or if you're a small business who wants to sell to the airline industry, and they're saying they pay in 45 days but they really mean 60, that could be the difference between making a payroll and not. It won't change reality, but you can plan for reality. And that's what got Stacey and I into all of this trouble in the first place.""Image Credit: Nicolás OrtegaA lot has happened since that fateful lunch in 2010. Abrams kept working at NowAccount during her tenure in the Georgia House of Representatives, but left the company in 2016 to pursue those two runs for governor. (Or as she says, ""I had this other job I was interested in applying for, but my application was rejected."") After that, she and Hodgson decided that NowAccount and NowNetwork should be separate companies, which act as partners with service agreements. Hodgson will run NowAccount, and Abrams will run NowNetwork.Unlike Hodgson, who's had a long career in business, Abrams admits she never really wanted to be an entrepreneur. ""I liked paychecks,"" she says. ""It was a frightening idea to be solely reliant on my own efforts.""The thing that changed her mind, though, was meeting Hodgson.""We often believe we have to be the leaders,"" she says, ""but having a partner challenges you. It helps you grow, sharpens your mind, gives you a different perspective. Lara and I have always been curious about what the other person knows.""Curiosity, more than anything, is what brought the friends to this place. And it's what will guide them toward whatever's next. ""Curiosity is about more than simply seeking information,"" says Abrams.

55,3 Ways to Give New Employees a Great First Day That Makes Them Excited to Be Part of Your Team,"Mar 5, 2024",Scott Greenberg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-ways-to-give-new-employees-a-great-first-day/468429,"
The following is an excerpt from business expert Scott Greenberg's new book, Stop the Shift Show: Turn Your Struggling Hourly Workers Into a Top-Performing Team, available now.As a manager of hourly employees, you may be eager to get new recruits working as soon as possible. But remember: you also want them to stay.Before you train them on the job, train them in your culture. Don't just tell them what your mission and values are. Discuss them. At In-N-Out Burger, no one puts on the red apron until they've watched a series of videos explaining their culture and ways of doing things. A lot of great hourly workplaces use videos, information packets, and even quizzes to confirm new employees understand the culture they're joining. Make sure new employees appreciate who you are as an organization, not just what you do. Share stories of your culture so they can understand how your workplace is different. Even better, have other employees explain the culture. It'll be more credible if it comes from co-workers.



Buy 'The Shift Show' Now: Entrepreneur Bookstore | Amazon | Barnes & NobleNever underestimate the emotional rawness of starting a new job. Here are some ways to get new employees comfortable and excited about being on the team.


Create your own welcoming customsNew employees have probably applied for other jobs and may still be communicating with those employers when they start with you. You need to make a good first impression so they mentally commit to staying with you. You also want to set them up for success.It's nerve-racking to start a new job—not just because they're having to learn how to do new tasks, but also because they're joining a new team. People worry about how they're going to fit in, what their social role will be, how to remember who everyone is, and how people get along. A first day at work is like your first day at a new school. Remember, we create culture on three fronts—in the head, in the heart, and on the floor. Your first priority is the heart, which means easing those first-day feelings.Begin with a memorable, warm reception. Hang a sign with their name and perhaps some festive decorations to welcome them to their new family. Have co-workers greet them at the door with a round of applause. Give them a welcome basket or bag of goodies. You'll never get another opportunity to create this moment, so give them something to tell their friends and family about.Rituals like this also communicate something to the rest of your team— that new people are important and should be treated with kindness. Your team is probably wondering how this new person will impact the work environment. A good welcome ritual cuts through that initial iciness and promotes camaraderie.


I met one business owner who sends new employees home with a small gift for their family and a note thanking them for sharing their loved one. He commits to protecting their well-being and invites the family to visit the workplace sometime. This may seem a bit over-the-top, but it's an interesting way to win over an employee's family and stand out from other employers. As the owner told me, ""You can never have too many people telling your employees how lucky they are to work for you!""Be sure to take photos of your welcome customs. Share them with the new team member and post them on social media. Let the world see your hospitality toward your employees and see how you should be the employer of their choice. 


Assign a mentorMentors (sometimes called ""coaches,"" ""big brothers/sisters,"" or ""buddies"") can offer guidance without eliciting the anxiety new employees sometimes feel around their boss. Co-worker mentorships promote a more collaborative atmosphere and get your team invested in one another's success.Also use this first day to establish your relationship with the new employee. Explain your management style. Inquire about their goals, how they'd like to grow, and what kind of management they respond to. Find out what they like (which you can use later for rewards and incentives). Explain your approach to providing feedback. Let them know you'll be checking in with them from time to time, and what to expect from those conversations. Help them see you as an advocate for their growth, not just an authority figure.Don't issue a uniform, give them swagClothing creates community. Sports jerseys and caps, college sweatshirts, military battle dress, and other uniform attire don't just identify people's affiliations—they promote them. But the power of clothing doesn't lie in what people are wearing. It's in their relationship to it. There's a pride that comes with visual affiliation. It feels good to be part of an institution with other members. Clothing is a way of saying to the world, ""I'm part of this group.""That's how you want your employees to relate to the clothing you provide them. Whether it's Walmart's blue vest, UPS' browns, or anything with McDonald's golden arches, the smart use of uniforms can create a sense of belonging.


Make a fuss over your company clothing. Don't ""issue uniforms."" Instead, give them ""swag."" Put the uniform in a gift bag, perhaps the one you give them on their first day. Or consider starting them with a low-key (i.e., cheaper) shirt or hat and let them earn the official gear once they complete training. Make it a moment when they earn their stripes. Offer additional branded clothing as prizes and incentives.Presentation matters, and so do rituals. Honor your colors. Let employees feel lucky to receive a uniform, rather than burdened to wear one.Get more management tips and strategies from 'Stop the Shift Show,' available now at the Entrepreneur Bookstore.

56,How Black Entrepreneurs Are Challenging Industry Norms and Finding Powerful Paths to Success,"Mar 4, 2024",Entrepreneur Staff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/black-history-month-inspiring-entrepreneurs-who-are/470072,"
In celebration of Black History Month, Entrepreneur contributor Terry Rice hosted a compelling Twitter Spaces conversation featuring dynamic entrepreneurs Pariss Chandler, Kashmir Thompson and Chrishon Lampley. The panel delved into crucial topics ranging from finding passion to challenging industry norms and offered powerful insights for aspiring business leaders.While they all had unique journeys and experiences to share, one common thread between all of the panelists is the belief that entrepreneurship is about more than just profits—it's about passion, community, and authenticity. In a world often dominated by the bottom line, their insights serve as a refreshing reminder of what it truly means to succeed in business.Listen to the entire discussion and check out the bios and top takeaways of our dynamic guests below.Black History Month Speakers



Terry Rice, Entrepreneur contributor and Managing Director of Good People Digital, is known for his passionate advocacy of entrepreneurship. In the discussion, he highlighted how genuine love for one's work fosters fulfillment and propels individuals forward in their entrepreneurial endeavors.Top Takeaway: ""Having drive comes with entrepreneurship — it is one of the benefits of actually liking your job. You don't stop moving because you actually enjoy this. You don't feel that same nagging 'I need to take a break from this' many of us experience with our day jobs. When you're an entrepreneur, it is hard work, but you just enjoy doing it so much.""Related: Navigating the Diverse Marketing Landscape of Black America — How to Foster Authentic Engagement, Loyalty and RespectPariss Chandler, the influential force behind Black Tech Pipeline, challenges prevailing notions within the tech industry. She debunked the myth of a ""pipeline problem"" for black technologists and advocated for the power of community and networking in creating opportunities for underrepresented groups.


Top Takeaway: ""I had mobilized this community called Black Tech Twitter, which showed that there are black technologists in the industry. We do exist, we are qualified and talented, and there is no 'pipeline problem.' If you don't know, the pipeline problem is this excuse that employers use: There aren't enough black people or people of diverse backgrounds to hire in these industries. It's really a networking problem versus a pipeline problem. When I mobilized this community with a viral tweet, I had a lot of companies DMing me on Twitter. They saw there are black technologists out there to hire. And they started asking me if I would recruit for them.""Related: For Years, This Black Founder Learned an Uncommon But Essential Craft on the Side. Now His Creations Are Beloved By Celebrity Chefs — and Can Sell for More Than $1,000.Chrishon Lampley, founder of Love Cork Screw, shared her wisdom on the pivotal role of personal relationships in business. She emphasized the value of face-to-face interactions and genuine connections that transcend the digital sphere, drawing from her own experiences in building successful ventures.Top Takeaway: ""Everything's not just an email. You actually have to pick up the phone and call and talk to people. You actually have to go to see an account. I'm in over 3,000 locations right now. I had lost some of those because I wasn't there and present. And when I walked into those stores and bars and talked to those managers or mixologists, we made a human connection that actually put me back in. That's also the reason why I'm sold at airports. Now I'm at Chicago Midway International Airport on 90% of the menus because I talked to somebody. So I just say again, take it back to the old school. Have some human connection and communication. You'll be surprised what you can get.""


Kashmir Thompson, artist, creator and founder, infused the conversation with her deep passion for her craft. Kashmir encouraged fellow entrepreneurs to embrace their uniqueness and fearlessly showcase their creativity without fear of judgment or rejection.Top Takeaway: ""One of the main lessons that I've learned and that I'm honestly really still learning today is to just not get so in your head about what you're offering. Just put it out there! There's so much art that I don't release because I don't know how it's going to sell. I don't know if people are gonna be receptive to it. But one thing I try to remember is to just not box myself in. Release the items that I want to release, release the art that I want to release, and know that my audience will find me even when I feel like they won't. And when I feel like my current audience won't like it? I try to remember to just really stay true to myself.""Terry, Pariss, Chrishon, and Kashmir have infused their journeys with passion, purpose, and genuine connections. We hope their powerful words and bold examples have inspired aspiring entrepreneurs to unlock the boundless growth and fulfillment opportunities waiting for them.

57,4 Ways Brands Can Educate Their Customers and Win Hearts,"Mar 4, 2024",Bora Celik,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-ways-brands-can-educate-their-customers-and-win-hearts/469937,"
Standing out is a challenge for direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands. But they have a secret weapon in their arsenal: Education.It's about going beyond just selling products and actually teaching customers about the value and benefits of what they're buying. This strategy changes the shopping experience. It turns transactions into relationships.From engaging quizzes to live Q&A sessions, personalized advice, and stories from the founders themselves, these innovative approaches are changing the game. They make every interaction an opportunity for a deeper bond between the brand and the customer.



Let's explore why embracing these educational tactics is becoming essential for DTC brands looking to make a real impact.1. Use quizzes for engaging online contentAdding quizzes to a DTC brand's website grabs customer attention uniquely and interactively. It turns shopping into a fun learning journey. Quizzes engage customers by asking questions to pinpoint their likes, needs, and hurdles. This teaches customers about the right products for them and gives brands insights into consumer habits.


Brands can then fine-tune their products and messages. Quizzes also make the website more engaging and fun, keeping visitors around longer. This can help improve the site's SEO and might even lift sales.By making recommendations more tailored and relevant, quizzes foster trust. They encourage customers to come back. This approach simplifies finding the right product, benefiting both the customer and the brand.Related: Educating vs. Selling — This Unique Marketing Style Will Help You Grow Your Business2. Meet customers through live Q&A sessionsDirect interaction with customers through live Q&A sessions can significantly enhance customer education and trust.


Mary Ruth's Organics demonstrates this by leveraging the knowledge and accessibility of its founder, MaryRuth Ghiyam. Despite the brand's growth, Ghiyam remains actively engaged with her community, answering Instagram messages personally and hosting monthly fireside chats via Zoom.A quick look at their Instagram shows thousands of people attend these chats. These sessions allow customers to ask questions in real-time, providing a platform for direct communication and personalized advice. This approach not only educates customers but also builds a deeper connection between the brand and its consumers.3. Personalize to enhance educationWhen customers get advice or product picks just for them, they tend to dive deeper into the content, remember what they learned, and act on the suggestions. Personalization makes them feel valued, building a closer bond with the brand. People are bombarded with endless options and information. Personalization is a surefire way to stand out.When exploring products, people often sift through loads of information and research. Brands can make a real impact by tailoring their customer education to meet these personal quests for knowledge.


4. Utilize founder tutorialsBrands have increasingly connected with their customers through tutorials led by their founders. This strategy brings a human touch to the brand, highlighting the passion and knowledge behind it. Founders sharing their expertise and stories draw customers in. It builds trust and credibility. These tutorials aren't just product lessons; they're windows into the brand's heart. They show what it stands for.This kind of direct interaction creates a community feeling. These tutorials are gold mines of information for customers, offering insights and tips for smarter choices. In a time when authenticity and openness are highly valued, founder-led tutorials are a smart move for brands aiming to improve their customer experience.For example, Shani Darden, founder of Shani Darden Skin Care, utilizes her Shani's Skin Tips as a platform for founder tutorials, directly engaging with her audience by sharing expert advice and personalized skincare tips. This approach educates customers on effective skincare practices. It also builds a personal connection between the founder and the audience, enhancing trust in her products.Brands can emulate Darden's playbook by leveraging their expertise through similar educational content, providing valuable information that addresses their customers' needs and interests. This strategy positions the brand as an authority in its field and fosters a community of informed and loyal customers.


Through examples like the ones above, it's clear that these education strategies are transforming brand-customer interactions. Whether offering personalized advice or sharing the heartbeat of the brand via founder content, these methods are gold mines for engagement. They educate and help create a vibrant, informed community around the brand.

59,He Built a Personal Finance App That Manages $8 Billion for Half a Million Customers. Here Is the CEO of M1's Hard-Earned Advice for Future Founders.,"Mar 4, 2024",William Salvi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/m1-ceo-brian-barnes-on-creating-a-fintech-platform-built-to/470390,"
We've been visiting the headquarters of some of the most innovative and imaginative leaders in business for The CEO Series, learning what it takes to launch and grow a thriving brand. For this episode, our crew went to the office of M1, a fintech platform that bills itself as ""the finance super app."" The powerful online investing and banking platform has raised $315 million at a valuation of about $1.5 billion and manages about $8 billion for half a million customers. I sat down with founder and CEO Brian Barnes to learn all about the platform, how it was created, and his advice to founders on running a company built to last.Below are some highlights of our conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity. You can watch the full video above.The thrill of investing""M1 is a personal finance platform. We started the company about eight and a half years ago. We now manage about $8 billion on the platform for half a million customers. And we are really just trying to create the best possible way for someone to manage their finances. And we do that with a lot of personalization, customization, and automation. I was fortunate to be introduced to finance at a pretty young age and I was immediately hooked. I love the idea of investing, of trying to find out what a company's worth and how it's operating in a complex world. As an investor, you're making a high-conviction bet. If you're right, you make money. If you're wrong, you lose money. And so, you know, some people like sports gambling. For me, it is what is a company going to be worth in the next five or ten years.""



Related: The CEO of Catholic Prayer and Meditation App Hallow Says Founders Need to Be Part of Something Bigger Than ThemselvesDoing business in good times and bad""We want to create a financial institution that lasts for decades. There are companies out there that have lasted for centuries. If you are around for that period of time, it's unquestionable that you're going to have these massive disruptions in the overall market. And so we have been trying to build the organization so that we can survive in any macro environment and not just be tailor-made for one.""


Calm in the storm""I try to stay calm — on the outside. [Laughs] The entrepreneurship quote I love is that the highs are high, the lows are low and they're ten minutes apart. There are times when you think you're taking over the world. And then there are times where you're like, What the hell am I doing? I took all this money, I convinced people to quit their jobs and join me, I'm competing against the Schwabs of the world. But stewing in all of that stress accomplishes nothing. I think maintaining my emotions and figuring out how I can allocate my time productively has been a good attribute that I've had as I've built the organization.""Related: How Personal Passions Fuel Business Success for the CEO of Vivid SeatsThe life of a founder""Being a founder of a tech company is more than just being a CEO. You're both the most senior and most junior person at the company. You get to set direction and strategy and things like that, but in any area where there is not someone dedicated to that role? It's on you to fill the gap. I would say I played CEO from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. And then I played junior analyst from 11 a.m. to midnight every night. You're just running around and trying to add value where you can. As you grow, you'd love to put things on pause while you figure out how to scale your team. But that's not how it works — you've got to scale your team and build a product and acquire customers at the same time. There's a little bit of chaos, but you have to sort of thrive in the chaos.""Related: Inside Potbelly's Recipe for Fast Casual Success


Legacy of leadership""My mom Brenda Barnes was CEO of PepsiCo and Sarah Lee. I mean, that's a great person to learn from. She was one of seven sisters. They all shared a bedroom. They were a Polish immigrant family in Chicago. Her father was a factory worker. And so, I think she always had an insanely healthy respect for people who did the actual work at her companies. The people who bottled the cola, who loaded the delivery trucks. As a CEO, you need to respect that they know their job better than you. And the leader's job is to set an example for what you want the values across the company to be. If you could write down all the positive attributes and values that you would want instilled throughout the company, then you better exhibit those things.""Check out more profiles of innovative and impactful leaders by visiting The CEO Series archives.

60,How This California Hot Spot Grew From Delivery-Only to Pop-Up Shop to Storefront,"Mar 1, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-miguels-artisan-recipes-grew-from-pop-up-shop-to/470493,"
Everyone always has a seat at the Segura family's dinner table. Miguel and Lisa Segura, owners of Miguel's Artisan Recipes in Clovis, California, have been making homemade Mexican recipes for their friends and neighbors for decades.But when the pandemic hit and both were furloughed from their jobs, they turned their passion into a business. Lisa created a label, and using Miguel's mother's recipes, they began delivering fresh meals to friends and family by car.When word spread, the Seguras were invited to serve their homestyle cuisine at pop-up events with Fresno Street Eats, a food truck and festival venue. The company's owner helped them get set up with a certified kitchen and pop-up tent. The next year, the tent turned into a food truck, which finally gave way to a storefront. In the corner of a neighborhood convenience store, the owners cook meals for catered events and sell their famous dishes and jarred salsas.



Fresh recipes and a tight-knit customer community earned the restaurant the #1 spot on Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat in the Central Valley - North list in 2023. This is how Nathen M., senior community director at Yelp and Elite reviewer, discovered—and came to adore—the Seguras' business.""Their food and jarred salsas are just fantastic and consistently delicious,"" his review reads. ""Their tacos are to die for, but recently I tried their tamales, and it's the perfect ratio of masa to tender pork. My Mexican mother-in-law, who is very, very picky with her tamales, gave these a double thumbs up.""


The restaurant's authenticity is a huge reason why Lisa and Miguel have seen exploding success. Taking advantage of the agricultural community in the Central Valley, they source fresh ingredients every week to honor their family's original recipes, which resonate with nostalgic customers.""Some people actually [say], 'You just took me back 20 years.' That's the biggest compliment in the world to me because you're having my mother's food,"" Miguel said.Though many of Lisa and Miguel's recipes have been in the family for generations, a key component of their success is their flexibility in the kitchen. Starting out with a short menu of staples, the owners have thoughtfully built out their offerings over the last few years as they've received customer feedback. With a background in sales, Miguel understands the importance of really listening to his customers.""I have cooks and chefs that are already in my kitchen now,"" he said. ""All we have to do is find out what food you like.""


""We have high expectations for ourselves, and we want other people to have good experiences when they're eating the food,"" Lisa added. ""So how can I be better? Continuously improving is part of our culture.""Not only are Miguel and Lisa receptive to feedback but they are proactive about making customer connections, eager to share their food with as many people as they can. In and out of their store, the Seguras always ask regulars how they're doing and invite new customers in to sample their salsas.One of the biggest ways they reach customers is through appearances on local TV channel Fox 26, where they visit the Great Day Kitchen and put on cooking demonstrations of their signature dishes. Beyond the screen, Miguel and Lisa are involved with several community projects, speaking at conferences and with nonprofits about their path to entrepreneurial success.""It's not just about us making food, it's about making a difference, giving to other people,"" Lisa said. ""We are all growing together. I feel so blessed to be giving part of myself, our cooking, and our family legacy to the community. I think that Miguel's mom would have said it best: 'Bring everybody to the house. Let them eat.'""


Miguel and Lisa's friendly customer service and community integration is what struck Nathen most about their business.""It's a lot of work to be out and about all the time and running a business, and they do it with grace,"" Nathen said. ""Every time I've met them in person, there's never a look of 'How do we do this?' It's just, 'How are you doing? We're excited to see you. Do you want some food?'""Having worked with both Yelp consumers and small business owners for nine years, Nathen believes these small interactions are the key to community success.""One thing [that] has never changed when it comes to pitching Yelp events is [that] your food will become secondary. If people can see you and identify with you and learn a little bit about you, they are going to fall in love with you, and they will want to support you. And how do they do that? By coming back to your restaurant and eating your delicious food.""


Nathen urges business owners to connect on a human level with customers, even on days when they're not feeling 100% or are dealing with a difficult person.""Don't look at a person who's going to potentially review you as your nemesis,"" he said. ""You don't know what they're walking in from. Maybe the best part of their day is enjoying your sandwich or your taco or your gym class.""Nathen brings this same level of empathy to his interactions as a reviewer. When he has a negative experience, he waits 24 hours before writing a review, pausing to think about the person on the other side of the counter, who may be stressed from trying to make ends meet. When he does provide critical feedback, he makes sure it's constructive and not destructive.""Try to put your best foot forward all the time,"" he said. ""If the consumer and the owner took a beat before immediately assuming something, there'd be a little less anger out there.""


In addition to community building, Miguel's Artisan Recipes believes in:Listening to feedback. Start with a small list of offerings and give yourself room to grow your menu based on what customers want to see.Engaging with customers whenever possible. Build long-term relationships with your customers by getting to know them on a personal level, both inside and outside of your store.Using fresh ingredients and authentic recipes. Invest in the quality of your products, and customer demand will follow.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Miguel, Lisa, and Nathen, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.Available on: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Pandora and Soundcloud.Editorial contributions by Callie Morgan and Kristi Lindahl

61,The Miley Cyrus Approach To Marketing — Why It's a Radically Different Method For Achieving Brand Impact,"Mar 1, 2024",Sunny Dublick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-miley-cyrus-taught-me-about-marketing/469675,"
Miley Cyrus took home her first Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance this year. Shocked and elated, she took the stage to accept the award from none other than Mariah Carey and shared a very heartfelt speech:""And so there's a story I wanna tell that sums up this moment, and I wasn't gonna tell it, but now Mariah's here. So there was a little boy that all he wanted for his birthday was a butterfly. And so his parents gave him a butterfly net, and he was so excited. He just went outside out in the sun and started swinging and swinging. But with no luck, he sat down on the ground, he finally let go, and he surrendered, and he was okay that he wasn't gonna capture this beautiful butterfly. And right when he did is when the butterfly came and landed right on the tip of his nose. And this song 'Flowers' is my butterfly.""So, what does it have to do with marketing? Everything.



Current marketing theory is centered around amplification: more ads, emails and automation. The idea is that the more times we can reach a customer with our message, the better. Push out social posts, text ads, and Spotify spots, and hit them at every path along the buyer journey until they're worn down enough to buy.I liken this to chasing a customer down the street screaming, ""BUY NOW!"" as they frantically run as far away as possible — only we're doing this through screens, so it feels tolerable. Is it really effective, though? Or are we just casting the widest net possible over and over again, hoping to scoop up more (proverbial) butterflies?


I want to advocate for a different way, one that feels far less cringe-worthy. I want brands to stop chasing down business and start attracting it. What does that look like?Related: 7 Marketing Strategies You Need to SucceedStart with your offering(s)You need to have something that is ultimately an attractive offer to your audience. I ask every client what are the brands they aspire to be like. Apple always comes up. The new iPhone comes out, and there is a line around the block. We all want that kind of brand loyalty, right? The real question is: are we willing to do the work to get there?Apple didn't become a brand giant by creating the same products as the rest of the industry. It pushed category conventions every chance it could get. It constantly innovated and became cool because it was always on the cutting edge of new technology. Buying an Apple product was like a promise that you had the new, shiny toy everyone wanted. Their marketing just lets you know it's available, and frankly, they barely need it.


Apple's customers do most of their marketing for them. Think about what it would be like for your business to have an offer that's so good you know there will be a waiting list. Push yourself out of the thinking that 'this is the way things have to be.' What would it look like if you created something so amazing that you didn't have to force the message to convince people to buy? That is how you become an attractive brand. That's how you get your butterflies.Related: How to Bring Connection, Creativity and Results Together in MarketingKeep it realOne of my biggest takeaways from the Grammy speech was the need for surrender. Accepting the reality of where you are right now. That level of honesty and authenticity is crucial in building a great brand. It's the opposite of giving up; rather, it is realizing you have control over certain things, but a lot is out of our hands as businesses.It's letting go of our vice grip on metrics and being fine with letting life and joy become part of our marketing practice. Marketers have become so trained that everything has to have a way to measure ROI — and while I am not advocating wasting money, I am advocating that we allow wiggle room in our budgets and hearts for authentic brand connection. Not the PR stories, not the influencer partnerships. I mean genuine ways to live out your brand's purpose for your customers and employees.


If you created a business, it wasn't only to make money. I am guessing it was created to help people. Sometimes, we get so far away from where we've been and our purpose that the best thing we can do is surrender. Remind ourselves why we started or why we were so excited to work for a company in the first place. How do we get back to being a great brand?Related: How to Create Authentic Relationships and Build Customer TrustBe a good stewardThink about the brands you admire — do they need to convince you to buy? To chase you down? No. What does the boy with the butterfly do once it lands on his nose? Does he hop right up and start chasing it again? Or does he know he doesn't have to? Will he continue to attract great things because he is a magnet for success? I want to encourage you to be this magnet as well, and how you do that is by being a good steward to your customers.That means protecting their data, their interests, and their privacy. That means treating them with the respect they deserve. So often, we treat customers like numbers on a balance sheet. Just bombarding them with information to get their sale. This is not the way to make a great brand. This is being that pushy car salesman that no one feels comfortable around. When in doubt, all you have to do is put yourself in their shoes. Is this how I would want to hear about a brand like mine? Or does it feel weird? Is there a better way? Let empathy towards your community inspire you to do better and become the magnet of great customers.


One thing I feel passionate about as a marketer is that we have to find a better way. What this industry has become is a never-ending spiral of advertising. In essence, marketing should be about connecting with the people you want to help. We're not connecting by shouting messages at them all day, every day — in short, we're not being great partners with our clients.I hope that I can inspire you to new ways of thinking about marketing in a way that lets you attract all of the businesses you can handle without ever having to chase a thing.

62,Women Are More Likely to Be Laid Off Than Promoted in Tech — Here's How We Can Change the Status Quo,"Mar 1, 2024",Jacqueline White,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-ways-to-reverse-techs-gender-disparity-in-leadership/469543,"
Nearly every industry suffers from a gender gap in terms of leadership — including technology. In fact, women lag so far behind men that they hold less than 24% of all tech leadership positions across industries, according to 2023 data from WomenTech Network.The underrepresentation of women in the tech industry was exacerbated by the tech layoffs in 2022, further hindering their progress. According to additional research by WomenTech Network, 69% of those laid off were women. While this does not imply that the decisions were made due to intentional gender stereotypes, societal norms and implicit biases shape everything from hiring to promotions. Chances are that separations fell within these same lines.When women experience disproportionately higher layoff rates, the direct result will be a smaller pool of experienced women candidates for leadership positions. Not only is this trend a clear problem on its own, but it could also have significant long-term consequences if it persists. The industry already grapples with the glass-ceiling effect; higher layoff rates only reinforce that barrier. As a result, this could potentially discourage more women from entering and remaining in tech careers, worsening the existing underrepresentation of women in the field.



As the number of executive women in tech diminishes, there will also be fewer women role models and mentors available to guide and support younger women in their careers. Certainly not the best means of empowering women in tech, especially when you consider that 60% of managers who are men admit to being uncomfortable mentoring women, according to a study from LeanIn.Org. Additionally, job security is a significant factor to consider. Layoffs within the tech industry can create a sense of instability, potentially dissuading women from pursuing long-term careers in the field.Related: How to Close Your Wage Gap and Open Equity at Work


How to support women in techEmpowering women in tech can certainly help address myriad challenges, but it is still important to be proactive with your efforts. Otherwise, the underrepresentation will persist, just maybe not to the degree that the industry is currently experiencing. The question then remains: What should we do to solve these issues? The following are good places to start:1. Institute equal opportunity policiesI began my career in the late '90s when men primarily dominated the tech industry, so I knew I would have to work twice as hard to be considered in the same category as my male colleagues. While more laws are now in place to protect employees from being treated differently or less favorably due to their sex and gender, additional work can be done internally to minimize implicit biases. Something as simple as an audit of your HR policies around hiring and promotions can shed great light on whether these decisions are truly merit-based or not. Also, you should review workforce reductions to determine if the criteria used are objective and free from discrimination.2. Establish a formal mentorship programEveryone can benefit from a champion in the workplace, and a mentorship program can serve as the perfect avenue to narrow the gender gap. After all, a mentor not only aids in someone's professional development but also offers insights into how to navigate difficult situations and business relationships. This person also provides an opportunity to connect with others in the industry to build a stronger network.NetSuite certainly got the memo on this. The enterprise software company matches high-performing women with colleagues who work at least two levels above and in different departments than their mentees. The program seems to be successful based on the data, achieving a score of 3.7 out of 5.


Related: How Women Are Innovating and Shaping the Tech Landscape — and How Men Can Support Them3. Create a women-only leadership development programIf you want more executive women in tech, invest in their development. Create a leadership development program tailored specifically for women, aimed at preparing them for leadership positions. This program can align closely with your existing leadership programs, which should include an educational track for men in the organization as well.Necessary elements include communication, coaching, accountability, influence, negotiation and change management. The only real difference will be in the program's participants, and evidence suggests that the move will lead to higher promotion rates among women employees. It can also bolster retention and even attract more women tech talent to your company.Related: 3 Ways Leaders Can Support Women Who Want to Enter a Career in Tech 


4. Look at your organizational cultureSometimes, the answer to how to get more women in tech comes down to organizational culture. The lack of diversity in leadership can perpetuate the status quo and even discourage the necessary changes to promote equality. Ask yourself, ""Does my organizational culture foster inclusivity and diversity? Does it value the contributions of women in all aspects of operations?"" If not, look for ways to improve.Apple, for instance, has more than 25,000 of its employees participating in groups like Women@Apple, Black@Apple, Accessbility@Apple and more. There are even faith-based groups at the company. Could they do better? Probably, but the company scored 73 among diverse employees, putting it in the top 20% of U.S. companies with 10,000 or more employees.Getting more women in tech leadership positions is not just a matter of equity or social responsibility; it is a strategic imperative that directly impacts your bottom line. The data is clear: Diverse leadership teams drive innovation, improve decision-making, attract top talent and enhance corporate reputation. When combined, these ultimately lead to greater competitiveness and success in the dynamic tech industry.

63,How Can You Make Sure Your Business Will Survive Anything? Try These 3 Proven Strategies,"Feb 29, 2024",Mike Szczesny,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/3-strategies-to-make-sure-your-startup-can-survive-anything/469549,"
After a few years of economic uncertainty, 2024 is shaping up to be a promising time for startups to get off the ground. While software may see a particular resurgence due to anticipated market growth, every industry has opportunities for fresh concepts and innovative companies. That's beneficial for founders entering the tech industry. However, technology isn't the only area ripe for new companies, ideas and concepts.Take ecommerce, for instance. According to Insider Intelligence, it's a sector expected to expand as sales soar toward $1.72 trillion within three years. Renewable energy is another promising sector to explore, with the World Economic Forum noting that green solutions are expected to account for 35% of global energy by next year.In other words, it's a good time to consider launching a business or product. However, resilience remains crucial for all entrepreneurs venturing into the startup space. Even in the best of times, launching companies can be risky. Flexibility and adaptability are essential to success, no matter the economic climate.



How can you ensure that you are prepared to pivot at a moment's notice? Implement a few proven strategies to keep your growing business agile.Related: The Basics of Building a Budget for Your Business


1. Design your annual budget allocations to account for uncertaintyWhat are some reasons why startups fail? According to CBInsights, 38% of failed startups cited a lack of cash as the primary issue. That's nearly 4 in 10, which is a compelling reason to ensure that you dedicate significant time to adjusting your funding allocations.First off, be sure to set aside emergency dollars. Having some money in reserve could save you from problems if a vendor suddenly increases prices or you can't meet payroll. This is beyond just being efficient with your cash flow; it's setting aside a slush fund, so you're not struggling to cover basic bills.Next, invest in your profit centers. These will naturally include your sales, marketing and support departments. Many founders have made the mistake of trying to reduce their sales and advertising budgets. That's a good way to lose a lot of leads and make it difficult for you to generate revenue for your business. You can (and should) still operate with a lean, grassroots mindset. Don't be frugal in small matters and wasteful in larger ones, especially if you've allocated those emergency funds.2. Stay alert for opportunities to broaden your influenceYou need a solid business plan to establish a supportive and visionary framework for your company. That's great, but remain open to opportunities that might not align with your current plan. You don't have to seize every opportunity to grow, but stay alert to possibilities.


For example, let's say you have developed a product, and your business is in the U.S. However, your sales team brings you some interesting findings: They are receiving a lot of interest from buyers in foreign markets. This might indicate that you are focusing on increasing international sales. In 2021, INS Global discovered that 42% of companies found moving outside domestic markets a popular way to diversify.The point? Staying updated on trends is essential for making real-time decisions. Nothing should be set in stone, from marketing to reaching a new demographic to changing your internal processes. If you are too rigid, you will not experience the benefits that come from being able to adapt.Related: 10 Tech Trends That Will Shape the Next Decade3. Differentiate your company through exceptional customer serviceEvery company has competitors. Some of your competitors may offer products or services almost identical to your startup's. Yet, you can still win over customers with innovative customer service solutions.


This is how Zappos has risen to become a leader. The company's service team deserves custom awards for their innovative approach to engaging with customers needing assistance. A great example of their unique strategy is how Zappos focused on communicating with call-in customers during the pandemic. Instead of following the same old approach, Zappos empowered its representatives to engage in genuine conversations about anything and to stay on the phone for as long as necessary.How can you revitalize your service and disrupt your industry in a way that attracts more fans? A good starting point is to examine what other companies are (and aren't) doing. As you identify gaps, consider ways to address them. Next, test some of your creative solutions. Not all ideas will work, but some will likely be winners. Add them to your service offerings and watch your competition scramble to keep up.There's no reason to hesitate pursuing entrepreneurship in 2024. Yes, the past year or so has been challenging. That doesn't mean you can't be successful as a business owner. You just need to implement measures to enable your organization to adapt and change as the months progress — and the money flows in.Related: 4 Ways to Provide Excellent Customer Service

As the United States commemorates Black History Month, corporate marketers must challenge the oversimplified perception of Black Americans as a monolithic group. The United States comprises a diverse array of Black experiences, encompassing descendants of enslaved Africans, recent immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean and various cultural groups that have flourished over generations.As a Black marketer, I recognize the critical need for brands to connect authentically with the wide range of Black culture, crafting marketing that truly resonates without diminishing our diverse experiences.Related: Celebrating Black History and Culture Is the Right Thing to Do — and Good for Business. Here's How.



The diverse landscape of Black AmericaThe diversity within the Black American demographic is deeply rooted in the complex history of the United States, tracing back to the descendants of enslaved Africans brought to North America through the Transatlantic Slave Trade. This group's history has profoundly shaped the country's cultural, political and social narratives, characterized by resilience, cultural amalgamation and a rich legacy of contributions across various spheres.From this historical backdrop, unique cultural groups such as the Gullah Geechee in the Carolinas and Louisiana Creole have emerged, each with distinct identities shaped by their unique histories and cultural influences. The Gullah Geechee people have preserved their African heritage through language, crafts and community practices. Similarly, the Louisiana Creole community reflects a rich blend of French, African, Spanish and Native American influences, evident in their language, cuisine and music.


Adding to this, the Black American demographic is further diversified by significant immigrant populations from the Caribbean and Africa. Data from the Pew Research Center indicates that the Caribbean is the primary region of origin for Black immigrants, with nearly half (46%) of the foreign-born Black population originating from this area. Jamaica and Haiti are the most significant source countries, comprising 16% and 15% of the Black immigrant population, respectively. These communities, alongside other African immigrants, enrich the American cultural landscape with their diverse cultural backgrounds, adding new layers of complexity and richness to the Black American identity.This intricate blend of Black America presents unparalleled opportunities for targeted engagement. Marketers aiming to authentically engage with the broader Black community must grasp and appreciate these sub-communities' unique heritage, preferences and cultural narratives.The strategic importance of cultural specificityThe buying power of the Black American population is projected to exceed $1.8 trillion in the coming year — surpassing the annual GDPs of nations like Mexico and the Netherlands. Understanding and tapping into this market with respect and authenticity can significantly boost brand loyalty and market share.The demographic landscape of the United States has seen the Black population grow by 30%, to 36.2 million individuals as of 2021, emphasizing the importance of culturally specific marketing strategies. This significant change in demographics is characterized by the fact that roughly one in five Black Americans are immigrants or the children of immigrants.


Related: Unpacking the Black Demographic Shift and Why Marketers Must Re-Examine Their StrategiesCompanies doing it rightGoogle:Through its innovative Google Doodles, Google has spotlighted prominent figures from Haitian and Jamaican history, effectively bringing their stories and achievements to the forefront of the international community. These doodles serve as a gateway for millions worldwide to engage with and learn about the profound impact of Haitian and Jamaican cultures. Further amplifying its commitment, Google's Arts & Culture platform stands as a testament to the company's commitment to cultural preservation and education, offering users curated exhibitions and narratives celebrating Haiti and Jamaica's unique cultural identities (alongside a plethora of other countries).Peloton:


Peloton has played a pivotal role in amplifying diverse voices within the fitness industry, providing a significant platform for instructors like Alex Toussaint to share their unique perspectives and cultural heritage. Toussaint's presence and narrative on Peloton do more than add depth to the brand's instructor lineup; they offer a blueprint for leveraging personal stories and cultural heritage in marketing strategies.This strategy enhances the brand's representation efforts and positions Peloton as a leader in promoting inclusivity and understanding through fitness, demonstrating the profound impact of integrating personal heritage with brand identity in today's digital marketing landscape. By aligning with voices like Toussaint's, Peloton demonstrates how brands can successfully integrate representation into their marketing strategies, turning their platforms into arenas for positive change and community building.Disney:Despite The Princess and the Frog premiering in 2009, Disney has strategically embraced and celebrated Louisiana Creole culture. The film introduced Tiana as the first Black Disney princess and was set against the vibrant backdrop of New Orleans. Disney's promotional efforts skillfully highlighted these cultural elements, appealing to a broad audience while paying homage to the cultural significance of the film's setting and characters. Disney's marketing successfully balanced cultural authenticity with timeless appeal, from merchandise featuring Tiana to collaborations with renowned Louisiana Creole chefs. This long-term commitment has manifested in several significant initiatives that continue to pay cultural and commercial dividends for the brand.


In the fall of 2023, Tiana's Palace opened in Disneyland Resort's New Orleans Square, extending the narrative beyond the screen with a dining experience offering Louisiana Creole cuisine and the vibrant atmosphere depicted in the movie. Additionally, the announcement of ""Tiana's Bayou Adventure,"" slated to open in 2024 as a reimagined ride replacing Splash Mountain, further demonstrates Disney's commitment to celebrating Louisiana Creole culture along with the Louisiana ecosystem, thus enhancing its brand identity as inclusive and diverse.Related: 20 Brands That Are Actually Making Progress on their Commitments to Serving the Black CommunityTo authentically engage with the diversity within the Black community, brands can incorporate culturally specific phrases or expressions into targeted marketing efforts. These strategic integrations, particularly in areas with a significant Jamaican and Haitian community presence, like New York and Florida, deepen connections and showcase respect and appreciation for cultural diversity. By commemorating cultural events and infusing these subtle nuances, brands can significantly enhance engagement. Collaborative initiatives with community leaders and influencers further authenticate these campaigns, while diverse representation in advertising accurately mirrors the community's spectrum of identities, fostering trust and loyalty among customers.In today's marketplace, where authenticity and genuine connection are highly valued, brands must acknowledge and celebrate the diversity within the Black community. Embracing Black Americans' distinct cultures, languages and historical narratives enables brands to foster deeper engagement, loyalty and respect among their audiences. This strategy demands a dedicated effort to grasp and weave these cultural identities into marketing initiatives, ensuring authenticity and a commitment to diversity and inclusion. By doing so, brands enrich their relationships with diverse communities and set a standard for meaningful engagement in the industry.

66,The Owners of This Texas Farmers Market Took a Big Gamble. Here's How It Paid Off Bigger Than They Dreamed.,"Feb 22, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-this-texas-farmers-markets-gamble-paid-off-big/470139,"
Fall Creek Farmers Market in Humble, Texas, is not just a spot to stop by for your Sunday morning coffee and a fresh vegetable or two. Owners Jonathan and Andrea Haskin built this vibrant space with a vision to change their community's food shopping habits and educate their customers on the importance of buying fresh and local items.The couple came up with the idea for the market in 2015 when they started taking a longer look at what kind of food they had available to them and realized they had to travel far and wide just to source quality ingredients from local farmers. What would happen if they brought their community closer to the source?Related: Top Health and Wellness Franchises



To their delight, the Haskin's neighbors embraced the concept. Situated in the beautiful Fall Creek neighborhood, the market's outdoor setup is near a golf course and several walking trails, drawing tons of people and their pets into the space every Sunday morning.Jonathan and Andrea prioritize being present in their space and providing a personalized experience for every visitor. Getting set up two hours before the market opens and staying until the last group trickles out, the pair walk around to greet and share their story with customers. In the market's early days, their daughters sat at the entrance making bracelets for shoppers as they walked in.


This community feel is what drew in reviewer Forest B., now a regular visitor of Fall Creek Farmers Market. ""All of the vendors were so personable, willing to share advice and their specific stories,"" his review reads. ""I particularly enjoyed the cultural diversity. So much to learn at each booth.""With 20+ vendors spanning global cuisines, there is no limit to the kind of food you can sample at Fall Creek Farmers Market. On his first visit alone, Forest tried a Colombian coffee blend, two empanada flavors, Vietnamese egg rolls, and an Italian ice dessert. The cherry on top was getting to engage with the vendors themselves, learning firsthand about their products and journeys.Related: 4 Reasons Why You Should Enter the Health and Wellness Industry""One [vendor] that's not mentioned in my review is the Indian couple who serve prepared foods there,"" Forest said. ""They are a little bit older. That's completely different, say, from the couple who owns Frostbite, which is the Italian ice vendor. They're youngsters and [are] actually looking to you to provide them information on your journey here in the United States. So you just learn quite a bit about the people. Sometimes people are a little surprised to find out that you know a lot about topics in their areas, but the way you learn a lot is by talking to people and being open and receptive.""


Forest's experience is a perfect example of Jonathan and Andrea's educational ecosystem in action. First and foremost, the market aims to teach its visitors about the importance of fresh, quality food. The Haskins ensure their vendors share this passion and make an effort to educate every customer who visits their booth. 90% of Fall Creek's vendors farm and ranch full-time. Some even take agriculture classes at Texas A&M.""They live it as we do,"" Jonathan said. ""And it starts from the inside. We are really passionate about immersing ourselves into the market, and we are very selective with who we allow [to be] a part of our team.""Jonathan and Andrea's goal is to be the tipping point that pushes customers into the world of local food shopping, and they've found that preparation is key. They engage with customers online ahead of each sale to make sure they have all the information they need for a smooth visit. Because offerings shift each week to spice things up for shoppers and ensure seasonal produce stays front and center, Jonathan and Andrea provide a list of vendors and produce options in advance to help customers plan their meals and build out their grocery lists before arriving at the market.Related: How This Healthy Food App Scored a $200K Investment


The most faithful customers do around 80% of their food shopping at Falls Creek Farmers Market, which was the vision the owners had in mind when they set out to build a business.""It's not a craft show. It's not a bake sale. You can actually come and get your pastured eggs and real items,"" Jonathan said. ""Knowing where your food is from is a big deal. It's like getting a root canal or heart surgery. So it feels really good to be able to serve and to be able to give them access as we have it.""Not only is shopping locally good for your health, but it's good for the local economy. Forest stressed the importance of spending your money and time at small businesses.""Business owners typically are here from other countries. [They] come from backgrounds in which there was virtually no safety net, so they bring their knowledge to the United States. When I'm looking at these businesses, I'm looking at how I can learn more so I can help other people in the community continue to start these small businesses that make our economy run.""


Beyond making visits, reviewing is a powerful way customers can show support. Jonathan and Andrea take every review they receive to heart, always looking to expand the offerings and inclusivity of their space. They find it important to stay receptive to feedback, keeping the dialogue with customers open, genuine, and full of love.In addition to prioritizing customer education and building community, Falls Creek Farmers Market believes:Passion starts from the inside. Put love and care into what you do and it will trickle down to your partners and employees—and ultimately your customers.Preparation is key. Communicate online with your customers ahead of a sale so they know what to expect. Plus, make time to help out with any problems that come up.Supporting local is a great way to learn new things.

68,"Adapting to Change Is Key to Surviving Every Consumer Demand — Just Ask Netflix, Blockbuster, WeWork and More","Feb 19, 2024",Zain  Jaffer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/pivoting-is-the-key-to-survival-just-ask-these/469582,"
The case of how the shared workspace company WeWork went from being a darling of American business to bankruptcy is an example of a long line of business failures that stem from an inability of top management to adjust to a major change that has occurred in the world.Many do not see the iceberg ahead, but some can shift courseThe RMS Titanic sank in 1912 because everyone thought she was unsinkable. Human hubris and pride is a flaw we all have. Even C-level executives have it despite their opinions to the contrary, and old practices that worked well in the past are hard to change.Take for example Nokia, a giant in the analog cellphone sector. When Apple launched its iPhone, and Google came out with the Android operating system, the Finnish giant which had pivoted earlier from the lumber industry radio business to cellphones decided to stick it out with its proprietary Symbian operating system. The market did not agree, and soon thereafter Nokia lost its lead in the industry along with players like Sony Ericsson and Motorola to newer phone makers like Samsung and Apple.



When Netflix was a puny startup, they offered themselves up for sale for $50 million to Blockbuster, which declined Netflix's DVD mailing movie business. During that time, Blockbuster was the giant in the VHS/DVD movie rental business, with a retail store presence on many street corners. Unfortunately for them, they failed to recognize the changes that had occurred, namely that streaming video technology had become cheap. Netflix on the other hand was humble enough to recognize the shift and is now one of the major behemoths of the NASDAQ.Related: How Pivoting Saved My Business When Things Didn't Go According to Plan


Often those who have stellar educational backgrounds fail to recognize these shifts particularly if success is all they have encountered with the status quo. It is after all hard to question why you are successful. Most people will simply take it for granted, and in some cases, decide that their special management abilities are what led to their success.On the positive side, one example of a major strategic shift that was executed successfully was when Intel under their late CEO Andrew Grove with cofounders Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore led their business shift from memory chips to the new business of microprocessors in the '70s. It is easy to make that shift as a business if the current business is losing money, but harder if it is making tons of money. In Intel's case, they decided that if new management came in, they would shift to microprocessors because of the upcoming personal computer (PC) business with IBM and others, so they decided that they would do it instead.Grove pointed out in his management bestseller book, Only the Paranoid Survive, that each company and industry might in its future face what are called Strategic Inflection Points. These are key moments when management should recognize that something major has shifted, and if a company is unable to pivot, the company might face a decline or even extinction.How, then, should we act?The number of eventual business failures that have graced the covers of top business magazines shows that hubris is everywhere. A real business leader, to remain successful throughout the duration of a career along with the company should also exhibit some humility.


What is worse is we often try to defend our positions and use confirmation bias, even if the data that supports our argument is random to begin with. Meaning that the data, while appearing to support your position, does not.The first step we need to do is to admit that as human leaders, we are not infallible. Every one of us can make mistakes. Appearing on the cover of a business magazine and getting invited to speak in prestigious global forums like in Davos, Switzerland or sitting in the C-Suite does not make us less human.Next, learn some statistics, such as how to use an XY scatter plot. At least enough so that you know you need enough data to show a real correlated trend. Learn not to infer a trend from a random set of data that does not even show a line or a curve if graphed. Just because you got three coin tosses as heads does not mean that the next coin toss will land the same as before.A turkey's life before the ax falls on its head is pretty good. The turkey is well-fed and gently treated. In short, past performance is not an indicator of future performance.


If your data already shows a trend, do not suffer from analysis paralysis just because you are incapable of shifting gears. If it is time to change course, just do it. Discuss with your team what to do if you are wrong and actually make that shift in direction. Have a pre-agreed exit strategy from the position you first took, no matter how hardcore you were. If something has changed, be ready to pivot.Related: Knowing When — and How — to Pivot Is Key to Your Business' Survival. Here's What You Need to Do.Do not become extinctHaving the ability to spot when something has changed, and the willingness to abandon the success of the past that may no longer be true for a new uncharted course is part of good business leadership.It is not risk-free, but it is necessary. It can prolong your business for the next few decades to come if your company masters this skill — otherwise, you'll become just like the dodos and dinosaurs.

The evolution of DEI over the past several years has been marked by corporate fickleness, with several brands and businesses pledging public commitments and setting up frameworks that have since fallen short of true impact and action. In its first wave, DEI was seen as a moral imperative and compliance issue; the second wave will reveal how the brands that made DEI a true priority will start to see the payoff, literally, in the pockets of shareholders.It's more important than ever to make sure your brand content is authentic and racially appropriate — not just for your brand reputation, but to build and maintain a loyal and active consumer base.When diversity and inclusion are recognized as a strategic advantage, it rewards the boardroom and beyond. True DEI not only benefits employees and society at large but also translates into tangible financial returns for shareholders.

Why They Shouldn't and How to Recommit.Opening the apertureThirty-nine percent of your purchasing audience is multicultural, which means inclusive communication can unlock this market. When you reach a wider audience, your ad dollars go further, new customers are acquired, and shareholders are happy.


Entrepreneurs who are looking for new ways to drive their business forward, look no further than DEI. It's easy to understand the importance of diversity and inclusion across the board, but these efforts are often misunderstood when it comes to marketing.That's why I founded XStereotype, an AI-powered platform that helps businesses predict how effective content will be across demographics. We've quantifiably proven that inclusivity sells. The more inclusive your advertising is, the more money you'll make.Our data shows that these traditional demographic markers hold less and less power over purchasing behavior. Socioeconomic status, region and education don't impact intent to purchase as much as lived experiences, including markers of ethnicity, gender, emotion and more. These are more significant signals as to whether or not they'll make a purchase.Our data reveals a strong correlation between positive emotional responses and positive interpretations of diversity in content. In fact, of the ads we've analyzed, purchase intent scores improved by 10% across the board for ads that received high inclusion scores. And that just makes sense: People are more likely to buy from your brand when they see themselves reflected in the content they're consuming.


From ""targeting"" to ""inclusion""Now is the time for brands to update their marketing strategies from ""targeting"" to ""inclusion."" When we're ""targeted"" as a demographic, we're often treated as a monolith — that's where the dangers of stereotyping can come into play.Targeted media can make us feel like a walking statistic, as opposed to consuming content that resonates with us and makes us feel heard. Targeting is the old way of approaching marketing: It leads to negative brand sentiment, and it's innately segregating.Many brand leaders make the mistake of trying to laser-focus on just one target audience, when in reality, the ads and content that work best appeal to all audiences. To optimize your ROI, reexamine the inclusivity of your message and brand personality.Companies that close their aperture and put their dollars solely towards more targeted groups are going to shrivel up and shrink and shutter. Opening the aperture is the way to survive: Since 39% of your purchasing audience is multicultural, why not speak to them too?


Related: The Key to Developing More Informed and Inclusive DEI Marketing StrategiesInclusion sells. Authenticity sells.Here's a basic example: Let's say a local hair salon has posters in their windows showcasing the beautiful styles they offer. Solid strategy, right? But what if these photos only feature white women, and half of the local community are people of color? A Black woman might walk past that salon every day without stopping in — not because she doesn't need a trim, but because the ads don't resonate. Authentic representation matters — not just because it's inclusive, but because it gets the consumer through the door.You don't need to create a whole new product or service, just make it more relatable. It's not that these audiences don't want or need what you're selling; it's that your value proposition didn't speak to them because they couldn't connect with your content.This is the benefit of being inclusive: You make your ad work harder, smarter and better. Multicultural understanding will help these ad dollars go farther and reach a greater audience. Your marketing budget will be optimized when focused on developing content that speaks to a broader audience in a real, non-stereotypical way.


So, next time you're wondering how to boost sales or really nail that next product launch, consider the audiences you might be missing. Prioritize diversity, speak authentically, and watch DEI turn into ROI.

70,Why the National Football League Is a Leader in Social and Corporate Impact,"Feb 14, 2024",Craig Kielburger,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/why-the-nfl-is-a-leader-in-social-impact/469239,"
The expectations for this year's Super Bowl were high, but I don't think anyone predicted that this year's event would turn out to be America's most-watched program since the moon landing, with an astounding 123.4 million viewers tuning in to the big game.While the Taylor Swift effect certainly was a factor in achieving that staggering number, there is more to the modern NFL than celebrity fans, touchdowns and tailgate parties. The league has grown into a case study for a corporation seeking to support its communities across the country.The NFL has been a long-time supporter of charitable causes, but in recent years, it has significantly ramped up its player safety, social responsibility and social justice initiatives.



A visit to the NFL's Community page on its website shows the breadth of the league's initiatives, from environmental sustainability to domestic violence education, youth fitness, early cancer detection and prevention, and building character in young people.I learned of the massive scope of the NFL's social responsibility work through another of its initiatives, Inspire Change, the league's social justice platform. Its goal is to reduce barriers to opportunity, particularly in communities of color. It operates at all levels of the league, from current and former players to the NFL teams and their owners and up to the league head office.


Related: A Former NFL Plays Says 'Indentity Shifting' Is the Key to SuccessInspire Change facilitates NFL investment in organizations, programs and initiatives that reduce barriers to opportunity, anchored in four pillars: Education, Economic Advancement, Community-Police Relations, and Criminal Justice Reform.My connection to the program came from a partnership between Inspire Change, my organization (Legacy+), and the Martin Luther King III Foundation.Martin Luther King III, his wife Arndrea Waters King, and their daughter Yolanda Renee King were seeking ways to commemorate the upcoming 100th birthday of Martin's father, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The result was Realize the Dream, a bold new initiative that aims to transform, unify and uplift America by rallying communities to perform 100 million hours of service by the 100th anniversary of Dr. King's birth.


In seeking to amplify Dr. King's vision of unity and launch the historic community service program, the NFL was an obvious choice. No other platform has the reach or worldwide profile held by the NFL. In 2023, the league averaged 17.2 million viewers per game for its 272 regular season games, creating a potential viewing audience unmatched in North America.Those significant audience numbers rise exponentially during the playoffs, so we worked closely with the NFL to launch the five-year service campaign during Wildcard Weekend, which coincided with MLK Day 2024.The game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Tampa Bay Buccaneers opened with a commemorative coin toss with Martin Luther King III, Arndrea Waters King and Yolanda Renee King.A series of events and activations took place over the weekend, with MLK decals and Dr. King's iconic ""Be Love"" message affixed to the helmets of all 318 players participating in the weekend games. The ""Be Love"" and ""It Takes All of Us"" messages were also stenciled into the end zones for all games.


The game opened by the Kings drew an audience of over 29.2 million viewers. While that number seems low compared to the viewership for the Super Bowl, the game was ESPN's second-most watched NFL game in its history. Public service announcements aired over the weekend on all the networks covering the games (ESPN, ABC and CBS), with over 180 million viewers taking in the games and viewing the powerful Realize the Dream messaging.Beyond its ability to reach tens of millions of viewers, we looked for the NFL's support due to its work to raise awareness on diversity and equity issues. Along with Inspire Change, the league is on the record in committing to increasing the number of black head coaches and executives so that the diversity on the field is reflected back on the sidelines and in owners' boxes.To that end, the league adopted the Rooney Rule in 2003. Named after a former Pittsburgh Steelers owner who also served as the chair of the league's diversity committee, the rule set out hiring and interview requirements for filling coaching and front office positions to ensure more minority candidates were considered and hired.Related: Why All of Us Need to Join the Fight for Workplace Diversity


The NFL's support for Realize the Dream is yet another positive step in accelerating the league's commitment to diversity and inclusion, and it may already be reaping benefits.Within days of the launch of the campaign, the New England Patriots named Jerod Mayo as their new head coach, the Atlanta Falcons hired Raheem Morris to lead their team, and the Las Vegas Raiders elevated interim head coach Antonio Pierce to full-time status.While those three hirings happening so close to the launch of Realize the Dream could be written off as coincidence, they may also reflect how the league's open commitment to diversity can influence the actions of ownership, teams, and players.That is the power of corporate impact initiatives that permeate an entire organization. It would be one thing for the NFL to make a lump sum donation to Realize the Dream or some other cause, but the level of buy-in was visible on team uniforms and helmets, in the end zones on the field, all while tens of millions of viewers watched from homes and restaurants.


While corporations making donations to charitable organizations is a commendable way to try and give back, concrete actions like those being taken by the NFL deliver true impact and will ultimately be the drivers of change.

71,The Difference Between Startup Success and Failure Comes Down to This One Thing,"Feb 12, 2024",Hilt Tatum IV,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/the-difference-between-startup-success-and-failure-comes/468936,"
In every company, employees are an invaluable resource. Not only are they the ones who help startups hit the ground running, working fast and furious to meet outrageous goals, but they also bring an incredible background of education, experience, abilities, creativity and more.These are the intangible factors that make human capital such a critical piece of the startup puzzle.As a former entrepreneur and now an investor who helps startups realize their dreams, I know how a talented and motivated workforce can mean the difference between a successful business venture and one that fails.



Let's discuss how human capital can be the secret weapon for a thriving startup.Related: Beyond the Basics: 5 Surprising Qualities Investors Seek in a Winning Team


Invest in people and their skillsWhile entrepreneurs have great ideas, they need a team with the right abilities to take their vision from a concept to a viable product or service. That means finding the right people with particular skills and experiences to drive innovation and solve problems others can't.Personality, attitude and work ethic are crucial. That's one element of human capital that can't be ignored. You can hire someone who is the best in their field, but if they create division and strife in your team, it won't work.Conversely, your startup's success depends on people who know what they're doing and do it well. It's hard to build a strong company with good people who aren't contributing to the day-in-day-out technical needs of the organization.It's a balancing act you must evaluate correctly the first time, as hiring the wrong person can set your company back. And in the fast-paced startup environment, that doesn't bode well for future investments.


Attracting and keeping top talentAnyone familiar with startup culture knows that it can get pretty vicious when you're trying to hire the best talent. It's highly competitive, with many fledgling companies vying for precious capital.That's why creating a culture that attracts the right candidates is essential. With so much transition over the past decade, there are not many ways startups can differentiate themselves in a tangible sense, such as working virtually, ping pong tables, free food, etc. With most companies already offering those things, it becomes more about selling your vision and what the future could hold with the right people on board. Appealing to a candidate's sense of self-worth and intrinsic value can go a long way to bring them on.However, once you have them in the fold, the game's not over yet. According to Founders Circle, the average employee tenure in high-growth startups is two years. If getting them in the door wasn't hard enough, keeping them there is even more challenging.This attrition rate makes sense. Startup life is a grind, and it can quickly take a toll on everyone within the organization. That's why employee engagement initiatives are so important. As an entrepreneur, you have to remember that you have real people working for you, and even the most devoted among them have needs.


Talk with your team members individually and have honest conversations about how they're doing, how the company is doing and how your team can help each other through challenging periods. Ask them what they need or if there's any further education or learning that might help them in their roles. You have no idea how the simple act of taking time to attend to your employees, treating them as people and not resources, can motivate them to keep their eyes on the prize.Related: Here's What's Brewing in the Minds of Startup InvestorsA culture of continuous learningWhile the scheduling and budget constraints of running a startup can be brutal sometimes, it's still important to carve out opportunities for your people to focus on enhanced learning and skill development. Giving employees the chance to pursue their passions and improve their craft is an integral part of the human capital process.If you think about the technology and software industries, change and evolution are constant. It only makes sense that you want your team to stay updated on the latest trends and developments, bringing these new insights into your organization. You want your team to evolve with the technology they're working with, so allow them time to focus on the latest updates and integrate those ideas into their daily work.


Not only is this an essential investment in your company, but you're also sending your people the message that you value them and their careers. You want them to be the best versions of themselves and give them opportunities to build on their knowledge and experiences.That can be scary, as it's always a possibility they may take all this new knowledge to another organization. But that's a risk you should be willing to take if it means improving your product and service while bolstering your company culture.Building a winning teamAs mentioned, I've been on both sides of startup life as an entrepreneur and an investor. In my experience, I have found and firmly believe that no single individual can get all the work done, nor do they have the talent to do so.As a leader within an organization, it's your responsibility to recognize that you can't do it all, and you shouldn't have to. Finding the right people makes an incredible difference in the work you do. That includes building a diverse and inclusive team. A robust and diverse team is a good signal to investors of a healthy organization, and it also pushes your team to think in new, innovative ways crucial to development.


Every person in your organization should be seen as a strategic ally and resource for your company's continued growth, development and success.

72,'Go Back to Your Tractors': 4 Business Lessons We Can Learn From the Iconic Rise of Lamborghini,"Feb 9, 2024",Jerod Guerin,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-lessons-we-can-learn-from-the-iconic-rise-of-lamborghini/468882,"
After over 60 years in business, Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann says the supercar company is still going strong — selling more cars every month than it can produce, even after increasing production twice in 2022. Amidst inflation, rising interest rates, and increasing energy costs, it's a stunning success story — especially for a once-bankrupt company, liquidated and pulled up by the bootstraps of a farmer's son.With annual revenue exceeding €2.8 billion ($US3.07 billion), Lamborghini may not seem like a case study for small and medium-sized businesses, but this mega company's long and tattered history can teach modern founders a thing or two about innovating from raw resources, leveraging publicity, and refusing to compromise on the quality of its products. Business owners may recognize themselves in the humbleness of Ferruccio Lamborghini's beginnings, but his whole story offers four key lessons for how to turn core values into an enduring brand.Related: What Benjamin Franklin and Tony Robbins Can Teach You About Self-Improvement



1. Get savvy: Start with what you knowFerruccio Lamborghini was born into an Italian family of farmers, but from a young age, his focus was less on the farm and more on the machines needed to operate it. He was gifted at fixing engines, a knack that steered him to attend technical school and later to serve as a mechanic in World War II for the Italian armed forces.After the war ended, Ferruccio saw opportunity. He salvaged surplus parts the Allied Forces had left behind and returned to his hometown, where he began building tractors on his family's farm. The Lamborghini Trattori company was born with its notoriously affordable and robust builds.


In just a few short years, Ferruccio had not one but two flourishing companies (the other a heating and air-conditioning business), making him one of the wealthiest men in Italy by 1962. His early ventures may not have been as glamorous as the supercar company known the world over today, but they provide a strategic blueprint for business owners.By recognizing opportunity and utilizing the period's abundant resources, Ferruccio was able to leverage his farming connections and existing skills to embrace tractor manufacturing. He then diversified into the heating/air conditioning sector to help mitigate risk as he observed changes in post-war living. These savvy decisions ultimately set Ferruccio on the path to pursuing his deepest passion.Related: 5 Ways to Spot and Capitalize on Trends2. Chase perfection and don't compromise, everBy the time he was in his 40s, Ferruccio had ample time and money and so briefly considered building helicopters, but the government refused him a license. Instead, he turned to marvel at his growing collection of Jaguars, Mercedes, Ferraris and Maseratis. But Ferruccio's enthusiasm for perfection led to a nagging problem: No car ever completely satisfied him.


If it wasn't the weak ventilation, it was the noise of the power transmission or the inferior leather lining. When he purchased a brand-new Ferrari 250 GT, he experienced issues with its clutch. Frustrated, Ferruccio told his factory mechanics to take the assembly apart, revealing that his top-of-the-line Ferrari used the same clutch component as Lamborghini's own tractors.Ferruccio was shocked. He paid 10 lire for his tractor clutches; Ferrari charged him 1,000 for the same part. He was even more upset to learn that Ferraris were not built with specialty components that were more durable and suitable for the use case. He took his complaint straight to Enzo Ferrari himself but was not met with open arms. Ferruccio went to his grave claiming that Ferrari, known for his bluntness, yelled at him: ""The problem is not my car, it's the driver. Go back to your tractors and leave me alone!""Whether fudged or fabricated, the two titans' decades-long feud provided fantastic publicity for both parties. Ferrari was already a household name, and by hiring some of Ferrari's ex-engineers and -mechanics, Lamborghini was able to debut its first model car only four months later.Related: How to Build a Business That Lasts 100 Years


3. Elevate customer serviceLamborghini presented its first prototype at the 1963 Turin Auto Show, dubbing it the Lamborghini 350 GTV. Ferruccio chose his zodiac sign, Taurus the Bull, as the company logo. The prototype morphed into Lamborghini's first production model and later the Miura, Espada, Islero and Jarama. The company boomed as Lamborghini's cars received wide acclaim for their refinement, power and comfort.A lifelong passion for cars fueled Ferruccio, but his early business ventures proved priceless in setting the company apart. His heating and air-conditioning service company, Brucatori, had instilled in him the importance of never compromising on customer satisfaction. If a customer's car broke down, Lamborghini would pay to send a mechanic straight to them, by plane if needed, along with a personal letter of apology. This no-compromise mentality became indelibly associated with the luxury level of not just the car itself but the Lamborghini service.Related: 6 Tips to Build a Business That Will Last Decades 4. Core values are meant to lastUnfortunately, the 1970s weren't as kind to the brand. Union strife and failed emissions tests stifled the company's entry into the lucrative U.S. market, leading to a temporary withdrawal. While facing challenges with conforming to U.S. regulations, Lamborghini only managed to continue selling the Countach in America after a seven-year absence.


Feeling the weight of financial troubles, Ferruccio sold his shares and retired, and Lamborghini eventually entered bankruptcy proceedings. The company changed hands multiple times throughout the '80s, and the product line stagnated. But we all know the story didn't end there. The Volkswagen Group acquired Lamborghini in 1998 and, under new owners, innovation returned.Under the management of Volkswagen's Audi division, Lamborghini has regained its status as a supercar manufacturer known for its incredible performance, state-of-the-art power and unparalleled luxury. Ferruccio may have moved on long ago, but he created a legacy through his unwavering commitment to service, performance, and perfection. It's a lesson of perseverance and staying true to a brand's core values. And when it was time for Ferruccio to step down, brand evangelists kept the name and the tenacity behind Lamborghini alive for future generations.

""Be nice, be clean, and be present."" This is the mantra of Philip and Sibs Harrell, owners of Sundae Scoop, a mom-and-pop ice cream shop in Virginia Beach, Virginia.Customer service is the number one priority for these business owners. Whether chatting with customers or selecting and training staff, Philip and Sibs focus on creating an inviting community space for friends and families to gather.Related: 7 Essentials of Great Customer Service



""At the end of the day, being in the community is what an ice cream shop is about,"" Philip said. ""We represent every culture that's in our area. That's where the ube ice cream comes from, or the coquito, or rum raisin. Each one of those [flavors] is gonna respond or touch something in someone that they remember from their childhood.""Sundae Scoop's warm and engaging customer service has earned the business a 4.8-star Yelp rating with nearly 100 reviews (at the time of writing). Most reviewers discuss positive experiences they've had interacting with Philip and his friendly staff, including Yelp Elite Aneesa P.


Arriving right after the store had opened for the day, Aneesa chatted with Philip as she ordered her ice cream. He shared the story of the shop, helped her pick out the perfect gluten-free flavor, and even helped her snap the perfect photos and videos to accompany her review.""I felt like we really connected,"" Aneesa said. ""He wasn't just like 'Here's your ice cream. Go.' He was like, 'Hey, I want to let you know, behind the scenes, the story of how I came up with this idea.'""Philip and Sibs see positive reviews like Aneesa's as a key tool for boosting staff morale. When a scooper gets called out by name for contributing to a positive customer experience, Philip and Sibs are the first to let them know.""They're young kids. They're very self-conscious,"" Sibs said. ""So it feels really good when people give them their big-ups and name them.""


Philip and Sibs spend a lot of time not only encouraging existing staff but also hiring scoopers who will contribute to Sundae Scoop's hospitable culture. They ask all job candidates to thoroughly read the reviews and take note of what people love most about the shop. They want to make sure all new and potential hires are ready to deliver the peppy, friendly service Sundae Scoop promises.Related: How Chef JJ Started a Rice Bowl Revolution in HarlemAs a community-driven space, Sundae Scoop is active in the Virginia Beach area, partnering with local schools and businesses on events like ice cream socials. Philip and Sibs are also committed to mentoring fellow small business owners, connecting with other businesses through community groups and promoting them on the walls of their shop. In his three years running Sundae Scoop, Philip has helped three other businesses get off the ground.""They took the risk too. They took that leap of faith,"" he said. ""So if someone like myself or my wife can come along and help them on their journey, that's all the better because it's building a stronger community.""


Philip has found these relationships especially important to cultivate as a Black business owner. He speaks to the fear of the unknown that can surface in the Black business owner community when you don't know who to turn to or what resources are out there.Related: 3 Strategies This Vietnamese Noodle Shop Has Used to Thrive in Minnesota""I always encourage people just to join something,"" he said. ""You gotta find something bigger than yourself. You have to find people who look like you, and you have to find people who don't look like you. And you need to be able to use advice from all of them and put it together.""Supporting Black-owned businesses was part of Aneesa's motivation to visit Sundae Scoop. Being one of a handful of Black women in her field, she was able to connect with Philip over what it's like to be successful in a white-dominated space. Aneesa stressed the importance of writing reviews to ensure that great Black-owned businesses don't get closed down due to a lack of support.


""We all have to support each other, not bring each other down,"" she said. ""[It's] really important to me to be able to let everybody know, 'Hey, we can own all of these spaces and also be successful as well.'""Philip and Sibs remind themselves every day of their commitment to being groundbreakers in their community with a mural on the wall of Sundae Scoop. This reimagining of the famous painting ""Under the Wave off Kanagawa"" represents a line from artist and rapper Tobe Nwigwe's song ""EAT"" that reads: ""[We] don't just ride the wave, we create it.'""""[Sundae Scoop] is our way of creating our own waves, of making our own path and making sure that we're going to be okay,"" Philip said. ""At the end of the day, just be good, support each other, and help each other where you can, and I can almost promise you that it's going to come back your way.""In addition to the power of warm and engaging customer service, Sundae Scoop believes:Reviews are the roadmap to success. Positive feedback can be used to set key expectations for staff, and critical feedback can be used to make important changes to operations or processes that make the customer experience easier or more enjoyable.Friendly staff play an important role in creating positive customer experiences, and training them on your processes and values is a key part of your customer service strategy. Hire a diverse team of employees who are dedicated to delivering your business's mission.Minority-owned small businesses need to support each other.

74,Sephora Hit $10 Billion in Revenue and Workers Aren't Happy That All They Got Was a 'Stale Cookie',"Feb 7, 2024",Jordan Hart,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/sephora-reaches-10b-in-sales-gives-workers-stale-cookie/469417,"
This article originally appeared on Business Insider.Beauty chain Sephora hit a big sales milestone in 2023, but the workers who helped to make it happen say all they got was a ""stale"" cookie as thanks.The company celebrated hitting $10 billion in revenue in North America last week, and some of its stores got cookies in the mail as a gift.



But, the sprinkled treats and an attached thank you note — which demanded confidentiality — didn't go over well with Sephora's employees, according to a slew of comments online and two workers who asked to remain anonymous.""They are always coaching us to meet our goals and expectations, and, of course, everyone goes above and beyond for the company and all they give us is a stale cookie and a letter thanking us,"" said one former employee whose last day coincided with the cookie delivery.


Another employee told Business Insider: ""When we got the cookies, we were like, 'Wait what?'""It's obvious they're not listening to us,"" he said. ""These are people who don't know how this actually works and how important we are to the operation.""In a statement to BI, Sephora said it ""had a great year thanks to our extraordinary team members who help create and build our incredible beauty community.""We are proud of all our employees across our stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices who contributed to this shared success in North America,"" the company said in the statement. ""As the leading prestige beauty retailer, it's success like this that allows us to continue to offer highly competitive benefits and pay, performance bonuses, education, brand perks, training product, gratis, and substantial product discounts to our employees.""


It's unclear if Sephora gave employees any additional compensation for hitting the milestone.Anonymous via Business InsiderSephora staff got the treats over the last week, workers said. The cookies came wrapped with a label saying ""We did it! $10 billion"" to celebrate the company raking in record-setting hauls.


Sephora's card — which BI has seen — said the company set records for Black Friday in stores, as well as new bests for its online traffic and warehouse fulfillment.""Inside this box, you will find a sweet treat to enjoy with your team,"" the card continued. ""We thank you for making it our greatest year ever. Cheers.""At the bottom of the card was a warning: ""The content of this card is confidential and should not be shared externally as it is a violation of our company policies.""But that didn't keep a subreddit dedicated to Sephora employees from trashing the presents.

Some poked fun with reviews of how the pre-packaged goods tasted (one user gave it a 4 out of 10), but others said it made them feel like ""dirt on the bottom of their shoes.""Another user turned the cookie into a call to action: ""Let the unionization begin!"" they wrote.The employee who got the cookie on her last day said it was ""totally normal"" to see a confidentiality notice attached to gifts from Sephora.She said the gift left her disappointed, but not surprised.""They really don't reward us for the work and mental energy it takes to be a Sephora employee,"" she told BI.

In an era where cultural consciousness plays a pivotal role in shaping consumer perceptions, Black History Month offers a significant platform for brands to demonstrate their commitment to the Black community. However, beyond the ethical and social advantages, there lies a critical question for executives: ""What is the return on investment of Black History Month marketing efforts?""Black marketing should not be confined to just one month. These efforts should be part of an organization's overall multicultural marketing strategy. And as a proud Black marketer, I understand the countless ways brands can authentically celebrate Black culture without alienating Black consumers. Not only is the inclusion of Black consumers in marketing the right thing to do — it's also the most profitable.Related: 3 Authentic Ways Brands Can Celebrate Black History Month



The financial impact of diversity and inclusion initiativesThe Black consumer market, with its projected buying power exceeding $1.8 trillion, stands as a testament to the economic potential of this demographic. This figure not only surpasses the annual GDPs of nations like Mexico and the Netherlands but also highlights why this market cannot be overlooked. For companies, Black History Month offers a strategic window to connect with this community.The crux of effectively engaging with this market, particularly during Black History Month, lies in developing marketing campaigns that authentically resonate with the Black community. According to McKinsey, research shows that ""Black consumers are much more likely to seek out and place emphasis on brands that are trustworthy, have a clear social mission, appeal to their cultural values and generally have credibility among the Black community."" By aligning marketing initiatives with the values and expectations of the Black community, companies can cultivate a loyal customer base, which is instrumental in driving sales and enhancing long-term revenue streams.


Enhancing consumer engagement and loyaltyThe effectiveness of culturally conscious marketing is also evident in consumer engagement and brand loyalty metrics. For example, it's 6 to 7 times more expensive to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing customer. This places a high premium on customer loyalty, particularly within demographics known for their brand allegiance, such as the Black community.A study by Google found that 66% of Black consumers are more likely to return to a brand with advertising that authentically reflects their race/ethnicity. Similarly, a Deloitte study found that 57% of consumers are more loyal to brands that commit to addressing social inequities in their actions. Also, an Adobe survey revealed that 38% of respondents are more inclined to support brands that showcase diversity in their advertising. Additionally, 34% of consumers have boycotted a brand at least once due to a lack of representation in advertisements or actions. These statistics highlight the importance of authentic engagement, especially during culturally significant periods like Black History Month.When brands engage in marketing that genuinely celebrates Black history and culture, it reflects the company's ethical marketing practices and aligns with sound financial principles. Cultivating loyalty within a community known for its strong brand connections translates into repeated business and increased spending — factors that are crucial for sustained financial success. It's also important to note that loyal customers often become brand ambassadors and can organically extend the brand's reach.Related: Unpacking the Black Demographic Shift and Why Marketers Must Re-Examine Their Strategies


Impact on long-term brand equity and reputationInvesting in culturally conscious marketing and demonstrating a genuine commitment to the issues facing the Black community can significantly elevate a company's long-term brand equity and reputation. Research conducted by Sprout Social shows that most consumers (70%) believe it's important for brands to take a public stand on social and political issues. This strategic approach establishes a brand's reputation as a leader in social responsibility. Genuinely supporting issues impacting the communities in which a company serves creates a resilient brand image that is adaptive, socially aware and deeply trusted by consumers.Navigating potential pitfallsSuccessfully navigating the challenges in multicultural marketing, especially during Black History Month, is essential for maintaining brand integrity and earning audience trust. A 2022 study by Insider Intelligence showed significant skepticism among Black internet users in the United States towards the motives behind large corporations' Black History Month promotions. The study revealed that nearly one-third of the users were skeptical about the intentions of social media-run businesses that launch such campaigns, pointing to a crucial need for authenticity in these marketing efforts.Another significant pitfall is cultural appropriation, which can be mitigated by incorporating diversity within the company's structure. Hiring a diverse staff not only provides a range of experiences and perspectives but also contributes to better decision-making and business practices. This approach is supported by a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) study, which found that companies with diverse management teams saw a 19% increase in revenue compared to their less diverse counterparts.To effectively circumvent these potential pitfalls, brands must adopt a proactive and thoughtful strategy. This involves engaging with cultural consultants, forming partnerships with community leaders and fostering ongoing dialogues with the communities they intend to reach. This comprehensive approach ensures that marketing campaigns are not only culturally sensitive and relevant but also authentically resonate with the target audience.

It encompasses improved brand perception, increased consumer loyalty and long-term market positioning. As society increasingly values corporate social responsibility, integrating cultural consciousness into marketing strategies becomes not just an ethical imperative but a business necessity. In celebrating Black History Month, brands can demonstrate their commitment to diversity and inclusion while driving tangible business results.

76,3 Ways to Build a Culture of Radical Honesty (and How It Can Transform Your Business),"Feb 7, 2024",Andrew Schaap,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-build-a-culture-of-radical-honesty-and-why-you/468889,"
What keeps me up at night? Watermelons.As a CEO, my biggest fear is that the digital dashboards capturing my company's vital signs are the business equivalent of that tropical fruit — green and firm on the outside, but red and mushy underneath. At first glance, everything looks solid. Then one morning, I get a call from a client asking, ""What the hell is going on with A, B or C?""This concern isn't fair to my team, who consistently exceed my expectations. But the reality is that for many leaders, such nagging fears can persist. When there's a problem, the last thing you want is for people to give you the impression — intentionally or not — that things are better than they truly are. So, how do you avoid this?



For the past few years, I've led a company in an industry facing astronomical demand. One of the biggest lessons: The agility, operational excellence and innovation required to meet this challenge requires building a culture of radical honesty.Here are three ways that leaders and their teams can embrace radical honesty — and reap the benefits of better decision-making and a true picture of where the business stands.


Related: How to Employ Radical Candor in the Workplace With 5 Simple StepsEncourage your people to admit their weaknesses — and play to their strengthsA simple formula for business success: Do things consistently better than the competition, and those wins will compound over time. The key to pulling it off? Let people focus on their strengths and delegate everything else.That calls for honesty and transparency. ""Fake it till you make it"" doesn't always work in business, where pretending can have disastrous consequences. As a leader, I want people to do the opposite — by asking for help and saying, ""I don't know.""One way to do this is by empowering and trusting team members to be rock stars in their domain. That makes our company better at creating innovative technologies, tackling new markets and responding nimbly to changing conditions.


But at the same time, as I urge people to lean into their strengths, I give them permission to be less adept at other things. For example, if a member of my leadership team is no good at financial underwriting, I tell them to own it like a badge of honor.After all, that's what hiring is for. To make up for their lack of knowledge and expertise in a particular area, we can bring on someone to fill the gap. It's my job as CEO to explain that the goal isn't to undermine or replace them, but to help them focus on what they do best.There's a direct line between that mindset and business results. In one study, companies whose CEOs excelled at delegating grew more than twice as fast as those with a less skilled delegator at the helm.Don't default to the rulebookFor leaders, honesty is nearly always the best policy, even if it means ruffling a few feathers or going against convention.


Sometimes this requires poking holes in well-intentioned ideas that also happen to be intellectually lazy. This came up recently in a chat with my team about how we plan to meet the demand that AI is creating in our industry. While some of the ideas presented were sound, others needed more probing.Take the argument for keeping someone in a management role because they've done the job forever. Many companies default to this way of thinking, but what if they're overlooking a newer hire with a fresh perspective and a natural ability to inspire the team? To me, sticking with option A isn't an intellectually honest approach.As hard as it is, leaders can't escape making these kinds of tough decisions. Without abandoning all loyalty to people, they should consider what's best for the business and make pragmatic rather than emotional choices. Even if those decisions aren't always popular.In a broader sense, being intellectually honest means knowing when adhering to the rulebook is hurting the company, not helping it. For example, I'm a big believer in hiring top talent, telling them where our True North is, and then letting them figure out the best way forward. If somebody needs a course correction, that can be addressed. But expecting the entire team to follow every company rule to the letter? That will only slow us down.


Related: Stop Lying to Your Team — And Yourself. Try Radical Honesty Instead.Give the team a license to speed without getting a ticketLeading with radical honesty also requires getting real with yourself and your team about how willing you are to embrace failure.At our latest companywide offsite, I told people I want them to fail more. For a business, that isn't as risky as it might sound. Companies that are serious about innovation should be willing to try new things and pivot fast if they don't work.Take Airbnb, which didn't begin by building an elaborate home rental website. Instead, the founders tested the waters by renting out their own loft online. Google Glass — released by a company famous for its ""moonshots"" — is a good example of a failed experiment. When its smart glasses didn't catch fire with consumers, Google moved on.


Encouraging creative destruction means removing the fear of failure, a major cause of inaction. Within reason, people should be able to fail out loud without worrying they'll get fired.For me as a leader, there's little risk because I've hired talented people who are laser-focused on executing well. All they really need is a license to speed without getting a ticket.Unfortunately, many business leaders don't see things that way. Despite all the rhetoric around moving fast and breaking things, less than half of companies have a leadership team that regularly tolerates small-scale failures, according to a recent global survey of CEOs.Someone should explain to them that the rewards of letting people fail can be substantial. In a study of 120 tech startups, those committed to learning from failure produced greater scientific output, raised more capital and innovated more.


Of course, businesses must also know when to play it safe. For Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, there's a big difference between ""experimental failure"" (good) and ""operational failure"" (bad). It's the same at my company, where the mission-critical computer and electrical systems that power our facilities don't leave much room for error. But even there we get creative — for example, by finding innovative ways to keep the lights on during a blackout.Related: How to Allow Room for Failure and Create a Successful Work EnvironmentFor leaders and their teams, the biggest benefit of a culture of radical honesty is the elimination of fear: that employees will get into trouble for taking risks, that folks aren't good enough at their jobs or that the company is actually on shaky ground.Ultimately, ensuring that everyone knows where they and the organization stand is a competitive advantage, thanks to a more engaged workforce, a clear view of where the business needs to grow and iterate, and a culture where people feel as emboldened to innovate as they do to ask for help. When it comes to performance, what you see is what you get. So, here's to keeping watermelons where they belong — at the company picnic.

77,Why Hope is the Overlooked Leadership Trait that Makes Organizations Thrive,"Jan 31, 2024",Megan J. Shen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-hope-matters-for-leadership-success/468659,"
A common question among leaders and organizations is, ""What type of leader is the most effective at helping organizations thrive?"" Often, the focus is on clear leadership traits, such as emotional resilience, courage and patience. These traits are critical to the success of a leader, but there is one overlooked trait that can help propel good leaders to becoming great leaders. A trait that can help organizations thrive, especially in the current climate of rapid change and uncertainty, is hope.One of the best and clearest definitions of hope, from the Cambridge dictionary, is ""to want something to happen or to be true, and usually have a good reason to think that it might.""That second part, having good reason to believe that something good can happen, is what sets hopeful leaders apart from optimistic ones. It's obvious that pessimist leaders are demotivating to the individuals they lead because they focus on challenges, not solutions. What is less obvious, however, is that optimists are also ineffective leaders. Optimists focus on the positive but tend to overlook or de-emphasize the reality of the challenges they and their teams face. Surprisingly, like pessimists, optimists fail to focus on solutions because they believe everything will work out without focusing on how they will make that happen.



Related: Great Business Leaders Have These 8 TraitsHopeful leaders, as this definition implies, acknowledge the challenges they face and those they lead, but they are motivated and hopeful that they can collaboratively find a solution. Leading with hope allows leaders, and thus their teams, to imagine a better future. This positive but realistic outlook creates energy that can push the team towards finding solutions to their problems and reimagining how work can be done more efficiently, effectively, and enjoyably.


Scientific research backs the claim that hope is a valuable leadership trait. Research by Arizona State University scholars notes that hope merely reflects ""wishful thinking."" Rather, it is a positive psychological trait that contains both willpower (or agency) and way-power (or finding pathways to success). Their research demonstrates that high-hope leaders, compared to low-hope, had more profitable work units and better satisfaction and retention rates among their subordinates.Individuals with high levels of hope have more goal-oriented strategies than those with low levels of hope. They are also more motivated to achieve those goals. Across multiple job levels and industries, employees with high levels of hope had higher levels of job performance, even after controlling for their self-efficacy and cognitive abilities. Another research study found that management executives with high hopes produced solutions to work-related problems that were both of better quality and more frequent.Related: Ignore the Cynics, Hope Is Your Greatest AssetEmployee retention and satisfaction are among companies' biggest and most expensive challenges today. A recent Harvard Business Review article noted that employee retention is expected to be 50-75% higher than companies have experienced previously, and it now takes 18% longer to fill those vacant roles than it did pre-pandemic. Gartner, a company focused on supporting executives, found that 65% of employees say the pandemic has made them rethink the place work should take in their lives.


Whereas an optimistic leader might think: ""We can keep hiring, and it will work itself out!"" in response to retention issues, the hopeful leader can reimagine how to motivate and retain employees. They can fully remodel the house rather than keep repairing the leaks. This ability is precisely because they can imagine an entirely different and better future and then set goals and implement strategies to get there. Their talents extend beyond employee retention and apply to the rapidly changing business market we find ourselves in due to rising inflation, unpredictable customer preferences, and AI/digital disruption.Related: What Makes a Great Leader?So, how do you become a more hopeful leader? Here are six quick tips:Name the problem or obstacle. As a hopeful leader, you must first acknowledge a problem to be fixed or an obstacle to overcome.Create a viewpoint of possibility or hope. Next, you must bring a spirit of ""possibility"" that you and your team can figure the problem out. The key to ensuring this viewpoint is hopeful, and not just optimistic, is to clearly articulate that you may need to iterate to find solutions and state why the solution is likely to work. It's essential that those being led feel confident that a solution is indeed possible.Set clear goals and action items to execute that vision. After making it clear, a solution can be found, and clear goals and action items on how that problem will be addressed or that obstacle will be overcome can be set. Making these SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound) is best.Implement those goals/action items. Next, you must implement the solutions. Make it clear that this is the first attempt or iteration on the path to success, of which there may need to be many.Keep trying until the problem is solved or improved (make multiple iterations). If the first set of goals doesn't work, it's important to call it quits when needed and then move on to the next solution. A hopeful leader is very good at taking alternate paths when the way forward isn't working and clarifying that there is still a way forward, even if it requires a bit of trying.Celebrate successes. Of course, you should celebrate achieving the larger goal, overcoming the significant barrier or obstacle, and finding the ultimate solution. But also celebrate the small successes along the way to keep the team motivated to keep iterating to find solutions.Remember the power of being a hopeful leader and moving forward with a clear vision that you can make your team's and company's future better and have some ideas on how to do it.

78,There Is No Place for a Cult Mentality in Startups — Here's How to Detect and Avoid This Type of Workplace,"Jan 30, 2024",Collin Williams,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-detect-and-avoid-cult-like-workplaces-and-why-you/468052,"
There is a doggedly negative stigma attached to cults, but, for years, many startups have fostered strikingly similar cultures and narratives. The parallels are frightening when explored. Look at the following definitions of the term ""cult:""""[G]reat devotion to a person, idea, object, movement, or work"" - Merriam Webster's Dictionary ""[A] system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object…a misplaced or excessive admiration for a particular person or thing."" - Oxford Dictionary



""[A] situation in which people admire and care about something or someone very much or too much."" - The Britannica DictionaryRelated: How Entrepreneurs Can Avoid a Toxic Work Culture


Are startups really similar to cults?Startup culture is based on the notion of disruption, risk-taking and, often, an unfettered admiration and belief in the founder(s). I lived this culture at my first startup job and found it both fascinating and terrifying. I'll give you examples:We had a weekly company-wide meeting where the founders would get on stage and whip the entire workforce into a frenzy replete with cheering and chanting. Very rarely was there a cogent message or strategy involved. Instead, these times were often used simply to disparage competitors and to foster some maladjusted team attitude;I commonly heard employees repeatedly refer to the primary founder as a ""genius"" and ""the smartest person I've ever met"" even though he was a college dropout who had never done anything in his professional career beyond running this particular startup;I spoke to the Head of Engineering who told me he heard an employee say ""If this doesn't become a one-hundred-billion dollar company, I'll kill myself."" How many one hundred billion dollar companies are there in the world? Maybe 100 in the United States and, possibly, 100 more in the rest of the world. The chance of becoming a one-hundred-billion-dollar company is infinitesimal. This statement made even less sense when considered against the Total Addressable Market for the business.Despite the apparent lunacy of some of these actions and statements, I can say there was unequivocal belief in the founders that unquestionably qualified as a ""great devotion to person(s) and work,"" that there was ""misplaced or excessive admiration"" for particular people, and that employees ""admired or cared about something or someone too much.""Yes, shockingly, startups can bear a striking resemblance to cultsWe live in a world where the startup mentality has become cultish. There are examples beyond my former employer. The cultures at WeWork and Theranos were legendary in their strangeness and likely led, in part, to their eventual downfalls. But even successful startups are not immune to this cultish behavior. For example, Uber became well known for its misogynistic and discriminatory practices, but when Travis Kalanick held an all-hands meeting saying that he would help the company change, even after colloquially calling the company ""Boob-er"" in 2014, many of the employees' concerns were assuaged.Like any other business, startups are, first and foremost, a job. They are not a lifestyle or mindset. While every company should foster a culture they believe in, whether that is through actions, mission statements or core beliefs, etc., you should never lose sight of what a job is, which is a medium for paying bills and sustaining yourself.Related: 7 Reasons Why Creating the Right Culture Should Be a Leaders Top Priority


What should you do if you feel like you're at a company with this mentality?Whether you are in management or an individual contributor, here are some actionable steps you can take to prevent yourself from getting in too deep:Always watch out for businesses where questions aren't asked and opinions encouraged. When you are involved in an oligarchy, there is a good chance there is a reason the founders don't want outside input.Watch how your fellow employees act towards the founders. Is there respect and admiration? Or is there adulation and unfettered loyalty? Respect and admiration are often warranted. Adulation and unfettered loyalty lead down a path where there is limited or no accountability.Do company meetings have substance? Or do they seem more like pep rallies? This isn't to say that company spirit is a bad thing, but it shouldn't be the only thing. In my opinion, transparency is paramount in startups. Employees need to know what is going on financially and culturally because it may impact how they perform their jobs. If you have no insight into what is substantively going on at the company, and that is masked with rah-rah fests, something is wrong.Finally, and this is hands down the most important one, trust your gut. If something seems off, it probably is. I remember the interview process at my first startup and this overwhelming feeling that something was wrong. I didn't listen and took the job. I ended up quitting less than a year later and testified as a government witness against the founders (not a joke). Throughout my employment, my gut was telling me something was very wrong. I should've listened initially.It's not all doom and gloomThat is not to say that you can't enjoy your job, even love it. In a perfect world, that would be the outcome. But enjoyment and/or love should never prevent you from questioning business strategies, raising concerns when something seems wrong and seeking to enforce policies that prevent discrimination or harassment.Loyalty to founders, executives and your company is laudable. An unwavering belief in their infallibility and blind dedication is lunacy. Startup founders are humans, like anyone else. They have emotions. They make mistakes. They are flawed and imperfect. Don't convince yourself otherwise. And that includes me as a startup founder. I've got more faults than I can count.Startups are fun, exciting, disruptive places to work. But they are places to work. They aren't religions. If you join a startup and see this kind of culture, run. Despite how the company may portray it as a simple culture, it's not normal. Find a startup where questions are asked, opinions are valued and no one asks you to wear ceremonial robes to team meetings.

79,3 Strategies This Vietnamese Noodle Shop Has Used to Thrive in Minnesota,"Jan 30, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-customer-service-is-creating-loyal-customers-at-this/468995,"
In Twin Cities, Minnesota, Justin Bui and his family serve up authentic Vietnamese cuisine at MT Noodles. A favorite amongst locals, this noodle shop is known for high-quality ingredients, incredible customer service, and a core mission of integrating heritage and family into everything it does.MT Noodles all started with recipes created by Justin's mom. ""My mom's the backbone of it all. It's her recipes. She's been in the restaurant industry for over 20 plus years. It's her life, and it was just another way to express herself — through food. For us, it's being able to share Vietnamese cuisine with the community,"" he says. ""We focus on really bringing those authentic dishes from her homeland to your table so that anyone can try it.""Related: Inside the Spa Where Calming Treatments Are Served Up With Craft Beer



Justin and his team prioritize using high-quality ingredients and harbor a genuine desire to share Vietnamese culture with customers. Staff routinely talk with guests to make sure they find exactly the right dish, especially if they've never had Vietnamese food before.""To see someone who's never seen it before be willing to try, it's really exciting. You get to try something that is truly authentic and something you might not be able to get anywhere else,"" Justin says. ""We want to help you navigate how to eat it. We try to tell all of our servers, 'Answer questions, educate customers,' because nowadays we get a lot of newer customers who maybe don't have a background in Vietnamese culture. And for us, as Vietnamese staff, how do we educate others to understand what this cuisine is about? No judgments at all. We're here to just help you navigate through it.""

Pho is really popular and bahn mi's are really popular. But I think there's quite a few people who probably can't name another Vietnamese dish… There's a whole lot of flavor out there that we miss with the traditional American palette. But it's so different when it's family-run, and this lady comes out there and tells me how much this dish meant to her family and her life growing up, and really opened my eyes to what her childhood was like. That's something you don't get from anything but a family-owned restaurant,"" Robby said.Yet success at MT Noodles extends beyond the team's willingness to share their cuisine and heritage with customers. They're also incredibly united in all of their wins as well as their mistakes, something that has proven to be a key motivator as they expand their business and continue to grow.


""We're really out there on our feet a lot, constantly moving. Mistakes are going to happen. It's really about always making sure we think of a solution. We'll talk to the customer, but let's see what we can do better then,"" Just said. "" Customers have different preferences, and you got to make sure you don't take it too personally. We've been really blessed with having a great staff that's able to communicate with all of our customers and really understand our priorities. I think as a business owner, you really want to immediately set the boundaries and the priorities for both sides, front and back of the house.""Related: Inside the Resort Where Customer Service Reigns SupremeThe team's collaborative dynamic and willingness to share the meaning behind their dishes is ultimately what keeps customers coming back.To bring customers into the family, the team continues to engage with customers even after their visits by responding to Yelp reviews.

""They replied directly to my Yelp post, which is really nice, and they wished me a happy belated birthday, which was just so sweet. They really made me feel good for going there, and it really helped knowing that they appreciated my review and that it meant something to them. It just feels nice as a reviewer when you know that restaurants look through the feedback and they actively go through it,"" Robby said.In addition to its high-quality ingredients and authentic menu items, MT Noodles maintains its reputation as a local favorite by:Putting core values at the forefront of service. As a small business owner, keeping your core values in mind is noticeable to customers and makes them feel like they're getting a truly authentic experience.Being honest with customers and building trust. Invite customers in and give them a behind-the-scenes look at your process to make their experience memorable, rather than just trying to sell the product.Sharing wins and challenges among staff. Through good times and bad, your team will feel more united in the goal of bringing top-notch service to customers when they share their triumphs and failures.

80,Why You Shouldn't Wait Have the Hard Conversations With Your Employees,"Jan 29, 2024",Daniel Todd,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-you-need-to-have-hard-conversations-sooner-than-later/467303,"
A problem deferred is not a problem solved. Just take my recent experience with cold plunges every day. The anticipation of the chilling water doesn't fade, but I have learned that hesitating is the least helpful thing to do because within a minute of getting in, my body starts adjusting to the temperature and I'm glad I took the plunge. I have experienced a similar hesitation many times when considering having an uncomfortable performance conversation with an employee. But the sooner I address the issue, the better the outcomes for the individual, myself and our company.It's easy to imagine other managers struggling with the same hesitation. Without proactive and clear communication, minor issues typically escalate, becoming more complex and challenging. From my experience, initiating tough conversations early gives people more time to address issues before emotions intensify. Much like my cold plunges, jumping in without delay becomes less daunting over time because seeing the positive results motivates us to confront problems early and head-on.Related: 5 Strategies to Ace the Difficult Conversations in Your Business



The mistakes leaders can makeFriendly and team-oriented managers often feel uncomfortable discussing performance issues with employees, and I was no different. Having done it wrong enough times now, I recognize how I used to justify avoidance. I would tell myself: ""Well, they may be missing some expectations, but they're not that far away."" I would convince myself that people would feel micromanaged if I talked to them too soon. In reality, that was an excuse for not doing my job, which is to help people get better through positive, constructive feedback.The approach I take today is akin to a football coach. I take personal responsibility for the people I hire, so I remind myself that, above all, I want this person to succeed. I use that feeling to force myself to step up and initiate tough conversations. I care about my employees, so giving them feedback early and often will help them get back on track faster and make them more successful.


Reframing these difficult conversations in this way has helped me tremendously, but I also had to learn how to have them in the most constructive manner so employees feel good or at least at ease about having them, too.The art of diplomacyEverybody has different thresholds for what they consider to be good or bad news. I have found that it's more common for people to almost overreact to even minor critiques, but others will not fix things unless the feedback is explicitly clear that it will impact long-term employment. It is up to the manager to understand the person's personality and think how best to deliver potentially difficult feedback — whether that means having a light touch or holding a very serious your-job-is-on-the-line conversation.To avoid creating anxiety, it is best not to make tough conversations a big, formal event. Frame the conversation positively, so as not to dismiss what the employee is doing right. I might say, ""Hey, you've been doing an awesome job. I noticed you're just missing the mark in this one area. I want to bring it up now to make sure you're informed. Let's check in on it over the next few weeks so we can stay headed in the right direction.""It is best to raise issues face-to-face since it's easy for people to misinterpret the tone of emails. At times, I have successfully laid the groundwork for constructive conversations via email, but it worked because I then spent time building them back up face-to-face. No matter where managers choose to talk to employees, the X-factor always circles back to the relationships they have built because people need to have enough trust to believe what a leader is actually telling them.


Related: These Are the 10 Most Difficult Conversations to Have in the Workplace — And How to Handle ThemWhen employees won't changeIf somebody really wants to apply themselves, they can typically get back on track when they start early. Oftentimes, all it takes is giving them proper guidance and support. People must believe their leader wants them to succeed, and that largely comes down to the manager's mental prep leading up to the conversation.Over the last two years, I have probably had to talk to four or five people, and most of them are still with our company today. When I'm not sure about an employee's commitment to improvement, I have adopted a strategy inspired by Zappos: I offer them an option to take six weeks' severance and leave straight away if they are not up for the challenge. But here's the catch — if they stay, fail to improve and then I have to let them go, they will receive only two weeks' severance.This approach has proven incredibly effective. Those who decide to stay after being presented with this choice really push their limits and improve their performance.


Taking the plunge earlyWhen someone on the team isn't pulling their weight, it affects everyone. That's why leaders have to act fast. But here's the catch: If you rush into firing them, it is a morale killer. Wait too long? Same deal. So, I have figured the best move is to heed the warning signs and heed the warning signs and tackle these issues early and head-on — like ripping off a band-aid or jumping into cold water.To make all of this easier, I make sure my team knows I am all about their success. This way, they are more open to tough feedback and it builds their grit. The bottom line is dealing with performance issues early on makes us better leaders. It may not be easy starting those hard chats, but the sooner leaders do, the sooner it becomes second nature — no hesitation, just step right in.Related: 3 Reasons You Should Have Difficult Conversations Now

While the fundamentals of the practice remain relevant, the way the job is performed now teeters more on a balance of tech-powered and human-driven approaches.Related: 5 Innovative PR Strategies to Boost Your Brand in 20241. AI and predictive analysis: The new PR playbookInfusing artificial intelligence and predictive analytics into public relations is more than a trend; it's a revolution. Modern PR agencies leverage these technologies to foresee media trends, identify storylines and pinpoint the most effective reporters and outlets. This tech-driven approach ensures that the content reaches the right audience and engages them effectively, resulting in a consistent flow of impactful media placements.

2. Depth of engagement over audience breadthGone are the days when the success of a PR campaign was measured solely by the size of the audience reached. Today, the quality of attention matters more. Engaging with niche markets, local news, and specialized channels like podcasts and newsletters has proven more effective. Focusing on the depth of engagement, this approach fosters stronger connections and more meaningful conversations with the audience. It reflects a shift towards building trust, awareness, credibility, and authority -- which are the foundational and fundamental building blocks of public relations.This depth-first approach involves creating content that resonates personally, sparking not just views but also conversations, shares, and a strong community presence. PR agencies are increasingly prioritizing metrics like time spent on content, the quality of discourse in comments, and the emotional resonance of the message. By doing so, they can foster a loyal audience base more likely to advocate for and stay engaged with the brand. This methodical focus on nurturing a dedicated following is especially crucial in an era where consumers value authenticity and personalization more than ever.Related: Artificial Intelligence is Revolutionizing Marketing. Here's What the Transformation Means for the Industry3. Strategic communications in tech PRThe tech industry presents unique challenges and opportunities in PR, especially in sub-verticals like cybersecurity, cloud and SaaS. Agencies specializing in tech PR excel in navigating these complex landscapes. Their strategic communications are tailored to resonate within the dynamic tech markets, often involving securing prestigious awards and coveted speaking engagements that amplify visibility and establish authority.


This involves a meticulous understanding of both the technological aspects and the market dynamics. By harnessing data analytics, market insights, and consumer behavior patterns, PR professionals are crafting campaigns that inform, educate, and engage diverse stakeholders. This approach is integral in demystifying complex tech concepts for the general public and positioning tech companies as thought leaders and innovators. Whether it's launching a new product, managing a crisis, or shaping brand perception, the strategic communication efforts in the tech sector are increasingly about creating a narrative that aligns with both business objectives and user expectations, fostering a powerful brand resonance in an ever-evolving digital landscape.4. Efficiency and productivity: Beyond billable hoursThe traditional model of billing by the hour is being challenged. Modern PR agencies focus more on productivity and results than just the number of hours worked. This trend is about doing more with less — leveraging technology and efficient strategies to deliver results without unnecessary overhead. It's a win-win for both agencies and clients, leading to more productive engagements and more impactful outcomes.These trends signify a transformative period in the world of public relations. Agencies that embrace these changes — employing advanced technology, focusing on meaningful engagement, specializing in strategic communications, and prioritizing efficiency — are leading the way in this new era. This comprehensive approach and deep expertise across various sectors exemplify this modern PR agency, one that is not just keeping up with the times but actively shaping the industry's future.

82,How to Navigate the Pitfalls of Toxic Positivity in the Workplace,"Jan 26, 2024",Satyen Raja,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-avoid-the-pitfalls-of-toxic-positivity-in-the/468481,"
In the modern workplace, the concept of ""toxic positivity"" has become a subject of increasing concern. This term, trendy yet often misunderstood, refers to an overemphasis on positive outcomes and attitudes, to the extent that it becomes detrimental. It's a phenomenon akin to the character Stuart Smalley from ""Saturday Night Live,"" who symbolizes the new age optimist, constantly affirming positivity, regardless of the underlying truth.We all know someone like this whose overwhelming positivity slowly withers the soul from within. While seemingly harmless, such behavior can mask deeper insecurities and disconnect us from our authentic selves.Eastern philosophies and warrior sage traditions teach us about the delicate balance between positive and negative forces. They assert that an environment — be it a world, company or organization — can never be wholly positive or negative. This natural balance is dynamic, ever-shifting and essential for genuine human interaction and growth. Recognizing this balance is crucial in avoiding the extremes of both toxic negativity and toxic positivity.



Related: How to Avoid Toxic PositivityToxic positivity: A workplace dilemmaIn the corporate world, toxic positivity often manifests as a facade of relentless optimism. This facade is characterized by superficial interactions where authentic feelings are suppressed in favor of a constantly upbeat demeanor. This creates a workplace culture where genuine communication is replaced by shallow exchanges and real issues are glossed over.


The illusion of constant positivity:The illusion of constant positivity in the workplace can lead to significant problems. It creates an environment where employees feel pressured to mask their true feelings, leading to a lack of genuine human connection and understanding. This pressure to maintain a positive front at all times can result in repressing negative but necessary emotions, culminating in unexpected emotional outbursts.The power of authenticity:The solution to toxic positivity is not a swing to relentless negativity but a balanced approach that values authenticity. Authenticity, being true to oneself and others, resonates more deeply than forced positivity. It fosters an environment of trust, respect and genuine connection. In an authentic culture, people are encouraged to express their true feelings, experiences and perspectives, leading to more meaningful and constructive interactions.


Related: What Is 'Toxic Positivity' and Why Is It Bad for the Workplace?Shifting from positivity to authenticityThe shift from a culture of toxic positivity to one of authenticity requires a conscious effort from organizational leaders. It involves acknowledging and embracing the full spectrum of human emotions, not just the positive ones. Leaders must create a space where employees feel safe to express their genuine feelings, whether they are positive or negative.To cultivate an authentic workplace culture, leaders must first recognize the signs of toxic positivity. These signs include a lack of genuine communication, a culture of forced niceness and an avoidance of addressing real issues. Once identified, leaders can implement strategies that foster authenticity, such as encouraging open and honest communication, creating forums for sharing diverse perspectives and recognizing and addressing the challenges employees face.Training for authentic leadership:


Leadership development, in its essence, is about equipping leaders with the tools necessary to build a culture of authenticity within their organizations. Such training focuses on nurturing leadership skills that are pivotal in facilitating honest and empathetic communication, creating a supportive team environment and encouraging team members to embrace and express their true selves.This approach to leadership development emphasizes the importance of understanding and empathy in fostering a genuine connection within the team, which in turn cultivates a more dynamic and authentic workplace culture.The role of empathy and understanding:A critical aspect of cultivating an authentic culture is empathy. Leaders must strive to understand the experiences and perspectives of their team members. This understanding helps in creating a supportive environment where employees feel valued and heard. Empathetic leadership fosters a sense of belonging and can significantly enhance team dynamics and productivity.


Embracing the full spectrum of human experience:To build a healthy, authentic workplace culture, it's essential to embrace the full spectrum of human experiences. This means celebrating successes and joys, as well as being open to hearing and understanding the challenges and struggles. It involves shifting focus from external roles, often associated with a facade of positivity, to a more profound connection with our authentic selves. When we operate from a place of authenticity, the dichotomy of toxic positivity and negativity naturally dissolves.Related: How to Create a Thriving Workplace by Leading With AuthenticityFostering authenticity for a healthier workplaceThe challenge in contemporary workplaces is to move beyond the superficial layer of forced positivity to foster a culture of authenticity and truth. By understanding and addressing the nuances of toxic positivity, organizations can create a more balanced, empathetic and effective work environment. This shift is not just about avoiding the pitfalls of excessive optimism but about embracing the complexity and richness of human experiences in their entirety.


A workplace grounded in authenticity is one where every individual feels valued, heard and understood. It is an environment where the full range of human emotions is acknowledged and respected, fostering genuine connections and a sense of community. In such a setting, employees are not just workers but human beings with a diverse array of experiences and perspectives.Ultimately, the goal is to create a workplace culture that values honesty, integrity and authenticity above all else. This culture should be one where leaders are open to receiving and understanding their team members in all aspects of their lives — personal and professional. By prioritizing authenticity over superficial positivity, organizations can cultivate a truly healthy, dynamic and thriving workplace.

83,AI Is Changing the Way We Look at Job Skills — Here's What You Need to Do to Prepare.,"Jan 26, 2024",Ryan Wong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/ai-is-changing-how-we-look-at-jobs-heres-how-to-prepare/467380,"
Talk about an HR nightmare: Today, 1.7 million people work in the U.S. auto industry, and 99% of cars sold or on the road are gas-powered. But that's all about to change … and nearly overnight. By 2030, plans call for half of new car sales to be electric — making millions of roles redundant and creating the need for millions more.Welcome to the brave new labor market. As technology advances at an ever-faster clip, seemingly no job is safe. Generative AI has only quickened the pace, leaving organizations scrambling. Some workplace roles are becoming obsolete in the course of months, not years, while new ones are constantly emerging.For companies, keeping up with these changes calls for a dramatic shift in mindset: Goodbye jobs, hello skills.



Businesses have traditionally managed talent by fixating on rigid job descriptions. But hiring and firing based on ever-changing roles is proving increasingly problematic. So progressive employers are taking a skills-based approach instead — reconceiving employees as a bundle of malleable skills rather than a fixed role.That assembly line worker may specialize in building gas engines, for instance. Under the hood, however, they likely have a basket of hundreds or even thousands of skills that may be just as applicable in the EV setting.


Skills are more granular and harder to track — but for today's employers and workers, they're far more useful than roles that may not exist tomorrow. When German industrial giant Henkel set out to upskill its workforce, for instance, it uncovered a repertoire of 52,000 skills, many of which were highly relevant in an increasingly digital economy.The challenges (and rewards) of taking a skills-based approach to talent cross nearly all sectors. Unfortunately, many organizations are flying blind when it comes to what skills they're missing, how certain skills drive business results and what reskilling and upskilling programs they need.As co-founder of an HR tech firm that helps organizations use people data to look at their business through a skills lens, I've seen what powerful results it can deliver for companies and their workers. Here are three key steps to move from roles to skills.Related: Tap Into These 4 Hiring Trends to Achieve Your Goals


Step 1: Understand the skills you already haveWhen a company says it's in ""hiring mode,"" I immediately get suspicious. Boosting headcount might sound like a logical move — but often, it's putting jobs before skills. A smarter approach: Start with the business problem and ask, Can our existing talent base solve it?Unilever went that route by launching an internal talent marketplace that lets workers bring their skills wherever they're needed. The company unlocked 700,000 hours to devote to some 3,000 projects, shrinking its need for new hires. Oh, and productivity climbed more than 40%.Using people analytics, organizations can take a systematic approach to understanding their talent base. Create a comprehensive catalog of skills. Match them against roles to identify gaps. The payoff: informed choices about whether to reskill, reassign or hire people. Even better, the skills gleaned become the centerpiece of internal and external job postings.Companies might be able to spot skills gaps at a high level, but their grasp of details is often fuzzy at best. In one survey, almost 90% of organizations recognized they had a skills gap problem or expected one within five years. But a clear picture of current skills or what roles likely faced disruption? On that front, more than half of companies were in the dark.


Step 2: Understand the skills you'll need tomorrowJust as important as understanding what skills you have is understanding what skills will be needed in the years ahead. Without an intentional approach here, it's easy to get caught off guard — even in forward-looking sectors.For instance, more than 250,000 U.S. technology workers were let go in 2023 — a 50% surge over the previous year. Along with countless startups, even giants like Amazon, Google and Meta are feeling the pain. Could they have avoided such a purge?Yes, by leaning on the emerging field of skills-based workforce planning. By turning to experts who classify what skills are waxing and waning in particular industries, companies can plan ahead to have the right number of people for the right tasks.A growing number of skills-based platforms use predictive models to peer into the future — anticipating, for instance, that demand for AI collaboration skills will climb in years ahead, while demand for traditional coding skills will drop. It's far from an exact science. But skills vendors can make educated guesses about how technology and other factors will change how people work. That foresight is increasingly important as AI lays waste to entire job categories.


Related: Why You Should Hire for Potential, Not ExperienceStep 3: Reskill and upskill employees to get thereTo get the most out of a skills-based approach, it's critical to embrace reskilling and upskilling rather than simply firing and hiring. Take PepsiCo, which in 2022 launched an academy that offers its 300,000 workers free training in digital skills. More than 11,000 employees signed on during the first year, earning certifications such as data scientist and site reliability engineer.Walmart recently launched a partnership with an online education provider that will offer its 1.5 million U.S. employees free courses in data analytics, software development and data-driven strategic thinking. Through its $2.1 billion Upskilling 2025 programs, Amazon is giving 300,000 workers access to education and skills training.Similar reskilling and upskilling efforts are popping up at businesses large and small. That's driving a boom in learning and development platforms, which make it easy for companies to create programs that suit their needs.


Employees want those programs. When my company surveyed workers, almost 60% said they rely on employer-led skills development for career growth. Nearly 9 in 10 employees said their employer should play some role in reskilling so they aren't easily replaced by AI.What's the ROI from putting skills front and center?The benefits of taking a skills-based approach to developing talent aren't hard to see. When Deloitte surveyed businesses about human capital trends, almost 95% said moving away from a focus on jobs is a key success factor for them.Besides doing a better job of matching people with what needs to be done, skills-based companies are more efficient and competitive. Nimble enough to adapt to change, they can evolve instead of stagnating in the old, roles-based way of doing things.Related: Why Skills Shouldn't Be Just a P.S. on a Resume


Want proof? Skills-based organizations are more than twice as likely to place talent effectively, 57% more likely to anticipate and respond effectively to change, and 52% more likely to innovate. Among the other rewards: a bigger and more diverse hiring pool, better candidates, lower recruiting costs and greater employee loyalty and retention.Will traditional job roles disappear as employees increasingly become skills repositories? I don't see that happening anytime soon. After all, roles are an easy and useful shorthand for describing what people do. But with help from people analytics, forward-looking companies will learn to see roles as a far more fluid collection of competencies — underpinned by skills that can be adapted to a changing job climate.

Gamified goal-setting: Crafting epic quests from everyday targetsElevate routine objectives into an enthralling series of quests. Transform each project milestone into an engaging level, each with its own set of challenges and rewards. Incorporate leaderboards to spark a friendly competitive spirit and badges for achievements to visually represent progress.


This gamification of work cultivates an environment where daily tasks become part of a grand adventure, significantly boosting engagement and fostering a strong sense of team unity.2. Reverse mentorship programs: Bridging generational wisdomLaunch a reverse mentorship initiative, a platform where junior employees impart fresh insights to senior team members. This exchange not only empowers the newer, younger staff but also provides executives with a fresh lens through which to view their strategies and operations. Such a program nurtures an ecosystem of continuous learning and paves the way for mutual respect across hierarchical boundaries.3. Virtual co-working spaces: Merging work with a rhythmic beatImagine a virtual workspace that replicates the buzz of a vibrant café, underscored by live DJ sets. This digital co-working hub becomes the heart of spontaneous interactions and creative exchanges, breaking the monotony of the conventional workday. The curated playlists not only enliven the atmosphere but also provide a shared sensory experience that can bond the team, despite physical distances.4. Weekly ""Wildcard Workdays:"" Igniting creative sparksIntroduce ""Wildcard Workdays,"" a unique concept where employees dedicate one day each week to explore projects outside their regular scope. This could range from developing a new business strategy to leading a community service initiative. This break from routine encourages out-of-the-box thinking, nurtures innovation and keeps the workweek varied and intriguing.

It's an exercise in building a resilient and forward-thinking culture, where growth is valued over perfection.6. Global cultural exchange initiatives: Embracing worldly perspectivesEach month, focus on a different culture or country represented within your team. Host engaging virtual events where team members from these backgrounds share their unique heritage and stories and perhaps teach a traditional recipe or craft. This initiative enriches the team's cultural understanding, fosters global inclusivity and adds a rich layer of diversity to your organization.7. ""Out-of-box"" office hours: Tailoring work to lifestylesRevolutionize the concept of office hours. Encourage team members to schedule their work hours at times that align with their personal productivity peaks or lifestyle needs, like late-night brainstorming sessions or early-morning thought-exchange walks. This flexibility acknowledges and respects individual work-life rhythms, leading to a more satisfied and efficient team.


8. Personalized wellness retreats: Nurturing mind and bodyOffer a range of tailored virtual wellness retreats designed to cater to the diverse interests of your team. Whether it's a guided meditation session, a challenging fitness program or a creative writing workshop, these retreats focus on nurturing the team's mental and physical health, showing a deep, holistic investment in their well-being.9. Micro-grants for passion projects: Investing in dreamsEstablish a micro-grant program where employees can apply for funding to support personal passion projects. This initiative demonstrates a profound commitment to the individual dreams and hobbies of your team members, reinforcing the idea that their personal growth and interests are valued beyond their professional contributions.Related: Connected for Success: 4 Crucial Values of an Interconnected Organizational Culture10.

85,Avoid These 3 Key Mistakes for Team Success in 2024,"Jan 25, 2024",Tom Medema,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-key-mistakes-that-hurt-team-collaboration/468462,"
As the CEO of Bubbles, which is dedicated to enhancing collaborative efficiency throughout the myriad of modern workplaces, I know I face an uphill battle, but I recognize the challenges ahead. This is the rationale behind encouraging every member of a team to approach this challenge with clarity and the necessary knowledge and equipment to unlock their team's potential and begin to drive even better workplace results.Part of this process is centered around dodging common yet overlooked mistakes. Identifying such mistakes can often seem glaringly obvious to someone like me, as it is essentially an inherent focus. Still, I recognize that this is a unique perspective, and therefore, I want to embark on this journey of empowerment for other professionals.To begin, I want to highlight a fact uncovered within a recent Salesforce study that indicated that 86% of employees and executives identified ineffective collaboration and communication as a leading cause of business failure. This is a scarily high figure, but it proves the critical importance of soft skills within businesses. Possessing certain business-specific technical skills is one thing within a team environment, but without the aforementioned non-technical skills, team environments can often become stifling, and the likelihood of success diminishes.



The notion of soft skills being eroded in the current, highly digital age is something that I have previously explored and covered extensively. Still, as well as thinking that this is not a fully accurate hypothesis, I also believe that we can begin to set ourselves up better to thrive. By originally recognizing the importance and then focusing on eradicating everyday barriers and mistakes, we arrive at a possibility to improve, and this is what I want to establish here, with this leading me to the first mistake to sidestep.1. Underestimating the power of clear communicationThe previous paragraph has already emphasized how great communication is any team's lifeblood, so I will just reiterate briefly. Moving into 2024, where we see remote work and digital tools at the forefront, we must adapt more carefully than ever.


Being able to balance efficiency with the retention of critical soft skills is something that I believe will enhance workplaces as we move forward, but it is a tall order. This is why we must prioritize clarity and establish clear communication channels and methods; excessive reliance on digital communication in the instance that a team has not achieved the former goal risks misunderstandings and a decrease in productivity and, subsequently, morale. Excessive reliance on digital communication, when a team is not ready for this, can be dangerous for widespread reasons, leading me to the next mistake to eradicate.Related: Five Shortcuts For Maximizing Efficiency At Work2. Failing to adapt to new technologiesResistance or failure to adapt to and adopt new technology can severely handicap teams. It is clear that rapid developments in technology lead to higher expectations for output from workplace sectors that directly benefit from such advancements.For example, using a tool like Bubbles' AI notetaker to record, transcribe and summarize meetings into actions can streamline team collaboration and communication, ensuring clarity is retained post-meeting. The key point here, however, is that a company or team that fails to adopt technology like this will be stuck carrying out these automated actions themselves, losing time, disrupting timelines and likely increasing confusion throughout the team.


They are likely to witness their efficiency decrease relative to their more adaptable competitors, potentially losing customers. Although fictional, scenarios such as this have led reputable sources to notions such as ""innovate or die"" in relation to businesses evolving technologically. Although generally, this represents a critical mistake, it can also be transformed into a tip.I say so because, looking at Deloitte's global survey of managers and executives, we learn that 90% of respondents and companies agree that digital technologies and trends are disrupting their industries but that only 44% feel adequately prepared for these disruptions. An old school teacher once said they believe in ""good preparation"" over ""good luck,"" and I want to echo this notion here. I believe that by being prepared to face and embrace technological advancements, we can collaborate better and, in turn, shift the mistake of technological negligence into a seamless transition.Related: How High-Yield CEOs Build a Schedule to Maximize Efficiency3. Undervaluing regular feedback and employee well-beingFeedback is one of the most powerful tools for growth, especially collaboratively, and yet remains often underutilized in many workplaces. This would make sense to me if feedback represented an aspect of work that the majority of employees wanted to dodge, but the reality is quite the contrary. A study by PwC revealed that almost 60% of respondents claimed to want regular feedback on a daily or weekly basis. Everybody wants to improve and innovate to avoid the notion above of ""innovate or die"", and well-executed feedback is the key to unlocking improvement.


Make sure not to fall into the mistake of moving with the wind in collaborative efforts, as this can not only stunt growth but can lead to further issues and mistakes, such as groupthink. No one wants to be a member of a stagnant team or feel like they are not growing as a person and employee, and therefore, this links to the criticality of employee well-being. A happy team is a productive team, and being able to reduce workplace stress can positively impact a team's bottom line. Don't be worried if you feel that this is something your team has neglected; the reality is uncovered by The American Psychological Association, which found that 550 million workdays are lost every year due to workplace stress.Overall, don't be alarmed! The key is to recognize these mistakes and dangers now, and focus on eradicating them from your team while you can!

86,5 Practical Strategies for Instilling a Culture of Compliance in Your Team,"Jan 25, 2024",Pritom Das,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-practical-strategies-for-instilling-a-culture-of/467583,"
Organizational compliance is not just about checking boxes. It is an essential foundation for maintaining quality, ethics, safety, and customer trust in your business. However, instilling an authentic compliance mindset across your entire team can be challenging. Complacency, lack of investment and siloed thinking are common pitfalls.As a leader, you play a pivotal role in cultivating an ethical, compliant culture at both the surface and deeper levels. Here are five comprehensive strategies for driving compliance excellence across your organization:1. Ongoing, engaging compliance trainingCompliance training should not begin and end with a generic, once-a-year seminar. To genuinely transform mindsets, training must be regular, tailored and interactive. Break large groups into smaller sessions focused on specific policies, risks and regulations relevant to their roles.



Use real-world examples, scenarios and case studies to make the content relatable. Have learners practice applying concepts through discussions, simulations and decision-making exercises. End each session with a knowledge check or quiz to reinforce key learnings. Follow up with refresher microlearning modules throughout the year to maintain sharp compliance thinking.To maximize engagement, leverage training formats like gamification, social learning and friendly competition. Have subject matter experts co-create and facilitate portions of the training based on their specialized experience. Keep sessions conversational and participatory. Welcome constructive debates, different viewpoints and critical thinking. Maintain an open-door policy for employees to ask follow-up questions after training events. Your goal is to shift mindsets through positive, consistent reinforcement over time, not just imparting information.


Related: The 5-Step Guide to Navigating Legal and Regulatory Changes in Business2. Internal monitoring, controls and auditsOngoing training lays the foundation, while rigorous monitoring and controls convert compliance knowledge into daily habits and behaviors. Establish internal controls like multi-level approvals for high-risk transactions, data access restrictions, surveillance systems and automation triggers to catch issues proactively. Conduct frequent audits and spot checks on operational processes, work products, documentation, communication channels and customer-facing interactions. Randomly sample past transactions to uncover potential problems. Look for patterns of small inconsistencies that could indicate larger risks. Turn audit findings into action by reviewing the results with staff and implementing process enhancements.Move beyond pass/fail audit outcomes. Apply continuous improvement and quality assurance principles to compliance. Establish internal key performance indicators, maturity assessments and self-monitoring mechanisms across teams. Empower employees to identify potential compliance vulnerabilities without fear of blame or retaliation. Apply root cause analysis and change management tactics to understand where and how gaps occurred. Continuously refine controls and processes to minimize future risk.3. Visible prioritization and decision-makingWritten policies are meaningless if compliance is not prioritized in actual decisions and actions. Leaders must visibly and consistently demonstrate that ethics and compliance override competing interests like speed, cost savings and convenience. Model compliance diligence in your own work, decision-making and communications. Verbally reinforce compliance as a core value in team meetings, one-on-one coaching and public forums. Ask probing questions about compliance risks and implications as part of your standard decision-making process. Require thorough documentation of compliance-related decisions and diligence for visibility.


Publicly commend employees who flag potential issues or go above and beyond in exhibiting compliant behavior. Use stories and specific examples to illuminate the detrimental impacts of non-compliance on your customers, brand reputation and bottom line. For instance, a $550,000 settlement was paid out after a non-compliant long-term care facility failed to meet safety standards. Share lessons learned from past compliance failures and risks avoided thanks to diligence. Your visible conviction will cement compliance as an indispensable cultural pillar, not just a policy.4. Open dialogue, mentorship and oversightCompliance should be woven into the daily conversations and mentoring within your teams. Maintain an open-door policy for employees to voice concerns, ask questions, and discuss real-world ethical dilemmas without judgment. Set expectations for email etiquette, record-keeping, information security, conduct with partners and data-driven decision-making.Require ethics and compliance sign-offs for new process designs and high-risk initiatives pre-launch. Embed compliance staff into operational teams to provide ongoing guidance and oversight. Assign buddies or mentors to new hires to set proper compliance expectations from day one.Create mechanisms for confidential reporting of potential issues and transparency into case outcomes. Document all compliance instructions and disciplinary actions taken for consistency. Recognize those who self-report mistakes as an act of integrity. Conduct ""autopsy"" reviews of significant compliance failures to extract learnings for the future. By encouraging open dialogue and providing compliance oversight throughout the organization, you reinforce shared accountability.


Related: Buying a Business? Make Sure It Checks The Boxes On This Checklist Before You Pull The Trigger.5. Meaningful incentives and consequencesTo drive compliant behavior, ethics and compliance must be directly tied to meaningful incentives, rewards and consequences. Recognize individuals and teams that go above and beyond to meet or exceed compliance standards — not just once a year but on an ongoing basis. Highlight role models. Showcase compliance excellence in your organizational communications. On the flip side, consistently enforce proportionate consequences for violations large and small. Doing so shows that compliance is mandatory, not optional.However, discipline should focus on remediation and growth, not just punishment. Use setbacks as teaching moments to improve individual and organizational compliance maturity. Small offenses may merit coaching, training, and probation before harsher action. Major violations often warrant suspension, termination or legal action. But handle each case individually based on intent, risk, response and mitigating circumstances. By tying compliance to incentives and proportional consequences, you reinforce it as a non-negotiable expectation, not just an aspiration.

88,How to Build Team Culture in a Remote-Work World,"Jan 9, 2024",Cyrus Claffey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-build-team-culture-in-a-remote-work-world/467171,"
Many of today's hiring managers and team leads have adapted to the latest trend of today's modern workforce — remote work! And because hiring a remote workforce widens the hiring pool, increases employee retention and results in higher cost savings, working from home is here to stay.However, as remote work remains the norm, managers have to reposition themselves and commit intentionally to building team culture.Compared to leading an in-person team, leading a remote team comes with a different, unique set of priorities and areas of focus. Even many experienced managers need help ensuring their employees have a positive, productive working environment. Here, we'll outline some examples of events and exercises that will ensure that you provide a strong, vibrant team culture in today's remote work world.



Related: The 7 Essential Elements of a Thriving Remote Company CultureThe importance of team cultureEven before offices made a significant shift to remote workforces, many managers struggled with how to foster a positive team culture in an in-person office environment. Those struggles only became more apparent when learning how to build team ethics in a remote workplace.


A positive team culture leads to happier employees. This may result in increased productivity over the long run. Because a positive work environment leads to things like friendships and increased levels of support between coworkers, you're more likely to see lower turnover rates and higher employee retention rates when you emphasize team culture.Positive team cultures also reduce levels of stress and anxiety among employees. With a less stressful environment, your skilled workers are more likely to remain with your company long-term. Additionally, they'll share their positive experiences as an employee. As this word-of-mouth spreads, your positive team culture may eventually result in your business becoming a sought-after place to work.In addition to these hiring and personnel benefits, positive team cultures correlate directly with profitability. You might engage in a chance discussion with a coworker over the water cooler or in the breakroom — leading to opportunities, collaborations and innovations that otherwise might not have happened.Working in a remote environment doesn't mean these benefits go away — it simply gives you the opportunity to create unique virtual spaces for these encounters and opportunities.


Are you excited to build a great team culture but unsure where to start because you lead a remote team? Here are some of the easiest and most successful team-building activities:Host virtual happy hoursHappy hours are easy opportunities for your employees to relax together. For an hour, your team can come together to chat outside of the typical virtual meeting environment.And don't worry — a remote-work happy hour doesn't require alcohol! Alternatively, you can send employees gift cards to order dinner or snacks to recreate the same atmosphere as an in-person happy hour. During the happy hour, you're free to plan all kinds of fun activities, like collaborative online games, or if your team members are up to it, one of them can lead an activity they're passionate about, like baking or a craft.Additionally, you don't have to limit happy hours or other activities to just your team. Feel free to reach out to other managers and set up an inter-team happy hour. The more the merrier!

A virtual team-building event can be an opportunity for employees to flex their problem-solving and creative skills outside of work while still building relationships with their coworkers.


Encourage managers to hold office hoursWhether an employee is new or they've been working at your company for years, they'd likely jump at the opportunity to pick your brain, ask questions and pitch ideas.Create a space for employees to do that by establishing ""office hours"" that any employee can use to pop in for a quick question. It's a more casual commitment than a direct meeting, so more employees will feel comfortable taking advantage of the opportunity, but it provides more structure than a spur-of-the-moment phone call.Related: 5 Ways to Build Team Culture in a Remote WorldPlan regular in-person team meetupsFor some managers and companies, there's no substitute for in-person communication and interaction. For teams that are scattered around the country, that means only one thing — coordinating a team meetup!


You can approach team meetups in a variety of ways. Do you want to have them once per year, per quarter, and on your own schedule? Further, do you want to have your meetup at a central location like your company's headquarters, or do you want to rent out a larger space elsewhere?And once your meetup is already in the works, you have a few more options. You can choose from any number of events to allow teams to bond when they're together, from museum trips to hikes and more.Overall, putting more effort into team building leads to higher productivity, elevates the workplace experience and results in a better return on investment for your company. That doesn't change just because your team works from home!Take the time to nurture your team through remote team building, and you'll see astronomical results.

89,"Here's How Much Money U.S. Employees Will Sacrifice to Avoid Returning to the Office, According to a New Study","Jan 9, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/us-workers-willing-to-take-8-pay-cut-to-work-from-home/468082,"
Nearly four years after the pandemic upended the way we show up for work, many U.S. employees still don't want to return to traditional in-office models.Prospective employees are willing to take an 8% annual pay cut for a job that's partially or fully remote, Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom told USA Today.Related: In-Office Workers Spend (A Lot) More Money Than Remote Employees During the Workday. Here's How Much.That comes to roughly $4,600 a year, as the median U.S. salary for full-time employees is $57,200, per the outlet.But employees who work from home are likely to see even more significant savings.



The average employee can save up to $6,000 if they're working from home 50% of the time in a hybrid position — and up to $12,000 if they're fully remote, according to a study from remote-work site FlexJobs.Some of the biggest savings come in the form of commuting costs, clothing and dining out, per the research.Related: Meet the Typical Remote Worker, Who Makes Good Money, Runs Errands During the Day, and Will Take a Pay Cut to Avoid RTOOn average, a commuter in the U.S. spends $8,466 going to and from their work site in a year, or about 19% of their annual income, according to agent-matching service Clever Real Estate.So perhaps it's not surprising that 90% of Americans don't want to come into the office five days a week, per a Gallup poll — and say that the No. 1 perk that would change their mind (38%) is a company willing to cover 100% of their commuting costs, according to a report from video conferencing company Owl Labs.

According to new research from Future Forum, workplace stress has resulted in an all-time high level of burnout.The World Health Organization defines burnout as an increased mental distance from one's job, feelings of energy depletion, and negativity among 10,243 full-time desk-based workers polled in six countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom.It is the highest level of work burnout since the Future Forum began measuring it in May 2021. Approximately 38% of workers reported burnout at that time.

91,Let Your Employees Be CEOs for a Day to Harness Their Hidden Power,"Jan 8, 2024",Daniel Todd,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/let-your-employees-be-ceos-for-a-day-to-harness-their/466395,"
We will soon be launching what is likely to become a multimillion-dollar-a-month new app. The impetus for the idea came from our user acquisition (UA) and sales team leaders after they had identified the potential for a new opportunity in the market that I, as CEO, could not see. They had an idea to expand our existing app to focus on a growing opportunity but after talking about it, we agreed it could grow faster and larger as a standalone app.This decision exemplifies the power of integrating diverse perspectives within the company to forge a superior strategic direction. It also shows how actively listening to and valuing employee ideas can be a driving force for innovation and growth.Making the most of this opportunity is a two-part process for leaders. Firstly, they have to prove they truly care about people's opinions. Secondly, they need to give employees enough information about how the business actually works from a strategic perspective so they are only bringing forward the best and most actionable ideas. If we do not get the second part right, people will be unhappy because they will feel their suggestions for improvement and growth are constantly being rejected.



Fortunately, we have tools to help them get into that strategic mindset and uncover their unique insights.Related: How Agility and Resiliency Help Small and Medium-Sized Businesses Succeed


Putting on the CEO hatGenerating bigger strategic ideas requires a deep understanding of the company's goals. Currently, everyone in our company is familiar with our monthly EBITDA target. While each company has its unique objectives, we have discovered that offering employees a perspective from the CEO's seat encourages them to consider the larger strategic elements at play.At our upcoming in-person conference in Las Vegas this January, we will engage various groups in a thought experiment: What would they prioritize if they were the CEO? We are already preparing folks across finance, product management and HR among others, prompting them to develop their best ideas for their respective groups. We are asking them what resources they lack and what they need to expand their teams. Our goal is to elicit unconstrained ideas, leading to discussions about how they contribute to the company's long-term growth goals. Once we have quantified their potential impact and cost, we can then estimate the long-term impact of these ideas.While we cannot implement every suggestion, determining the most feasible and impactful ideas is crucial. Keeping the door open for team leaders to present their ideas, coupled with a formal process for ideas submission like this one, is invaluable for leaders. However, educating employees on their role within the broader business context can help ensure these structures are truly effective.Establishing a foundation for innovationWe recently hired a new head of onboarding and employee education to guide people to understand our whole business model. It is too complicated to communicate in just a two-day training session, so instead we are creating videos and training content and posting them on our wiki. We also present them at our monthly online meetings to help our teams see why ""metrics matter."" These short videos lay out our entire business model one metric at a time and are entertaining enough and short enough that people will go back and watch them later when needed.


The other focus of the training is to give people a big, long roadmap of where we are heading. When ideas do come up, we can show people where they might fit in with the other initiatives we are working on. That way, our employees know they are not being ignored; it just might not be the best time to start on their idea. Being transparent about how we prioritize ideas shows we are serious about empowering our employees while tempering expectations.Related: You Have to Give Your Employees Freedom to See Excellence — Here's How to Do It.How leaders can prioritize ideasUnusable ideas are not usually bad, just impractical from a business standpoint. For instance, the HR department might ask for developers to build an automated solution for burdensome manual processes. As leaders, we might have to tell them they are paid to perform those actions because they are cheaper than having developers build a solution. Especially when building a company, an expensive solution that improves efficiency by 4% is not as valuable in the short run as a new growth project that could double the business at half the cost.At the same time, leaders cannot ignore teams. Our customer support team had been asking for efficiency tools for six years. As frustrations grew, I decided to direct investment into developing administrative tools. Purely from a growth perspective, this may not have been the best move, but I knew it was important for the team and became more than just a matter of cents.


We also strive to give people access to the right information so they can model their ideas and build projections on how they will impact the company before they even bring them to our attention. Conversations with innovative employees become so much easier when they see why we are going to prioritize a $20 million idea over their $50,000 idea. By establishing this transparency and a culture free from judgment, leaders help ensure people will keep generating and testing their ideas.Mutual trust — the key to good ideasWhen it comes to employee-driven innovation, the perfect balance is executive teams trusting their employees to come up with great ideas — and employees trusting leaders will take the time and effort to truly consider them. It is hard: People pitch an idea and might not hear back for months, which can disenfranchise them from doing it again. But if we educate people on how the company works and its larger objectives, they will have faith that the executive team is earnestly trying to move the organization forward. Then, as people see their best ideas get implemented, it creates a virtuous cycle: They will be motivated to continue to think more strategically and leaders will be able to harness their insights for the benefit of the whole company.

92,You Can Craft a Passion-Driven Success Story with the Proper Business Partners. Here's How.,"Jan 1, 2024",Ron Lieback,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-craft-a-success-story-with-the-right-partners/465753,"
Before launching my first business in 2017, I made a decision that helped shape its success — I declined several C-suite positions. Although they were financially attractive, the opps didn't resonate with my core values, particularly my commitment to ethical business practices.It's common for entrepreneurs to leap at the first opportunity that presents itself, typically driven by financial incentives. For many, years pass quickly, and though they have all the shiny things, many remain unfulfilled and miserable.An alternative path does exist. Leverage your passions, core values and strengths, and selectively embrace opportunities that align with them. How about the rest? That's simple — delegate them to trusted partners.



This approach has helped me shape a more fulfilling and successful entrepreneurial journey, one that allows challenges daily in vastly different industries while never feeling like I'm actually ""working,"" the latter always my ultimate goal.Here are two strategies that have helped me on my journey.Related: 3 Tips for Creating Powerful Partnerships1. Resist ill-suited opportunities — a test of entrepreneurial resolveFor new entrepreneurs, quick success and financial gains are tempting. Although these arrive sometimes, the real challenge resides in resisting opportunities that don't align with your passions, core values and strengths.This happened to me ahead of launching my first business in 2017. First was the passion and core value elements.All of my years spent studying literature and music helped shape my focus of only doing things passionate to me. This passion, along with a few of the business practices that didn't meet my ethical standards, prompted me to turn down a highly lucrative C-level position. It was the best — although most challenging — decision in my entrepreneurial journey.


Before jumping on an enticing opportunity, pause and reflect. Do you possess the necessary knowledge and skills? And, more importantly, does it resonate with your passions and ethical outlook? Pursuing a venture that's misaligned with your passions, core values and strengths typically fails.Instead, focus on nurturing your unique talents. Embrace opportunities that allow you to leverage your interests and the skills you've honed over time. This approach increases your chances of success and leads to a more fulfilling career.Building a business that mirrors your true self — your interests, skills and values — not only has a greater chance of success but also brings job satisfaction, leading to higher productivity, quality output and profitability. Someday, your interests may pivot, but as long as you built a solid business around them, you can also pivot from your role and pursue other opps. This could mean selling a business, passing leadership to someone else or simply taking on a new role within the company.That said, all of that relies on having solid business partners, leading me to the next point.Related: How to Use Strategic Partnerships for More Explosive Growth2. Relentlessly seek ideal business partnersOutsourcing is a strategic move for small businesses. Instead of trying to juggle every task, finding partners who excel in areas outside your expertise or interest is more effective.Identify tasks that are outside your wheelhouse, whether it's complex IT challenges or social media marketing. Find individuals who specialize in these areas and who are passionate about them. Their expertise and enthusiasm ensure superior quality and commitment.In my journey, I've learned that finding the right partners goes far beyond mere skillset matching. It's about forging relationships with individuals or entities that resonate deeply with your business's vision and core values. This alignment is the crux of building a partnership that's not just functional but genuinely synergistic.


It's like a well-orchestrated band where every member's unique style and expertise contribute to a powerful performance. When partners share your vision, they bring more than their skills — they bring a shared commitment to your business goals, a mutual understanding of what you stand for and an unwavering dedication to driving the collective mission forward.This synergy differentiates between a business that simply operates and one that thrives. It's about creating a network where each component amplifies the other, leading to exponential growth, innovation and success. It's a lesson I hold dear and a strategy I advocate for any entrepreneur looking to not just build a business but to create a legacy.Also, this approach goes beyond mere delegation — it's about optimizing. When experts manage tasks, they're executed with greater efficiency, improving productivity, reducing costs and enhancing quality.Related: How to Develop B2B Partnerships That Grow Your Business


With the right partners, you can concentrate on what you do best: boosting your productivity and work satisfaction. Seeking the right partnership can significantly enhance your business success. Combining your unique strengths with those of your partners creates a robust, dynamic business that's well-equipped to succeed in a competitive market.For budding entrepreneurs, it's vital to resist the temptation of taking every opportunity and instead focus on areas where you excel. Outsource other aspects to individuals who are passionate and skilled in those domains.This strategy leads to a streamlined, efficient business that thrives on your core competencies. Embrace the power of selective collaboration and watch your entrepreneurial venture flourish, anchored in your passions and expertise.

93,Why Jim Collins Is Wrong About How to Create Core Values,"Dec 26, 2023",Barry Raber,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-jim-collins-is-wrong-about-how-to-create-core-values/465390,"
Jim Collins is the guru of gurus on how to create great companies. He literally wrote the best-selling books on it — including Good to Great and Built to Last. He studied companies for years to share his observations.While I don't disagree with Collins on much, I strongly disagree with him on how to create company core values. If you follow his process to create your values, you will be selling your company short of its potential.Core values are the deeply ingrained principles that guide all of a company's actions; they serve as its cultural cornerstones.



Collins's process is overly focused on personal values and could result in developing values that are largely disconnected from the company's customer value proposition. That misalignment could hinder the growth and support of the business — and highlights the potential benefit of adopting a more effective process.Related: Core Values: What They Are, Why They're Important, and How to Implement Them Today


Visit the 'Red Planet' (but don't stay)The core exercise in Collins's process is the ""Mission to Mars."" In this exercise, the leadership team selects a group of five to seven people who do a ""super job"" of articulating the company's core values because they embody those values. The group answers a series of six questions. The first three questions revolve around their strongest personal values, while the last three focus on values that should never change under any circumstances. The result is the values those people share in common.What's missing here? All consideration for the company itself! The exercise totally disregards what the business is about — its industry, its purpose and mission, its brand and what value it is known for delivering to the customer, its customer base and its competitive advantage — you get where I'm headed.One question in his process specifies that you should disregard the industry you are in (it shouldn't matter). Another asks if you would hold the value even if it became a competitive disadvantage (Spoiler alert: The answer he wants is yes), while the third asks if the value would be valid 100 years from now. What company lasts for 100 years? And what young company disregards its customers, thinking that will help them last for 100 years? Collins calls these enduring values, and I can see why.The average age of a business in America is 10 years. You might be challenged to make it that long — much less 100 years — if you choose enduring values that have nothing to do with your business.


Collins came up with The Hedgehog Concept, which is the confluence of what a company is deeply passionate about, what they can be the best in the world at, and what drives their economic engine. The best companies have a strong Hedgehog. With a strong enough Hedgehog, company values may not matter. But for the other 30 million businesses in America, it would be smart to tilt the scale in your favor by approaching core values development in a more comprehensive way.Related: Core Values and Practices Are Booster Fuel for Your Business. Here's How to Establish the Right Ones.Try this insteadWhile the Mars Mission exercise can contribute to ideas for company core values, I think you need to replace the last three questions with questions more specific to your organization. The exercise should consider the business you are in, the industry, your brand and competitive advantage.This works best if you start by defining several foundational tenets for the business, then use those to work from in addition to the Mars Mission results that identify core values shared by exemplary individuals. These tenets include the company's core purpose or focus, mission, vivid vision, vision statement, the ""big hairy audacious goal"" and, especially, the brand promise.


Examining these company tenets, ask:What key non-negotiable factors are crucial to the success of these elements?What guiding principles are core to how we must operate to align with these?What behaviors do we need to exhibit consistently to make it happen?What top three priorities, essential actions or qualities must we uphold continuously to deliver on our promises for our customers and team?Now, drawing from this much larger brainstorm of ideas, develop your company's core values.While the end result could include two or three values around the shared attributes of the existing team or how they work together that are key to preserving company culture, two or three values should guide how the company delivers for customers or the direction the company is committed to pursuing.While Collins is focused on companies built to last 100 years, like Merck and Disney, I am focused on looking 10 years ahead as a time frame for your values. (Coincidently, that is the recommended timeline to achieve a ""big hairy audacious goal,"" another great Jim Collins invention). If in 10 years your values could be enhanced to align better with the evolving needs of the company, its employees and customers, don't hesitate to tweak them. Core values don't have to be forever.


Related: Unlock the Secret to Crafting Compelling Core Values With This Step-by-Step GuideI recently wrote an article about four entrepreneurs who sold their businesses for $50-$150 million within 12 years of founding. Each shared their core values with me — and for all four, at least half of their core values directly related to their approach to delivering value to the customer, either by process or product. It's clear that their achievements in 12 years (or less) were significantly influenced by core values.One benefit of producing values in this way is they are more tangible and yield visible results. That makes it easier to identify related behaviors and performance, enabling you to create effective recognition and motivational tools that amplify employee and company performance.While I know of no book or Bible on how to write company core values, artificial intelligence is in the news a lot. I asked ChatGPT how to write core values, and the response was much closer to what I'm advocating than what Collins articulated.


Exceptional core values have the potential to propel a company to new heights in a short amount of time. They can be so powerful. Invest the time to formulate them correctly, hire employees who are a great fit with them and watch their transformative impact.

94,Rejection Doesn't Have to Be a Bad Thing. Here's How You Can Use It as a Tool for Success.,"Dec 25, 2023",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-use-rejection-as-a-tool-for-success/465549,"
When I was 22, I had a boss who taught me to crave rejection. At that time, I was in a sales role and had shared with her that I felt all I ever heard was the word ""no.""The following month, she ran a competition to see who could hear ""no"" the most. And yes indeed, I was the victor. So much good came from that experience. I realized that rejection is a part of sales, and it's also a part of life. I learned that highly successful people know this and aren't miffed when they're told no. In fact, they embrace rejection and even learn from it.Successful people use rejection to get stronger. However, many people don't feel this way about rejection. If you're struggling to feel good about being rejected, here are four steps you can take to completely rewire your brain.



Related: 5 Ways to Turn Rejection Into Resilience1. Don't take it personallyOften, we struggle with rejection because we feel it's personal. But rejection usually isn't personal.


When rejected, it's easy to wonder what the rejection says about us. But often, rejection doesn't say anything about us. Instead, it says something about the other person. Frequently, we ignore or discount the reasons we're given for the rejection. Instead, we look for another reason (the real reason). Usually, another reason doesn't exist.If someone says they don't want the product or service we're selling because they can't afford it at that time, they usually mean it. If someone says they can't attend the event we invited them to because they're too busy, they usually mean it. Spending time beating ourselves up and wondering what the rejection really says about us and how likable we are is often a tremendous waste of time. When we trust the reasons we're given for the rejection, we can move on and strike out again much faster.2. Get excited about being rejectedRejection usually doesn't feel good. For many, that's why it's hard to imagine what (if any) good can (and will) come from it.Remember: Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional. Recognize that you have a choice in how you feel about rejection. Whatever story you tell yourself about rejection comes from you. It's up to you to interpret the information that exists in your world. You have the power to flip the script, change the narrative and tell yourself a different story.


You can choose to view rejection as a good thing — it means you put yourself out there, asked a tough question and exuded courage. It means you got out of your comfort zone, which always helps us grow and evolve. It means you got to practice a skill (the skill of asking, influencing or selling). That practice will help you grow thicker skin and hone your craft, making you stronger and tougher. With that in mind, you can choose to view rejection as a good thing.Related: How to Overcome Rejection and Move Forward With Your Big Goals3. Ask why — and learn from itMost people feel pain when rejected. When we experience any kind of pain, our first reaction is often flight or fight. We either walk away, as quickly as we can, or we double down and argue. When it comes to rejection, neither approach works well.Here's what does: Engaging the person who rejected you from a place of true curiosity. Questions such as: ""What was the biggest factor in your decision?"" or ""What, if anything, would've made you say yes?"" or ""What could I offer or do next time that would excite or interest you more?""


These questions are great tools to help you learn from rejection. Perhaps you can give feedback to your boss that your product's price point isn't appealing or the benefits aren't meeting market demand. You might learn that a slightly altered product or service would've garnered a yes, and perhaps you can negotiate an exception from your company that allows you to go back and offer the client what they really want.Every so often, there is something you could've done or said differently that would've been persuasive. Getting information about how to proceed more effectively next time is a win. With that mindset in mind, rejection is actually a good thing — it helps you improve.4. Know that things can changeRemember that most things in life aren't permanent and people's situations can change dramatically from one year to the next (or even one month to the next). Just because someone turned you down once doesn't mean they'll turn you down every time.Ask permission to reconnect or touch base again later. Maybe your friend can't make time to see you this month, but they'll be able to next month. Perhaps the client you've been trying to sign all year will be in a different financial situation next year. Recognize now simply might not be the right time for whatever you're proposing, and while that's okay, it may not always be the case.


Related: 4 Ways to Handle and Overcome Your Fear of Rejection5. Adjust your strategyAfter you get enough information to learn following a rejection, you get to employ what I call PDCA — plan, do, check and adjust.Once you've been rejected and know why, you can adjust your strategy. You might learn that making calls at lunch time isn't effective because no one answers the phone. You might learn you've been targeting the wrong demographic and need to pick different prospects. You might learn prospecting on the weekdays isn't as effective as prospecting on weekends.Rejection, if used correctly, can be an excellent teacher because it can guide us to make changes to what we do and how we do it. You might decide to start frequenting community events or join a networking group to be more successful. In the end, if being rejected causes you to do something new and different, that's another win.


Having a healthy, strong relationship with rejection is a true game changer. If you adopt these five philosophies on rejection, you'll find rejection isn't nearly as painful as it once was. You might even begin to look forward to rejection.

Recently, Sallie Krawcheck, CEO of Ellevest, made headlines when she described how her employees are more productive and better at meeting deadlines working from home, but her firm is less creative. Similarly, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said back in May that ""one of the tech industry's worst mistakes in a long time was that everybody could go full remote forever, and startups didn't need to be together in person and, you know, there was going to be no loss of creativity.""Are they right? Or are they simply doing remote work wrong? Let me share a real-life example from one of my clients, a late-stage tech startup with over 120 staff deciding on whether to make a bold move that could redefine its future.

Forcing Your Employees To Readapt to The Office Is Not The Answer.



Exploring the innovation challenge in remote workTheir team thrived in a remote environment, showing remarkable productivity and collaboration. The switch to remote work brought about numerous benefits: flexible schedules, no commute and the comfort of working from home. Employees reported higher job satisfaction and better work-life balance, leading to increased output and efficiency. However, they hit a roadblock when it came to one critical aspect: innovation.What is it about remote work that seems to stifle innovation? While digital tools have made communication and collaboration feasible and effective, there's an element often missing in remote settings — the spontaneous interactions and serendipitous conversations that spark in office environments. These unplanned moments, from a quick chat by the coffee machine to brainstorming sessions on a whiteboard, often lead to creative breakthroughs and innovative ideas.


There's a certain synergy that occurs when people share a physical space. It's about the energy, the non-verbal cues, and the quick back-and-forth exchanges that happen organically in a shared environment. This dynamic is challenging to recreate in a virtual setting, where interactions are usually scheduled and structured. The casual, impromptu nature of office interactions fosters an environment ripe for innovation, often leading to ideas and solutions that structured meetings cannot produce.So, the crux of the problem becomes: how do you foster this creative exchange in a remote work model? How do you replicate the dynamism and spontaneity of in-person interactions in a digital realm? This challenge is not just about finding the right technology; it's about rethinking how we facilitate and encourage creative thinking and idea exchange in a setting devoid of physical presence.To address this, companies have experimented with various digital tools and platforms aiming to bring the ""office vibe"" into remote work. These include virtual whiteboards for brainstorming, digital hubs for spontaneous chats, and scheduled ""innovation hours"" where team members can discuss ideas freely without a set agenda. However, these solutions often only partially replicate the in-person experience, leading businesses to seek more innovative approaches to bridge the gap.Unleashing creative potential with generative AIEnter Generative AI. It's a game-changer, considering GPT-4's impressive feats of creativity — outperforming 91% of humans on a variation of the Alternative Uses Test and surpassing 99% in the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. We're swiftly reaching a point where there are hardly any creativity benchmarks that AI can't master.


AI's ability to generate novel ideas and solutions is unprecedented. By processing vast amounts of data and identifying patterns that humans might overlook, AI can offer fresh perspectives that enhance human creativity. It's not about replacing human ingenuity but augmenting it with AI's computational power. How did this integration transform their approach to innovation? By embedding AI into their creative processes, they not only matched but exceeded pre-pandemic levels of innovation. This AI-driven strategy catalyzed fresh, groundbreaking ideas, fostering an environment where creativity flourished without the constraints of physical collaboration.Imagine brainstorming sessions where AI tools are used to suggest ideas, play devil's advocate, or provide data-driven insights. This integration led to more diverse and comprehensive ideation, pushing the boundaries of conventional thinking.Specifically, I helped my client learn how to leverage Generative AI to transform how individuals brainstormed and developed ideas before bringing them to a collaborative team setting. This approach offered an opportunity to boost remote creativity and innovation to enhance the quality of ideas and reduce the reliance on traditional in-person brainstorming sessions and spontaneous interactions. Here are the steps involved in the process.Related: Can AI Outperform Human Creativity? Research Suggests Machines Are More Capable Than We Thought.


1. Initial idea generationAn individual can start by inputting a basic concept or problem statement into a Generative AI tool. The AI can then generate a range of ideas, perspectives and solutions based on its vast knowledge base and data processing capabilities. This step can help in exploring various angles and possibilities that one might not consider in a conventional brainstorming session.For instance, if the individual is looking to develop a new product feature, the AI can propose multiple variations and enhancements based on current market trends, consumer feedback, and competitive analysis.2. Refining and evaluating ideasOnce a range of ideas is generated, the individual can use AI to evaluate their viability. AI algorithms can assess the potential impact, feasibility and market readiness of these ideas by analyzing relevant data points. This step helps in shortlisting the most promising ideas that are worth discussing in a team setting.In our product feature example, the AI can help prioritize which features are likely to have the greatest user impact or are most feasible to develop based on technical analysis and market data.


3. Enhancing creativity with AI-assisted toolsIndividuals can use AI-assisted design tools, predictive analytics, and simulation software to further develop and visualize their ideas. This can add depth and clarity to the concepts, making them more tangible and easier to communicate with colleagues.Consider an individual brainstorming a new marketing campaign. AI tools can help create preliminary designs, simulate customer responses and even draft potential marketing copy, providing a solid base for further team development.4. Collaborative integrationAfter developing a well-rounded idea independently, the individual can bring these AI-enhanced ideas to their team. This approach ensures that the ideas brought to the table are already well-thought-out, data-backed, and innovative, making the team discussions more productive and focused.If the idea involves a new business process improvement, the individual can present a detailed AI-generated proposal, complete with efficiency projections and implementation strategies, making the collaborative review process more efficient and goal-oriented.


5. Continuous feedback loopFinally, as these ideas are discussed and refined within the team, the feedback and additional insights can be fed back into the AI system. This creates a continuous loop of improvement and innovation, where ideas are constantly enhanced and updated based on collaborative inputs.In a software development project, feedback from team discussions can be used to refine the AI-generated feature concepts, ensuring that the final product aligns with both technical feasibility and team vision.By leveraging Generative AI in this manner, individuals can transform the brainstorming process, making it more independent yet equally, if not more, effective — whether they are remote or in the office. This method not only reduces the necessity for traditional in-person brainstorming but also enhances the quality and depth of ideas brought to collaborative discussions. In an era where remote and hybrid work models are prevalent, such AI-enhanced individual brainstorming will become a cornerstone of innovation and creativity in businesses.Rethinking office space: A strategic shiftThe impact of this AI integration was so profound that it led to a significant strategic shift. The company decided to release their $1.2 million annual office lease, a bold move signaling their commitment to a new, AI-enhanced mode of operation. This wasn't just a cost-cutting measure; it was a reinvestment into the company's growth and future.


The decision to let go of the office space was strategic. The freed-up funds were channeled into areas that promised more growth, like research and development, marketing, and further AI integration. This shift signifies a deeper understanding that the future of work lies not in physical spaces but in digital and intellectual realms.This scenario underscores a broader trend in the future of work. AI isn't just a tool for automating tasks or enhancing productivity; it's becoming a vital ally in driving creative thinking and innovation, especially in remote work settings. This isn't just about adapting to a new work model; it's about reimagining the boundaries of what's possible when human intellect collaborates with advanced AI capabilities.In a world where businesses vie for the top spot, AI can be the differentiator. Companies that harness AI's potential for creative problem-solving and innovation can gain a competitive edge. It's about leveraging AI to do more than just streamline processes — it's about using it to think differently and innovate faster.What does this mean for other businesses grappling with similar challenges? It's a clarion call to embrace AI not as a mere technological tool but as a partner in creative and strategic thinking. The success story of this tech startup isn't just about letting go of physical office space. It's about embracing a new paradigm where AI and remote work synergize to unlock unprecedented levels of innovation and growth.


Leadership plays a crucial role in this transition. It requires a visionary approach to understand and implement AI in ways that amplify human creativity. Leaders need to foster a culture where AI is seen as an enabler of innovation, not just a tool for efficiency.Related: Nearly 3 out of 4 Marketing Professionals Use AI to Create Content, New Study ShowsCharting a new course in the digital ageAs businesses navigate the complexities of the digital age, the integration of AI into core business processes is no longer an option; it's a necessity for staying ahead. The journey of this tech startup is a testament to the power of AI in revolutionizing not just workflows but also the very essence of creative collaboration and innovation in a remote work setting. It's a bold new world out there, and the future belongs to those who dare to redefine the rules of the game. We are on the cusp of a new era where AI and human ingenuity blend to create unprecedented opportunities for growth and innovation. It's an exciting time for businesses willing to embrace this change and harness the power of AI to redefine what's possible. The future of work is here, and it's vibrant, dynamic, and AI-driven - whether remote or in the office.

96,How I Pulled Myself Out of Burnout and Turned My Ambitions Into Reality,"Dec 21, 2023",Andi Cross,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-i-pulled-myself-out-of-burnout-and-turn-my-ambitions/465158,"
More than half of American workers say they're currently experiencing burnout. To meet the status quo of the modern corporate world, many put their passions on hold and compromise their life for their work. The concept of a work-life balance goes out the door.Once in this position, I decided to uproot my life in an effort to blend my passion and profession and defy the corporate America status quo. After more than a decade working in New York, I moved to Australia, started a consultancy, became a certified divemaster and ultimately focused my efforts on supporting mission-driven, impact businesses conserving and restoring the planet. Today, my team and I are on a two-year expedition called Edges of Earth, which is the culmination of five years of life upheaval and shifted career priorities.This pursuit of bringing together passion and profession is called ikigai. It's a Japanese framework that helps us think about our life's purpose in four ways: what you love, what the world needs most, what you're good at and what you can be paid for. Here's how I used this framework to get me out of a colossal state of burnout.



Related: 4 Basics for Making the Move From Corporate Job to EntrepreneurUncover your ambitionDiscovering your ambition doesn't happen overnight. It requires trial and error in figuring out what you want to dedicate your time and effort to. While we all have passions and strengths, it's invaluable to explore various avenues to figure out what is the right fit. Over 11 years at digital and marketing agencies, I filled lots of different roles to understand where I could contribute best.


These experiences offered insight into how businesses work and where I wanted to slate in, while highlighting certain voids in my life. Although sometimes frustrating, the years of training and exploring are extremely vital in figuring out what ambition means to you.Ground your ambitionsAssessing your aspiration's viability and understanding the real-world challenges you're up against enables you to make smart decisions from the start. An initial vision might require tweaking, but revising towards a fitting approach is always better than forcing things that don't work.For example, my consultancy saw numerous iterations, transitioning from exclusively serving ocean nonprofits (an extremely small pool of clients) to offering services to a wider range of mission-driven entities and leaders. That trial and error period doesn't stop once the ambition is uncovered — it's only just beginning.Set achievable goalsRealizing your ambition is a marathon, not a sprint. By segmenting the journey into attainable goals, the path becomes more navigable. My team and I are constantly envisioning the future and working backward to maintain a balance between initiating action and gaining momentum.


Rigorous project management is indispensable, helping to provide laser focus on the right now and not getting lost in the bigger picture. It's easy to get distracted by the end goal. But with the right management levers in place, that can be mitigated.Related: Living With Purpose: Here's How Entrepreneurs Can Win The Battle Against BurnoutChoose the right peoplePinpointing those who resonate with your vision and goals is perhaps the most arduous task of them all. A mismatch can cause setbacks in the time it takes you to realize you're working with the wrong collaborators.Upon finding the right fit, invest in them. Encourage their autonomy, foster their best work and support their growth — as building trust within a team demands this. It's our responsibility to uphold our commitments. Choose people that want to partner with you as much as you want to partner with them.


Be okay with saying noBuilding a corporate career, I was under the impression that saying ""yes"" when everyone else was saying ""no"" would elevate me. And for a while, that was true. However, with this comes the burden of not knowing when to push back.If there are red flags — occurrences that go against your vision and values — then there needs to be a way to recalibrate. And sometimes a hard ""no"" is what's needed most. Sometimes, a ""no"" is what gets you farther ahead in the long run, even if it feels like a few steps back in real time.Embrace the setbacksFailures shouldn't overshadow our identity or cripple momentum. Instead, they should enlighten us and offer wisdom. Each setback has made my team more resilient, allowing us to absorb a lesson learned and come out the other side more determined than before.Throughout our expedition, we've encountered changed plans, dissolved partnerships, faced abrupt shifts and pushed through tough conversations. It's impossible to be perfectly aligned with everyone we encounter. Sometimes change hurts, but let that hurt be fuel to the fire.


Related: How Your 'Box of Possibility' Can Help Drive Your Entrepreneurial PassionCelebrate every winEvery victory must be celebrated, regardless of size. These moments reaffirm that the diligent groundwork, even when it seemed so minuscule compared to our larger ambition, was invaluable.In the shadow of celebrated successes highlighted in the media, we often overlook the myriad of small, essential victories that constitute someone's entrepreneurial journey. Achieving these milestones demands immense effort without shortcuts, making every win deserving of wholehearted celebration.Stay curious and always learnContinuous learning is the ultimate key. Recognizing we don't have all the answers and that the journey is about the ongoing pursuit of knowledge keeps us humble and interested. For example, every location we visit on our expedition offers insight that helps refine our strategies and collaborations — keeping us on our toes and far from burnout in the process.


Simply put: If you have an ambition that you want to make a reality, go for it. Left unattended, it becomes the persistent ""what if"" echoing in the background. But it's equally important to pursue it with preparation, ensuring you have the requisite skills, insights and validation to some degree that your efforts will resonate. Not just for you, but for the wider world and those you hope to serve.

97,Why Neiman Marcus Doesn't Care If Its Corporate Employees Stay Remote,"Dec 19, 2023",Tim Paradis,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/neiman-marcus-execs-corporate-remote-work-policy-is-perfect/467144,"
This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Neiman Marcus isn't known for its discounts.But the luxury retailer where top shoppers drop upwards of $25,000 annually has fewer people showing up at its corporate offices — by design.



Due to its remote-work policy, about 40% of Neiman Marcus' 1,800 corporate workers are now based outside Dallas, where the company's first store opened in 1907.Prior to its decision to go remote in 2020 — just before the pandemic closed department stores across the US — most of the chain's corporate workers had to be in Dallas.


Unlike many bosses walking back promises of letting people sign on from their kitchen table, the company famous for over-the-top gift ideas has no plans to bring workers back to offices full time, Eric Severson, chief people and belonging officer at Neiman Marcus Group, told Business Insider.One key reason, he said, is because being remote has proven too powerful for attracting and hanging onto workers.""When a company announces they're going to force their people back in the office and we have jobs we need to hire, our recruiting team starts calling them,"" Severson said.Building worker loyaltySince the company moved to allow remote and hybrid work in 2020, a majority of the execs it's brought in have been from outside the Dallas area.""We wouldn't have gotten the talent if we forced them to relocate to DFW,"" Severson said.The stance from Neiman's isn't a total surprise for a company that puts a premium on the unique. This year, in its famous Christmas gift book, there's a chance to be an animated Disney character for $510,000 or take part in a New York ballet.The move to let people sign on from somewhere other than an office fosters loyalty from workers, Severson said. In quarterly employee engagement surveys, flexibility routinely ranks as the thing Neiman Marcus workers like most about the company. He added that the company's retention rate went up during the Great Resignation when many employers struggled to hang onto workers.""What it illustrates is how important and how powerful it is to have control over your time,"" Severson said.


Using offices, not hotels, to gatherSeverson said the retail chain, which includes three dozen Neiman Marcus locations and two Bergdorf Goodman stores in New York, hasn't lost creative firepower because many employees are now working from home.""It's a fallacy to say that human beings can only connect or be creative or productive when they're sitting next to each other,"" he said.When people do want to gather, they can do so at hubs in Dallas, New York, and Bangalore, India, Severson said. In the past, teams might have come together for meetings by renting hotel space. Workers can now use the offices, which are designed to be creative spaces, to meet in groups. Rooms have tech like digital whiteboards so people working from home can see what's going on, he said.The willingness to bring on remote workers for many roles has meant a 31% reduction in hiring time in recent years and a 75% decrease in the amount of office space the company has, Severson said.


Even with travel expenses, the company's costs are lower than before it filed for bankruptcy early in the pandemic. Neiman Marcus emerged from bankruptcy in late 2020 with a focus on well-heeled shoppers.Neiman Marcus Group is spending about 30% less on operating costs for corporate real estate than it was in 2019, not adjusting for inflation, Severson said. This approach gives the company more flexibility. ""If you have a soft year, you just don't travel as much,"" he said.Some of the company's stylists spend time interacting with clients by working from home or elsewhere. ""It's actually easier for them sometimes to do that when they're not interrupted on the selling floor,"" Severson said.It's important to set expectations for people who get to work from home, Severson said, adding that workers who don't want to be micromanaged are expected to deliver — and will be held accountable.


The company is in part owned by the asset-management giant Pimco. Neiman Marcus recently rejected a buyout offer from rival Saks Fifth Avenue, according to The Wall Street Journal.

98,"Here's Why Businesses Should Stop Trying to Hire for ""Cultural Fit""","Dec 15, 2023",David Eaton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-businesses-should-stop-trying-to-hire-for-cultural-fit/466064,"
Organizations that pride themselves on the strength of their cultures often seek to reinforce workplace norms by looking for ""cultural fit"" among potential new hires — candidates who, in the minds of leaders, reflect and will uphold their organizations' best attributes. Unfortunately, this hiring practice has the often unintended effect of maintaining overwhelmingly homogeneous, monocultural teams. This works directly against initiatives to advance diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB) to the detriment of innovation, organizational reputation and talent retention, especially among younger generations.Fortunately, leaders can begin rectifying this practice by internalizing, modeling, and ultimately operationalizing mindset changes that look beyond ""fit"" to embrace diverse backgrounds, perspectives, communication styles and even expressions of emotions. In doing so, they'll make their cultures even stronger, adding and elevating the contributions of those who might experience the world differently, not just because of race or gender, but also socio-economic background, country of origin, sexual orientation, birth order, generation, personality traits and numerous other factors.Related: Forget Cultural Fit and Look for Cultural Impact



Understanding the drivers behind cultural homogeneityThe motivation to hire based on cultural fit is as understandable as it is misguided. Leaders who value their current teams might want to emulate the success they've achieved to date and lean into the short-term comfort that, for the majority group, often accompanies conformity. They also understand on some level that de-prioritizing fit can lead to workplace tensions that — while often healthy, constructive and completely manageable — do necessitate time- and resource-consuming investments on the part of organizations and their top leaders.Unfortunately, the short-term benefit of this homogeneity ultimately gives way to significant long-term disadvantages. In today's increasingly globalized, multi-generational, multi-cultural world, the sameness that pervades workplace monocultures puts them at a significant business disadvantage, while also signaling organizational disregard for corporate social responsibility. Such organizations ultimately see weaker bottom-line results, higher turnover and reputational damage compared with more innovative, profitable and respected diverse-by-design competing organizations.


This points to the benefits of taking immediate steps to examine and potentially modify how organizations consider, value and interact with team members and prospective employees.Instead of ""cultural fit,"" seek out cultural contributorsUnderstanding that organizations are charged with assessing job candidates based on a wide range of attributes, some of which are challenging to qualify, it can be helpful for talent acquisition teams to actively replace the concept of ""cultural fit"" with something specific, though more constructive. Such departments might benefit from the idea of seeking out ""cultural contributors,"" meaning individuals whose perspectives would add to and advance, versus conform to, workplace cultures.The language here is important as the word ""contributors"" signals that the new viewpoints being introduced by increasingly diverse teams are welcome and positive. Of course, this thinking is best reinforced with clear, consistent, ongoing communications and concrete actions across enterprises to ensure it goes beyond mere lip service and leads to meaningful, positive change. As always, employees look to the examples set by top leaders for confirmation of their organizations' lived values, signifying the importance of buy-in and participation among members of the C-suite.Related: Diverse Teams Drive Innovation in Ways Homogeneous Teams Just Can't


Additional steps to fostering heterogeneous culturesRecognizing the risks associated with homogeneous workplaces, a growing number of employers are taking additional steps to make their cultures less conforming. For example, many organizations are focusing strongly on fostering greater awareness and acceptance of individual differences within their recruitment/talent acquisition functions. This reflects the understanding that prospective employees are interviewing organizations all while the organizations are interviewing individuals. Candidates who perceive that employers don't make space for team members' true, authentic selves will increasingly decline to join such companies.On a broader level, many organizations are thinking beyond hiring — investing in enhanced diversity training across departmental areas. The best of these trainings go beyond the largely criticized, ineffective versions of the past, encompassing expertly moderated, interactive group discussions and assessments and measurements of their value to participating individuals and the organization. They also emphasize inclusive leadership, which fosters environments in which all team members can contribute and organizations can benefit from their diverse perspectives and experiences.The most savvy workplaces have made the strategic decision to intentionally infuse enterprises with new cultural competencies that help meet big-picture objectives and drive organizational value. Engaging advisory firms, they embrace a multi-pronged approach including: a discovery phase to determine the organization's current cultural state; a co-created identification of what constitutes a better state; a design and execution with regard to how to pull this new state through all the roles, processes and systems of the organization; and an examination of how well it worked.Big picture, organizations that intentionally form diverse-by-design teams and support them with an inclusive workplace culture drive innovative thinking and long-term success. Achieving this requires companies to look beyond cultural fit, expand their recruiting pools and welcome those who will challenge the status quo.

My team was two weeks away from hosting a big event. There was a lot left to do. But my boss, Lisa, had just learned of a more imminent big event: a midday Mets game, where one pitcher had the rare chance to win his 20th game.""We have to go,"" she said.I was skeptical. It hardly felt like an ideal time for an afternoon adventure! But Lisa insisted that we could tackle the work later, because this Mets game would only happen once. She got tickets for herself, me, and a junior team member. When that pitcher secured his win, the three of us were there. And weeks later, when we hosted our successful company event, all was well — with nothing sacrificed from our outing.

100,Here's How Our Company Tripled in Size By Creating a Culture of Bold Kindness,"Dec 6, 2023",Cathy Thorpe,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/creating-this-type-of-culture-helped-our-company-triple-in/465983,"
When I joined my company in a leadership role nine years ago, I had an outsider's lens in more ways than one.Not only was I new to the organization and the people who ran it, but the industry of in-home healthcare was a big pivot from retail, where I had spent most of my corporate career.What struck me the most as I embarked on new terrain, was the genuine kindness I witnessed from our people who were servicing our clients with great compassion. Our business isn't built on transactions — it's built on trust. Our clients have to feel confident in our ability to support and care for their loved ones.As genuine as our approach was, it was also clear there were areas where our corporate culture needed reshaping. For example, I recall walking into our shared kitchen daily, only to find the sink overflowing with dirty dishes. In meetings, I would hear people blame other team members for performance issues — signs that discipline and self-responsibility weren't being prioritized.



At the time, we had roughly 40 franchise locations, primarily in Canada. It was a healthy achievement, but I knew if we wanted to grow and expand internationally, we had to transform our culture and people practices.Today, we have more than 300 franchise locations in four countries and have grown our revenue by more than 200%. We've also developed a culture where 60% of our people have grown into different roles, allowing them to build new skills and challenge themselves. Here's how we've accelerated the growth of our company and developed our people by creating a culture of bold kindness.Related: Why Patience And Kindness Need To Be At The Center Of How You Run Your Business


Defining a culture of bold kindness Bold kindness is more than exercising empathy on a client phone call — it's about shifting from a culture of ""nice"" to one of accountability while creating an environment where people feel their personal wellbeing matters.Creating a culture of self-discipline and accountability doesn't require instilling fear or pulling corporate rank — in fact, it's quite the opposite. We've found when you empower your team at every level to play a significant role in decision-making, you can exercise kindness and care for their wellbeing. This inadvertently helps build intrinsic motivation where teammates are driven to take ownership over their own work.According to data from McKinsey employees who are intrinsically motivated are 32% more committed to their job, have nearly 50% higher job satisfaction and perform 16% better than other employees.Today, everyone in our company works towards the same vision — we call it our ""painted picture."" We set bold goals, and each one of us is accountable for helping achieve them, but we also respect that every team member has their own process for getting there.This intentional shift towards balancing a culture of self-responsibility with care for our people shows up in every aspect of our teams' performance. From putting their own dishes away in our now well-maintained shared kitchen to the increase in our Net Promoter Score from the low 50s to the high 70s — bold kindness has motivated our team to achieve exceptional results and to be proud of the work the team has done.


Related: Compassion Will Boost Your Business: Making The Case For Showing More Kindness At WorkKnowing the people behind your performanceWe recently had two people within our company become first-time dog owners. We celebrated these milestones similarly to how we would if a team member had a baby. We were flexible in allowing our new dog owners to work from home and allowed them to transition back to in-office hours on a schedule that worked for their unique situation.In both circumstances, we wanted the underlying message to be clear: We value you, and what you're going through matters. Operating from a lens of bold kindness means taking the time to understand your talent as people first. By celebrating and supporting each team member's journey, both personal and professional, you foster a sense of belonging and care within your workplace.New research shows that when employees feel a sense of belonging at work, they are five times more likely to want to stay at their company. On the other hand, employees who feel insecure about their place within an organization are less likely to collaborate, share their creativity or perform to their highest potential.In contrast to traditional corporate environments, when our people come to work, they aren't expected to leave personal matters at the door. If we ask someone how their day is going and they sound off — we stop to check in. We want to know what is really going on with our teammates, whether it's personal or professional.


Encouraging people to show up as their whole selves to work isn't a license to forgo professional duties when a personal matter arises; it's acknowledging the circumstances they are facing and supporting them through it so that they can do their best despite the distraction.Related: How Your Company Culture Can Be a Force Multiplier (For the Good and the Bad)Showing up as a human-first leaderAs CEO, I'm not immune to personal challenges. Just as I encourage my people to show up as their authentic selves at work, I'm transparent about my life with my team. As a leader, I'm aware that how I show up at work sets a tone, and it's my responsibility to shape an environment where everyone can thrive.When I walk in on a Monday, I take time to greet everyone and listen with genuine interest as I hear about their weekends. These personal connections have been essential to our team's success.A global study by the International Social Survey Program, published by the Harvard Business Review, showed workplace relationships have a significant impact on job satisfaction. Not only that, but researchers at the Universities of Pennsylvania and Minnesota have confirmed close relationships at work increase productivity and result in higher levels of commitment, better communication and morale.I've worked in traditional business environments where orders are expected to be followed without question and where parts of my identity weren't welcomed. I've experienced firsthand how that kind of culture kills morale and innovation, and it always comes from the top.Bold kindness isn't taught in traditional business schools yet, but for us, it's been a game changer. Not only has the shift in our culture helped us triple our company's size and expand internationally, but it's also created a work environment where I and everyone around me feels supported and inspired.

101,Want Employees Back in the Office? What Leaders Are (Still!) Getting Wrong About This Ask,"Dec 6, 2023",Caroline Carter-Smith,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/want-employees-back-in-the-office-what-leaders-are/465108,"
For all the reports of loneliness and isolation experienced during the pandemic, it's no secret that a significant portion of the workforce became habituated to working from home. Many found the increased time autonomy, the lack of commute and the flexibility refreshing, if not freeing.Well, the party's over.Last year, people began returning to the office en masse. According to Build Remote, in 2022 approximately 34% — twice that of the previous year — of all Fortune 100 companies requested their employees return to the office. For those still working at home, the news gets worse; Resume Builder reports that 90% of companies plan to be back at the office by the end of 2024.



This presents its own set of problems. For business leaders, one of these is the question of how to ask employees to come back. But armed with the knowledge of what others have done right (or drastically wrong), it would behoove them to think about how they approach communications on this.As a business leader who supports other business leaders with how they communicate with stakeholders, I've seen firsthand how taking a compassionate approach to communicating policy changes can further the employer-employee bond, energize a workforce and take the edge off challenging conversations. Yes, including the RTO ask.


Here are some tips to get it right.Related: 3 Mistakes You May Not Realize You're Making When Bringing Employees Back to the OfficeDig deepIt sounds simple, but before asking their employees to return to the office, leaders should ask themselves: Why do I really want this?Is it because returning to a work environment is what everyone else is doing? Or because it seems like the correct course to take? Or is it even due to control issues? If your motivations are rooted in a scarcity rather than an abundance mindset or impulsive feelings, it's worth taking a second look and ensuring they aren't informing strategy that could do more damage in the long term.


One of many dangers of not thinking through your own motivations is coming across as unclear and out of touch. In a virtual town hall recorded in April, Clearlink CEO James Clarke awkwardly praised an employee for selling the family dog after hearing about the company's RTO policy and questioned whether single mothers or primary caregivers could really work full-time jobs.This was a textbook example of somebody who was making an ask from a lens of control and operational scarcity, who was not clear on the data, and who was throwing out confusing and alienating concepts to justify the return to work. Not only was this ineffective, but his communication blunder led to widespread negative coverage for his organization and his leadership.Look to the dataWhile personal reflection is a good starting point, one of the benefits of no longer being in the immediate post-pandemic period is that leaders now have access to some telling numbers around barriers and motivations for returning to a physical workplace.According to a 2022 Microsoft Work Trend Index, the main attraction of coming back is the social aspect: 85% of employees say they would be motivated to go into the office to rebuild team bonds, while 84% indicated they would return to work for the chance to socialize with coworkers.


This is gold for business leaders. CEOs and company heads who emphasize human connection and collaboration in the workplace are more likely to receive buy-in. No matter how comfortable and convenient your employees' home offices might be, they may still miss the water-cooler chitchat about the latest hit streaming show and the sense of mission that comes from being around like-minded people. Simply put: Framing an office come-back of any duration as an aspirational opportunity for collaboration and connectedness vs. a punitive measure rooted in control is a great place to start.Related: We Know Return to Office Mandates Backfire — So Why Are Tech Giants Like Amazon, IBM and Zoom Reinstating This Outdated Policy?Use humility and empathy as a North StarWords like empathy and humility get thrown around a lot, but they do matter here. If you want people to show up for you, show up for them.Put yourself in your employees' shoes. What kind of challenges do they face? Arm yourself with the information before you make that choice and that call. If you have a people team or access to HR data, leverage those things to get more insight into what is keeping employees at home and what would incentivize them to come back. Figure out their barriers to entry. Do they need childcare options? A less costly commute?


Also keep in mind that the blending of home and work life during the pandemic fundamentally may have changed things for people, particularly for caregivers. Acknowledging and accounting for the added stress that a return to the office may bring reassures them that the reality of their experience isn't being erased by the renewed physical barrier between home and work.Commit to being present, tooFinally, business leaders have to walk the walk as well as talk the talk. I've heard many stories of CEOs asking employees to come back, while rarely coming in themselves. Not a good look.Obviously, as a leader with travel and business obligations, you're not going to be able to be in the office 24/7 — and you wouldn't have been before this situation, either. But it is important that, especially in those early days of asking people to come back in, you are intentional about being present, making your face known (and seen) and demonstrating that enthusiasm that you're asking others to bring.Related: 3 Simple Ways to Motivate a Remote Workforce


That means everything from welcoming people back personally to showing your face around the office to, when possible, attending town halls and meetings in person. And it means continuing to ensure that whatever policy you have instituted is still working. Keeping those lines of communication open and responding to changes as they come up are ways that leaders can continue to show that this is a journey for them, too.Growing pains — or in this case, returning pains — are inevitable after a paradigm-shifting event like the pandemic. But by being clear and intentional in your communications, embracing empathy and leveraging data, your RTO ask might actually energize and inspire your workers.

102,How to Strategically Preserve and Evolve Workplace Culture Amidst Change Management,"Dec 5, 2023",David Eaton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-preserve-and-evolve-workplace-culture-amidst-change/465952,"
Many organizations have become attuned to the need for formalized change management, which helps support enterprises facing inflection points, such as restructurings, mergers, divestitures and changes in ownership. Such companies often engage experts who redefine and redeploy organizational models and business processes to smooth the required transitions and maximize the value of significant strategic and/or tactical changes.Unfortunately, most practitioners don't usually consider workplace culture's impact on change management success. This fundamentally limits the work's potential as the cultural norms that pervade every workplace can significantly inhibit needed change management initiatives.Related: How to Better Manage Corporate Culture During Times of Transition



A change management primerChange management is built around the idea that people and organizations require help adapting to new approaches, models and technologies as required by triggering events. The field is based on our modern-day understanding that C-suites can't simply decide to make a significant adjustment and expect their employees to just follow along.To provide the help that organizations need, change management practitioners design systematic approaches for dealing with necessary transitions or transformations. They create formalized processes for planning, testing, communicating, scheduling and — ultimately — implementing the necessary changes. They also document the processes and evaluate their short-term effects.


While intended to be comprehensive, these approaches often bypass any assessments, analyses or planning tied to how changes underway might be perceived as threatening or run counter to existing workplace norms. Failure to bridge this gap can result in ineffective change management and, bigger picture, diminish morale and productivity, and drive turnover.What happens when change management neglects cultureAs an example, consider a behavioral health provider that has accepted investment from a private equity sponsor and is implementing a change management process to help drive the adjustments required to enhance the value of the organization. Like many mission-driven organizations, the provider is staffed by service-minded individuals whose first priorities revolve around providing care.Upon learning of the transformation underway, the team members begin to feel an immediate sense of unease. They've heard that private equity prioritizes profits over patients and see the advancing changes as validating their perceptions. They read memos full of business phrases that reinforce the feeling that the organization has embarked on a very different direction. Ongoing requests by change management consultants make it more challenging for them to meet the needs of their patients.Ultimately, the most experienced, respected team members decide the best thing to do is leave.Related: 3 Keys to Successful Change ManagementAvoiding cultural pitfalls in change managementAs an essential, early and repeated element of any change management effort, organizational leaders would be wise to first clarify the intentions behind the transformation — an indication of their cultural objectives. For the behavioral health provider, it could be that the infusion of capital will allow them to serve more patients as part of their mission-driven ethos. It could also be that the organization is evolving its mission, a potential challenge for its people that experts can help mitigate — for example, providing team members with alternative ways of ""living their values.""Such exercises should inform a cadence of professional communications to employees capturing leaders' thinking, making it relevant to individual employee groups. The goal is to bring team members along on the transformation journey, helping them embrace not just the changes but the potential accompanying cultural shifts.Maximizing communications by tapping into essential human needsGiven the vital importance of these communications, it's vital that leaders have a full grasp of not just the strategy behind them, but also the essential human needs that their people will experience as they internalize the change and process them within the workplace's cultural context. This will help inform the tone required in written communications and all near-term interactions.


Such needs include:Information: Details about the changes underway will allow people to process and personalize the transformation, considering how it might impact them. Such information should include leaders' insights on the ""why"" behind the changes underway as well as recommendations on how to work through them and what to do once the initiative is complete.Empathy: Imagining or trying to deeply understand what it's like to experience organizational change from the employee's perspective will help leaders grasp its inherent challenges and best overcome them. They would be wise to publicly acknowledge the difficulty of such changes even as they cast a vision for the future.Ideas: Throughout an organization's change management journey, leaders should provide employees with ideas for how to ""digest"" the change underway, helping them understand what is expected of them and when. This clarification will serve as guideposts for individuals and teams who might be feeling adrift.Time: Just as leaders took time to consider the change in question before they adopted it, people need time to wrestle, question, process and get aligned with the change being thrust upon them. Those who are given this room to ""catch up"" with leadership will be most responsive to change management.Related: 3 Key Steps to Becoming an Effective Change LeaderThe savviest organizations go a step beyond professional communications. They evaluate and map out the existing and potential future culture, designing and implementing work streams that facilitate a transition from one culture to another and ""pull"" new cultural elements through every facet of the company.When handled in this thoughtful, intentional manner, organizational cultures no longer impede but serve to accelerate change management and drive results across enterprises.

103,Uncovering the Hidden Benefits (and Dangers) of Remote Work in 2024,"Dec 5, 2023",Tom Medema,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/uncovering-the-silent-benefits-of-remote-work/465361,"
Imagine waking up on a Monday morning, sipping your coffee, and beginning your workday from the comfort of your home. This scenario — once considered a rare perk — has become a reality for millions of people in recent years. In fact, IPSE research revealed that the number of workers operating exclusively at home increased from 5.7% in January 2020 to 43.1% in April 2020.This shift and rapid normalization have prompted a global discussion on the future of work, the relevance of which is only growing larger with time. Resultantly, I see it as essential to explore the nuances of remote work, examining its benefits, challenges and overall effectiveness, which forms the basis for this article.Related: Remote Work Is Here to Stay: Are You Ready for the New Way of Life?



The rise of remote workThe rise of remote work has been extreme and, thus, should be covered before delving into the benefits, or lack thereof. Transforming into a sought-after option for many, the allure of remote work throughout recent years has lied in its flexibility, as it allows employees to work from any location with just a laptop and a stable internet connection — giving rise to the 'digital nomad,' as a remote work subsection.Painting the picture of ultimate efficiency in complete flexibility, I have always considered to what extent this holds true, as the lack of direct contact and isolated nature formulates issues that have begun to seep into this digital workplace. Nevertheless, Upwork estimates that 32.6 million Americans will be working remotely by 2025, and therefore, adapting to the future remote workforce trend is key, but we must first examine this method.


The pros of remote workA clear pro is the elimination of commute time, improving physical and mental health and paving the way for productive or leisure time within previously wasted hours of the day. This flexibility adapts to personal needs, creating a more harmonious balance between family and business.However, alongside personal benefits, the Global Workplace Analytics report fortifies the environmental advantage of remote work adoption, stating that 600,000 cars per year are resultantly off the road and that even working remotely half the week can reduce yearly emissions by 54 million tons.Further pros include reducing overhead costs for employers and the possibility of a hybrid model, combining office and remote. Microsoft's Work Trend Index views the widening of the talent marketplace arising from remote/hybrid work as ""one of the brightest sides"" of remote work.Talent is everywhere, and we appreciate this at Bubbles, with our team transcending geographical barriers, ranging from Costa Rica to Poland. We reap the rewards from this diversity with increasingly specialized personnel.


Related: Why Elon Musk and Other Tech Leaders Are Right to Ban Remote WorkUnlocking asynchronous workPeople are spending 252% more time in meetings than they were before the remote work transition, according to Microsoft's New Future of Work report. But there is great potential to improve productivity by reducing this time commitment while ensuring people do not miss anything important. Enter, asynchronous remote work and the ability to participate without full attendance.This improvement is complex. It has been aided by recent advances in large language models that have enabled this dream to become reality by extracting and preserving information to then follow up on asynchronously. I believe this falls into place with literature on cognitive science that gives us some strong hypotheses for how summarization tech and AI can work in tandem with the mental preferences of most workers. Such science suggests that people appreciate light, low cognitive load interactions in meetings to flag action items and then preserve and organize items in a hierarchical structure. This can now be achieved with an AI notetaker, which will join meetings, listen and formulate easily understandable focal points for asynchronous collaboration. This clearly benefits those within the meeting, but what are other pros of enabling asynchronous remote working?For one, employees are empowered to have full autonomy over their schedule and can communicate without being tied to a strict schedule. Asynchronous work also focuses on deliverables rather than time worked, going hand-in-hand with the former benefit and increasing accountability. While reducing interruptions and distractions, this also respects individuals' productive hours and encourages more thoughtful communication when outlining essential workflows.


Related: Why Remote Work Shouldn't Be Up for DebateThe cons of remote workRemote work is not without challenges. It can be difficult to separate work from free time, with difficulties in 'switching off' from work. Naturally, European or Asian colleagues of a US-based company may experience this due to time-zone conflict, but asynchronous work can help here.Separation also refers to loneliness and isolation that remote workers may experience. Without virtual team building and consistent remote collaboration, symptoms like poor decision-making and distraction can seep in. Gallup suggests that only 36% of employees are engaged in their workplace, so as a remote team manager, the maintenance of clear, consistent communication is key.So, while my company, Bubbles, encourages remote working extensively, we recognize the cons and know that balance is crucial. A well-designed home office and clear work-life boundaries are instrumental in a successful remote working experience.


Overall, we see the future of work clearly, and I believe remote, asynchronous work offers diverse opportunities and challenges, but alongside, we see it as a space to tread carefully within, as the retention of strong personal relations and empathy within a team is critical. I would therefore advise adopting enthusiastically but navigating with adaptability.

104,I've Spent Decades Studying How Mentors Make You Successful. Here's How You Find the Right Ones.,"Dec 4, 2023",Wendy Murphy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/an-expert-explains-why-you-need-a-personal-board-of-advisors/464630,"
By the early 2000s, working for a single company for your entire career was rare. The new normal was fluid. Employees became more likely to move between organizations, or even switch industries entirely. Job mobility offers flexibility, but it also leaves many of us feeling overwhelmed and looking for guidance.How can we best draw on others' support as we forge our own careers? I'm a professor of management at Babson College who has spent decades studying how mentors boost individual development and organizational success. After teaching thousands of students and executives, there's one piece of advice I give everyone:You need to build a personal board of advisors to help guide your career.



A personal board of advisors is a small part of your overall network: It's a group of people invested in your success who you can turn to for advice and support. Here are five of the most important things to know about building your board of mentors.Related: What You Need to Know About Building a Small Business Advisory Board (and Why You Need One)


Quality is more important than quantityA personal board of advisors falls between the solo guru you turn to for every question, and your 500-plus LinkedIn connections. It's a smaller network of people who care and provide support for you throughout your career, including peers and role models. This network changes over time to reflect what you need at different career stages, as you will rely on them for everything from providing practical advice to advocating on your behalf.An extensive contact list does not translate to a better network. Prioritize high-quality connections over high-quantity networks. Try making a list of how many people you actually discuss your career with. You'll notice it's smaller than you may have thought.Here are the three characteristics to look for in a high-quality relationship:Positive intent — You and your mentor are both entering with good intentions and assume the best of each other.Mutuality — You're both present and engaged when you're speaking. You have a genuine connection and aren't just trying to get something out of each other.Vitality — You leave the conversation feeling energized rather than drained.Don't put all your eggs in one basketEveryone benefits from mentoring relationships. My research shows that mentees are happier, more satisfied in their careers, get promoted faster and learn new skills. Mentors get many of the same benefits, plus loyalty among their team and a reputation for supporting others.


However, a common mistake people make when seeking mentorship (and that companies make when setting up mentorship programs) is relying on one person. More than 92% of Fortune 500 companies have mentoring programs in place. But many of these are 1:1 models, where an employee is matched with a single mentor. That's a lot of pressure on a single relationship and whether you hit it off.More importantly, you need multiple perspectives on your personal board of advisors. Sometimes, you need support from within your organization. Other times, you need an external eye. Sometimes, you want a person who shares your existing interests. Other times, you want someone who shares new interests you're looking to explore.Related: 8 Steps to Creating an Effective Advisory BoardPeople are more willing to help than you thinkReaching out can feel daunting. Everyone's busy, and it can feel like you're asking a lot. But research on reciprocity shows that when someone asks for help, our immediate instinct is to offer it. People are flattered to be asked for their advice and mentorship. That doesn't mean you'll always get a ""yes,"" but it should make you feel more confident asking.


When you reach out or first meet a mentor, think through how you present your story. This is an introduction, not a sales pitch for why this person should mentor. Be honest; if you're editing your story to strengthen a relationship with a mentor, it might be a sign to seek someone else.Take advantage of the moment when you're new at an organization to reach out to people. There's never an expiration date on seeking mentorship. But the first few months of a new job offer a natural alignment: It's when you most need support and when other people are most inclined to give it.Your peers are some of your best mentorsThe most underrecognized and underutilized mentors are your peers. As you progress through the ranks into more senior positions, the pool of available mentors above you shrinks. By the time you get to CEOs, who don't have a boss, peers are the main option to receive mentorship.Adding peers to your personal board of advisors is helpful at every career stage. A lot of peer mentorship is informal and spontaneous. Structure, however, can also be helpful. Set up a recurring time to meet, whether it's once a week or once a year. And, as with other mentors, it's best to have a diverse group of people with different perspectives.


Peer mentoring allows us to grow through the advice we receive as mentees, but also as the mentor who's offering said advice.Related: Randi Zuckerberg: Don't Search for That 'Pie-in-the-Sky Mentor'It's on you to develop your personal board of advisorsWith the shift toward greater job mobility, companies stopped taking responsibility for cultivating employees' entire career trajectories. The formal mentoring programs large companies have in place are aimed at developing employees in their role within the organization, not looking out for your career as a whole. You now need to be intentional about building your own career networks. No one will do it for you.Many executives I work with feel lonely in their professional journey. Oftentimes, the only person they'll discuss their career with is their spouse or partner. They come to understand that they haven't paid enough attention to their own growth and development.


Even as an expert who teaches about building networks, I sometimes forget to focus on my own. But I remind myself that creating and maintaining quality relationships with multiple mentors is good for me, good for my advisors and good for my employer.It's a win-win-win worth investing in.

105,4 Ways to Maintain Company Culture in the Age of Constant Change,"Dec 1, 2023",Julian Hamood,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-ways-to-maintain-culture-among-constant-change/465216,"
We are living in a golden age of innovation. Every year, new technologies are introduced that completely alter the industries we operate within. Changes that come at rapid speed can potentially lead to chaos and confusion — sparking internal conflict within teams trying to navigate these shifting tides. It's up to us as leaders to create a precedent with how we respond to these changes to set the right tone within our organization.A healthy work culture starts from the top. Leaders who adapt to industry changes and steer the company forward during these uncertain times can empower their employees with the confidence that all systems and processes are in order. To model that desired behavior from your team members, you must establish the proper protocols for implementing change in the company to reinforce the idea that the organization is thriving amidst this evolving technology.Related: What Makes a Great Company Culture (and Why It Matters)



1. Transparent communication among teams before implementing changesThe age of change will inevitably create new technologies that your organization will eventually aim to benefit from. However, leadership and planning teams must strengthen communication channels to keep all affected departments in the loop. During the ideation phase, the ability to properly communicate to all stakeholders and affected parties on what changes and processes are soon to come, as well as the proper timeline of implementation, reduces anxiety around these changes and helps employees feel like they are a part of the change as opposed to looking from the outside in. Proper communication allows your organization adequate time to prepare and adapt its workflows.2. Leveraging expertise before committingI've been in IT for 12 years, and I'm all too familiar with the anxiety of implementing a new platform. You can't rely on what these companies say about their products, as they will only cherry-pick their successes. It is important to find people who've used the platform and who don't have a hidden agenda. Often, the platform's most trustworthy and honest reviews are from those who had a middle-of-the-road experience with the product.


This process applies to any new technology you implement into your business. While it's tempting to jump on the hype train of any new software or hardware system that's making the waves, be sure to do your due diligence before investing thousands of dollars in implementing a platform that potentially comes with its own set of problems. There is no free lunch when it comes to new technology. New systems require learning curves, troubleshooting, and trial-and-error before they can serve to increase productivity and workflows. That said, you can accelerate the breaking-in process by finding your own references and getting into the meat and potatoes of what the new technology entails.Related: 10 Excellent Company Culture Examples For Inspiration3. Invest in ongoing training for employeesAs your business evolves and begins implementing new systems, it's important that you leave no employee behind. Ongoing training will help cultivate trust because team members gain confidence that they'll have technical expertise in their role. Additionally, as you nurture employees to increase their skills through these training programs, you are also investing in the future of your company.Training programs can identify and cultivate potential leaders within the organization, thus preparing employees for upper management roles and succession planning. There will come a day when an essential member of your team decides to move on to something else. However, if you're constantly building the skills of your employees, you can more easily transition a promising team member into a leadership role and thereby maintain stability within the organization.


Training also fosters a culture of innovation. Passionate employees who get exposed to new ideas and different methods are more likely to think outside of the box and creatively contribute to improving your organization by introducing new products, services and solutions. This also inspires colleagues to seek the best out of each other and creates a standard of excellence within a foundation of ongoing support.Related: The 8 Essential Steps to Building a Winning Company Culture4. Following up on implemented changesLet's say you've input a new IT system and have been running the program for three months. You've done all the troubleshooting to work out the bugs, and your team has been brought up to speed. Now, ask yourself: is the system adequately addressing the pain points you attempted to solve?In an age of change, you must be reaping the benefits of the new systems you put into place. Following up on those changes is important if you expect a certain program to correct a specific issue you and your team have been dealing with for some time. If it's not, you have to figure out why and move forward. If it is, it's important to communicate the successes of the new platform to your team members so that when the time comes to implement another change, your staff is confident that these changes will benefit the whole company.


To sum up, it's ultimately up to you as a leader to establish the proper protocols and processes to allow your company to adapt to changes accordingly. While this is a golden age of innovation, it's up to you to determine whether your company glitters from that gold.

106,5 Ways to Instill a Company Culture Even When Your Workforce Is Virtual,"Nov 30, 2023",John Boitnott,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-ways-to-instill-a-company-culture-even-when-your/293628,"
Company culture is without a doubt one of the top job benefits for employees. Free snacks and good vacation time make a difference, but how you interact with your supervisors and the environment that results from that is what can keep an employee on board when pay raises and bonuses aren't a regular thing. But for the increasing number of professionals who don't work in an office post COVID-19, a positive culture can be difficult to achieve.Using the many tools now available, leaders can achieve company culture virtually. Here are a few ways you can create a winning culture for your remote teams.1. Consider your personalitiesMuch like onsite workers, your remote employees and contractors have varied personalities. You likely have extroverts, who crave regular interaction with others, and introverts, who could be just fine with going days without direct communication with another human being.



Get to know your workers one on one and determine the type of work environment that works best for each of them. Some introverts are perfectly fine with communicating with others using a chat tool, so that might be the best option for all of you. You can even take it a step further and create fun activities and in-person get-togethers that work best for the team as a whole.Related: Entrepreneurship For Introverts: The How-To


2. Honor your talentIf your workers are being creative as part of their daily duties, consider that their unique work styles might improve their daily output. Instead of berating your designer for choosing to work late into the night and sleeping until noon the next day, consider that it may be just a part of that person's process. As long as your team members meet their deadlines and are available for scheduled meetings, there shouldn't be an issue with the work hours they keep.Related: Keeping a Good Employee From Leaving Is Your Best Growth Strategy3. Make meetups funIf your teams are virtual, chances are you rarely meet face-to-face. Even though it comes with an expense, it's important to try to work in at least one group meeting each year. Consider scheduling a fun retreat where you can learn new skills or make up for enjoyable activities missed in the office each day.When the day's meetings are over, plan a night out at a local restaurant or recreational attraction. You'll likely find those excursions lead to far better teambuilding than you could ever achieve in a conference room.


Related: In a Polarized World, How Can Leaders Foster Unity Without Losing Their Identity?4. Encourage playYou don't have to be in the same office to socialize. If you have a small team, encourage members to get to know each other by providing the tools necessary to do so. If you regularly host video chats, you'll quickly find employees initiate those calls on their own.For larger teams, consider separating workers into groups. If certain employees live within close proximity to others, schedule regional gatherings or encourage them to meet up on their own occasionally. You can also pair workers by interests and help them get to know each other through a Secret Santa exercise in December or by pairing them on a special project. You'll likely find they develop a bond that extends beyond that one experience.Related: Everyone Should Be Thinking Remote-First — Here's 3 Reasons Why.


5. Reinforce your missionFor remote teams, it can be even more difficult to remain constantly focused on the goal. You must be clear on your company's mission and communicate that with every salaried and contracted worker. You should also regularly reinforce your company's mission. The words likely won't have as much meaning if you don't walk the walk.Demonstrate how your work impacts the customers you serve. Share videos and images through your company's internal communication tools or collaboration software that demonstrate the hard work that's being done in your office and in the field. If you have testimonials from customers about how your business has changed their lives, this can be especially powerful. It will help your remote teams stay focused on what's important.Related: The Future Is Not Just Flexible — It's United.Culture is achievable remotelyCompany culture isn't necessarily dependent upon a physical workspace. It's especially important for virtual teams to find a way to instill that culture in other ways, such as through video chats and online collaboration. Employers have to create opportunities for salaried and contracted employees to get to know each other when they're remote, since they won't have the benefits of daily face-to-face interaction. Despite that extra effort, many entrepreneurs say hiring remote is still worth it, since it often brings greater flexibility, cheaper talent and varied perspectives.

107,"How to Put the ""Fun"" Back into Your Business Fundamentals","Nov 29, 2023",James Goodnow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-put-the-fun-back-in-business-fundamentals/465310,"
We are living and working in an era with the greatest rate of change since the Industrial Revolution, where businesses strive for increased agility, tighter efficiencies and heightened engagement. In the effort to survive in a hypercompetitive environment, the concept of ""fun"" in the workplace is often reduced to a whimsical whisper in the quest for productivity, growth and revenue. When properly integrated into an organization's culture, however, ""fun"" can be a catalyst for motivation, profitability and sustained success, and its benefits extend far beyond office walls or computer screens.Now, let's not get tangled in semantics. By ""fun,"" I'm not suggesting installing a giant slide or an adult-sized ball pit in your lobby. I'm referring to a culture that allows for levity, encourages genuine connections, promotes creativity and instills a sense of happiness in work — a culture of fun that promotes building strong bonds and community among coworkers.Related: How to Create a Workplace Culture Where Everyone Feels Like They Belong



The lost ingredient in the virtual worldThe need for fun has taken on new significance in a remote world. First, let me say that I'm a proponent of flexible working. I've seen firsthand how a thoughtful and balanced remote-working policy improves recruiting, retention, and productivity. Although compelling business arguments exist for working remotely, sitting on Zoom for hours likely doesn't meet anyone's definition of fun.What was fun about the days when everyone was in the office? For many, it was those spontaneous moments of laughter, the energy of group discussions in a room where ideas bounced around like charged particles, and the serendipitous brainstorming that happens over a coffee break. These moments, although fleeting, served as emotional anchors. They cultivated team spirit, nurtured interpersonal relationships and contributed to job satisfaction. Today, in a world where work interactions are often limited to structured virtual meetings, the organic evolution of ideas and these crucial moments of connection have become incredibly scarce.


Related: The Surprising Benefits of Having Fun at WorkThe new importance of old valuesSo there's no confusion: I'm not advocating for a mass five-day-a-week, return-to-office policy. Many businesses are pursuing this approach, and I think it's a mistake. In my opinion, those businesses and firms will pay a steep price for being out of touch with the world and what many employees seek. However, companies that embrace flexible working don't automatically score 100% in the fun department. They will have to get more creative, dedicating time and energy to keep employees fulfilled and happy over the long run. If they do, my thesis, informed by my experience and those of leading organizations worldwide, is that businesses can have their proverbial cake and eat it, too.So, how can companies weave fun into their increasingly digital tapestry?1. Invest in fun-first in-person eventsIn a remote-first world, whenever possible, businesses need to invest in and support in-person events to encourage community and connection. Remote working saves businesses a lot of money — reduced office space, lower utilities, fewer lunches, office supplies, parking expenses and more. Companies must redeploy some of this capital and invest it in gatherings, retreats and social events. These get-togethers should be fun-focused and have one goal: to provide an environment where employees can truly get to know one another beyond their professional personas.


What do these events look like in practice? I work at Fennemore, a large law firm with 17 offices around the U.S. At our firm retreat earlier this year; we hosted a ""Back to the Future"" themed get-together — complete with 80s party costumes and a DeLorean that looked as though it was straight off of the set of the original movie. Lawyers may be stereotypically uptight, but our employees stretched their creativity, took some risks, and had a blast.During the event, we hosted an on-theme ""hackathon,"" where everyone participated in brainstorming ways to improve training in remote settings. Our thinking was that if we provided a cash prize of $5,000 for the winning idea, employees would have fun, feel supported, and help us improve their remote-work training experience in the process. It was tremendously successful, and we ended up incorporating many of our employees' ideas.Related: 5 Strategies to Build a Fun Work Culture That's Also Productive2. Reinvent onsite meetingsI know that not every meeting can be fun-focused; the work must be done. So when teams do gather to work in person, make it count. Beyond the presentations and reviews, incorporate team-building exercises, workshops, or even a simple walking meeting outdoors to break up what can seem like monotonous spreadsheets or lectures.


The best meetings allow for plenty of dynamic interaction. We recently hosted an onsite leadership training program called ""Fennemore University."" Rather than putting people in a room to listen to presenter after presenter, we created an interactive format intended to encourage conversation and connection. After a brief, no-frills training session, we separated participants into groups, empowered them to wrestle with concepts, and asked them to present their findings. Instead of listening for hours to various presenters, our employees collaborated, built bonds and had fun with people they normally see in a virtual box.Related: The Underrated Value of Fun in the Workplace3. Gamify the mundaneNot every task or goal necessitates teamwork or meetings. What then? Is there a way that people can build bonds when doing document review, data entry or simply getting their work done? Yes. Convert routine tasks or targets into engaging challenges or competitions. Leaderboards, badges, quests, or even simple shout-outs can transform a mundane task into a challenge—driving engagement and a sense of accomplishment.All-hands meetings can be informative, but sharing so much strategic information can be long and, I'll say it, boring. At Fennemore, we transformed our all-hands December Meeting into a game show. I kid you not — we opened up with a game of Plinko (with cash prizes!) to break the ice and garner excitement for what was to come. We then went through the agenda with Bob Barker-inspired enthusiasm, encouraging colleagues to share important updates in a lively format. We sprinkled these updates with submitted dance videos from colleagues across our firm, creating a safe space for colleagues to connect, laugh, and enjoy one another's dance moves, or lack thereof. By embracing contestant mindsets, showing off our inner rockstars, and cheering each other on, this all-hands December Meeting served a dual purpose: informing staff about our strategic next steps and fostering camaraderie.

108,4 Ways to Bring Your Team Back From the Brink of Innovation Extinction,"Nov 28, 2023",Duncan Wardle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-playful-tactics-to-prevent-your-teams-creative-decline/464230,"
Entrepreneurs often assume that the biggest barrier to developing great ideas is a shortage of time or resources — but that's not true. It's the lack of playfulness in their innovation processes.According to recent reporting by Fundera, more than 70% of business owners work more than 40 hours per week, and almost 20% work more than 60 hours per week. Yet, they still lack creative solutions to their problems. As someone who spent years as the head of innovation and creativity at Disney, I can tell you exactly why: They're not leveraging the natural way the brain comes up with ""Eureka!"" moments.Let me put this a different way. When do you get your best, brightest, most out-of-the-box ideas? While you're in the shower, walking your dog, working out, commuting, falling asleep or waking up? Then you're like most humans on the planet. But I can guarantee you didn't say, ""While I'm at work, of course.""



Even though we're paid to have big ideas at work, we never have them there. Work is too chaotic and distracting. Our brains focus on emails, presentations and reports. But the second we step away from our occupational lives, we move from what I call a ""busy beta"" state of mind to an alpha one. In busy beta, the door between the conscious and subconscious brain is firmly closed. In alpha, that door is flung wide open.How, then, do you get your employees to move toward an alpha state of mind on demand when you're eager to come up with new concepts for the company? Follow these steps.

Start tackling challenges before you need answersDo not brief a challenge to your employees on the same day you need them to create and deploy a solution. Give at least a week for everyone to ideate, and then bring them together to talk about their thoughts.This is the opposite of what usually happens in the workplace, typically called a brainstorming session. Unfortunately, brainstorming rarely produces anything innovative because it's too tied to the work atmosphere. People need stimuli unrelated to work (e.g., walking their dog, testing a cheesecake recipe, playing an instrument) to gain unfettered access to their unconscious brains.Remember: It's too late if you wait until the house is burning to think of a fire prevention plan. You need to start planning in advance so everyone can allow their wild, fantastic notions to surface. That way, you can tap into the power of alpha waves, which are essential for any kind of relaxed, creative process, per Microsoft research.


2. Write down all the rules that are part of your problemI've designed a two-step innovation tool called ""What If?"" that tears down plenty of the roadblocks to creativity and gives people better access to their imaginations. The first step to ""What If?"" involves writing down all the rules that are holding you or your team back.For instance, consider Walt Disney's dilemma when he wanted to release his film Fantasia. He was frustrated because he couldn't pump mist or heat into theaters. Why? Theaters wouldn't let him. Accordingly, he wrote down all the rules of going to a movie theater: I must sit. I must be quiet. I must pay to get in. I can expect it to be dark. I can't control the environment.By writing these rules down, Disney could more clearly see everything that was getting in his way. This allowed him to move on to the second step of ""What If?"" — which I outline below.Related: Have a Great New Idea? Here's How to Know If Your Brainstorm Will Become a Breakthrough


3. Break one of the rules you listedThis is the fun, absurd, provocative part that allows the creative rubber to meet the road. Look at the list of rules you generated. Choose one and come up with audacious ways to break it. In Disney's case, it was to worry less about controlling the movie theater environment by taking his movies out of the theater. He considered having people dress in costumes in different themed lands so he could control the story and engage the audience. Enter the concept for Disneyland.The founders of Netflix used this practice as well. They were fed up with the rules and limits of consumer video rentals. They didn't want consumers to have to drive to the store during business hours, choose a limited number of videos from a limited stock, drive back home and return everything within a few days or pay a late fee. The rule Netflix chose to break was having a physical store. Inspired by the internet, the company's leaders made it possible for customers to order movies online. Later, Netflix took the concept a step further by becoming a streaming platform.The good part about this exercise is that you don't need the resources of Disney or Netflix to do it. You just need to remain open-minded.4. Take nothing off the tableTo be sure, some of the responses you'll get when you go through the rule-breaking experience will seem strange and perhaps even shocking. Dig around for the truth, though. It's often buried deep within off-the-wall suggestions.


In the 1960s, a small company in Great Britain that made drinking glasses had a big issue. The company needed more production and less rampant product breakage. To figure out what was happening, the leadership team observed the packing operations. They found that the employees systematically packed 12 glasses in two layers in one cardboard box. Separating the glasses were newspapers. And guess what? The workers were spending a lot of time reading the newspapers and not concentrating on the quality of their work.Related: 5 Steps to Creatively Solving Business ProblemsThe unspoken ""rule,"" therefore, was that everyone was diving into the newspaper first and their jobs second. To break this rule, someone suggested that the employees shouldn't be able to see anything. If they couldn't see, they couldn't read the paper. It was a horrible idea until someone else used it as a springboard: Why didn't the company hire visually impaired individuals? Aha. The company moved forward, upping its production, lowering prices and receiving a salary subsidy for hiring people with disabilities.The point is that you can't keep trying to innovate the same way you've always done. It's just not going to work, and you'll waste even more precious time. Instead, infuse a sense of playfulness into your innovation practices. Write some rules. Pose some ""What If?"" questions. Then, break the status quo. The moment you take these steps, you'll start seeing more imagination from your team and less resistance to change.
