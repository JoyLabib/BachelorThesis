Responses have been edited and condensed for clarity.Image Credit: Courtesy of CCRSP INC. Dr. Amareen Dhaliwal. How were you introduced to EdTech, and what inspired you to start your side hustle in that space?When I had the opportunity to tutor STEM classes in college, I quickly realized teaching was my passion. I excelled on the newly formatted MCAT and decided I wanted to help students achieve higher scores (one of my students even reached the 99th percentile!). A college friend suggested I create a pre-med club focused on innovative learning experiences, which sparked my interest in curriculum development and the use of learning management systems supported by professionals in medical and scientific fields. The idea to build a website and offer tutoring services emerged after I hosted a successful MCAT seminar, and my commitment to tutoring in college laid the foundation for my future endeavors.



My tutoring venture expanded into a holistic coaching experience, which focused on the psychology of studying, anxiety management and wellness, including the utilization of 24-hour planners, exercise and nutrition. This comprehensive approach led me to pursue a psychiatry residency. Despite not initially seeing myself as a business person, the need for innovation in MCAT preparation drove me to entrepreneurship.Related: Best New Shows for Entrepreneurs (Streaming Free)


After collaborating with peers in clinical trials, we launched online clinical research courses, aiming for excellence and continuous improvement. This endeavor was more than a business; it was about making a meaningful impact and addressing broader needs. CCRPS INC was founded to address the underemployment of foreign medical graduates and healthcare professionals in the U.S. despite their impressive credentials. Together with colleagues in clinical trials, we aimed to provide educational courses to help these individuals secure entry-level positions that offer both competitive salaries and a sense of purpose. We established a strong online presence, developed expert-led courses and focused on education and career preparation. Our commitment to quality content quickly earned us recognition and trust, positioning CCRPS as a leader in the field.What were some of the first steps you took to get CCRPS off the ground?First, we identified our niche by recognizing a gap for non-clinical medical professionals seeking valuable career paths. We built a user-friendly website and formed partnerships with providers, building trust by seeking out video and audio reviews from graduate students to help other students have a better idea of our comprehensive and in-depth educational approach. We collaborated with experts to create high-quality course materials and secured the necessary accreditations to establish credibility. We also offered comprehensive career support and focused on quality education, which spurred organic growth through referrals and a robust online presence.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building the side hustle, and how did you navigate them?Building and growing a startup requires constant ""figuring out"" of challenges. The biggest challenge was meeting and surpassing our clients' needs so they could continue to grow. Additionally, delegating to the right people requires trial and error; you can't expect to get it right from day one! The key to overcoming these challenges is learning to be okay with the ups and downs, being the rock when changes don't go as planned and consistently providing excellent services.Related: This Insurance Agent Started a Side Hustle Inspired By Nostalgia for His Home State — Now It Earns Nearly $40,000 a Month


How long did it take you to see consistent revenue from your work within EdTech?From the outset, our business achieved net profitability, a testament to our compelling curriculum. Starting with one in-person student whose enrollment funded our initial website and SEO efforts, we adopted a strategy that allowed us to reinvest early profits into expanding our operations. This approach was essential in both our foundational stages and as we scaled, particularly with the MCAT company.Despite promising early enrollments, our focus has always been on student success and quality education rather than merely generating revenue. This commitment enabled us to reduce prices over time, making education more accessible and aligning with our belief in the importance of affordable education. Engaging students meaningfully requires commitment, evidenced by our successful partnerships with contract research organizations and our lean yet effective operational model.How do you balance your entrepreneurial pursuits with a demanding career in medicine?Following a year-long hiatus to launch CCRPS, I transitioned back into my residency. Today, brilliant clinical research professionals and a solid team manage the day-to-day operations and business aspects, ensuring student success remains a priority at CCRPS while I fully immerse myself and focus on my residency.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.


What do you enjoy most about running your own business?I appreciate the profound influence I can have on students' success and career advancement. Witnessing their growth, seeing their achievements and knowing that we play a pivotal role in shaping their futures is incredibly rewarding and reaffirms my passion for education entrepreneurship every day. With over 22,000 student members from more than 1,200 organizations, including six government agencies and 308 universities, the reach and influence of CCRPS are evident. A 2024 LinkedIn review of graduates highlighted remarkable outcomes, with placements in over 1,600 companies and 23% achieving managerial roles or higher. Furthermore, the initiative has significantly contributed to developing the clinical research workforce for various contract research organizations. This progress, driven by a team of exceptional clinical research educators, underscores the collective effort and dedication to advancing clinical trials and healthcare.What's your advice for others hoping to start successful businesses?Learning how to harness and delegate our strengths effectively is crucial. Sometimes, guidance from those who've walked the path before us can be a game-changer; seeking expert mentorship in areas we find challenging can make all the difference.Start small and focus on what matters: In a world brimming with startups, it's vital to remember that at the heart of every idea and venture are the people we aim to help. They are our priority, always. Let's embrace our unique talents, lean into learning and always put people first.This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

2,Bantam Bagels' Founder Fell Into a Mindset Trap 'People Don't Talk About' After Selling the Now-Defunct Business for $34 Million — Here's What Happened,"Apr 12, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-happened-to-bantam-bagels-founder-reveals-her-struggle/472502,"
In 2013, Elyse Oleksak, co-founder of Bantam Bagels, got a call from her husband Nick about a bite-sized snack that would set some big plans in motion. ""Mini bagels stuffed with cream cheese,"" Oleksak recalls him saying in her recently released memoir A Shark Ate My Bagel: How We Built Bantam Bagels. ""Sort of like doughnut holes, but bagels."" Oleksak had heard plenty of ambitious ideas from her entrepreneurially-minded husband in the past, but tiny stuffed bagels were one she could get behind. The duo met at a grocery store after work to start experimenting.Image Credit: Courtesy of Elyse OleksakIt was the beginning of Bantam Bagels' near-decade-long journey, one that cycled through ""success followed by failure"" and ""elation followed by panic,"" Oleksak tells Entrepreneur exclusively.



The business made a splash on Shark Tank, where the Oleksaks struck a $275,000 deal for 11% equity with Lori Greiner (hence the title of Oleksak's book) in 2014. In the next several years, it saw sales hit $45 million as it expanded the product line to include mini stuffed pancakes and egg bites, landed in 10,000 stores and 8,500 Starbucks and was ultimately acquired by the Ohio-based T. Marzetti Company for $34 million in 2018 before ceasing operations in 2022.Related: All 7 'Shark Tank' Stars Share Tips on How to Become a Millionaire


""We were going to die in the wake of our own success if we didn't do something about it soon.""Like many entrepreneurs who find themselves at the helm of a fast-growing business, the Oleksaks had an ""aha moment"" when they realized their cash-versus-growth dilemma. ""We got to a point where even though this was our baby and it was something that we had owned at near 100% for so long, we were going to die in the wake of our own success if we didn't do something about it soon,"" Oleksak says. So the Oleksaks sold to T. Marzetti. It felt like a perfect match, Oleksak recalls, and the couple stayed on in marketing and product development capacities.However, getting used to her new relationship with the company wasn't easy, Oleksak admits. It's a struggle that didn't make it into the book, she says, but an important one nevertheless. According to Oleksak, with all of the focus on success stories and flashy sales, there's an all-too-common experience that gets lost in the narrative because ""people don't talk about"" it: How do you cope when all of your hard work pays off and your dream finally comes true?""Every single ounce and fiber of our being was dedicated to the survival and growth of this company [for years],"" Oleksak explains, ""so when you operate in this fight or flight mode for so long, it just becomes who you are."" Simultaneously chasing success and steeling for calamity takes a serious mental toll, Oleksak says, and when there were no more fires to put out, her brain began ""inventing disasters"" that didn't exist and therefore had no concrete solutions — a never-ending ""spiral.""


Related: 4 Ways Highly Successful People Handle Tough Times and Get Back on Track""When we were left feeling safe and at peace, I almost didn't know what to do with that safety and peace.""""We found loving arms for our explosive child,"" Oleksak says. ""We did it. But every single sense of self and success [had been] wrapped in this swirl of panic at all times, so when we were left feeling safe and at peace, I almost didn't know what to do with that safety and peace. Your brain almost doesn't know what to do when it stops. I personally went through an extreme breakdown."" Oleksak likens the experience to those of professional athletes who have to redefine themselves after a career in sports.Seeing your biggest dream become a reality can be amazing, but you have to prepare your brain for a complete mindset shift and pick up the appropriate tools to navigate that, according to Oleksak. The entrepreneur is a huge proponent of therapy and credits it with helping her recalibrate what it takes to get from one day to the next without considering chaos a foregone conclusion. ""I worked through a lot to find mental peace and stability and be able to be present again in the moment,"" she says.


Unfortunately, just a couple of years after T. Marzetti acquired Bantam Bagels, the pandemic put pressure on the supply chain, making it a challenge to stock the same variety of products as retailers streamlined processes wherever possible. By that point, Oleksak says she and her husband had given up a lot of decision-making authority and weren't involved in the conversations that ultimately led T. Marzetti to stop production of the brand. Still, Oleksak — and the nearly 1,500 people who signed a petition in support of Bantam Bagels' return — would love to see the products make a comeback one day.Related: 5 Ways to Protect Your Mental HealthAs Oleksak reflected on her entrepreneurial journey ""full of ups and downs,"" she kept coming back to all of the connections she'd made along the way — from every customer who purchased a Bantam Bagel to the manufacturers who took a chance on the product, celebrity endorsers including Oprah, Sarah Jessica Parker and Whoopi Goldberg, and so many more — and wanted to give back with a behind-the-scenes look at lessons learned over the years. So Oleksak put pen to paper and drafted A Shark Ate My Bagel, then opted to self-publish it ""the entrepreneurial way,"" with a marketing plan that included her own website and an Amazon push.""Thank God I organized all those lessons because, man, did I make a lot of mistakes,"" Oleksak laughs. These days, she's approaching the publication of her book as she would the launch of a ""mini business"" and says she's putting most of her energy into that right now. But she also looks forward to working with small businesses in the future, helping them avoid the mistakes she made and secure wins of their own.

3,4 Common Mistakes That Will Spell Doom Your Ecommerce Business,"Apr 11, 2024",Martins Lasmanis,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-common-mistakes-that-will-spell-doom-your-ecommerce/470805,"
Today, you'll be hard-pressed to find someone who hasn't — at the very least — played with the idea of launching an ecommerce business. The U.S. is the global leader with an estimated 14 million ecommerce sites, and that number will only keep going up as selling online continues to gain traction among everyone from established brick-and-mortar businesses to individuals taking their first entrepreneurial steps.While, yes, setting up an ecommerce store is easier than ever before, unfortunately, getting sales and succeeding is as difficult as it ever was. Perhaps even more, given the growing competition. As the CEO of an on-demand consumer goods platform, I have a front-row seat to the trials and triumphs of today's digital businesses. I've witnessed first-time entrepreneurs attain life-changing success, and I've seen great ideas fizzle out due to poor execution and everything in between.What I've noticed is that people succeed in many different ways, but they often fail in the same ones. It's hard to spot a success story before it happens, yet it's easy to tell if a business will struggle. With that in mind, here are the four most common mistakes people make that you should avoid when starting an ecommerce business.



Related: Business Owners: Are You Making These 10 Mistakes?Succumbing to perfection paralysisSome great products have never seen the light of day just because the business owner couldn't find the perfect button color for their website. This sounds ridiculous – until it's you who's in that position, losing countless hours sweating the small stuff trying to make everything perfect.


Perfectionism is a common vice among first-time entrepreneurs in particular, as they have no grasp of what constitutes ""good enough."" People go to great lengths to imitate the industry's best examples while forgetting that the bigger companies often have entire teams of developers, designers and copywriters doing what the entrepreneur is trying to manage alone. ""Doing things right"" is simply unrealistic.Instead, it may be wise to take a page out of a product developer's book and focus on an MVP – a minimum viable product. The idea behind an MVP is that you do the minimum required to get a functional product or, in our case, a store. And then, once it's up and running, you can iterate, improve and polish it to your heart's content. This will help overcome perfection paralysis and focus on what really moves the needle.Selling to everyoneSpeaking of moving needles, building a brand without understanding your customer is like navigating without a compass. Sure, you may be moving, but in what direction? What challenges will you encounter? Should you have brought hiking boots or a boat?The ABCs of entrepreneurship will tell you that for your business to be successful, it must answer a real need. But it falls on your shoulders to identify who exactly has that need. More often than not, it's a small subsection of people. (And if it's not – that's a red flag signaling you might be biting off more than you can chew.)


This audience will have unique characteristics, including demographics, preferences, pain points and more. Successful businesses leverage these factors to craft tailored messages, to choose the best advertising platforms and to further develop their offering. Conversely, unsuccessful companies aren't aware of who these high-potential customers are and instead opt for blanket messaging that's aimed at everyone and no one in particular.Experience shows that a laser-focused approach beats a broad net every time.Related: I Accidentally Became a Successful Entrepreneur. Here Are 5 Mistakes I Learned to Avoid When Starting a BusinessRefusing to adapt or admit mistakesFailure is an inevitable part of early entrepreneurship. Unfortunately, it is also at this early stage that people are most idealistic. They have resolute expectations of how everything will work, and they become tunnel-visioned on bringing this specific idea to life rather than building a successful business.


As you might expect, this initial vision is usually misguided. Do you want to stand out with a super distinct brand voice? There is a reason why nobody else is doing it. Do you want to bring a product to a new audience? There is a reason why this audience hasn't been interested in that product.The hallmark of a high-potential business is the ability to recognize when their idea doesn't work and pivot toward an alternative. Yes, it's hard to kill your darlings, but unless you do, you'll find yourself banging your head against the wall, bleeding resources on a failed concept.Note that this isn't only about your business idea but all your business activities, including design, marketing, product, etc. If something doesn't work, adapt.Trying to juggle everything aloneTo go from idea to first sale requires a wide variety of skills, meaning solo entrepreneurs must wear many hats. They need to be designers, copywriters, website developers, user experience experts, accountants, partnership managers, and marketers—and all of this without even mentioning the product itself, which includes design, sourcing, logistics, photography and more.


Some people manage, and it's admirable. But you don't have to go at it alone.For example, I repeatedly see aspiring entrepreneurs get sucked into learning peripheral skills, e.g., graphic design, when, in reality, they need little more than a logo, which would cost $5 to get from a freelancer on a job site. Worse yet, people get burned out from the constant learning and abandon their business ideas just because they can't manage something that they could have paid someone else a few dollars to do.Sure, those who struggle through like to wear their adversity as a badge of honor. Taking pride in doing things the hard way is human nature. But it's not necessarily good business.

      Key Takeaways    



        Kerr saw the demand for enamel pins in the artist community and thought the sales could help fund his daughter's 529.
      


        Within a few days of launching his site, he had an order for 1,000 pins from someone he ""had no link to at all.""
      


        Now, Alchemy Merch offers additional products, sees nearly $2 million in annual sales and boasts partnerships with major brands.
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Alchemy Merch owner Greg Kerr, who was working as a musician when he started selling custom pins in 2015. Today, Alchemy Merch is a full-time business that creates custom products for companies including Apple, Nickelodeon, National Geographic, Nike and more, as well as independent artists looking for ways to monetize their artwork in new ways.Image Credit: Courtesy of Alchemy Merch. Greg Kerr.When did you start your side hustle, and what inspired it? I'd been running a literary-inspired apparel brand, Miles to go, and had begun making enamel pins as one of the products we offered back in 2015. Some friends began asking me for help to get them made because of how confusing overseas production can be. Around that time, my wife and I decided we'd try to have a baby, and on the day we found out we were pregnant (Father's Day in 2016), I bought a domain for Pin Game Strong. I saw there was a demand for help within the artist community, and I initially thought if we could put a few hundred dollars into our daughter's 529, it would be a win. The original intention was that we'd keep running the apparel brand and help people make enamel pins on the side. I quickly recognized that there was a huge gap in the market to offer retail-quality merchandise. Everything was focused on promotional products, and with my background in running a brand, I thought it was important to focus on products people would be proud to bring to market. There was a need to go beyond promotional and into fully custom.



Related: This Insurance Agent Started a Side Hustle Inspired By Nostalgia for His Home State — Now It Earns Nearly $40,000 a MonthWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I'd seen a post on an episode of the Adventures in Design podcast talking about how someone should help people make pins. At that point, I had made thousands of pins for myself but hadn't thought about offering it as a service. I offered to help anyone interested and got a quick response. Word of mouth spread, and I saw that people wanted a safe outlet for making pins. Knowing we had a child on the way was the catalyst to buy a domain and throw together some pricing. I was familiar with how promotional products companies price their products and decided I'd try to beat them. Once the site was up, things started happening quickly, and within a few days, I had an order for 1,000 enamel pins from someone I had no link to at all.Image Credit: Alchemy MerchWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?As things started moving quickly, I had a lot of struggles with my time and how to balance it with the brand that had been paying my family's bills for the past few years. We went from $0 to $1 million in sales in 18 months, and it was just me. I did all of it: managing the business, handling all orders, communicating with factories and all art. It was a lot to handle. We didn't spend a cent on advertising in the first two years. Word of mouth was spreading and keeping me as busy as I could handle. My first step was to get some help on handling art files so I could keep working on customer interactions. I wish I'd looked for help sooner, but when I finally did get the help, it freed me up to focus on sales more.

How much did the side hustle earn? Within six months, we'd surpassed the monthly revenue of the brand I'd been working on for eight years prior — and it kept growing. Once we saw how quickly it was moving, the secondary goal became to replace my wife's income by the time she'd have to decide whether to go back to work or not after our daughter was born. We hit that goal and kept on running upward.You've since turned the side hustle into a full-time business, Alchemy Merch. What's been key to that growth, and what does revenue look like now? We hit a point where I needed to let go of the previous business so I could focus all of my time on making products for others. We started as Pin Game Strong and kept on adding new products in: patches, acrylic keychains, washi tape, etc., and the name just felt too limiting. We'd built up solid name recognition but knew it was time to grow beyond pins. Growth has been challenging for the past few years. When Covid hit, we got knocked back twice. First, we had delays in factories returning to work that caused a lot of refunds for events lined up. Then in March, they returned, and the U.S. got hit with lockdowns. A lot of our business is driven by events. Artists sell at fairs, cons and other events, and corporations will [make items] for conferences or team events. Pre-Covid, we were up only, and since then, we've been working hard to really focus on tightening up what we do and how we do it to help stand out. Although we have had growth the past two years, it's not until this year that we are seeing the energy back in people to create again. We have been floating right under $2 million a year in sales for the past two years and are hoping to finally break past it and continue to grow.Related: Don't let your good idea go to waste.

Making not only products, but also full-on retail-ready merchandise can have a lot of obstacles for creators, and our goal is to remove those and help guide them. Working with other creative people all day is constantly inspiring. Our goal as a team is to collaborate and elevate a customer's project.


As you consider the business's future, what are you most excited about? I'm excited about expanding the types of products we offer and continuing to help creators. There is not a lot of direct competition in our field and at our size, so the chance of someone looking to acquire us is low. I hope to keep building a company that continues to provide for my family and our employees and keeps helping people.Related: She Used Her Kids' College Fund to Build a Side Hustle, But the Product Was 'Unsellable' — Here's How She Got Back on Track for $100 Million in SalesImage Credit: Alchemy MerchWhat's your advice for others hoping to start successful side hustles of their own?Although I didn't actively think about it at the time, Alchemy Merch is a marriage of all of my skill sets and hits on what I really want to be spending my time doing. It's tough running a business in the after-hours if you have a 9-5, but if you really want it, you need to put in the work. If you are thinking about starting a side hustle, really think about what you want to do and if there is a need for it or space in the market for you to improve upon what is out there. The market told me how badly Alchemy Merch was needed, and I responded. When it became clear that this had legs, I never looked back. I've been self-employed for the past 20 years, so it gave me some clarity to run with the momentum and recognize what we were doing had real value.

Stefan Gehrig's side hustle was doing well — and that became a dilemma.The Melbourne, Australia-based entrepreneur had started a gym bag brand called Knkg, also known as King Kong Apparel, in 2011. It began as a side hustle that scratched an entrepreneurial itch untouched by his academic day job, then grew into his full-time business. But by 2021, he'd hit a wall: To scale up, he needed resources that he didn't have.Meanwhile, in Miami, investor and former PayPal executive Keith Rabois had just helped found a startup called OpenStore, which acquires Shopify stores with growth potential. Gehrig heard about OpenStore, but wasn't interested in selling Knkg. Then, in 2023, the startup launched another offering called OpenStore Drive, which lets Shopify owners retain ownership while handing off operations to OpenStore. That interested Gehrig a lot more.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Danny Trejo, an insurance agent who started grow-at-home citrus business Via Citrus in 2020.Where did you find the inspiration for your side hustle? I started working on Via Citrus shortly after moving to New York City, inspired by the nostalgia for the citrus groves of Central Florida. I grew up on a large citrus nursery filled with the sights and scents of orange blooms — a vivid part of my childhood that I always cherished.



While I had always wanted to be part of the citrus nursery business, I wanted to contribute in a different way that not only brought value to the business but also meaning to myself. The distance from my roots, coupled with the longing for the familiar fragrance of orange blossoms, sparked the idea to share this piece of my home with others. It was then that I realized I could educate others on how to grow citrus trees — no matter where they were located — by opening an online store.Related: What to Watch - The Most Inspiring Shows for EntrepreneursImage Credit: Courtesy of Via CitrusWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground? What were some challenges? Starting out, I faced the daunting task of setting up an ecommerce platform. With no prior experience in websites, I had to start from scratch, learning the ins and outs of online retail, from design to development.


Simultaneously, I tackled the important step of defining our product line. Given the vast diversity of citrus varieties ranging from oranges, lemons, limes, tangerines and grapefruits, I had to make decisions about which to offer. This involved researching citrus growth habits and the unique selling points of each citrus type to curate a selection that would appeal to a broad audience.Equally important was determining the size of the plants Via Citrus was going to offer. This decision was a delicate balance. On one hand, offering plants that were too small could lead to customer disappointment, as they might not immediately appreciate the beauty or potential of their purchase. On the other hand, larger plants, while more visually appealing and closer to bearing fruit, would incur prohibitive shipping costs, making them less accessible to a wider audience. This required careful consideration of the growth stages of citrus plants, shipping logistics and customer expectations to select sizes that offered the best value for our customers and the business.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?


The first couple of months saw under $1,000 each thanks to family and friends who supported the launch of Via Citrus. However, it wasn't long before we were averaging about $7,000 per month in revenue, with May (Mother's Day) and December (Christmas) being our busiest.What does average monthly revenue look like now? We see $36,000 per month in sales. May and December continue to be our best sales months.What do you enjoy most about this side hustle? It keeps me in touch with my roots — pun intended — by working on this project with my dad. Growing up surrounded citrus, where my dad dedicated over 40 years of his life, has deeply influenced my appreciation for the cultivation and care of citrus. Now as the person behind Via Citrus, I am able to maintain and strengthen this bond despite being six hours away from the farm. Via Citrus serves as a vital link to my father and the work he continues to do. He's not just the grower — he's out there selecting and packaging each citrus plant we send out to our customers. This hands-on approach from him ensures that every plant we deliver carries a piece of our family's dedication and love for citrus cultivation.


Image Credit: Courtesy of Via CitrusAs you consider the business's future, what are you most excited about? The booming plant industry and the significant steps we are taking to grow alongside it get me excited. As our world gets more digital, people are turning to gardening and indoor plants for both hobby and home decor to take a break from their screens. This trend presents a promising opportunity for Via Citrus, as our unique offering of citrus plants aligns with this growing interest.What is particularly thrilling is our recent purchase of new land for the development of additional greenhouses. These new greenhouses will have the capacity to increase our variety of citrus offers, improve our cultivation process and ensure we can meet the growing demand from our customers.

For me, I wanted to get everything right the first time: the perfect-looking website, the perfect variety, size, packaging, images, etc. I was spending too much time perfecting. Perfection is somewhat of a double-edged sword. No one was seeing my website or buying my citrus plants. Therefore, my quest for perfection limited my ability to get any consumer feedback to make anything better. Eventually, after years of planning and perfecting, I launched the website. The few customers who did engage became invaluable sources of feedback. Their insights helped us refine our offers in ways I hadn't anticipated.It's important to get your product out there, even if it's a limited run of your product. Early feedback provides incredible insights and can steer your side hustle in a direction that better meets market needs and preferences.

Syed Lateef runs his Airbnb business in Chicago.


 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Syed Lateef, a 36-year-old Airbnb Superhost in Chicago. It's been edited for length and clarity.I'm the CEO of SyedBnb, a short-term rental company with over 300 units and 100 employees.After dropping out of college for one year before returning to get my degree, I started working in finance, but I didn't aspire to have the lifestyle of the company's VPs. I wanted wealth, exotic cars, luxury vacations, time, and freedom, so I pivoted to real estate.



I started my business in 2017, and in 2023, we made $11.5 million in revenue and $1.4 million in net profit.Real estate was the key to the life I wantedAfter being let go from my first role as a financial analyst, I landed a job at Allstate. I was promoted three times within five years, but the salary increases weren't meeting my expectations.I realized that the people I knew in my community who were wealthy and had nice homes or cars were involved in real estate, which made me believe that was one of the main drivers of wealth.I started listening to the ""BiggerPockets"" podcast and read ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad,"" which motivated me to pursue financial freedom. I expected it to take me 15 years to replace my salaried income through real estate, but I was determined.


In 2016, I purchased my first multifamily building in Chicago using savings from my finance job and a loan on my 401(k). I put one of the units on Airbnb with a goal to make double the rent in one month that I could expect from a long-term tenant.I hired cleaners and virtual assistants to do the admin work and implemented pricing software from the outset (I use PriceLabs).Within four months, I made three times the expected market rent for a long-term tenant. I realized what an incredible opportunity this was and converted all the units in my building into Airbnbs. I was addicted and wanted more.Three to four months into my side business, even though my family and friends encouraged me to keep my salaried role, I gave my notice to leave. I was now a full-time entrepreneur.


Since its launch, I've scaled the business to over $35 million in revenueOne of Lateef's units in Chicago. Courtesy of Syed LateefI became an Airbnb Superhost in 2018, which means my average reviews are above 4.8 out of 5.In the second year, I expanded into rental arbitrage (renting units from landlords and subleasing them on Airbnb) after realizing it was an easier way to grow my business. After furnishing my units, I lacked the cash to buy more rentals. I now own 13 apartments and arbitrage 320.


My revenue hit $2.8 million in 2019. 2020 was a down year due to COVID-19. By 2022, I had my first eight-figure year, reaching $10.5 million in revenue.I only work a few hours a weekWith the help of my employees and the implementation of author Gino Wickman's guiding principles of the EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System), my workweek hovers around two hours.EOS is a set of concepts and tools for entrepreneurs to have people in the right seats, track scorecards, document processes, identify issues, and get traction on their business. Weekly leadership meetings using the EOS system help me achieve a two-hour workweek, but those two hours are intense meetings.I also handle my landlord relationships and business growth, but that's periodic, as well as the occasional proverbial fire.


The biggest mistake I made was growing too quicklyThe biggest mistake I made was being too optimistic about growth in the winter before the pandemic. I started scaling and ran out of cash, but I didn't expect COVID-19 to hit me with a knock-out punch. My revenue went to zero. Airbnb refunded all my future guests. I didn't have the money to pay the landlord's rent.I negotiated with all my landlords to allow me to stay in business. I purchased assets from bankrupt companies and was able to scale significantly. For example, I bought furniture for $250 per apartment from a bankrupt company.Here's my Airbnb adviceMy best advice to other aspiring Airbnb Superhosts is to learn from other hosts' experiences. Get in the Airbnb Facebook forums and connect with others. Attend networking events. Hire a coach or purchase a course to help you start the business.Then, take action. If you can't afford a property, consider rental arbitrage. So many people get stuck in the learning and planning process. Inevitably, you'll learn while being in the actual business.


When I got started, I asked my sister, who's into interior design, to help me furnish my first Airbnbs. For guests' needs, we modeled hotels to see what items created a good stay. I learned everything myself through experience.Let's put you on the fast track to success. Accelerate your business growth with our all-inclusive subscription.

This Q&A features Lauren Myrick, founder and CEO of Found. Myrick raised more than $75.2 million from leading VCs including Sequoia Capital, Founders Fund and Lightspeed Venture Partners to build a better banking system for self-employed freelancers and independent workers. Image credit: Courtesy of FoundWhat inspired the idea for Found?I've seen the frustrations of small business owners firsthand through my personal and professional life. On a personal note, my sister is a yoga studio owner and self-employed fitness instructor, and I saw her struggles navigating traditional finance and business management tools. Professionally, when I was the GM of Square's Payroll business, I saw how complicated, painful and stressful taxes can be for small business owners.



Both of these perspectives inspired me to further investigate the financial management and tooling challenges that self-employed business owners face. Connor Dunn, my co-founder, and I started talking to family members, friends and other self-employed business owners to understand their challenges. Many people don't realize that managing your finances when you're self-employed differs quite a bit from when you are a W-2 employee. There are different tax requirements and forms, and you are on your own to figure out how much you need to pay in taxes. We also saw a common theme that people start their own businesses because they want freedom, flexibility and creative control — not so they can become their own accountants.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.


During these conversations and additional research, we realized two important things. First, we could provide tremendous value to these self-employed individuals by giving them a toolkit to manage their finances — something we felt we were uniquely equipped to do because of our backgrounds at Square. Second, the self-employed population in America is large and growing: Approximately 60 million Americans today are self-employed, and self-employment will soon surpass traditional employment to become the majority of the American workforce. Shortly after these conversations, we started Found.Why is doing taxes one of the most difficult financial tasks for freelancers?Unlike W-2 employees, business owners and freelancers do not proactively have income taxes taken out of their paychecks — and are expected to calculate and report their expected taxes themselves throughout the year. They are also frequently acting as their own ""finance department,"" an area where most have very little expertise. This typically involves keeping business and personal finances separate, correctly calculating and proactively saving the proper amount for taxes, and tracking financial deadlines, expenses and fines.In addition, tax laws are always changing and complicated by both state and federal policies. These laws are also starting to regulate how payments are invoiced, paid and tracked in relation to apps and platforms that we all interact with. For example, millions of freelancers, gig workers, solopreneurs and contract workers breathed a collective sigh of relief in December 2022 when the IRS delayed the new tax-reporting requirement for third-party payment platforms like Venmo, Cash App and PayPal, but that was just a temporary measure.Keeping finances organized while also staying on top of these changing laws is a lot to manage, and the tools available to the self-employed are typically expensive and disparate. Because of this, and because there is the ever-looming risk of owing money in taxes at the end of the year, we frequently hear that doing taxes is one of the most stressful parts of being self-employed.

Found can automatically estimate and set aside money for taxes for our users based on their income. We can also help our users easily categorize expenses and provide guidance on what can and cannot be deducted as write-offs.Found partnered with Column Tax to take these benefits a step further and provide tax filing services to its users, particularly those who are Schedule C filers. Column's tech is integrated into Found's suite of financial tools for independent workers. With Column Tax, Found Plus subscribers can access free tax filing services as part of their annual subscription.Filing through Column Tax is already around 1.5-2 times faster than standard DIY tax software providers and can be even faster for certain filers like independent workers who often have more complex tax returns. Because Column Tax is able to pull data directly from Found accounts, this partnership can help save Found users a lot of time when entering financial details during the filing process. The IRS has estimated that self-employed individuals spend 24 hours on taxes per year! And pay $560.


Related: She Used Her Kids' College Fund to Build a Side Hustle, But the Product Was 'Unsellable' — Here's How She Got Back on Track for $100 Million in SalesDo you have any top tips for freelancing and side-hustling filers who want to file with ease?First, it's incredibly important to organize your income sources. Keep track of 1099-NEC forms from clients and 1099-K forms from payment processors like PayPal to avoid a last-minute scramble. Second, make sure to separate business and personal finances, ideally through maintaining separate bank accounts, which will help simplify end of year reporting. You also want to meticulously track all business-related expenses, as these could be deductible expenses and significantly lower your taxable income. This could include expenses related to equipment, supplies, home office costs, phone bills and any other materials needed for your business.Lastly, it's crucial to understand your responsibility for paying self-employment tax in addition to regular income tax. To ensure you have sufficient funds to cover your tax bill, including estimated tax payments, allocate 20-30% of your freelance income into a separate savings account dedicated solely to taxes. If you expect to owe at least $1,000 in federal taxes for the year, make quarterly estimated tax payments to avoid underpayment penalties. Properly budgeting and making timely tax payments can save you from potential financial headaches down the line.And what are some of the common mistakes they make during filing, especially around retirement?When we surveyed Found customers last year, we learned that only 22% of self-employed people know how to maximize potential deductions and write-offs, which means they are missing the chance to lower their taxable income — and therefore their tax bill. Some of the tax deductions, like when you buy a new laptop for your job or pay your CPA, are more straightforward, but there are so many others.

And when you're self-employed, you can likely deduct contributions made to several types of retirement plans, such as traditional IRAs, SEP IRAs and Solo 401(k)s. Some of these retirement accounts can lower taxable income by deferring the tax bill until the money is withdrawn in retirement. Not being aware of these benefits can lead to missed opportunities for tax savings.

      Key Takeaways    



        Smith and his wife first heard about the EyeSpy side hustle from friends who knew founder Mistie Boulton. 
      


        Smith started with the company over two decades ago; these days, he completes about three evaluations each month. 
      


        Since he began keeping track in 2008, Smith has enjoyed a $40,000 food budget in exchange for his reviews. 
      












This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cliff Smith. Smith is based in Palo Alto, California and has been an evaluator for EyeSpy Critiquing & Consulting since 2003. The piece has been edited and condensed for clarity. I started working as a mystery diner with EyeSpy over 20 years ago. Our friends knew the founder Mistie Boulton, so they were among the very first people to do it, and when they told us about it, we thought it sounded too good to be true — to have our meals at nice restaurants paid for in exchange for writing up the experience. We didn't jump on the opportunity right away, but when I lost my job and began to tutor GMAT prep, I picked up the side hustle so we could continue dining out.Typically, I complete around three evaluations a month, and the work takes me to fine dining establishments as well as more casual restaurants; sometimes, the evaluation will even be for a takeout order. One Saturday last month, my wife and I did a brunch evaluation at The Village Pub, and our budget for brunch was $250 — and we needed it. We actually went slightly over with the tax and tip. The following Friday, we got a pizza delivery. So it remains a mix, and that's one of the advantages: This side hustle gets you into places you might not go otherwise.



Related: She Used Her Kids' College Fund to Build a Side Hustle, But the Product Was 'Unsellable' — Here's How She Got Back on Track for $100 Million in SalesThe process usually starts when you receive an email, then you go to the website and see that you have an assignment. You can negotiate when to do the assignment within the month, and if you can't do it that month, you can explain why and potentially take on the assignment the next month, but you may not get it again. It depends on what's going on — sometimes if they already have someone for the following week, it doesn't work out.


For each evaluation, there's an online survey form, and they do differ. Different restaurants care about different things. For example, The Village Pub cares a lot about how they handle the wine. Do they observe proper protocol? Do they keep filling your glass? Other places don't care nearly as much about that, but they might care about how many people say goodbye to you. So before an evaluation, you really do need to look at the form. Even if it's a similar kind of restaurant, the management may care about different things for different reasons. And you're supposed to remember when they did different things. I take pictures so I have a timestamp for all of it.Related: This 29-Year-Old Left His Marketing Job to Pursue a Side Hustle — Now He Earns Nearly $200,000 a Year: 'So Attracted to the Adrenaline Rush'You have to turn in the evaluation within 24 hours. When we started, it was two days, but they changed it to the next day. And in a way, that's reasonable because you have to remember a lot, and it does fade. The time it takes to finish an evaluation depends on the place. For the pizza place I mentioned, I completed it that night and maybe spent two hours on it at most. But I probably spent about six hours on The Village Pub evaluation. I wouldn't do it all in one day for a place like that.We also have to submit photos. I use Photoshop to crop them because I'm surreptitiously taking the pictures — though it doesn't have to be too surreptitious because a lot of people are taking pictures these days — but I take so many that I don't want to be too obvious about it. I don't take great pictures all the time. For the food, I do, but for the other things, not so much. But I may take a picture of the table to show the place settings if they care about their positioning. Later, when I'm submitting the photos, I need to crop them so they look better, and I reduce the rest so I don't bring the EyeSpy server to its knees.


Since July 2008, I've tracked how much I was budgeted for each evaluation — and it comes out to $40,000 in total. Of course, the real number is higher than that because we started the side hustle in 2003. And, of course, the cost of dining out has increased over the years. My favorite part of being a mystery diner is the ability to go places we wouldn't otherwise; it gets us into restaurants like The Village Pub, where we just wouldn't spend that kind of money on a dinner, let alone a brunch. We also try places we might not normally try. We go to Oren's Hummus, which is owned by the founder Mistie Boulton, all the time, but before working with EyeSpy, I'm not sure if we'd ever had Middle Eastern food.Related: I Started a Semi-Passive Side Hustle That Earns $33,000 a Week on Amazon: 'Selling There Is a No-Brainer'I also appreciate that I really have a voice. Generally, if you go to a restaurant and they treat you badly, you might ask to speak to the manager, and maybe you get comped or you get a free dessert. But I have a nuclear weapon. If I note that something isn't right, there probably will be a change. This wasn't vindictive, but one time, we went to a nice bistro in San Francisco, and our server just wasn't very accomplished. It wasn't a deal-breaker that would keep us out of that restaurant in the future or anything like that, but things weren't smooth or well done. A few months later, we went back to the same restaurant, and that same server was there, but now she was an assistant server, not the main server. So I thought, Well, they listened. And she seemed to be okay doing that; it was a better fit for her skill set. It's gratifying to know that I'll be heard because the restaurant management paid to hear it.

10,I Was Told I Was Too Old for a New Tech Job. Now I'm Fighting Back.,"Apr 4, 2024",Tim Paradis,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/recruiters-ageism-goes-viral-tech-applicant-starts-company/472208,"
This article originally appeared on Business Insider. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Vern Six, 58, who has worked in tech for over three decades. After getting laid off from a contract job, he updated his LinkedIn profile to indicate he was open to work. A recruiter contacted him and expressed surprise at how long Six had been in tech. Six, who lives near Waco, Texas, with his wife, posted about his experience with what he saw as ageism. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.I've been in tech as a developer, a senior engineer, principal software engineer — whatever you want to call it — for 37 years. My career has ranged from three-month to four-year engagements. I'm almost always hired as an independent contractor.



After I got laid off, I got a phone call from a recruiter, which happens a lot. He said, ""Hey, I've got your résumé. Can you spare a few minutes?"" I said, ""Sure.""So, he went to pull up my LinkedIn profile. He goes, ""Oh, wow, you've been doing this for a long time."" It was like he'd never read my résumé, which was 12 pages long and listed every project I ever had.


Then he goes, ""With 37 years in this business, I'm surprised you're not a CTO."" He said, ""That's going to be a hard sell. I don't even know if I can pitch you to any of my clients. They're all going to wonder why you're not a CTO or at the C-level."" I was like, ""Did you just say that?""I think I responded to him in a way my mom would not necessarily be very proud of. Then I hung up. He was really hateful.After my post on LinkedIn about his call went viral, he begged me to take it down and not be naming and shaming. I probably have no less than 200 emails from attorneys wanting to represent me to go after this guy. But I'm just like, ""I don't need to be a part of him getting bad karma, and I don't need it to possibly come back on me with some bad karma. It's just not who I am.""Other people have also come out of the woodwork. I have more than 73,000 emails in my inbox. In the ones I've gone through, I've gotten, I don't know, 100 invites to date. I've been married for 25 years, so I'm good.


I've had probably 200 hate messages. They're like, ""Just go away, you old goat,"" and stuff like that. Other people have used some very explicit language.The post had over 2 million impressions on LinkedIn, and I've had thousands of connection requests pop up. People wanted me to start a group there, so I created one called Inclusive Futures to fight ageism and discrimination. It already has over 400 members.'Bring the old guy in here.'I didn't see any ageism at my last company. But, before that, I'd seen it. ""Bring the old guy in here. See what he has to say about this."" I can't tell you how many times I've heard that since I was 45-plus. On one hand, it's kind of flattering in that, OK, my opinion is valued. On the other hand, it's damn insulting.It was most prevalent when I was working as a software engineer. At many social events, I was simply excluded. In other cases, it wasn't the right type of event for me. I'm not going to go to an axe-throwing bar in downtown Dallas. They would go play paintball. I'm an old Army sergeant; I can play paintball, but I'm 58 years old. I have broken my back a couple of times, and I'm not exactly going to do those things anymore. If they want to go out on my bass boat and we go fishing — let's go.


But in my experience, over 37 years, women have gotten a much worse run over the coals than what occurs with ageism. I've heard hundreds of people comment about women in tech — which can be career-ending discussions — and they're just talking lackadaisically in the middle of the boardroom or cubicle or whatever. Discrimination, in general, just kind of pisses me off.Going for coffeeThis is the first time in my career that I've ever had more than 24 hours that I have not been employed somewhere. I'd been on this work project for four years. I've always been an independent contractor; I've had a great career. I have been building web apps mostly for the last 26 years. And I'm a former CTO.My wife and I recently bought more than 30 acres next to us. We went to the closing at 3 p.m., and at 4:20, I received a phone call from my client that my contract work was being suspended because they'd had a problem at the company. I was just like, ""Holy smokes. I just made myself cash-poor and don't have an income.""We're former full-time missionaries. Before that, we had been kind of serial entrepreneurs. We owned a chain of indoor amusement parks. We sold that, went and lived in Guatemala, helped build an orphanage, and financed all of that through the sale of the amusement center business and my tech work. I've worked wherever I can plug in my computer. I've been in 92 countries and earned an income in every one of them.


In 2021, a friend and I were discussing how we could really make an impact in the world. So, my wife and I started this fundraising company called Purpose Brew Coffee. We wanted to focus on helping projects raise money. The basic model is that we white-label our coffees. And we create a website — because I'm a tech guy, right? — and brand our coffees for the organization doing the fundraising. They promote it to their supporters, and we ship the coffee to the customer.The seller of the coffee earns a percentage for each bag sold. It's a huge share. Thirty percent of the retail dollar goes to each organization. If you sell popcorn, cookie dough, or chocolate bars, they often get at most 2% to 4%.So when the layoff happened, my wife and I looked at each other and said, ""Well, maybe it's just time."" Then she said, ""Nobody can do our tech better than you. Let's stop paying the contractors and have you take over."" So we went down that path. We've doubled the number of partnerships — just in the last few weeks — because I'm doing it full-time now.But even though I love the coffee business, I am still looking for another tech role.


After the LinkedIn post, I've been getting a couple hundred calls a day from recruiters. I would take a project that lasted from a few months to a few years. But, for now, the coffee business is growing. It's going to be a cool, cool deal. I think it's really going to take off. It will not support us at the moment. We're living off of savings. But within two months or so, I think the business will support us.

11,"This Mom Started a Side Hustle After a 'Shocking' Realization in the Toy Aisle. Her Product Was in Macy's Within the Year — Seeing Nearly $350,000 in Sales.","Mar 28, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/her-shocking-discovery-led-to-a-side-hustle-and-over-300k/471768,"
In 2022, Elenor Mak, now founder of doll company Jilly Bing, was busy balancing her business development role at a healthcare company and raising her 2-year-old and 4-year-old children. Back then, she ""was definitely not looking to start"" a side hustle. She'd founded an ecommerce fashion company in the past and knew what it took to get a business up and running. But that changed when her young daughter Jillian began playing with stuffed animals and dolls.Image Credit: Courtesy of Jilly Bing. Elenor Mak.""It reminded me of my own childhood,"" Mak tells Entrepreneur. ""You're playing with dolls; you're trying to make sense of the world. She was bossing her dolls around, like, 'Eat your dinner. Wash your hands.' Acting like a mom. Not in those words, but at age two, sort of using those words, simpler versions of those words.""



Related: How to Go From Side Hustle to 7-Figure Business and Beyond, According to 3 Women Who Did ItOne day, Mak's mother gave her granddaughter a ""beautiful blonde, blue-eyed doll."" When Mak asked her why she'd chosen that doll instead of one that looked like her daughter, her mother said, ""It was the prettiest one on the shelf."" Despite knowing her mother meant well, Mak found those words ""so heavy,"" a reminder of her own experience with lack of representation as a child.


""They gave them an Asian name, like Ling, or like a bad haircut. It was so shocking and disappointing.""Mak decided to buy her daughter a doll that looked like her and figured it would be a straightforward process: Because I live in San Francisco, and it's 2022. But it wasn't. Her local toy store didn't have one. Neither did the second she visited. Or the third. The toy aisles at major retailers like Target and Toys""R""Us seemed as though they ""had not evolved"" since Mak was a kid, nearly four decades before.""There were just rows and rows of Caucasian dolls, brunettes, and then at the very end of the aisle, you would have these dolls that I think were intended to be Asian because they were holding a panda bear,"" Mak recalls. ""They gave them an Asian name, like Ling, or like a bad haircut. It was so shocking and disappointing.""Mak looked to Asia for more options, but asking her relatives what they could find only turned up ""Eurasian-looking dolls,"" she says, adding that ""dolls largely represent what society thinks is beautiful, and in Asia, what's beautiful is still the Caucasian sort of features."" Mak remembered wishing she were beautiful like the dolls she had growing up, and ""her mommy bear instincts"" kicked in — she was determined to get her daughter a doll that looked like her, even if she had to make it herself.

""It's really hard — really hard — to make a good doll.""Mak Googled ""how to make a doll,"" and armed with an MBA from Harvard Business School and her ""strong business background,"" she got to work on a side hustle that would shake up the $40 billion toy industry. Although she admits the creative component wasn't where she excelled (""My 6-year-old son is a better artist than me,"" she quips), she had a clear vision when it came to the business side and the potential for major demand: ""The Asian American population is one of the fastest-growing — we're 7% of the country's population.""And how hard could it be to make a doll in an age where we're churning out Teslas and developing AI? She recalls thinking. As it turns out, ""it's really hard — really hard — to make a good doll,"" Mak says. Fortunately, her business background helped her develop an essential ""superpower"": ""finding really good people."" Mak did cold outreaches to Asian designers at large toy brands and leveraged her own extensive network to connect with professionals who could bring the dream to life.


Image Credit: Courtesy of Jilly Bing. Elenor Mak and her daughter Jillian with the Jilly doll.By June 2022, they had their team of four. Mak conducted a lot of research over the next several months, speaking with Asian families and looking at photographs of kids and dolls to really try to understand what parents wanted. ""It's not just about saying, 'Oh, this doll's Asian,'"" Mak says. ""But what mattered to them? What were the features? What were the backstories?"" In December of that year, the prototype for Jilly Bing, named for Mak's daughter Jillian and the Chinese word for cookie, ""bing gan"" (Jillian's first word), was ready to share with the world.Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a Month""Adult women would write in and be like, 'Oh my gosh, it's like healing for my inner child.'""Jilly Bing started shipping dolls in August 2023 — and sold out of its stock of 2,000 within six weeks. Greta Gerwig's blockbuster hit Barbie had also put the spotlight on dolls that summer, ""opening up the national conversation"" and presenting ""an opportunity for us to change the narrative for not just our Asian children, but all children,"" Mak says. At that point, Mak realized the ""high-risk, high-effort"" passion project she'd worked on as a side hustle for the past couple of years — taking late-night business calls after her kids were asleep and balancing it all with her full-time day job — would benefit from her undivided attention.Jilly Bing also appeared on the Today show around that time, and the positive response was ""overwhelming."" ""Adult women would write in and be like, 'Oh my gosh, it's like healing for my inner child. Life would have been so different if I had a doll that looked like me growing up,'"" Mak says. ""Even non-Asian parents writing [in to say], 'Oh my gosh, I think my kids should have dolls that look like their friends.'""By early this year, Jilly Bing was on shelves at Macy's; the retailer reached out after the Today segment. ""It's a company I grew up with,"" Mak says, ""so it was just really wonderful that they saw the value of Jilly Bing so early on."" Jilly Bing is also part of Macy's Mission Every One initiative, which has committed $5 billion of spending through 2025 to its people, partners, products and programs ""to create a more equitable and sustainable future.""Related: How This Doctor-Turned-Entrepreneur Is Trying to Change the World Through Play


""Seeing the kids' reactions to having a doll that looks like them keeps me going [more than] everything else.""To date, Jilly Bing has sold approximately 5,000 dolls, Mak says. At $68 apiece, that's more than $300,000 in sales.And Mak's favorite part about running her business? That would be the testimonials from her young customers. ""It's seeing the photos,"" Mak says. ""And hearing the stories [from them] — and my own daughter — saying, 'She looks like me. She has black hair like me.' [And] little Asian boys saying, 'She's beautiful like my mama.' It's just seeing the kids' reactions to having a doll that looks like them that keeps me going [more than] everything else.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Jilly Bing. 


Mak had to ""trust her gut"" to start the side hustle turned full-fledged business that's leaving its mark on the toy industry and beyond, and she looks forward to building the brand out in the years to come.""I am most excited about being able to create characters,"" Mak says. ""We started to branch into comics because it's a doll, but we're starting to create the stories. I've got a vision of a whole cast of Asian American characters that actually reflect what Asian America looks like today. We have mixed Asian children, you have boys, you have Southeast Asian. Jilly's our first doll, so I'm excited to grow and introduce the world to the rest of Jilly Bing's friends.""

14,Gen Z Is Turning to Side Hustles to Purchase 'the Normal Stuff' in 'Suburban Middle-Class America',"Mar 26, 2024",Sherin Shibu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/gen-z-is-putting-in-the-extra-work-on-their-side-hustles/471709,"
Gen Z, the generation designated by the U.S. Census as born from 1997 to 2013, has been standing out in the workforce for the wrong reasons: 74% of managers find the generation harder to work with than others, according to a Resume Builder survey, and 57% of Gen Z is willing to abandon the standard 9-to-5 entirely to become a social media influencer, according to a Morning Consult survey.But a new report from The Washington Post found there is one area where Gen Z is willing to put in the extra work: online side hustles, including building revenue from social media.The outlet spoke to several Gen Z side hustlers making up to $8,900 a month, or six figures per year, doing everything from making financial advice videos to offering trip planning services.



Related: The Most Unexpectedly Popular Side Hustle of the Decade Has Low Startup Costs and High MarkupsThe effort, the report notes, is because Gen Z came of age during the 2008 financial crisis, spent crucial years of school remotely during the pandemic, and observed recent waves of layoffs as entry-level workers. Now, they're trying to adjust to higher costs of living that appear to outpace wages.


""Things have changed to be able to just afford the normal stuff in suburban middle-class America,"" Colin Stroud, a 24-year-old based in Columbus, Ohio, told The Washington Post. ""You have to do extra stuff to do that.""Stroud stated that he and his wife went from living paycheck to paycheck to making $3,000 last month with side hustles alone. He gained an audience after posting on LinkedIn about how to fly to Hawaii for ""free"" on credit card rewards points, and now makes money charging clients for consultations and trip planning.Related: Gen Z's Main Career Aspiration Is to Be an Influencer, According to a New Report""Despite a strong labor market, many young people are struggling to find work, which could prevent them from achieving their financial goals, like renting their first apartment or paying down student loans,"" said Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma, in a March report from the company. ""As a result, Gen Z is getting creative about ways to make money with many turning to social media and online platforms to earn some extra cash.""


According to the Credit Karma report, 47% of Gen Z stated that they made more money on social media than they did working a traditional 9-to-5 job.The respondents used money from online side hustles to save money, invest, and travel.Nearly half of Gen Zers and millennials who responded to another survey, this one by Lending Tree, stated that they always plan to have a side hustle.The same survey showed that 80% of Gen Z and millennials with side hustles rely on the extra cash to make ends meet and that more than half of Gen Z ages 18 to 26 have a side hustle.

      Key Takeaways    



        Woo's background in management consulting and further research inspired her to build a tool in the form of a card game ""that anybody could enjoy."" 
      


        Her first deck — 52 Essential Conversations — launched in May 2018.
      


        These days, she releases a new deck on Amazon every four to six months, and the business model is a ""no-brainer.""
      












This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dr. Jenny Woo, educator and founder of Mind Brain Emotion, the company behind a line of card games and other tools for the development of emotional intelligence. The story has been edited and condensed for clarity. There's some research that shows that today's college students are way less emotionally intelligent compared to those a decade ago. And this research was done before the pandemic, so you can imagine what that looks like post-pandemic. I've also seen a lot of research on the impact of distance learning and social isolation, where adults and kids just don't have the same opportunity to interact with people. For kids, this translated into social anxiety and regression [in] communication skills and language, and just that unwillingness to connect with people.Image Credit: Courtesy of Mind Brain Emotion. Dr. Jenny Woo.



I've done management consulting for Fortune 500 companies, and through working with senior leaders, I found that soft skills in the workplace are not quite emphasized, which really impacts the health of an organization's team. When I was researching this area at the children's level, I realized, Oh my gosh, these are the skills that basically weren't really taught or discussed in school. So, while at the Harvard Innovation Labs, I took a research-backed approach to develop a tool in the form of a card game that anybody could enjoy — you don't have to go to school or anything. (I wanted to do something that was easy and accessible because I'm the first one in my family to graduate college.)Related: This Gen Zer's Stylish Side Hustle Earns About $20,000 a Month and Paid Off His Parents' $200,000 Debt: 'I Enjoy the Hands-Off Nature'


The development of my first card deck, which launched in May 2018 with the help of a Kickstarter campaign, stemmed from a combination of education research and industry experience. I was in a master's program in education that was focused on the intersection of cognitive science, neuroscience, education and child development, and I guess psychology sprinkled in there. I started with the 52 Essential Conversations to really help people have purposeful conversations in an authentic and vulnerable way. This would be parents with children, adult parents and grandparents with children in school. It's almost like the pearls of wisdom that you want to leave someone close to you — to feel good that they're set for life and can make responsible decisions.I didn't even really think about developing more card decks, but organically, as I was testing the game out with users and gathering these case studies, understanding how people are actually engaging and interacting with it, I realized that in order to even begin to have these vulnerable, heart-to-heart conversations, you need to have that trust, respect and understanding first. And so that is where I created the second deck, which is the Relationship Skills deck — to help people go back to the drawing board, connect with each other and build that caring trust necessary to even have a conversation. I released that one in January 2019.Related: Her 'Crude Prototype' and $50 Craigslist Purchase Launched a Side Hustle That Hit $1 Million in Sales — Now the Business Generates Up to $20 Million a YearAmazon is a platform that's continuously growing in terms of people who rely on the service, so selling there is a no-brainer. These days, I launch a new deck every four to six months on Amazon, and the sales bring in $33,000 a week. I have other streams of income as well. I lecture at the University of California, Irvine. I'm lecturing but also providing a service through my online course as Mind Brain Emotion, my company. So every quarter I teach, and they pay me directly per person taking my online course. We do some real estate too.


I speak a lot to entrepreneurship classes at the graduate college level, and one time I got this question from someone: ""Can you start a business if you're not really passionate about what you're selling if it will make a lot of money?"" My answer is, ""Why would you want to do that?"" My advice is to do something that you're truly passionate about and hopefully passionate about for a long, long time because it is a grind. You're going to get negative customer reviews, which is like a death sentence for a business. And you have to love what you're doing enough to just pick yourself up and keep going. That also goes into knowing what your values are; you're going to have so many dilemmas and decisions that you need to make, and in order to weigh the pros and cons, you have to go back to your values and what's important to you.Related: Learn How You Can Take Advantage of Amazon's Advertising Tools to Get More Eyes on Your BusinessAdditionally, as a solopreneur, you don't know what you don't know, and that's one of the biggest challenges I see when I talk to other entrepreneurs. Sometimes you could be so in love with your idea, but it's really important to talk to as many people as you can and listen to the customer first before yourself or the product to understand if this is meeting a need and if there are demands for this product.Looking for your next side hustle?

16,5 Ways to Make Money Online in 2024,"Mar 22, 2024",Georgi Todorov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/top-ways-to-make-money-online-this-year/471234,"
In 2024, the digital world continues to offer innovative ways to earn money online, marking an era of unprecedented opportunity for entrepreneurs and freelancers alike. At the same time, mass layoffs are fueling a new wave of entrepreneurs.Companies are transitioning towards automation, integrating AI to streamline operations. Businesses lay off employees and replace them with AI. In a survey gathering opinions from over 1,500 small businesses in the UK, 24% of the participants indicated plans to substitute certain staff members with AI within the next 12 months.Undoubtedly, the increase in highly skilled unemployed individuals from the IT and marketing sectors will result in a rise in new entrepreneurs and individuals seeking online income opportunities.



This concise guide highlights five methods to capitalize on the internet's vast potential for generating income.Related: The 5 Most Reliable Ways to Make Money Online


1. Freelance workFreelancing serves as an easily accessible route into the online income world, requiring minimal initial investment or skills, and suits newcomers to the workforce. AI advancements lower entry barriers across professions, enabling almost anyone to generate income, particularly through content creation.This ease of entry makes freelancing an attractive option for aspiring entrepreneurs lacking funds or networks. Starting with simple tasks like article writing, freelancers can increase their earnings as they acquire more skills.However, the challenge lies in the direct exchange of time for money, which may lead to burnout since income stops when work does, excluding time spent on non-billable tasks. Despite these challenges, freelancing can pave the way for future professional growth and opportunities.2. Consultancy business — The next level after freelanceMoving from freelancing to consultancy marks a professional progression, shifting from payment for work volume to earning based on expertise. This change enables higher earnings for less task-oriented time, focusing on offering strategic advice to clients.


Consider the SEO industry, where numerous specialists operate as independent consultants. This mirrors my own journey, transitioning from freelance SEO work to consultancy. According to one study, self-employed SEO consultants earn slightly more than agency or in-house SEOs.The income potential for an SEO consultant is capped due to limitations on client capacity with a maximum of five to six clients. This restriction sets their annual earnings between $50,000 and $250,000.The earning potential as an SEO consultant has a ceiling, but it can be significantly enhanced by establishing an agency and expanding your business with additional employees.3. Create a digital PR agencyDigital PR agencies make pretty good money. According to one study, the average price of one PR campaign for a client can range from $6,000 to $20,000.


Establishing a digital PR agency is a promising venture in the current market, where the demand for high-quality digital PR services is on the rise. This business model involves securing media features and placements for brands across various publications and outlets.Operating a digital PR agency is within reach with the right approach. The key lies in assembling a team capable of crafting captivating campaigns and gathering compelling data. But there's a caveat — over 42% of journalists report receiving between 10 and 100 pitches a day. To cut through the noise, aim to establish long-term relationships with journalists and publishers. Once you've provided value to them, they're more likely to prioritize your pitch next time.What is the disadvantage of starting an agency business? It may not be the right time. In my podcast, The Create & Grow Show, I've spoken with several agency owners who all agree that the agencies are facing challenges. They've experienced a significant loss of clients and find it increasingly hard to attract new ones.Related: 10 Online Careers You Can Start Today With Basically No Money


4. BloggingTransitioning to blogging introduces a more passive, yet intriguing method of income generation. Unlike traditional models, this approach doesn't require trading time directly for money.In one of my previous articles on Entrepreneur, I shared my experience on how I generated income through my ex-blog, thrivemyway.com. My earnings came from various sources, including display advertisements, affiliate marketing and sponsored posts. Eventually, I sold the blog for a six-figure sum. Diversifying income streams can make blogging a less risky venture.For those interested in succeeding in affiliate marketing, my advice is to concentrate on high-yield products. For instance, in the health niche, supplements are lucrative, and that market is growing.5. Become an online personal trainerAccording to one study, the wellness industry could be worth $8.5 trillion (57% growth) by the year 2027. In the U.S., online fitness coaches earn $52K to $93K per year.


These facts make the industry an excellent opportunity for those who are passionate to get involved.Online personal training thrives with digital growth, offering a lucrative and satisfying path by meeting the demand for personalized, remote fitness coaching and enabling global client reach.In conclusion, whatever you choose to do — don't ignore AI. Utilize it to enhance efficiency and save time. AI is not just a hype or a trend; it's the present and will be increasingly integral in the future. To stay competitive, adapting to AI is essential.Related: 10 Ways to Make Money Online You May Not Have Thought Of

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Ray Cao, a Gen Z seller on StockX, an online marketplace and sneaker reseller. Image Credit: Courtesy of Ray CaoWhat was your day job when you started your side hustle, and why were you interested in entrepreneurship?I was a student working as a part-time barista earning about $8 an hour (minimum wage at the time) at a bubble tea store in New York City. My family had gotten into $200,000 worth of debt from speculative investments and gambling. We were desperate to the point where my parents borrowed from relatives to get by. This put an obvious strain on the relationship between them, and my family would quickly become the topic of untoward gossip. I was ashamed, scared and insecure. I eventually cultivated these feelings of vulnerability into action and dove into entrepreneurship.



When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?I started the side hustle in 2015 when I had just turned 18. Sneaker and streetwear culture was growing popular, and demand for these coveted brands trended higher. I heard from my friend that this would be a lucrative business opportunity, and we both pursued it. My inspiration for starting and continuing this business was always my immigrant family.Related: I Was a 25-Year-Old Nurse When I Started a Side Hustle to Combat Anxiety.

Throughout my childhood and adolescence, I grew to understand that I was much poorer than my peers. My parents were seamstresses and worked around the clock to support the family. My mom would tell me that she only earned a dime for each fabric she had sewn together, totaling only $200 weekly. Even my late grandma would spend her days picking up bottles and cans to recycle for five cents per piece. My parents and grandma navigated their lives here through sacrifice, cultural disparity and language differences. To this day, their story continues to fuel my ambitions and keeps me progressing.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I joined online communities and forums (Reddit, Facebook, NikeTalk) to conduct research and opened a bank account and card to purchase online drops. Eventually, I bought my first item, Supreme Air Jordan Desert Camo 5s (2015), for $225 and sold them locally for a $400 profit.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?As college progressed and my finance career came into focus, I didn't have the energy to grind through the manual labor required for the business (sorting through incoming inventory, shipping outbound orders, conducting quality checks and dealing with returns from purchases and sales). I automated the business through Excel spreadsheets and worked with my parents to facilitate the day-to-day operations. During this time, I also gained access to store inventory at the StockX warehouse. This dramatically reduced my active work time and involvement to 10 hours a month. Everything I needed to manage the business could now be done from my laptop anywhere in the world.Related: Access our best side hustle stories and make more money. Subscribe to Entrepreneur+ now.


As my available capital increased, a new challenge sprouted: order sizing. For example, with $1,000 and a hype release, it was easy to size my order — as much as I could afford. When that available capital increases a hundredfold or a thousandfold, things become more complex. I remember placing a roughly $10,000 order for the Nike Blazer Mid 77 Vintage White Black. About the first 30 sold at a 15% premium, but demand dried up as I flooded the market with available pairs. I lost about $3,000 and quickly learned the importance of order sizing and liquidity.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?During the early growth stages, monthly revenue trended closely with the amount of capital that was readily available. As the business matured, monthly revenues in the past two years peaked at a little under $20,000.What does total revenue look like now?I've earned about $1.53 million in total revenue on StockX.What do you enjoy most about this side hustle?I enjoy the hands-off nature of this business because it allows me to simultaneously progress my finance career (whether it's a new business venture or another corporate gig). The network of partners and relationships I've built along the way is invaluable, and so is being surrounded by so many smart individuals — special shoutout to the StockX team!

    Sarah Michelle Boes knew there had to be a better way to prepare for her stress-inducing nurse practitioner's exam — so she created it.

      Key Takeaways    



        Sarah Michelle Boes followed her passion for teaching into nursing school. 
      


        After passing her nurse practitioner's exam proved easier than expected, she wanted to instill confidence in others. 
      


        She put together her first course within a week of that exam — and became a millionaire within the year. 
      












This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sarah Michelle Boes, the founder of Sarah Michelle NP Reviews (SMNP), which was acquired by Blueprint Test Prep in 2022. Boes currently serves as the chief nursing officer for Blueprint Test Prep and hosts the podcast Becoming A Stress-Free Nurse Practitioner. She earned her BSN from the University of Kentucky, her MSN in Nursing Education from Western Governors University and her post-MSN-FNP from Eastern Kentucky University. The piece has been edited and condensed for clarity. Image Credit: Courtesy of Sarah Michelle BoesI grew up in rural Eastern Kentucky, and I always had this passion for being a teacher. I had my heart set on it. But my parents are teachers, and they're like, ""Absolutely not. You can't do that."" There are a lot of politics and bureaucracy within teaching. It's a lot more than just being an educator. Then, when I was a teenager, my grandmother was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. Without great access to premium healthcare in our area, we had to travel two hours to Lexington to get that diagnosis and receive a care plan that she could take back home. That was over the summer, so I went with her, and that was my first introduction to nursing at the Markey Cancer Center.



Those nurses were incredible. I feel like oncology nurses, in general, are kind of angels. Not only did they take care of her, but they also took care of me. It was just a great experience. So, knowing that I wasn't going to be able to be a teacher, I was like, Well, nursing — I feel like I could get something done. And there would be a teaching aspect because there's a lot of patient education, but I'd also get a human connection with people, which I thrive off of. So it was a no-brainer, and I attended the University of Kentucky, which guaranteed me admission to their program — and that's a really big deal.Related: This Nurse Turned $500 in Savings Into $100 Million in Sales After Sharing Her Hair Care Routine on YouTube. Now She's Revealing Her Secrets to Success.


I grappled with anxiety during nursing school. A class was notorious for weeding out people, and everyone dreaded taking it. I had a ton of anxiety in that class in particular, so much so that my instructor was like, ""I don't think nursing is for you. You're too anxious to be a safe nurse."" I had to choose to stay. The grading scale in nursing is also very different: In most programs, anything less than a 76 means you fail — and on the first exam in that class, I got a 74. I literally failed the first exam by one question. So I had to figure out how to contend with my anxiety, to think about the tools I could use.So, I started to figure out how to manage that class and my anxiety. Then, I began tutoring, ultimately quitting my full-time job as a manager to help students full-time. I taught them the skills that had helped me tackle that challenging class in a different way, and my anxiety didn't pick up again until I was a nurse practitioner — because it had been a long time since I'd taken a high-stakes exam. There was no one to turn to get perspective because I was the first nurse in my family, and I didn't know many people who were nurse practitioners.What's more, I took my nurse practitioner exam in the prime of Covid, May 2020. So it was chaos. Testing centers were down, and some places would let you take it online at home, but others wouldn't. By the time I took the exam in the middle of May, it had been canceled five times, three of which I'd already arrived at the testing center. So, there was a lot of anxiety involved. I was like, Am I ever going to take this test? My job is riding on this.Related: Nurse Makes $2 Million In One Year With Side Hustle Selling Class Notes Online


I was so stressed that I ended up breaking a tooth in my sleep because I was grinding them so hard. I was going to have to get a dental implant to the tune of $7,000; my hair was also falling out. But I finished the 175-question exam in less than an hour, and I passed. I was like, I can't believe I was stressing over this thing. This was so much easier than my nursing exam. All I needed was confidence in myself because I'd spent years in schools and hundreds of hours in clinical preparing. None of my reviews had given me that confidence.That realization — and the fact that I still had to pay for a $7,000 dental implant — motivated me to put together my first review course. I started my business because I was like, I can't afford this $7,000 implant. I figured if I put together a little review course and even just earned $500, that would help pay for it. And I started to think about how it could be done differently — how it could be less like someone lecturing you and more like studying with a friend. So, I came up with a Q&A approach, which I'd used as a tutor in nursing school and when I taught nursing students at the collegiate level.Within a week of passing the exam, I made my first three-hour course. I actually gave it out to all of my classmates for free. There were 30 of us, and I was like, ""Hey guys, I'll give you this course for free if you invite someone else into the group when I give it to you."" I gave the course to the first 100 people who came into the group. Then, not even a couple of days later, someone who had taken the course went on to pass, and it kind of exploded through word of mouth. It got wild really quickly. The first person I tried to sell it to for $25 got mad because her friend had gotten it for free, so she haggled me down to $15. Still, I made $1,000 on the first day I started selling, and I didn't even make $1,000 in a week as a nurse. I was like, What if I made $1,000 a day, every day? What would life look like?Related: Her 'Crude Prototype' and $50 Craigslist Purchase Launched a Side Hustle That Hit $1 Million in Sales — Now the Business Generates Up to $20 Million a Year


By the end of June and July, I'd surpassed what I used to make annually as a nurse. I told my nurse practitioner job I wouldn't be coming. I wanted to see how far I could take the business, but being reasonable and never having run a business before, I kept my full-time teaching job, just in case. But every spare hour I had, every weekend, was all about the business. Because I was so anxious about it being a startup, fragile and new, I waited to quit my teaching job until I made $1 million. We hit seven figures in seven months.About a year and a half in, I was still using third-party software to host my courses — nothing was in-house or really in unison. It got to the point where my students were literally breaking the software; I needed my own. We actually spent $100,000 trying to build an app that ended up completely falling apart. That was really hard, but we just kept running up against technology, and I realized I was the bottleneck to this thing. The business wanted to grow, so I started looking into other options.We considered a sale and put out some teasers, hoping to get constructive feedback. As it turned out, the test prep provider Blueprint had some internal meetings about the prospect before I even sent out the teaser. They had medical stuff, and they had LSAT stuff, but they didn't have any nursing material at the time. And I wanted to take some pressure off myself because a week into sending out the teasers, I found out I was pregnant. I never want people to think I sold because I was pregnant; it just coincided with the timing.Related: I Turned My Side Hustle Into a Passive Income Stream That's Earned More Than $1 Million — But Making Money Isn't Even the Best Part


We loved the Blueprint team, but the deal just wasn't right at first. My husband and I had decided on a number before we had a single conversation, and I'd recommend any entrepreneur do the same. Otherwise, it can be hard to navigate a deal when emotions are running high. So the first deal wasn't our number, and we walked away. Then they came back with our number, and we ended up selling around the two-year mark. That money has been life-changing.At 36 weeks pregnant, we found out that my daughter was going to have a congenital heart defect. We had no idea. So everything kind of flipped on its head really quickly. When I gave birth, the money gave us the flexibility and ability to be with our daughter when she needed it the very most. She had six surgeries in her first five months of life, two of which were open-heart surgeries. So, very crazy, chaotic times, and what a blessing to be able to have not only a maternity leave, but also a medical leave, and to be able to be fully present for that — and not only me but also my husband. We could be there together and support one another.Now, my daughter is 19 months old, and for the past year, we've been working to do a legacy gift to our local children's hospital, where they literally saved her life. Hopefully, next month, fingers crossed, everything's going to be finished, and they're actually going to dedicate the Norton Children's Heart Institute to my daughter. They are trying to build out a premier heart program there, and you have to have the funds to be able to do that. So the money gives us a lot of freedom and flexibility — my husband's also starting up his own business — but our work with the children's hospital is the most meaningful and impactful accomplishment.This article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of being a Young Entrepreneur®.

The interior of a home at South Park Cottages.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Booker Washington dreamed of building a community where everyday people could afford to buy a homeEnter South Park Cottages, a village of 29 tiny homes just outside Atlanta that opened in 2023 with prices from $190,000 to $230,000.Compare that to the typical home sold in Atlanta, which Redfin found cost $431,250 as of February 2024.The demand was clear: All 29 homes — one- and two-bedroom units ranging from 400 to 650 square feet — sold out over a year before they were even built and less than two months after hitting the market.



Washington, the 41-year-old owner and founder of micro-home-builder Techie Homes, wanted to offer locals an alternative to renting or buying a traditional single-family home.""Accessible homeownership is an issue in Atlanta,"" he said. ""Our goal is to provide homes at a price point where mortgages are equal to or less than the cost of renting a one-bedroom apartment.""Located in College Park, Georgia, South Park Cottages has been so successful that Washington is building a second community, Union Park Cottages, nearby. Sales for its 26 homes launch later this month.South Park Cottages is also the first Black-owned micro-home community in the Atlanta area. Take a look around.


In 2022, after being rejected by investors and banks, Washington crowdsourced $2 million for the development's construction.The first sketch of the South Park Cottages' layout. Courtesy of Techie Homes via BIWashington spread the word about his vision by word of mouth, garnering support from locals and Bianca Motley Broom, the mayor of College Park since 2020.""Because no one believed in my dream, we went to the people in order to build that community,"" Washington said.""I think there's pent-up anger in urban areas about capital equality. Even if it's a marginal investment return, people want to be a part of something good.""


Backers, who contributed amounts as low as $1,000, were promised a return on their investment once the homes were sold, Washington said.The average rate of return was 12%, he added.Techie Homes acquired the land for South Park Cottages for $150,000 in October 2021 and construction was completed 18 months later.Homes in construction at South Park Cottages. Courtesy of Techie Homes via BIHomes in the community range from 400 to 650 square feet and are two stories tall.Some homes have one bedroom and others have two. All homes have one bathroom, along with a complete kitchen, living room, and laundry.The 29 homes in South Park Cottages went up for presale in January 2022, and sold out within 50 days of hitting the market. Homes were sold on a first-come, first-served basis rather than via bidding wars.The community's homes have three different home layouts.A digital rendering of a home at South Park Cottages. Courtesy of Techie Homes via BIOne of the homes' three layouts features a 10-foot ceiling, an open loft, and floor-to-ceiling windows.The units also feature ""high-grade soundproofing insulation"" within the walls to keep utility bills low, Washington said.Washington wanted each home to feel both luxurious and comfortable.Homes at South Park Cottages.Courtesy of Techie HomesEach home is furnished with smart technology, including self-learning and programmable thermostats, Bluetooth surround-sound speakers, and smart refrigerators, Washington said.Their high ceilings and large windows provide ample natural light and a spacious feel.""We can provide what are called 'luxuries' in other new-construction builds,"" he added.The community covers two and a half acres.An aerial shot of South Park Cottages.Courtesy of Techie HomesSouth Park Cottages has some communal amenities, including a quarter-mile trail for bikers and pedestrians and a 2,000-square-foot fruit and vegetable garden.Residents enjoy gathering around the fire pit.The fire pit at South Park Cottages.Courtesy of Techie Homes


""We don't have a gym or a clubhouse because of the density of homes,"" Washington said. ""But we do have a lot of communal and connection touch points within the community.""A homeowners association, or HOA, governs the community.A walking path at South Park Cottages.Courtesy of Techie HomesThe homeowners association is made up of residents from various ages and walks of life.""Our demographics range from ages 25 to 65, with incomes ranging from $50,000 to millionaires,"" Washington said. ""We have entrepreneurs, teachers, and medical professionals. We also have people that work in blue-collar jobs.""It gives the community a homier feel than using a property management company, he added.South Park Cottages residents have the opportunity to build equity.Another angle of the homes at South Park Cottages.Courtesy of Techie HomesMany tiny-home villages in the US are geared toward renters, but South Park Cottages homes were available for purchase.Homeowners were allowed to choose their preferred lender, Washington said, and the typical monthly mortgage payment is about $1,500.The average rent in Atlanta is $2,100 a month, according to Zillow.Washington said he feels homeowners at South Park Cottages get good value for their money.A living room in a home at South Park Cottages.Courtesy of Techie Homes


Home prices in Atlanta have been steadily increasing. According to Redfin, the median home price in Atlanta of $431,250 is 12% higher than the same time in 2023.The high cost of housing in Atlanta is partly due to an influx of new residents attracted by the city's booming job market and relatively low home prices compared to cities like California and New York.Transplants often make housing more expensive, pricing out some locals.Washington said the community has made a profit for investors.A nighttime view of the homes at South Park Cottages.Courtesy of Techie HomesWashington declined to share how much it cost to build each home but hinted that it was low enough to make a profit.""We achieved somewhere between 30% and 40% of margin within our for-sale price and build-cost price,"" he said, adding that the lower price of construction is ""good for the business and homeowners"" because it allows Techie Homes to keep sale prices affordable.


According to Washington, the community is valued at $6.1 million.The popularity of South Park Cottages inspired Washington to develop a new community in nearby Union City.Washington, the founder and owner of Techie Homes.Courtesy of Techie HomesUnion City, another suburb of Atlanta, is just 15 minutes away from South Park.It will have 26 homes from 625 to 675 square feet, with prices from $230,000 to $250,000. All the units will have two bedrooms and one bathroom, but some will be one-story ranch-style houses and others will be two-story residences.Construction for the community, named Union Park Cottages, will begin on March 26.Homes at Union Park Cottages are scheduled for presale on March 28 and currently have a 3,000-person waitlist, Washington said.


Residents of Union Park Cottages will also have the chance to build equity through a commercial space in the community.Washington at a construction site. Courtesy of Techie Homes via BIA planned mixed-use commercial space at Union Park Cottages will feature a coffee shop, a lounge, and a coworking space.Residents of the community who are a part of the homeowners association will hold a 10% equity stake in the retail center, according to Washington.


""Every month when the proprietor pays into their lease, 10% of the proceeds will go to the homeowners association,"" Washington said. ""The association will disperse the proceeds from the retail center to the current homeowners on record.""

Ben Huffman, CEO and co-founder of Contra, knows what it takes to run a successful freelancing side hustle. Huffman got firsthand experience in the freelancing space as a music producer, working with small labels and, ultimately, Sony Music. The work was fun but ""didn't pay well,"" he tells Entrepreneur, so he started designing apps, pitch decks and websites. Huffman became a ""power user"" on Elance and Odesk, which would merge to become Upwork, and soon ""became fascinated"" with the idea of building a team globally.Image Credit: Courtesy of Contra. Ben Huffman.""I would find projects locally in New York and then hire freelancers from all over the world to help me with the skills I didn't have,"" Huffman recalls. ""I loved the freedom and autonomy of working independently, but even more, I loved working with people from different cultures and backgrounds. Early on, I realized the flaws in the business models of the platforms I used.""



The world was becoming more connected, Huffman explains, and the ""take-rate model"" eBay brought to the fore ""didn't make sense for people and working relationships,"" especially as workers increasingly sought flexibility and employers needed more niche skills. So Huffman set out to create a platform that could address those pain points, and after interviewing thousands of independent workers, discovered they need to think about three things to be successful: creating their identity and credibility, managing their business and finding new leads. Contra, which has raised $45 million from venture capital firms, provides support in all of those areas.Related: How to Start a Freelance Writing Side Hustle


""Contra is commission-free, so our users can keep 100% of their earnings.""""Independent workers can create a profile that showcases their skills and what they can actually do instead of their roles at past companies,"" Huffman says. ""Focusing on projects and skills allows independents to highlight the specific problems they've solved and the value they've delivered. Independents can find new projects from high-quality, vetted clients, manage their business with our free invoices, contracts and proposals, and, most importantly, they can get paid. Contra is commission-free, so our users can keep 100% of their earnings.""Nowadays, nearly two in five U.S. adults have a side hustle, and one in three of them say they use their side hustle earnings to cover everyday expenses, according to a Bankrate survey. Freelance projects can be an accessible, flexible option for people hoping to capitalize on their skill sets, but the most successful will be those who avoid the common pitfalls of the job.Related: 10 of the Most Profitable Side Hustles You Can Start With Little or No MoneyHuffman shares four mistakes that could hinder any side-hustler's success:1. Underpricing your services to attract your first clients""Going down this route can devalue your work,"" Huffman explains, ""and make raising prices much more challenging in the future. Before solidifying your prices, get to know the market you're entering, track industry rates, consider your years of experience and outline your unique expertise; these variables will help you determine a price that works for you and your clients.""2. Not prioritizing your projects the right way""It's important to prioritize projects that fully align with your skill set and politely turn down projects that could be a better fit with someone else,"" Huffman says. ""While many first-time freelancers may regret turning down new projects, taking on too much work can often lead to being overwhelmed and subpar work.""3. Not learning new in-demand skills""Right now, we are seeing a ton of demand for skills like Framer for building websites, video animation and social media management,"" Huffman says. ""There is also a huge opportunity to upskill in the latest AI tools. So much of the world of work is changing because of AI, and there is a huge opportunity to get ahead of it all.""

Not going the extra mile for your clients""Going above and beyond with clients can lead to referrals, more projects in the future and a reputation that will help you build longer-lasting relationships,"" Huffman says. ""To set up any project for success, you will want a well-scoped out set of deliverables and project timeline. Once you have this, you should get everything put into a contract so that you have a framework for your agreement and protection if things get off track.""And one last piece of advice for side hustle success? While growing your network of clients is important, don't forget to cultivate a network of other independent consultants, too. ""Having a community of fellow freelancers to bounce ideas off of and get advice from is invaluable and can lead to new leads in the future,"" Huffman says.

      Key Takeaways    



        I make $125,000 working at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
      


        I own consulting agency Juntero Design, which began as a side hustle.
      


        I'm passionate about Juntero's new subscription-based model, which provides a range of services for a fixed rate.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Chisom Okwulehie, who started consulting agency Juntero as a side hustle when she was an employee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The piece has been edited for length and clarity. In 2017, I started working at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, where I design and manage infrastructure projects. At the height of the pandemic in 2020, I'd had my first child and was told we wouldn't receive a merit-based pay increase at work, so I wanted to find ways to supplement my income. My father always told me and my siblings that if your spouse dies, you have to be able to cover the mortgage and support your family. I'm a big advocate for diversified income.So, I started Juntero as a side hustle with my husband. Now, it's a corporation that we co-own, split into two subsidiary companies or studios: Juntero Design and Juntero Technology. My husband owns Juntero Technology; I own Juntero Design. Today, Juntero is a full-fledged design and technology business, but it all started with me taking on small projects on different platforms and charging as little as $20.



Back then, I watched a lot of YouTube tutorials to prepare and experimented with my different talents — web design, photo editing, graphic design, architecture design and interior design. People gravitated towards my architecture and interior design services. Initially, I kept my prices low to build a portfolio and accumulate strong testimonials. That credibility is the greatest currency and helped me increase my visibility; for every 10 pieces of positive feedback, I'd raise my hourly rate by $20. Eventually, I learned not to trade my time for money and switched to fixed rates.Related: At 23, She Started a Side Hustle for 'Quick Money.' Now the Business Brings in More Than $1 Million a Month — and Boasts Celebrity Fans.


I made about $55,000 that year, and over $200,000 the next. Then, in 2023, I exceeded $400,000.Then, near the end of 2021, I realized that I couldn't help as many clients as I wanted, so I had to put my ego aside and trust other people. I started hiring other designers on a project-based model. They're not employees; they're contractors. So, since 2022, I've outsourced more than 90% of the work. That helped me scale the business even more. I made about $55,000 that year and over $200,000 the next. Then, in 2023, I exceeded $400,000.At Port Authority, my salary is $125,000. The net profits at Juntero alone are higher than my 9-5 salary, but I plan to stay at Port Authority. Some people think I'm crazy, but I'm on a public student loan forgiveness program and have three years left. Also, I learn so much from my colleagues' expertise.Now that I'm not on the production side of Juntero, I spend more time on marketing and client management. We have two payment structures: a one-time payment model and a subscription-based model. I've spent a lot of time marketing the subscription model. It's an idea that came to me last year. One of my major clients is a developer, so with the subscription model, she can pay the monthly rate and access our services for a range of tasks.


Related: How to Go From Side Hustle to 7-Figure Business and Beyond, According to 3 Women Who Did ItA marketer could hire a designer at $100,000 a year or enroll with my service and see even more output. So it's a huge cost savings.I'm very passionate about the subscription model because it's a game changer: It's allowing companies that don't have creative teams to enroll in a membership program and access my creative team for a consistent flow of deliverables, whether it be drawings or 3D models. And it helps these businesses scale, too. One of my clients uses my renderings to consistently sell multimillion-dollar homes over the asking price. With the subscription model, these companies can have five people doing the work for the salary of one; for instance, a marketer could hire a designer at $100,000 a year or enroll with my service and see even more output. So it's a huge cost savings.Related: I Turned My Side Hustle Into a Passive Income Stream That's Earned More Than $1 Million — But Making Money Isn't Even the Best Part

More than half of Gen Zers and millennials have a side hustle, and 80% of them say they need the extra cash due to the state of the economy, according to a recent survey from LendingTree. From driving for rideshare services to teaching courses online, operating cotton candy vending machines, turning your backyard into a dog park, and so much more, there's something for everyone hoping to diversify their income streams — and anyone who might want to launch into full-time entrepreneurship, too.Sometimes, successful side hustlers grow their earnings to the point where they outpace the salaries from their full-time jobs, and it only makes sense to go all in on their new venture. But even people whose side gigs see less initial return might have an entrepreneurial spirit and clear vision that motivates them to commit in full, and with the right strategy and mindset, those businesses can also become highly profitable, hitting six- or even seven-figure months.Below are three women who did just that: Katherine Watercutter, founder and CEO of activewear brand Gold Hinge; Julie Berninger, co-founder of e-printables curriculum Gold City Ventures; and Danielle Cohen-Shohet, founder and CEO of booking and payments platform GlossGenius. Their journeys and areas of expertise are different, but they all know what it takes to go from a side hustle — maybe lucrative, maybe not — to a thriving multimillion-dollar business.

Katherine Watercutter: Gold HingeKatherine Watercutter is the founder and CEO of activewear brand Gold Hinge. When Watercutter was 23 and worked as a sales representative for a distribution company working with kitchen and bath designers around Indiana, she started the business as a side hustle. Lack of funding proved a major hurdle in the beginning, but today, Gold Hinge counts celebrities including Kristin Cavallari and Kaitlyn Bristowe among its fans. The brand also went viral during TikTok's ""RushTok"" trend, garnering 40 million hashtag impressions and sales in the multi-millions.Watercutter's advice: ""My advice may sound as cheesy as it gets, but don't give up. People in this day and age are impatient and sometimes quick to give up when they feel like they keep failing. There were a few times when I thought I hit 'rock bottom' and exhausted all options, but I found a way around it. I felt like I was failing consistently for three years, and I know many would have given up by then, but business is all about problem-solving.""Related: At 23, She Started a Side Hustle for 'Quick Money.' Now the Business Brings in More Than $1 Million a Month — and Boasts Celebrity Fans.Julie Berninger: Gold City VenturesJulie Berninger is an Etsy shop owner and co-founder of Gold City Ventures with Cody Berman. Berninger worked as a project manager for large tech companies and planned to be in the industry long term, but the ""financial independence, retire early"" (FIRE) movement inspired her to start a side hustle. She opened an Etsy shop focused on the bachelorette party niche, then co-founded the online course business that teaches other entrepreneurs how to find success on the platform. She quit her 9-5 in 2021 when the income from her ventures replaced her salary.


Berninger's advice: ""Don't start a business by yourself! Pick a business partner and scale faster! Also, don't waste time trying to piece information together on YouTube. Pay for a step-by-step program or a business consultant because your time is valuable.""Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a MonthDanielle Cohen-Shohet: GlossGeniusDanielle Cohen-Shohet is the CEO and founder of GlossGenius, an all-in-one booking, payments and point-of-sale solution that helps beauty and wellness professionals drive bookings and grow their business. In college, Cohen-Shohet did freelance makeup out of her dorm room, and she and her twin sister also collaborated on a digital receipts payments venture. Ultimately, she'd pull from those experiences to help self-care entrepreneurs run better businesses — and build a software company worth over $510 million in the process.Cohen-Shohet's advice: ""Be fearless. Don't take no for an answer. And, importantly, surround yourself with like-minded people. You might find this through a community like the one we've created for entrepreneurs with GlossGenius, or you might look to people closest to you. I've had many close supporters along the way, but my strongest collaborator is my twin sister, Leah. She has been a thought partner from day one and has played an invaluable role in expanding the company into what it is today. So surround yourself with people who get you.""

The allure of starting a home business has never been stronger, with many people either supplementing their 9-to-5 income or leaving their day jobs altogether to follow their creative entrepreneurial dreams. With the rise of easier-to-navigate ecommerce platforms and social media marketing, people are finding unprecedented opportunities to turn passion into profit.One in three Americans report having a side hustle, and it can be easy to see why with all of the tools available to make entrepreneurial aspirations a reality. Starting a home apparel printing business is just one option for the more creatively inclined.Though you may not have any idea of how to begin a home printing business, many people just like you begin with a little corner of their home, some equipment and a few good ideas to get started. With the right approach to design, quality materials and customer service, those who decide to begin home apparel printing businesses can enjoy wide profit margins, not to mention the satisfaction of being one's own boss.



Related: Learn How to Start a T-Shirt Merch Business as a Side HustleA solid side hustleSeveral aspects of the home apparel printing business make it an excellent side hustle option. Think about all of the places you go in a day — the grocery store, your kid's soccer game, PTA meetings or your day job. There is one constant among people and what they are wearing: customization.


People love clothing that shows off their personality, their favorite band or a quirky saying that endears them to a particular social group. There is never a shortage of people who will be willing to shell out for custom-designed apparel, whether it's fun t-shirts, team uniforms or accessories.In addition, startup costs for a home apparel printing business can be relatively low compared to other side hustle options. Many custom printing machines can be purchased at a relatively affordable price, flexible payment options are available, and materials are readily available either online or even at your local hobby shop. You can stock up on t-shirts, sweatshirts, tote bags or even hats and other accessories in bulk or take advantage of sales to get yourself started and enter the market without breaking the bank.This side hustle is also extremely flexible and great for busy parents, people with day jobs or even those with other side hustles because it can easily be integrated into your existing schedule. Operating out of one's home also adds further flexibility while reducing business overhead.A home apparel printing business is also extremely scalable. As demand and access to resources grow, side hustlers can expand their businesses as they see fit. This can include growing the online portion of one's business for more passive income, leveraging new community connections for larger custom apparel orders or offering new, unique printed products.


Related: This Former Stay-at-Home Mom Started a 'Zero Experience' Side Hustle That's Earned Over $500,000 — and She Doesn't Work More Than 1 Hour a DayGetting startedTo get started with a home apparel printing business, you must follow some key steps.1. Research and planDo some digging into the market to see where you can add value that may currently be missing. There are multiple printing options available, and each has its pros and cons.One of the newest and most popular methods on the market, particularly for home-based businesses, is direct-to-film printing. Also known as DTF printing, it does not require pretreatment of the garment, the hot melt powder that is used bonds directly to any material, and you can print on bulkier items that would be otherwise impossible with other printing options. In addition, DTF transfers can be cut and stored for later use, meaning decorators can print their most popular designs in bulk for a more streamlined customization process.


The versatility of DTF printing contributes to it being the most popular choice for at-home printing businesses overall. The demand for customized apparel has led to DTF printing nearing a market value of $1.7 billion by 2026.2. Invest in the right equipmentOnce you complete your research and know what kind of approach you want to take, invest in the best equipment for the kind of printing you'd like to do. Keep an eye on quality, first and foremost, to get your side hustle off on the right foot.3. Design and creativityThink about starting a portfolio of designs for your business. For example, if you are catering to local sports teams, they may have ready-made designs. Or if you have a great idea for a unique apparel design, you can easily take it from idea to reality with design software.4. MarketingToday, marketing is multifaceted and multilayered. Set up social media accounts for your new business, network face-to-face within your community, and get people to wear your creations where they will be seen and noticed. Sit down and work out a comprehensive marketing plan that can help grow your business to new heights.


5. Be ready to pivotEven the smallest of side hustles need to grow and adapt. Within your apparel printing business, that may mean taking on larger commissions, going after group orders or hopping onto fashion trends when they emerge. The most successful side hustlers are the ones who can shift with the market.Related: 10 of the Most Profitable Side Hustles You Can Start With Little or No MoneyThose with an entrepreneurial spirit and a creative vision could thrive with a home-based apparel printing business.

      Key Takeaways    



        Watercutter says she's always had an entrepreneurial spirit, but the side hustle proved challenging at the start. 
      


        Cash flow was one of the biggest hurdles; it took ""a lot of discipline and learning"" to push the business forward. 
      


        The brand's since gone viral on TikTok and began hitting seven-figure revenue months last year.

Katherine Watercutter.What was your day job when you started your side hustle, and why were you interested in entrepreneurship?



I was a sales representative for a distribution company working with kitchen and bath designers around Indiana (I studied interior architecture and design). I have always been an entrepreneur since I was young; you have to have that as a part of you to be willing to take risks.When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?


I got the idea for it in 2018 and started it in January 2019. There really was no inspiration — I thought it could make me quick money. But I was wrong about that.Related: He 'Accidentally Discovered' a Semi-Passive Side Hustle in College — Now He's on Track to Make More Than $500,000 This YearWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I started a Shopify store and created a website and an Instagram.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?One of the biggest challenges early on was cash flow. I didn't receive funding from outside investors and started with very little to invest. So there were a few times where I almost had to close the doors because of cash flow. It taught me a very valuable lesson early on because businesses often fail the first year when they run out of money. I navigated that by getting a line of credit from the bank and a business credit card, which helped with funds, but I also almost maxed those out. It took a lot of discipline, learning and watching the numbers to navigate this challenge until I saw more consistent growth and revenue.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?The side hustle didn't earn anything. It wasn't until a few years into making it my full-time job, dedicating 80-90 hours a week, that I actually started making money, and I didn't pay myself until about 2021. It is hard to say how long it took for consistent revenue because it wasn't until the spring or summer of 2020 that revenue took off — but later that year, it dropped again. It is safe to say that 2021 was the year that revenue was actually ""consistent"" enough to feel safe where debt was paid off, and things were headed in the right direction. So that would be a total of about three years (two years all-in on my business).

People in this day and age are impatient and sometimes quick to give up when they feel like they keep failing. There were a few times when I thought I hit ""rock bottom"" and exhausted all options, but I found a way around it.

27,15 Weird and Wonderful Side Hustles You Never Knew Existed,"Mar 5, 2024",Amanda Breen and Frances Dodds,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/15-weird-and-wonderful-side-hustles-you-never-knew-existed/470122,"
If you've been hearing a lot about side hustles lately, you're not alone. The term has slipped into our common consciousness in recent years—so much so that Merriam-Webster added it to its dictionary in 2022. ""Side-hustle is a word on the move,"" the entry says. ""Although the precise definition of this term is still in a bit of flux, it appears to be centering on 'work performed for income supplementary to one's primary job.'"" ""In a bit of flux"" is right. Having a side hustle means many things to many people. Some rely on the extra cash to pay their bills, others want a fun hobby that makes a little money, and still others want to build an entirely new business or career.A 2023 Bankrate survey found that nearly 2 in 5 of all American adults now have side hustles, and more than half of all Gen Zers and millennials. Among these younger side-hustlers, 1 in 5 Gen Zers and 1 in 4 millennials hope to one day make their side gig their full-time job. Factors like the normalization of remote work and a general sense of economic instability have surely fueled this trend, but one thing is clear: It's not slowing down. As one side-hustler, Justin Cambra, told us: ""In today's world, stability is from multiple sources of income. I'm trying to generate as many revenue streams as possible."" Hopefully, the following ideas will help you do just that.Breed bugs.

      Key Takeaways    



        I uploaded my ""MBA in a Day"" course on the online learning platform Udemy in 2016. 
      


        The single course has generated more than seven figures in passive income, but it's not about the money for me. 
      


        I have 72 other courses online, and I use the profits from my business to build schools. 
      



















Courtesy of Chris Haroun


This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Chris Haroun, CEO and founder of Haroun Education Ventures. It has been edited and condensed for clarity. After I graduated from business school at Columbia, I worked at Goldman Sachs for five years. Then, I switched to the hedge fund industry, and Citadel hired me and relocated my family to the San Francisco Bay Area. There, I eventually switched to the venture capital sector. And I found that my happiest day at work was always the first day. And then it went downhill, and I couldn't understand why. I did fine at work, but I thought maybe I was depressed or something. But it was because I hadn't found my passion.During the years I worked at other companies, I found that during my annual review, it was always uncomfortable for my bosses because they would say something like, ""You're doing a great job. You're a top performer. Everybody loves working with you. But can you spend a little bit less time mentoring other people on other teams?"" And I always said, ""It's just who I am. I can't change the DNA of who I am."" I love helping people. So I started teaching.



Related: 4 Passive Income Ideas to Try as a Side Hustle in 2024In 2016, while I was still working in venture capital, I started teaching during the evenings in East Palo Alto. I felt alive helping those students. I loved it. Then I started to teach at a couple of Bay Area MBA universities. One Saturday, I taught a course that I called ""MBA in a Day"" through the LEMO Foundation, which serves under-resourced student-athletes. And the next day, I just threw up a camera at home and recorded myself for eight hours. Then I uploaded it to the online learning and teaching platform Udemy.


That course has sold close to 500,000 times, generating a passive income stream of seven figures in net profit after all expenses. And I continued to scale: Now, I have 72 other courses on Udemy and nearly two million students across the globe. And although this work can be relatively low-touch from a customer service perspective, the goal isn't just to make money. It's to help others. I spend a lot of time helping students, jumping on Zoom calls and answering questions.The profits from what I do go toward building schools. If you go to Project Magu, you'll see the first school that I built with one of my students in Rwanda. And with another one of my students, I'm building the second school now in Kenya, about a six-hour drive from Nairobi. It's a school for girls.Related: Anyone Can Start a Passive Income Side Hustle For Easy Money — But Only If You Know These 5 Essential Tips First.It's a great sense of purpose for me. When I was at the LEMO Foundation, the founder of that charity told me something that changed me. He said, ""You can't expect to realize your dreams in life unless you help others achieve theirs first."" So we're all here, as Tony Robbins once told me, to serve others and to help other people. And so that's what I did.


The pandemic was tragic, but it really pulled forward my vision of the future of education by at least a decade. And I think that in my lifetime, only 50 universities will make it. I think what's going to happen, ultimately, is that most will deplete their endowments, and then there'll be a Hail Mary pass to alumni to save the schools, and then people will think to themselves, Why bother going to university unless it's a great brand like a Harvard or Oxford? The system is elitist to the extent that a lot of children get into top schools because their parents went there or they donated money. Another problem is that you pay $100,000 for 20 hours of class per week, and you graduate without any skills.In my book 101 Crucial Lessons They Don't Teach You in Business School, I outline the problem with MBA schools. They don't teach you how to sell. They don't teach you how to network to get a job. They don't teach you how to manage your own money. They teach you how to manage other people's money. They don't teach you how to present. They don't teach you how to start a company. Graduate and undergraduate business programs teach you theoretical concepts that were relevant maybe last century. So I think that the sector is ripe for disruption. I think Udemy is going to be the catalyst to kind of change the industry where more people are going to learn online.Related: Access our best side hustle stories and make more money.

And it's an amazing story: Years ago before she started teaching on Udemy, she was in an awful marriage with an abusive husband. It was terrible. And she got the courage to leave him and take her kids with her. So she was living off food stamps, and she thought to herself, What can I do to help other people? What am I passionate about? And she's passionate about baking bread. So she put up a camera at home, and she started showing people how to make bread on the platform. Again, everybody has something to teach you.

      Key Takeaways    



        In 2006, El Ghatit was working in IT when he got the idea for a sentimental telephone-based business. 
      


        A few months later, he was laid off and decided to focus on growing his side hustle. 
      


        As a side hustle, the venture earned $100,000 per year; now a full-time business, it's on track to see more than $700,000 in 2024.

Back in 2006, I was working in an IT department of a large employee benefits consulting firm, managing 60 people, and I wasn't feeling fulfilled at my job. I didn't like being in meetings all day, and I wanted to get more hands-on again and work on something more meaningful, but I couldn't see a viable path to doing that where I was.I had been playing around with a telephone system in my spare time and wondered if I could create a business by having people call in and record their favorite stories and memories about a person as a way to celebrate their birthday, retirement, wedding, etc.

The Business Saw Over $650 Million in Annual Revenue Last Year.What were some of the first steps you took to get the side hustle off the ground? My mother-in-law's 65th birthday was coming up, and I thought she'd enjoy hearing from all her kids, grandkids, friends, husband, etc.So, as a trial, I set up a phone number that everyone could call and gave her the resulting recordings on a CD (remember — this was 2006). We all listened to it together on her birthday in her living room. She loved it, there were tears, and it sparked a lot of stories (18 years later, she still loves it).


I thought the idea had some traction, so I worked on it in my spare time to make it a service.A few months later, I got laid off, and I decided to take some time to try and grow the business. People started ordering, but not in the volume that allowed me to support my wife and four young kids, so after nine months, I took a job as a director of IT for a mid-size company where I could be hands-on and manage a small team.Were there any challenges that came with running the side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those? Navigating the side hustle of LifeOnRecord presented three significant challenges. First, I got used to the security of a corporate salary with the entrepreneurial aspect of LifeOnRecord. I enjoyed both, which kept me from fully committing to LifeOnRecord. Despite the automation and minimal time LifeOnRecord required, the camaraderie of my corporate role left me hesitant to leave until 2022.


Additionally, keeping LifeOnRecord a secret from colleagues fostered an emotional barrier, making me more reserved and unable to share valuable insights across both my worlds. This secrecy persisted until the pivotal moment I decided to quit my corporate job. Surprisingly, upon revealing LifeOnRecord to the CEO, I found unexpected support rather than resistance. The company facilitated a smooth transition, allowing me to gradually shift my focus to LifeOnRecord, with the CEO even providing guidance along the way.Lastly, an early challenge involved defending LifeOnRecord's intellectual property against infringement from a multi-national corporation. Through perseverance and direct negotiation, which took over a year, I secured an agreement from them without legal intervention, and I licensed my intellectual property to them for a fair but significant licensing fee.Related: Access our best side hustle stories and make more money. Subscribe to Entrepreneur+ now.How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue? On average, how much revenue did it bring in? 


Growth was gradual, but people who used the service talked about it with others and developed into repeat buyers. Before I focused on it full-time, it brought in a little over $100,000 a year as a side hustle. With my corporate salary, it allowed us to live comfortably, fund college for my kids and go on trips.How much annual revenue is LifeOnRecord projected to see this year? For me, it is not really about the money and growth but more about me being able to provide a personal, customer-focused experience that I can be directly involved in. Having said that, last year was the first year it was a full-time venture, and it brought in about $350,000, and this year we will more than double that amount. We're always super responsive to customer questions and requests, and I don't want it to get so big that stellar customer service is no longer a priority.How have you approached scaling the company? What has really been key in helping it grow? 


Right from the start, my strategy was all about leveraging technology to scale and enhance the customer experience. Recognizing that customers wanted more control over their contributions, I developed a ""My Recordings"" portal for them to edit, organize or delete their messages. I streamlined the audio enhancement process by partnering with Dolby Labs for top-notch voice clarity and noise reduction, and I expanded contribution options beyond traditional phone calls to include six alternative methods.[While] balancing this growth with my corporate responsibilities, I was mindful not to expand too quickly, aiming to maintain a healthy equilibrium between my day job and LifeOnRecord. This balance allowed me to enjoy the perks of both my professional career and my entrepreneurial venture without overwhelming myself or the business.A key innovation was introducing vintage rotary phone rentals for wedding receptions for guests to leave messages for the wedding couple. Unlike competitors that simply rent out the phones, we integrated these pieces into our broader service ecosystem. Guests love the charm of leaving messages on these classic devices, which are then enhanced and preserved through our platform.Related: This Fun, Flexible Side Hustle Pays $35 an Hour and Gets You Into Exclusive CEO Summits, Music Festivals, and Sports EventsAs you look back over your journey with LifeOnRecord, is there anything you wish you would have done differently? There's a lingering thought that maybe I should have stepped away from the corporate world sooner to fully embrace the entrepreneurial path with LifeOnRecord. The allure of stability and a predictable income often held me back, anchoring me to a role that, while comfortable, perhaps limited the potential growth of my passion project. Yet, with every decision comes a silver lining.Staying in my corporate job perhaps longer than I should have afforded me invaluable lessons and experiences. It was in this professional setting that I honed skills that later became crucial in navigating the entrepreneurial landscape: the discipline of managing projects, the art of negotiation and the ability to lead a team.This period also served as a vital incubation phase for LifeOnRecord. It allowed me to slowly but surely build the foundation of the business, testing ideas and refining the model without the immediate pressure of having it be my sole source of income. In a way, it granted me the freedom to experiment and innovate with less risk, laying the groundwork for what LifeOnRecord would eventually become.


What are you most excited about when it comes to LifeOnRecord's future? Customers have used LifeOnRecord in innovative ways. People have used LifeOnRecord to send out audio thank yous, and brides have recorded their feelings of ""saying yes to the dress"" using LifeOnRecord, then played that recording as they walk down the aisle. I think there are many more ways to market LifeOnRecord that we can explore in the future.What's your favorite part about running your own business today? I love the impact the business has on customers. When I had a corporate job, I felt like a cog in a wheel, but with LifeOnRecord, I created a way for people to make a connection with others. I'm especially grateful when people buy it and record messages for someone with a terminal illness. They say it's one of the few things they can do to show how loved the person is.Beyond that, I like the lifestyle flexibility and not needing to be accountable to anyone other than our customers. I love being identified with it and the excitement that other people have when I share what I do.

Everyone loves a side hustle they can do from home. But now that working from home is so common, some of us wouldn't mind getting out of the house in our off-hours — and doing something inspiring, exciting, or social. If that sounds like you, there's a side hustle that might just be perfect. Tremont Turner has been doing it part-time for a decade, and makes about $40,000 a year in extra income.Back in 2014, Turner was working his way through college in Hammond, Indiana, making minimum wage at Chipotle and Panera and dreaming of becoming an actor. One day, a friend of his who did some work as a brand ambassador asked if he could cover for her. She was supposed to work a promotional ESPN event — a fantasy football draft — but something had come up and she couldn't make it.Turner was iffy at first. ""I know nothing about football!"" he said. She assured him it was easy, then told him how much it paid — double what he was making in fast food. ""I was like, what?!"" he recalls. ""Oh, I don't care what it is,"" he said. ""I'm in for sure.""

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Sina Omosowon, founder of the TV-mounting business Shine.Image Credit: Courtesy of Shine. Sina Omosowon. When did you start your side hustle, and what inspired it?



I started my TV-mounting business, Shine, in 2019. I originally started the business as a side hustle to help put myself through school and support my family. At the time, I was earning my Ph.D. in plant evolution, focusing on food crop production and crop improvement. A friend of mine introduced me to TV mounting and showed me there was a growing demand in this space, particularly as more people chose to mount TVs on their walls versus using a stand to help create more space in their homes. I saw an opportunity to make extra money through TV mounting, so I got trained on the basics and started to build out a business from there. My business ultimately helped me pay for school and finish my Ph.D. with no debt.Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a MonthWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?After being introduced to TV mounting, I got trained on the basics and shadowed a friend on a few of his jobs. From there, I tried to consume as much information as I could to learn and grow a base of knowledge, watching a lot of YouTube videos and asking questions. As I continued to complete more and more jobs, my confidence grew.When I first started out, it was important to grow awareness of my business and build trust with customers. Without reviews or much experience, I often got customers by giving discounts on jobs. I also learned the importance of being responsive and getting back to customers quickly. I always had my phone on me so that when a request came in, I was able to quickly answer any questions and schedule an appointment.In addition to word-of-mouth, I registered as a pro on Thumbtack, which helped me find customers in my area who needed my services. It was a great place to build out a profile with reviews and photos from completed jobs so potential customers could learn more about me and my business. As I completed more jobs and built up a bank of positive reviews, it became easier to get more clients. Especially as a young entrepreneur, positive reviews help people trust you and give them confidence that you'll do a good job. I now have nearly 1,000 five-star reviews.


I started out doing around two to three jobs a day, and these jobs took more time as I learned different nuances and built up my confidence. Steadily, I started getting more and more customers and became even more efficient at TV mounting, which allowed me to serve more people in a day. Today I can mount a TV in 15 minutes.Related: The 'Easy' Side Hustle He Started in College Hit More Than $1 Million in Revenue — and Taught Him 3 Business Lessons He Still Uses TodayWere there any challenges that came with running your side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those?One of my biggest challenges initially was having to spend money upfront to get my business off the ground, whether that's purchasing all the tools or giving customers discounts on jobs to build up a client roster. This initial investment was important, particularly because it's crucial to have the right equipment for jobs requiring construction. Luckily, I was able to recoup the money I spent upfront after a few months of work.


How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue? I started seeing consistent monthly revenue about six months after I started. After getting my Ph.D., I received job offers in the plant science space, but my business was also taking off, so I had to weigh my options. It's always been my dream to be my own boss, so I decided to invest in my TV mounting business and take the entrepreneurial path.How much average monthly revenue do you earn now? I earn about $30,000 per month through my TV-mounting business.You've since turned your side hustle into a full-time business. What do you enjoy most about it?Owning my own business lets me control how I spend my time. I can schedule jobs around family commitments and decide when to work and when not to work. I also really enjoy interacting with people on a daily basis and putting a smile on their faces with a job well done. There's a lot of satisfaction in owning your own business.Related: 3 Secrets to Starting a High-Income Side Hustle in 2024, According to People Whose Gigs Make More Than $20,000 a MonthDo you have any advice for others interested in this gig? What should they know before they get started?


My biggest piece of advice for anyone interested in being an entrepreneur is to make customer satisfaction a priority. When you're just starting out, money should not be the priority. It's more important to satisfy the customer, get good reviews and build up a strong client base who can refer you to friends and family. With consistency and steadfastness, the money will come. Prioritize customer satisfaction, and everything will fall into place.

      Key Takeaways    



        A Georgia-based millennial is earning over $250,000 a year secretly working two remote jobs.
      


        He said his childhood made him want financial security and that overemployment provides him job security.
      


        The IT professional shared his four pieces of advice for overemployed workers.

A Georgia millennial says a desire for financial security motivated him to work multiple jobs in secret. Worker in the story not pictured.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Tomas, a Georgia-based IT worker in his 30s, said his journey to an ""overemployed"" lifestyle began at a very young age.He grew up ""very poor,"" he told Business Insider, and after his mother left his father, he, his mother, and four siblings shared a one-room apartment for two years.



""As I got older I was like, 'I don't want to live like that,"" he said.In 2016, when Tomas had roughly $40,000 in credit card debt and was struggling to pay child support, he decided to look for a second remote job he could work on the sly. Two years later, job juggling had helped him pay off his debt, but he wasn't ready to give it up.


""I kind of felt invincible, and it made me feel like that will be one less thing I have to worry about in life,"" said Tomas, whose identity is known to BI but has been withheld due to his fear of professional repercussions.To this day, Tomas is secretly working two full-time remote jobs that pay over $250,000 a year in combined salaries, according to documents viewed by BI. Doing so has helped him grow his net worth to over $500,000, pay off two new cars, travel more, and find ""financial stability and freedom,"" he said. Tomas added that he'd love to have a third job if he can find the right fit.Tomas is among a small group of U.S. workers — many in the tech and IT industries — secretly holding multiple remote jobs. Working more than one job at once may not violate federal or state laws, but it could breach some employment contracts and be a fireable offense if a worker is ever found out.As layoffs have spread across the tech industry, Tomas said the extra job security that comes with overemployment has become even more important. He's even encouraged some colleagues to look for second jobs and provided advice on pulling it off.


""Companies will terminate you or lay you off without any notice at all,"" he said. ""I now have the belief that everyone should always keep two jobs.""Finding the right job for over-employment isn't easyTomas has had several different stints as an overemployed worker.Roughly a year after he began his overemployment, he decided to take a break. He said one of his jobs became much more demanding and that he wanted to adjust to the workload before he took on a second job again.Additionally, throughout this career, Tomas has worked a mix of full-time and contract jobs, and the latter have typically had an expiration date.


As pandemic fears have eased in recent years, Tomas said he's also worked for companies that required employees to return to the office. Given working remotely was key to his overemployment, he decided to part ways with those employers.These job separations are the main reason Tomas has had roughly seven different jobs since 2017. While he's generally had no more than two jobs at once, he said there were three to four months when he had three jobs — and one month when he had four. All but one of his jobs were remote — he said flexible working hours enabled him to juggle a hybrid and remote role for a while.At his peak, Tomas said he earned close to $400,000 across his jobs in a single year.Four pieces of advice for over-employed workersTomas has four suggestions for people interested in the over-employed lifestyle.


First: Know your job well so you can complete tasks quickly and dedicate time to your other jobs. Second: Figure out which job has more flexibility so you can reschedule those meetings if need be. Third: To appear constantly online for a job, don't rely on mouse jigglers — he said he thinks some IT departments can figure out when workers are using the latter. Fourth: If you think your boss is suspicious of you, it's probably time to leave that job.Tomas said job juggling has been fairly easy in his two current roles. Both jobs have flexible hours, and his shifts start at different times of the day — with only three hours of overlap between them. He said he's only had one or two overlapping meetings that have required him to come up with an excuse for missing one of them.But during a prior overemployment stint, Tomas said he had a boss who seemed to suspect he was job juggling — asking questions like why he was online well past working hours. When these questions didn't go away, Tomas decided to leave the job.Unless he finds one job that pays him over $250,000 a year, roughly his current combined salaries, Tomas said he has no plans to give up his overemployment.""I'm going to keep going as long as I can,"" he said, adding, ""The rewards definitely outweigh the labor.""

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Julie Berninger, Etsy shop owner and co-founder of Gold City Ventures with Cody Berman. What was your 9-5 job and/or primary source of income when you started your Etsy shop?I worked as a project manager for large tech companies. I have my masters in computer information systems and planned to work in the tech field forever.When did you start your Etsy side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?I listened to personal finance podcasts on my lunch break and commute to and from work. I was inspired by people who started Etsy and Amazon shops as side hustles. I was also inspired by the ""financial independence, early retirement"" (FIRE) movement, where people traded in office jobs for jobs with more lifestyle freedom. I loved my job, but I also loved to travel and wanted a bit more flexibility with how and where I worked.



Related: His Side Hustle Solved a Common Problem for Homeowners. Now the Business Brings in $3 Million a Month During Peak Season.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I picked a niche on Etsy that I knew very well: the bachelorette party niche because I was going to a bunch of bachelorette parties. I noticed how people were willing to pay for throwaway items for those events, and order quantities were high because so many people attended the event (usually groups of 15-20 women, with one person making the large purchase for the group). It seemed like a great niche for my shop. I started with temporary tattoos because I knew they would be easy to store in my tiny apartment in Silicon Valley. I didn't have room to sell larger pieces. I didn't have a budget for photography, but I put the tattoos on, went for neighborhood walks and took pictures in front of my neighbors' beautiful rose bushes. There are some gorgeously landscaped lawns in Silicon Valley!What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?


I was averaging around $15-$20 per order with the temporary tattoos, but I was stressed for time. I was squeezing in trips to the post office before and after work. I was also podcasting and interviewing eight guests per week about how they achieved financial independence. I met someone at a conference who sold printables on Etsy, and I was hooked. I switched my product line to selling bachelorette party scavenger hunts and was convinced digital products were the way to go going forward because they required less time. There is very little to no work done after the sale.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill. It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue, and at what point did the side hustle's income surpass that of your full-time job (if it did)?I made around $10,000 per year selling digital products as a side hustle on Etsy. My plan wasn't to leave my day job, though, since I loved working in tech. I didn't have a plan or the space in my life for selling on Etsy to become a full-time thing. Full-time entrepreneurship happened slowly over time. I was also a well-paid tech employee with a master's degree, so it felt very scary to take a leap — and it would have taken a while to replace my income. But I did make six figures total over a few years between Etsy and blogging about my personal finance journey. I eventually left my full-time job in 2021; by then, the money from my ventures replaced my full-time job.


When and how did that side hustle lead to Gold City Ventures? How does Gold City Ventures help aspiring side hustlers?The episodes on my podcast about my side hustles were always the favorite episodes with listeners. I recorded how I created and sold digital products on Etsy in YouTube videos first.I had my first kid in 2019, and I launched Gold City Ventures, my online course business, soon after with a business partner using those videos as the main curriculum. We've improved our curriculum over the years and now have the step-by-step course to start an Etsy shop for digital products.Over 15,000 students have bought the course, and some have achieved some amazing results. We've had students who make this their full-time job and have earned over $70,000 in one year on Etsy. It's been a lot of fun to help people start small businesses.


What I love about Etsy is that it brings the customers (90 million per year) to you, and digital products are a low-risk small business since it doesn't cost much to start, and you don't have to buy inventory; you are just spending your time. It's also good if someone only has a few hours extra per week and just wants a side hustle.Related: This Former Teacher Started a Side Hustle That Made More Than $22,000 in One Month: 'I Have Never Been More Fulfilled'How much average monthly revenue does Gold City Ventures bring in now?Gold City Ventures makes over $100,000 per month, and we've expanded to offer many additional services such as live coaching, a community and done-for-you templates.


What's your best advice for other side hustlers who hope to find success selling online?Don't start a business by yourself! Pick a business partner and scale faster! Also, don't waste time trying to piece information together on YouTube. Pay for a step-by-step program or a business consultant because your time is valuable.

Image Credit: Courtesy of Pan's Mushroom JerkyWhat was your full-time job and/or primary source of income prior to starting your side hustle? Did it change over the course of your side hustle journey?I earned an electrical engineering degree from the University of Illinois, and I spent most of my career at Motorola/Continental Automotive in Chicago.Along the way, I launched a tech startup with friends until we sold the business in 2016.



These full-time jobs allowed me to test the market, learn and iterate along the way. Finally in 2016, I was in a position to dedicate everything to Pan's, and I made the transition to work on the business full-time.Related: These Sisters Started a Side Hustle After a 'Light Bulb' Moment Standing in Line for Coffee — Now Their Business Has Done $100 Million in Total SalesWhen did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?I took a trip to visit family in 2006 in Malaysia, where I met a vegetarian cousin who had been making our family's mushroom snack for years. As vegetarians, they had trouble finding foods that not only tasted great but also had great texture. And they found that mushrooms were very satisfying and healthy.


This opened my eyes to an amazing culture with innovative foods that mimic the texture of meat. I fell in love with the product and its history, and I knew our family had a snack that needed to be shared with the world.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I first learned how to import the product from my family in Malaysia. I sampled the product as often as I could to test demand and gather consumer feedback. I quickly found out that many types of people, including non-vegetarians, loved it because it was a healthy snack that tasted great.I started selling on our website (which we powered through Shopify) and Amazon for direct business. I started to cold email, call and visit as many stores as I could to get more sales and distribution.


Meanwhile, I also did some product development and worked on transferring production to the United States. I rented small kitchen spaces, made products, tested, iterated and repeated that process frequently. I used the cash from online sales and sampling events to reinvest back into the business.Related: After This 26-Year-Old Got Hooked on ChatGPT, He Built a 'Simple' Side Hustle Around the Bot That Brings In $4,000 a MonthWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?It's hard to avoid the amount of capital it requires to get started from scratch. Luckily I had some 401k cash along with debt I could leverage to help get the business off the ground.


How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent weekly or monthly revenue?It took about two years.When did it surpass the income of your full-time job?After about year three, I started making enough income to match my previous full-time job.When did you decide to go all-in and transition from side hustle to full-time business?After wrapping up another startup venture in 2016, I decided to go all in on the business.Luckily at that time, all the trends were aligning. Mushrooms were trending; healthy, on-the-go snacking was still gaining popularity; and plant-based foods were booming. I felt confident that we had product-market fit and a quality product that would succeed.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill.

38,How to Understand Limiting vs. Productive Attitudes Among Day Traders,"Jan 31, 2024",Ross Cameron,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-understand-limiting-vs-productive-attitudes-among/468701,"
The requirements for day traders are straightforward:You need knowledge of the profession. There's indeed a lot to learn, but it's not mystical. If you put in the hours, you can acquire a solid foundation of knowledge over some months.You'll need basic computer gear. When I was a day trader cub, I thought it was cool to have ten monitors and a powerful computer tower. I discovered it was overload. Now, I use a standard laptop and just three monitors.You need a day trading brokerage account. U.S. accounts require a minimum of $25,000 to be maintained in the account, but you can open a foreign one with $500.This brings us to the last requirement: the right applied attitude.When I say ""applied attitude,"" I mean you can have the best attitude, but if you don't take actions consistent with that attitude, you'll fail. For example, if your attitude tells you that you need to be done with trading for the day because of the mistakes you just made — but you decide to take just one more trade — you will soon be toast.



What are examples of trading attitudes that harm or help? Here are four:1. Fear as a brake vs. fear as a motivatorMy inspiration for working hard to become a successful day trader had nothing to do with seeing myself driving a Lamborghini. It had to do with seeing myself homeless if I didn't find a solution, pronto.


I lived in a modest house in Vermont with my dog. My trading account was down to the $25k minimum, and I had $30k in credit card debt. I was also down to the last few things I could sell on Craigslist to raise cash.Fortunately, I had kept a trading journal. As a last gasp before taking up some other profession, I analyzed my winning and losing trades and found certain patterns. Long story short, I turned my trading around. If that fear had led to inaction, it would have ended my trading career.Related: Want to Make Enough Money to Live A Great Life? Start By Setting Your ""Freedom Number""2. Scarcity vs. abundanceA close cousin to a fear mindset is a scarcity one. The first saying I ever learned was: ""A penny saved is a dollar earned."" Money was always tight, as we were continually reminded.


I learned about my great-grandfather, who was on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in 1929 on the day of the crash. He lost everything. That trauma rippled down through the generations to me. I had the feeling not only of scarcity but that you couldn't depend on others for job security. That was reinforced by what happened to my mother: After four decades of working at a hospital, she was laid off.Years later, I learned about my great-grandfather's brother-in-law. He started an investment company following the Great Depression, and he made millions.Here we have a member of my extended family, in the same enveloping Great Depression, who engineered a vastly different outcome. I was intrigued by how this branch of my family did not have a scarcity mindset. It opened the door in my mind to the possibility of thinking differently.Let's jump to today. Not only have I turned $583 into more than $10 million by day trading, but I've had the privilege of working with thousands of other people on their own day trading journeys. I see two other attitudes at work in some of them.

But this characteristic can be taken to an extreme — it can invalidate any advice.Let's say you're reading about a successful franchise owner. You love how this person overcame many obstacles to get where she got. Then you have a choice:You can look for reasons why your circumstances are different and her situation does not apply. For example, you might think: ""It's easy for her to succeed, but English is my second language."" Or ""It was easy for her because she benefited from the whole pandemic hysteria, and we're now over that.""


If you look hard enough, you can find endless reasons why someone's success differs from your circumstances.Or you can look for handholds.Think about rock climbers: At any moment, there are a hundred ways not to move up the wall, but they look for one little spot to grab to pull themselves higher toward their goal.The path of least resistance is to look for reasons why someone else's success does not apply to you. The path of progress comes when you find what you can use from that person's example.

But when you are learning a skill, the time to show how unique you are is after you've mastered the skill.There are three types of cooks: those who wing it and are happy, those who read a recipe but don't follow it, and those who follow the recipe. If these people try day trading, only one has a hope of succeeding.If you wing it, come across a hot tip, open a day trading account and have at it, you will be slaughtered in minutes.If you study successful traders but decide that you can modify their advice, you're doing so with no experience. Your days are numbered.If you first follow their instructions, this allows you to stand on their shoulders and learn their discoveries. In time, you can then modify their principles to match your experience.Day trading for beginners is difficult enough without hobbling yourself with ineffective methods. The right mindset is a foundation on which to make effective decisions. Those moment-by-moment decisions will determine your success in this wonderful but challenging profession.

        LePrix leverages the founders' industry knowledge to pioneer the B2B pre-owned luxury market.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Elise Whang and Emily Erkel, co-founders of B2B marketplace platform LePrix, which offers a curated space for sourcing pre-owned luxury items from top suppliers around the world.LePrix has done more than $100 million in topline gross merchandise value since launch. It has raised $15 million to date and is the largest B2B pre-owned luxury platform globally, with over 150,000 units of pre-owned luxury at wholesale prices per month, according to the company.How did your corporate careers prepare you to launch the side hustle that would become LePrix? 



Whang: Early on in my legal career, I had the opportunity to meet entrepreneurs from mega-corporations who had built their businesses from scratch. Their journey was fascinating and inspiring to me; however, I quickly realized entrepreneurs are often over-glamorized. Lawyers see all the blemishes and the challenges and hardships business owners face as well. This experience helped me take the proverbial leap with my eyes wide open. Importantly, being a lawyer also trained me how to write thoughtfully, be persuasive and take measured risks. I also learned that what I enjoyed most about being a lawyer would carry over to being an entrepreneur — helping people and fixing problems.Erkel: My career in retail strategy consulting prepared me for the launch of LePrix in so many ways. Each project was a different opportunity to help a client overcome a challenge and succeed — whether it was launching a large Japanese fast-fashion retailer in the U.S., helping a women's specialty retailer go omnichannel or [helping] an iconic luxury brand house known for its handbags expand into other categories. The skills I learned to quickly identify the problem, be creative with the solution and help the retailer execute helped me learn the skills that every entrepreneur needs: strategy, execution, grit and adaptability.


Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill. It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.When did you start the side hustle that would become your company, and what was the inspiration behind it? Whang: When that first amazing business idea dawns on you, it is like a bright light bulb going off in your head. It first lit up when I was standing in line for coffee before work knowing I had to work over the weekend. What I really wanted to do over the weekend was go to my favorite consignment stores with my sisters, but these stores all closed at 7 p.m., and I could not get there. So why not bring all these wonderful designer consignment stores online? This first iteration of our business was consumer-facing, aiming to aggregate the best designer consignment stores online in one platform. This laid the groundwork for our present business model, focusing on business-to-business (B2B) pre-owned luxury wholesale.In the early days, I juggled my entrepreneurial pursuits with my demanding role as a lawyer. My side hustle typically unfolded between 8 p.m. to 2 or 3 a.m. and consumed weekends for several years. Fast forward — the light bulb went off again when we saw that our stores were buying from each other more and more on our platform. We realized they needed a way to source pre-owned authentic handbags and jewelry from other trusted businesses online. We then launched the first B2B pre-owned luxury wholesale auction houses from across the globe to retailers in the U.S., and it grew from there.


At which point did you decide to leave your corporate jobs to focus on LePrix full-time, and what motivated you to take the leap? Whang: I was eight months pregnant, happily married, with a great job as a lawyer. I was patting myself on the back for being the first female lawyer in our family. But I was also panicking that life was going by at warp speed, and if I didn't take the leap soon to work on this great business plan, it may never happen. In hindsight, I was probably going through a midlife crisis. We applied to an accelerator program and got in, but they required only full-time founders, which meant I had to quit my day job. I was scared about what our immigrant parents, who worked their behinds off to give us the American dream, would think. My husband asked me what I was going to do — and I said I wanted to take a bet on this business; otherwise, I'd regret it on my deathbed (I know, dramatic). I popped out my baby and then started my entrepreneurial journey. I haven't looked back since.Related: Being 'Lazy' Paid Off: Her Failed Side Hustle Led to a Business That Brings in Over $100 Million a YearErkel: At the time, I had been at a large specialty retailer, working with the leadership team on different strategies, from growing their new baby business to exploring ways to shorten lead time from design to delivery. It was an amazing experience and a great team, but part of me yearned to build something that was more aligned with my passion growing up. When I was younger, I was obsessed with fashion, especially luxury and vintage. When my co-founder and sister, Elise, approached me with the idea of launching this as a side hustle, my gut reaction was an immediate yes. Once we started gaining traction and growing quickly, I knew it was time to go full-time, but I was nervous. Innately, I am more risk averse, but the numbers (and Elise) are very convincing. Would I rather be a cog in a wheel or chart my own course and try something new and exciting that there was clearly a market demand for? The answer was clear.


What have been some of the biggest challenges you've faced over the course of your founding journey so far, and how have you overcome them? Whang: One of the significant challenges we faced was securing funding from venture capitalists (VCs). The reality of less than 5% of female founders successfully raising funds from VCs is real. Our company deviates from the conventional VC company profile; we're far from resembling the stereotypical characters depicted in the HBO show Silicon Valley (one of my favorite shows). Notably, our team is 60% BIPOC, with two female founders, and we take immense pride in this diversity. We have, however, successfully secured funds from private investors and early-stage VCs who wholeheartedly believe in our vision, the business, its potential and our team.Erkel: Another challenge was the pivot from B2C to B2B. It was clear that the way to help our stores was not selling but sourcing. For businesses, sourcing pre-owned luxury is difficult, risky and expensive because the wholesale industry for luxury resale is highly fragmented. As our B2B business continued to take off, Elise and I knew it was time to sunset our B2C business. It was a decision we thought very carefully about as the B2C business was not only our first baby, but we had also built a pretty successful business. However, the growth of the B2B business was immense, and with limited resources and time, we knew it was time to double down on B2B.Related: I Spent the Last 3 Years Building My Side Hustle Into a Full-Time Business. Here's What I Learned.What are you most excited about as you look to LePrix's future? Erkel: As the leader in the B2B pre-owned luxury industry, we are most excited to be the driving force making luxury resale accessible to retailers globally. We have the opportunity to change the industry, help retailers meet consumer demand and, most importantly, make a sustainable impact.What's your best advice for other side hustlers who hope to turn their gigs into full-time ventures?Whang: Don't quit your day job until you have some data or traction. DO build out a business model with your data and make an informed decision to take the leap. Don't obsess about hyper growth anymore, but DO build a profitable business — it's still a business. Don't kick yourself for failing. DO learn from your mistakes and quickly pivot.


Erkel: Don't be scared to take the leap. Life is short, and time is limited. If your side hustle shows traction and the only thing that is holding you back is fear, overcome it. Don't let fear dictate your life and stop you from moving forward. Life is more fulfilling if you're doing what you love.

40,4 Ways to Make Over $1 Million With Your Online Business,"Jan 25, 2024",Mohamed Elhawary,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-hit-1-million-in-online-sales/468501,"
In my journey to achieving $1M in ecommerce sales, I've navigated countless challenges and uncovered key strategies that truly drive success. In sharing these insights, my aim is to offer you a clear, hands-on guide — a blueprint that's been tested in the real world of online retail.We'll dive into identifying profitable niches, building a unique brand identity, harnessing data for marketing and effectively scaling your business.Related: Don't Be a Waiter — Be a Creator. 5 Ways to Create Opportunities for Yourself In 2024



1. Identify high-demand, low-competition nichesWithin the realm of dropshipping, the key was identifying the right niche. This required a strategic approach to understanding market demand, especially in areas underserved by larger players.I began by harnessing Google Keyword Planner to discover niche products within broader categories. For example, I focused on unique sub-niches like 'handcrafted gemstone earrings' or 'vintage-inspired brooches' in the jewelry sector. These were terms with considerable search volume but limited competition, indicating a potential market gap.


Next, I used SEMrush to conduct a competitive analysis. This involved studying what competitors were offering and, more importantly, what they weren't. I looked for patterns in overlooked products or customer needs not being fully addressed.This step was crucial in confirming the potential of the chosen niche.Related: This Former Stay-at-Home Mom Started a 'Zero Experience' Side Hustle That's Earned Over $500,000 — and She Doesn't Work More Than 1 Hour a Day2. Craft a unique brand propositionEstablishing a distinctive brand identity was essential for my ecommerce venture, particularly in the competitive jewelry space. This went beyond just a logo or a tagline; it was about creating an emotional connection with customers.


The first step was to define the brand's unique value proposition. I focused on what set my jewelry offerings apart — was it the artisanal craftsmanship, the ethical sourcing of materials, or perhaps a fusion of traditional and modern designs?This clear definition helped shape all aspects of branding, from the website design to social media presence.I utilized tools like Canva to design visually appealing graphics that resonated with my brand's aesthetic. Platforms like Shopify offered customizable templates for creating a cohesive and professional-looking online store that matched the brand's image.Social media plays a pivotal role in storytelling. Through platforms like Instagram and Pinterest, known for their visual appeal, I showcased the jewelry, shared stories behind the designs, and engaged with the audience. This built a community around the brand, enhancing customer loyalty.


But it wasn't just about online presence; customer experience was key. Every touchpoint, from product packaging to customer service, was aligned with the brand ethos. For instance, using eco-friendly packaging reinforced a commitment to sustainability, a core aspect of the brand.This insight underlines the importance of a well-crafted brand identity in e-commerce. It's not just about selling products; it's about selling an experience, a lifestyle.This approach was instrumental in differentiating my business in the crowded online jewelry market, contributing significantly to its growth and success.Related: 5 Steps to Building Your First Online Sales Funnel


3. Data-driven marketing tactics in ecommerceUtilizing data-driven marketing tactics was a game-changer. It started with collecting and analyzing customer data to inform every marketing decision.I used Google Analytics to track website traffic and customer behavior, understand which products were most popular, and identify patterns in browsing and purchasing. The real power lies in using this data for targeted marketing campaigns. For instance, I used Facebook Pixel on my e-commerce site to gather data on customer activities. This information was then used to create highly targeted Facebook ad campaigns.The ads were more relevant and effective by focusing on customers who showed interest in specific product categories. Email marketing was another crucial component. Using platforms like Mailchimp, I segmented the email list based on customer purchase history and engagement.This segmentation allowed for personalized email campaigns – customers who showed interest in a particular type of jewelry received emails tailored to those preferences, significantly improving open and click-through rates. Content marketing was also tailored based on customer interests. Blog posts and social media content were created around topics related to the most popular products, leveraging SEO to attract organic traffic.


These data-driven marketing tactics ensured that every dollar spent on advertising was targeted and effective. By focusing on what the data was telling me about customer preferences and behaviors, I was able to craft marketing strategies that resonated with the audience, leading to increased engagement and sales.Related: 4 Super Simple Side Hustles That Could Replace Your Regular Wage — Fast4. Sustainably scale your productAchieving $1M in e-commerce sales was not just about initial growth but also about sustainable scaling. This required strategic planning and execution in expanding the business. Key to this was diversifying the product range without deviating from the core brand identity.For example, while specializing in a particular type of jewelry, I gradually introduced related accessories that complemented the main product line. Infrastructure scalability was another focus. As the business grew, I transitioned to using Shopify Plus, which offered more robust features for handling increased transaction volumes and customer data.


This platform's scalability ensured the website remained efficient and customer-friendly, even with growing traffic. Additionally, I implemented automated systems for inventory management and order fulfillment. This not only saved time but also reduced the likelihood of errors. As part of this, I established strong relationships with reliable suppliers and shipping partners to ensure product quality and timely deliveries, which are critical for customer satisfaction and repeat business.Lastly, customer service scalability was crucial. As the business expanded, maintaining high-quality customer service was paramount. This involved setting up a dedicated support team and using CRM tools to manage customer interactions effectively. Scaling an e-commerce business balances expanding your reach and maintaining the quality of your products and services.Related: How to Elevate Your Online Sales with Cutting-Edge Product Photography

        Kyle Kazmer creatively converts his large yard into a lucrative dog-friendly retreat through Sniffspot.
      


        Sniffspot offers Kazmer a turn-key solution for passive income; he's made over $40,000 since spring 2023, averaging up to $7,000 monthly in the summer.

I first listed on Sniffspot in spring 2023. Sniffspot is used by dog trainers and dog owners wanting a space for their dogs to run outside and play without having to go to a public dog park, and I thought it sounded interesting since we have a large yard that we just don't have enough time to fully enjoy. I also wanted to teach my young children to be entrepreneurial, and the value of work, and this is something they could be a part of. (Fun fact: They are enjoying it so fully that my youngest son named our new puppy ""Sniffspot!"")Sniffspot was incredibly turn-key: Just upload some photos of your yard, set a price per hour and include some details about your spot, and it does the rest, allowing users to look up nearby spaces to rent by the hour.


Related: A Simple, Leisure-Focused Side Hustle Earns This Couple a Lucrative Extra Income Stream: 'Our First Year We Made $84,000.'The immediate passive income with no upfront cost was the inspiration to start, but it turns out I love hosting on Sniffspot because of the stories, experiences and memories that are made on our property without us having to do anything. It is very rewarding to consistently have very thankful people telling us their stories and that bringing their furry friends to a Sniffspot was the best experience they've ever had with their dog: whether it is watching their dog swim for the first time, seeing an anxious dog be stress-free and playful, a family having the opportunity to have a stress-free hike with their dog letting them run wild without a leash — we even had a man propose to his girlfriend here with their dogs! And sadly, last week someone brought their dog the day before they would put him down to have one last sweet time together. It is truly rewarding, and I never imagined the stories we would hear from opening up our yard for dogs.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground? There are many gig economy options out there, but a lot require significant time and ongoing maintenance. We created our profile with tons of photos, and then it just exploded. Word-of-mouth has been the biggest driver, especially among dog trainers, but our reviews and user images really took our spot to the next level.Were there any challenges that came with running your side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those? 


The biggest concern was safety with having strangers on our property and worrying if they would treat our backyard and property with respect. We've all heard horror stories about other short-term rental options — but dog owners must be of a different breed because that concern was completely unfounded for Sniffspot users. Everyone is overwhelmingly considerate, respectful, caring and overall professional. Sniffspot has an insurance policy that brought us some peace of mind as well, and the support staff is also incredibly helpful and responsive, which makes hosting a breeze.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill. It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue? The first partial month we made $1,500 on our spot. The second month we generated $3,700. But really, the highlight for me is the truly passive nature of Sniffspot with no cost to set up and minimal upkeep. Many will just unlock their side gate and let the dogs, and money, roll in.How much average monthly revenue do you earn now? How much total revenue have you earned to date? An average month is between $4,000-$5,000 on Sniffspot. Summer months range from $6,000-$7,000 for us in the sunny Southern California area. Since last spring, we've made over $40,000 on Sniffspot.


What sets Sniffspot apart from other gig platforms? The users are friendly, caring and respectful. We've had over 700 guests, and I can count maybe one or two times someone did not clean up after their dog. The platform is automated, so it is completely passive as a host. Bookings are immediately accepted, and the only task required by hosts is to have your calendar up to date and the property accessible.Related: This Arizona Teacher Started a Side Hustle That Immediately Earned More Than Her Full-Time Job: 'Much Better Than $40,000'What do you enjoy most about your side hustle? 


The revenue stream is great, but what I love most is how appreciative everyone is and the opportunity to share our beautiful property. We fell in love with it, and it makes us so happy to share it. We are truly motivated by the love of dogs and the owners who know what a difference it makes for their best friend. We are filling a need in the community of dog-lovers.Our guests tell us they absolutely love being able to have their dog off leash and play or train and that they are truly creating memories with their dogs. We consistently get guests driving two-plus hours each way for their dog to come visit our Sniffspot. Someone even recently drove more than six hours to make a trip out of it.We've heard stories of proposals happening here, dates between dog lovers, dog birthday parties, dogs learning to swim, anxious dogs coming alive for the first time, etc. — the stories keep us on Sniffspot, and it's truly so rewarding.Related: She Started Her Side Hustle to Solve a Serious Problem With Outdoor Furniture. It Blew Past Her Full-Time Job's Income — to $66,000 a Month.Do you have any advice for others interested in this gig? What should they know before they get started?If they're considering the gig economy or passive income for their space, Sniffspot is the best platform out there. It is consistent, reliable, automatic and has the best users. Because you can choose your own price point per hour, play around with what works. Do your research with other comparable spaces near you. You don't want to price too much beyond other spots in your area, but don't undercut yourself. Be sure to provide great experiences and be client-obsessed. Some may choose to offer dog toys, blow-up pools, etc. We have paddle boards, kayaks, homegrown fruit that guests can pick and buy, a petting zoo and even working fire trucks. Be sure to have decent photos of your space with details on what guests can expect. And feel free to ask for reviews in any follow-ups. Word-of-mouth is a powerful tool.

42,The 5 Stages of Personal Wealth — How to Master Your Money For Business Success,"Jan 24, 2024",Brian Will,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-to-master-your-wealth-for-business-success/468417,"
Embarking on the path to personal wealth is a journey filled with distinct phases, each with its own set of goals and challenges, from the initial struggle to cover basic expenses to the later stages of securing your own future, giving back to society, and planning for your heirs. Which stage are you currently in?1. Pay the bills phaseThis is where the journey begins. Your primary focus in this stage is to make enough money to meet your basic needs. It doesn't matter if you're working a job or starting a business; your objective is to ensure that you can feed your family, cover your rent or mortgage and keep the lights on. At this point in our journey, other luxuries are a goal for the future and not a current reality.Related: 3 Keys to Building and Increasing Personal Wealth Today



2. Accumulation phaseOnce you've successfully navigated the ""pay the bills"" phase, you enter the accumulation phase. At this stage, your income starts to grow, and you might be tempted to accumulate material possessions and indulge in some luxuries. This phase can be a thrilling ride, but it's important not to go overboard and put yourself back into 'stage 1.' In this phase, you need to secure a safety net of cash to bail you out if something goes temporarily wrong with your income stream.3. Savings phaseAs your wealth grows, it's wise to enter the savings phase. This is the phase where you're building a long-term financial safety net. You're also working on building up your resources of passive income to allow you to earn more but work less in the future when you're ready not to have to work for a living every day. Your financial focus here is having enough passive income to maintain your current lifestyle if your primary income source disappears for good.


Related: How to Manage Your Money With Confidence4. Charity phaseOnce you've secured your own financial future and your passive income is set in place, it's time to think about giving back to the world. The charity phase is all about using your excess income to make a positive impact, supporting causes you care about, and contributing to society. Finding and supporting your passion with resources is a true first step to happiness.5. Inheritance phaseThis last stage involves considering what you'll leave behind for your loved ones. Whether it's a comfortable nest egg, valuable assets or a legacy, planning for your heirs is crucial to financial success. How much is enough and how much is too much are decisions you will need to start thinking about. We want our children or heirs to be comfortable and safe, but maybe not give them so much that they get spoiled and don't contribute to society themselves. These are tough decisions.Related: The Truth About Money Management


Three money rules for business successNow that you understand the five stages of your personal wealth, let's get into the rules for wealth in business. These three rules are essential to handling finances for your business:Cash Is King: Having cash reserves is essential in both personal and business finances. It's the ultimate safety net. Whether you're running a business or managing personal finances, having cash on hand can save you from unexpected financial shocks. The amount of cash reserves depends on your overall risk and debt. What does your lifestyle cost, and how long can you sustain it if you lose your ability to produce?The Golden Rule: ""He who holds the gold, rules."" Don't part with your money until you're absolutely sure of the outcome. In business, this rule applies when dealing with contractors, partners, or vendors. It's all about preserving leverage. As long as you hold the money, you can control the outcome. Once you give it up, you are at the mercy of whoever has it.Pay Yourself: Don't forget to pay yourself when running a business. It's essential for maintaining mental and financial well-being. The stress and desperation can lead to poor business decisions if you can't cover your personal expenses. Don't let that happen to you. Too many people make bad decisions about their future trying to manage their current lifestyle or problems.In both personal and business contexts, money is a complex yet vital part of our lives. By understanding the five stages of personal wealth, you can make well-informed financial decisions. Embracing the money rules for business success, such as keeping cash reserves, preserving leverage, and paying yourself, will lead to a more secure and prosperous future. Protect yourself, build your financial safety net, and never become a financial statistic. Your financial well-being and the success of your business are closely intertwined. Remember these principles, and you'll be better equipped to master money in all aspects of your life.

In the summer of 2021, former stay-at-home mom Gina Van De Voorde was working remotely for a mental health facility — and the gig was ""ironically destroying [her] own mental health.""""I just hated the job,"" Van De Voorde tells Entrepreneur. ""I dreaded it every single day. And that's what kind of led me into looking for different side hustles or businesses to start.""Van De Voorde scoured YouTube for hours every day in search of inspiration until she found a tutorial for print-on-demand. Print-on-demand services allow side-hustlers and business owners to create and ship their products as orders come in — which means fewer costly minimums and less risk.



Related: This Retired UPS Employee Started a People-Oriented Side Hustle That Earns More Than $500,000 a Year — and 'Anyone With a Pulse Can Do It'From there, ""it kind of clicked,"" Van De Voorde recalls. Despite having ""zero"" experience in ecommerce or graphic design, she was able to open her Etsy clothing shop that same day.


""Thankfully a lot of simple designs sell really well.""She opted to work with the print-on-demand platform Printify and create her designs on Canva.""I'm definitely still not a graphic designer by any means,"" Van De Voorde says. ""I still don't really even think I'm that good, but thankfully, a lot of simple designs sell really well. Text-based designs sell well.""For the first few months, Van De Voorde ""was just kind of guessing"" which designs would resonate with customers. The strategy wasn't all that effective in the beginning, she admits. But the more time Van De Voorde spent on Etsy, conducting research from 9-5 alongside her full-time job, the more she realized which styles and trends would sell.

It Earned Over $115,000 Last Year — More Than His Full-Time Job.""With print-on-demand, you have to do a lot of niche research.""Van De Voorde began by selling T-shirts and sweatshirts, which remain her top-selling categories today.""With print-on-demand, you have to do a lot of niche research,"" Van De Voorde explains. ""In the beginning, I was just testing a bunch of niches until I tested the Western niche that proved to be very successful. So that was pretty much my first niche that scaled really well.""


Van De Voorde also offers her designs on Shopify now but says it's ""totally different"" from selling on Etsy. With the latter, she doesn't have to worry about driving her own traffic, as it's ""more like a marketplace.""Related: How This Seller Makes $12,000 a Month of Passive Income on Etsy""As long as you're consistent, posting every day, you'll see success.""Van De Voorde's consistent trial-and-error approach paid off — big time. Nowadays, not only does she work on her shop ""just a few hours a week,"" but she's also done more than $500,000 in sales.


And her best advice for other side-hustlers who hope to take a page from her book and run their own successful print-on-demand businesses? Don't assume it's some overnight ""get rich quick scheme.""""It's a lot of work upfront,"" Van De Voorde says. ""So just be prepared that you have to front-load the work in the beginning in order to get your shop off the ground — then you can kind of pull it back. But as long as you're consistent, posting every day, you'll see success.""

Katherine O'Brien.When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?



My side hustle journey has been two-fold. I started my ice cream business, Cream Cruiser, in May of 2015 kind of on a whim. I was working a regular 9-5 but always knew that I wanted to create something that was my own.At the time, I was walking to my 9-5 job through the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, which, over the summer, was always filled with lots of visitors and corporate commuters such as myself. Some days, there would be so many people that you could hardly navigate through the crowds. I was constantly thinking to myself how amazing an ice cream cart would be on a hot, sunny day.


Also, at this time, the mobile food industry had really started to gain traction. I wasn't interested in starting an ice cream truck because of the investment. I wanted something smaller and simpler. After some research and phone calls, I found a small business that manufactured custom food bikes. And within minutes of speaking with them, I knew it was for me.I got the entire business up and running for under $10,000 and launched in just a few months. I started at a local farmers market, and it wasn't long until I got into catering weddings, corporate and college events, etc.Image Credit: Elizabeth Rodenhizer Photography


Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill. It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.I worked a full-time job and sold ice cream during the summer for over three years to be able to put every penny back into the business. Finally, in 2018, I quit my job to go all in on my ice cream business. At this time, I also expanded into wholesale and even private label.The second part of my side hustle journey came into play after a tough few years from 2020-2022. As a small business in the food and beverage and events industry, I felt like I could not keep my head above water and knew that something needed to change.As events were introduced back into our lives, my little catering business started to take off. All of a sudden, I got my fire back and had a great income stream that I had been missing over the past two years during the pandemic. Towards the end of 2022, I decided to stop focusing on the wholesale and private label and go back to doing what I loved, which was selling ice cream from a bike at events.


This led me to part two of my side hustle journey. I created Bike Business University to share my love of this ice cream bike business model with as many people as possible. It's simple, it's affordable, and it's fun! My goal is to make the bike business community just as big as the food truck community.Related: This Ballet Dancer Needed a Side Hustle When the Pandemic Stopped Performances. So She Spun Her Unique Skill Set Into a 6-Figure Business.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?The first thing I did was start my Ice Cream Bike Lady social media accounts. I began sharing my journey and what I loved about my ice cream catering business.  I was also using this time to learn more about digital marketing and how to teach others what I had learned over the years. I wanted to help them avoid some of the lessons I learned the hard way. Pretty quickly, I started connecting with people all over the country looking for a mentor to help them get started and, most importantly, hold them accountable for bringing their business to life. So, I continued listening to my audience and created what they were asking for.


Image Credit: Katherine O'BrienWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?Due to the challenges that came with the pandemic, for a while, I struggled with feeling like I had failed — that I didn't have what it took to scale my ice cream business to what I had originally envisioned when I first went full-time with it. But in reality, those challenges were the best thing that ever happened because they forced me to refocus my goals and brought Bike Business University into my life. It took me a while to be okay with the fact that change is healthy, and being an entrepreneur, it is incredibly important to adapt as needed.

Here's What I Learned.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue, and at what point did the side hustle's income surpass your full-time job?I launched Bike Business University before I had even created it. I had an idea of what the program would look like and had started developing the backend, but it was far from ready. I wanted to make sure it sold before I dove in 100%, so I did a pre-sale. Within the first week, I had sold over $10,000 in courses. I am very grateful that it did not slow down after that, and almost immediately, I replaced my full-time job's income.You've turned your side hustle into a full-time business. How much average monthly or annual revenue does it bring in now?Currently, I average $20,000 per month with Bike Business University. With the recent growth, I am projected to double that by the start of summer 2024.What's your advice for other side-hustlers who hope to turn their ventures into successful businesses?Start before you are ready, and trust yourself enough to know that if you're passionate about what you're doing, you will figure it out as you go. It's okay to make mistakes. It's okay to learn lessons the hard way. It's okay to adapt and make changes as you need to. Just keep going and keep growing.Related: 4 Things Entrepreneurs Don't Need, According to This Outdoor Adventurer and Creative Founder


Also, learn online skills. The internet and social media can be incredibly powerful when you understand the opportunities available. Nothing brings me more joy than selling ice cream out at events, but having an online side to my business has been a total game-changer for me — and provided me with an uncapped income that would not be possible solely from ice cream sales.

      Key Takeaways    



        Blake Geffen was inspired to start Vivrelle while wedding planning, identifying a gap in the market for accessible, high-end accessory rentals.
      


        Geffen says passion is the cornerstone of a successful side hustle, proving that a labor of love can lead to fulfilling and lucrative business ventures.
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Blake Geffen, founder of luxury accessory rental company Vivrelle.Courtesy of Vivrelle. Blake Geffen.Why were you interested in entrepreneurship, and what does being an entrepreneur mean to you? 



Before founding Vivrelle, I spent the majority of my career in public relations, and I was always so inspired by the founders and CEOs that I worked with as clients. Now, being on the other side, I hope to be an inspiration for anyone I work with! Being an entrepreneur means being an inspiring and personable leader while being extremely passionate about the brand I am building and the team I am working with. Both of these elements continue to keep me motivated, no matter what challenges arise.When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?


The idea for Vivrelle actually came to life when I was planning my wedding in 2017. As I was planning for different bridal events and occasions, I wanted to accessorize each outfit uniquely and in a way that reflected my style, but I found it nearly impossible to find high-end, quality options that didn't break the bank. That's when I realized there was a hugely untapped market for borrowed luxury accessories. I bounced the idea of creating an exclusive membership club that gives access to highly coveted accessories off my fiancé (and now husband/business partner!). We started building Vivrelle from the ground up, both leading up to our wedding and on our honeymoon, and we officially launched the company in September 2018.Related: The 'Easy' Side Hustle He Started in College Hit More Than $1 Million in Revenue — and Taught Him 3 Business Lessons He Still Uses TodayWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?As mentioned, we spent our honeymoon, specifically our time in the Maldives, putting our business plan together. We still joke that we skipped the bellinis on our honeymoon and instead made a full-blown business plan. We then came back, and at the time, I was still working in public relations, so I was using the small amounts of free time I had to build the brand I was so passionate about. On weekends, we would spend our time pitching potential investors and garnering relationships with vendors and partners to help us create a website, tapping friends to help with marketing, etc. We used every waking minute to build our vision for Vivrelle and bring it to life.


What were some of the biggest challenges that came with the side hustle, and how did you overcome them?One of the biggest challenges, which came in the beginning, was showing potential investors that they had reason to believe in us and this model. Before we launched, we said if we could get 50 members to sign up the first month, we would be on to something, and we far surpassed our goal! With my background in PR, we leveraged influencer marketing to help get us off the ground. As purveyors of fashion and lifestyle, we knew they could help bring our message to life quickly, so we prioritized working with ones known for their personal style and overall lifestyle to highlight how Vivrelle helps them elevate their every day.Related: 3 Secrets to Starting a High-Income Side Hustle in 2024, According to People Whose Gigs Make More Than $20,000 a MonthHow long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly and/or yearly revenue from your side hustle? We feel very fortunate that, with hard work, we surpassed our initial projections in month one and have continued to see consistent growth month over month.We continue to grow triple digits year over year and proudly raised $35 million in our Series B round with investors including celebrities Morgan Stewart, Nina Dobrev and Lily Collins. We've continued growing and expanding, and we're excited to reveal what we've focused on since our fundraise.What do you enjoy most about running your business?There is so much to love about running Vivrelle. One of the things I enjoy the most is meeting members on streets, airports, restaurants and hearing about how Vivrelle has brought them joy or improved their day-to-day lives. We have a showroom location in Manhattan, and I love going in and hearing which bags members are loving most, how they are styling and using them for special occasions, vacations and everything in between.

I've always loved luxury fashion and experimenting with my style, so starting Vivrelle felt like a natural evolution of this passion. As a CEO and mother of three, every day certainly looks different and throws new challenges my way, but I'm always excited to tackle whatever we face because I care so much about this space and the brand we've built.

49,She Went from Being Homeless to a $20 Million Real Estate Mogul. And It All Started at a Crime Scene.,"Jan 3, 2024",Anna David,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/she-went-from-being-homeless-to-a-30-million-real-estate/467749,"
In 2005, Laura Spaulding was asked a question that sparked a $20 million business.A cop who'd been working in Kansas City homicide for a few years, Spaulding was filing a report on a gruesome murder when one of the victim's family members asked her when the police would be coming back to clean up the crime scene.""I said, 'We don't clean that up,'"" Spaulding recalls. ""And then I just got to thinking about what she'd asked. I went home and searched on Google. And I realized, 'Oh, my God, there's nowhere for this lady to go.'""Most cops would have stopped there, but Spaulding was not most cops. ""I thought, 'Okay, I'll do the cleanup of crime scenes as a side hustle,'"" she told me on the Fail Your Way to Success podcast.While Spaulding believed in her idea, she was nevertheless surprised to discover that, within six months, her side hustle was bringing in far more income than her cop salary. Today, Spaulding Decon is the only crime scene clean up business that also flips the real estate after they clean it up. It's also a $20 million franchise.

Now He's Earning $7,000 a Month — and Putting It to Good Use.From rags to richesNo one could accuse Spaulding of having had an easy road to becoming a multi-millionaire.She was a homeless 18-year-old when she decided to apply for the military as a way of getting her education paid for. She'd only been in the service for six months when she was kicked out alongside two other gay women.


Undaunted, Spaulding took up as many loans and grants as necessary to pay her tuition at the University of Tennessee. After graduating, Spaulding was hired as a cop in Kansas City. But a year into the job, she was getting antsy. She wanted to make big moves—and more money. A supervisor asked who wanted to make overtime by working undercover as a prostitute. Spaulding volunteered.Working the streetsMasquerading as a sex worker, Spaulding hit the streets, meeting everyone from ""guys in BMWs with the car seat in the back"" to guys who'd just gotten off work at their construction sites. No matter who it was, Spaulding followed the same procedure: have the initial conversation, tell the customer to meet around the corner, and then let the SWAT team take over.From there, Spaulding started working undercover in narcotics, posing as a drug addict at crack houses. But after 18 months, Spaulding saw that the undercover life was in danger of destroying her. ""I realized the work was changing who I was,"" she recalls. ""I was starting not to trust anyone, to constantly be looking over my back and to alienate my friends.""And so she went back to being a regular cop—and that's when inspiration hit.Related: He Launched His Creative Side Hustle Out of a Garage. Now It's Worth $225 Million.Building her crime scene businessWhen she began researching existing crime scene clean-up businesses, Spaulding discovered that there was only one in Dallas. So, she asked them if they could train her, and she used her one-week vacation to do the training. ""The only savings I had at that point was $2500,"" she recalls. ""It was do or die.""


Returning to Kansas City, she visited five banks to get a start-up loan. ""They all told me no, so I lied to the fifth one and told them I needed a home equity loan,"" she says. ""They gave me $15,000.""After her first crime scene clean-up, Spaulding quit being a cop and relocated to Florida, where she realized she could marry her passion for crime scene cleanup with her love for real estate if she offered to buy the real estate where the crime took place and then flip it.Getting the word outThere was one problem: no one knew that there were companies that did crime scene clean-up since most assumed, just like the woman who inspired Spaulding to start the business, that the cops took care of it.""I thought, 'We don't have a billion-dollar budget for TV commercials and billboards and all that stuff,'"" Spaulding recalls. So, she pitched her team to invest heavily in social media. They all tried to talk her out of it, saying that documenting crime scene clean-ups would come off as insensitive, if not downright offensive—and that no one would want to watch it. Plus, it was 2019—kind of late to try to build a social media following.Spaulding ignored them, got a videographer to follow the team around as they cleaned up the scenes, and within two months, they had 100,000 YouTube subscribers. Today, they have 1.36 million subscribers on YouTube, 4.5 million followers on TikTok, and 750,000 followers on Instagram.Spaulding Decon has continued to thrive, with 25 locations across the United States. What started as a desire to solve a problem for people on the worst day of their lives has become something this formerly homeless undercover cop could never have imagined.

50,How to Make Real Money as An Expert Witness,"Jan 3, 2024",Micah Solomon,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-make-money-as-an-expert-witness/466871,"
Are you interested in pursuing work as an expert witness? I recommend you consider it if you're seeking mind-expanding and wallet-expanding work.Let me start with my own experience because it's the bulk of what I have to go on! Here are the three types of cases to which I offer my expertise: customer service expert witness, hospitality expert witness, and customer experience expert witness.I only take cases I believe in, and I enjoy applying my own experience as a customer service consultant and customer experience consultant in a venue that's so different from where I usually spend my day and my brain cells.



Whether expert witness work replaces your main gig or doesn't (and I think generally it won't because continuing as a practitioner in your field is actually an attraction in getting this kind of work), it's a fabulous source of potential income. Money aside, I predict that you, like me, will find it fascinating to be participating in our country's system of justice.Related: New York Lawyer Uses ChatGPT to Create Legal Brief, Cites 6 'Bogus' Cases: 'The Court Is Presented With an Unprecedented Circumstance'


Do you have what it takes? Do you even want to have what it takes?There are not all that many legal barriers to you entering this field. But do you have the mindset, even the interest, for what this takes? Here are my opinions on this, based on my work and qualifications as a customer service expert witness and customer experience expert witness:• You are up for learning new things. The court system is its own beast, and I find it fascinating, at least in small doses. You may not.• You have good reading comprehension. This might sound very schoolteacher of me, but you're going to need to read the relevant documents provided to you by the firm that retains you, as well as potentially doing a roundup of everything else relevant that is out there.• You are a good and clear writer. Not always, but often, you'll be called upon to create a written opinion. And this needs to be clear and well-reasoned.


• You're reasonably steady under fire. Okay, a courtroom is rarely the scene for dramatic fireworks as you've seen on Better Call Saul or Suits. But you should expect to be badgered by opposing counsel (okay, not badgered, as that's not permitted, but behavior that comes very close to the badgering line) and even the judge.• You're willing to limit the words that come from your mouth. What I mean here is that when you get a question, you only answer within the scope of the question. Sometimes, this is as little as answering ""yes"" or ""no."" It's hard to learn for the more gregarious and passionate among us.• You truly are an expert in your field. Are you, truly? Any law firm that contacts you for this work must be convinced that you are. And then, you need to survive the likely challenges from opposing counsel to both your qualifications and the relevance of all aspects of your testimony.Let's dig into that last bullet point now.Related: Use This Secret Customer Service Technique to Boost Your Customer Retention and LoyaltyWho can be an expert witness?At this point, it's important that I caveat what I'm about to write: I am not a lawyer or legally trained. So do not use the following by itself; augment it (or entirely replace it) with information from actual legal sources, as well as, perhaps, your own reading of the laws and regulations that are relevant.As far as who can be an expert witness, there's good news: the law governing this in federal court — Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 702 — is quite broad and accommodating; it does not restrict the areas of knowledge to just scientific and technical fields but includes all forms of specialized"" knowledge. Furthermore, there are no specific education or background requirements; an expert can, in theory, be anyone who has expertise derived from their ""knowledge, skill, experience, training or education.""And in reality, many types of expert witnesses are needed by the courts. Here are a few of them that may be of interest to you:


• Business Expert Witness • Economic Expert Witness • Financial Expert Witness • HR Expert Witness • Engineering Expert Witness • Construction Expert Witness • Medical Expert Witness • Customer Service Expert Witness • Hospitality Expert Witness • Customer Experience Expert Witness (These last three are the disciplines within I share my own expertise.)Related: An Industry is Booming, But Most Don't Know About ItWhat qualifies as expert testimony?""A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if the proponent demonstrates to the court that it is more likely than not that:(a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods and(d) the expert's opinion reflects a reliable application ofthe principles and methods to the facts of the case.""NOTE: the above includes proposed changes to FRE 702 that may not yet be in effect when you read this.


After reading this, are you intrigued? If you decide to pursue work as an expert witness, I offer you my best wishes. Please be honest and give your best effort. If you do, the rest should fall into place. And remember again: none of this is legal advice, just some insight offered by a layperson.

51,"How an Ex-Police Officer Made $12 Million in 3 Years After Buying ATMs for $2,100 and Operating Them as a Side Hustle","Jan 2, 2024",Laila Maidan,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/how-to-start-an-atm-side-hustle-that-brings-in-millions/467799,"
This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Paul Alex entered the police force as a trainee with the plan to build a career in law enforcement in the San Francisco Bay Area.Alex, 35, hit the ground running, eventually becoming a detective in the narcotics task force before being assigned to the special victims unit. By 2020, he had scaled his way up to a salary of $133,000, with benefits bringing him up to an annual salary of over $272,000, according to California state archives viewed by Insider.



While his career set him up for financial stability, his weekly working hours could range from 60 to 100 hours.""I didn't have any personal freedom,"" Alex said. ""I was neglecting my personal life. I wasn't hanging around my family who I love. I'm a big family guy. And at the end of the day, I realized, this can't be life.""


The deeper realization that a salaried career wasn't going to be his future was during periods when overtime was paused, which would cut his pay drastically, he said. Some months, his biweekly paycheck would be $2,000 after deductions. This meant he always had to save for those low months to cover his bills, which could range from $5,000 to $6,000 a month, he said.""What really was a morale killer was the fact that you want to move ahead in life. And I feel it kept you static when that happened,"" Alex said.He decided that investing in cash-flowing assets would be a way out of the paycheck volatility. He could then use his salary for discretionary purchases such as vacations, cars, and additional investments.He initially considered real estate but felt that it would require a lot of cash and a mortgage that would create more debt. Plus, he believed that the overhead expenses of maintaining a property would add to his stress. He'd have to hold any rental income in cash in case he had to cover the mortgage due to missed rent or repairs.


In 2017, Alex came across the idea of investing in ATMs through a colleague who had been researching the business. He began joining social media groups about it, watching YouTube videos from others who had done it, and reading any material he could.It was a business model that was out of his comfort zone because he knew nothing about it. But the draw of it was that it had a low-cost barrier to start; relative to buying real estate, an ATM could cost less than $3,000. It also had lower risk because if the ATM wasn't generating a return, he could relocate the machine, which he refers to as a floating asset. And finally, it was a quick way of starting a side hustle because once a machine was placed on location, it could start generating a profit almost immediately.Alex decided to pursue it as a side hustle in 2018. By March 2021, he had left the police force and made it his full-time job where he provides the ATMs for those who also want to embark on this business.From January 2021 to April 2023, Alex's profit and loss statements viewed by Insider show a total sales of $12 million and a net profit of about $3.5 million for his company ATMTogether, a provider of ATM machines and services. His company Merchant Task Force, which provides credit-card terminals, shows an income of $844,000 and a net profit of $742,000 for the same period.


Scouting locationsIn 2018, Alex took two weeks off from work and used that time to scout the city for ideal locations.He looked for high-traffic areas that had an incentive to have an ATM on site. This included tourist areas and city spots that were populated with nightclubs, restaurants, and valets to target zones where staff was tipped. He also looked for small businesses that offered cash back at checkouts, which was a nuisance to the business because they had to be sure there would always be enough dollar bills in the register.Alex would pitch the businesses as though he was offering a service. He would be responsible for providing and maintaining the machine at no charge to them. He recalled cold calling over a hundred businesses and physically walking into over 20 locations.""When I started this and I had gone out there and I was getting nos and yeses, wins and losses, It was very difficult for me to go back to work and not think about my business. And I think that's what caught me, was just the fact that I was growing something for myself and I wanted to continue to grow it.""


He initially had the idea of starting with three ATMs but by the time he was done, he was able to secure six locations: three liquor stores, two barber shops, and one nail salon in the San Francisco Bay Area. The first three were incentivized by cashback and the last three by cash tips.Once the machines arrived on location, he loaded each ATM up with about $2,000 to $3,000 in cash.Not every location was a grand slam. Alex noted that a decent minimum return on an ATM should be at least $200 a month per machine. Within the first month, Alex could already tell that the only three machines producing a return were the ones he placed at the liquor stores. They had a net profit of about $250 to $500 a month per location from fees charged for withdrawals. In contrast, the lower traffic locations were only producing $25 to $100 a month. He let the machines sit for two months before deciding it was time to move them.Alex also found a mentor from Facebook who was successful in the business. Based on his mentor's advice, he moved the three machines to two convenience stores and another liquor store. From there, they began to bring a net profit almost immediately, with the highest return being $600 a month, he said. He suddenly had six operational machines that brought in roughly $3,000 a month in net profit, he said. It took him approximately six months to get a return on his investment.


Funding the businessesWhile Alex had enough cash saved to purchase the machines, he realized he would need the bills to stock the ATMs. So instead, he signed up for two personal credit cards and used them to buy the hardware, he said. They were cards that specifically offered zero interest for the first 12 months, he noted. This would give him enough time to create cash flow without incurring interest every month.When he purchased his first set of six machines, Alex assumed he got a good discount, which was $2,100 an ATM. He would later realize it was a bad deal because it required him to pay a 30% commission from the fees his ATMs charged. While the sales agent he worked with told him it was standard practice, he later realized it wasn't the only way.The next set of machines would be purchased from his mentor. They were both new and refurbished and cost between $1,800 to $2,200 depending on the model.Additional costs for the ATMs included an internet wireless modem for $150, a monthly internet charge of $6.99, and installation by a technician of $300.


Alex would gradually use the profits from his ATMs to buy more machines. And by 2020, he had accumulated 30 ATMs across the San Francisco Bay area that were operative. Each brought in anywhere from $250 to as much as $1,500 a month in net profit.Altogether, these little assets cash flowed anywhere between $9,000 to $12,000 a month in net profit, he said. While his side hustle didn't make up for his salary, he was fully able to cover his bills with the profits. This was enough to make him want to leave his job in 2021 to build a business in this sector.During this time, he met an ATM provider who he partnered with and they scaled to become a provider of ATMs. This allowed him to sell off his machines so that he could become remote.Even while in the act of building his side hustle, Alex still had doubts running through his mind. The chatter from those around him kept him questioning his ability to carry this through. Some of his colleagues thought it was a bad idea to invest in an unknown business and told him he should just pick up extra hours instead. In hindsight, he's glad he kept going.


""Invest in yourself. Self-education is everything,"" Alex said reflecting on his journey. ""All this started from a friend of mine, giving me an idea, and then me taking that idea and doing my due diligence and just researching it, buying books, watching videos, reading, reading, reading to the point where I was comfortable enough to execute it on my own.""This story was originally published in June 2023.

53,The Only Business Idea You Need to Start Making Money,"Jan 2, 2024",Terry Rice,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/the-only-business-idea-you-need-to-start-making-money/439210,"
If you do a Google search for ""business ideas"" you'll quickly get overwhelmed and confused by articles offering numerous, random suggestions. And while some of the ideas may be inspiring, they also miss the most obvious - and easiest - way to generate revenue as an entrepreneur.Become a professional service provider based on the skills you already have.Think you can't do it? Think again. Because if you've ever excelled and enjoyed any job-related task, you can sell that service to organizations and individuals.



Following this process helps you avoid many of the risks associated with entrepreneurship. It helps you avoid imposter syndrome by doing something you know you are good at, and since you've been paid for them in the past, you know there's a market for your services .So stop looking externally for business ideas. Everything you need to start a business is already within you. Here's a three step process to get you started.


Determine your zone of geniusIt's time to get paid, and the first step is to determine your Zone of Genius, which are the tasks you feel uniquely qualified to perform and enjoy. This term comes from the book The Big Leap by Gay Hendricks and I'll walk you through the process of discovering yours now.We'll start by gaining a basic understanding of the various zones of competence.Incompetence: You're not good at these things and don't want to beCompetence: You can perform these tasks but others can do it just as wellExcellence: You can perform these activities extremely well but it may not be as rewarding as you'd like at times.Genius: These are the activities you enjoy and want to keep developing. You could talk about them for hours and never get bored. This is the service you'll offer to clients.Next, open up this spreadsheet. In Column E jot down all the organizations you've worked at. Once you've completed that, write down all the major tasks and activities you performed at each organization in Column F. This also includes tools and processes involved with each role, and you can probably lift most of this information from your resume or LinkedIn profile.


Now it's time to assign all these tasks and activities to various Zones of Competence. You'll want to be extremely honest with yourself here. In most cases you should have a handful of activities in your Zone of Genius, a few more in your Zone of Excellence, and even more in the remaining zones.You can see the example from your worksheet below.Based on the example above, this person could become a consultant who helps organizations plan their Facebook ad campaigns. We'll go deeper into potential service offerings next.


Related: 5 Steps to Get (Almost) Anyone to Connect With You on LinkedInDetermine the specific services you'll sellNow that you've identified the skills you want to monetize, it's time to create services based on these skills. I created the A.C.T.I.O.N. business ideation model to help you quickly determine which services you'd like to offer.Audits


These can be scary if we're talking about your taxes, but they're extremely beneficial if you provide them as service to organizations or individuals. Based on your zone of genius, this is the step-by-step approach you'll use to analyze a company or process. Your main goal here is to identify areas of improvement or opportunity.Need help creating your audit? Watch this step-by-step video I created.ConsultingThis involves providing your opinions, analyses, and recommendations to organizations or individuals based on your own expertise. Fortunately, you can use the same process that you already created for your audit.


TrainingYou'll help individuals or organizations develop the specific skills needed to perform their job. This is different from consulting, but it's somewhat related. Maybe during your audit or consulting you discovered they need to start leveraging a new process, but they don't currently know how to. That's where you come in to provide training.ImplementationThis is where you help your clients implement the tools or teams needed to achieve their goals. It could be onboarding a new tool or even selecting the right vendor to partner with.


Ongoing RetainersThis is one of my favorite ways to make money. With retainers you continue providing advice and services based on your area of expertise. But you may not have a specific project you're working on. You're just there to answer questions whenever they arise. I strongly recommend offering retainers at the end of any project so you can continue generating revenue from your clients.New OpportunitiesBy design this is the most flexible part of the model. What ideas can you come up with based on the organization, their goals and creative ways you can help them reach their desired outcome?


I'll give you an example here. I make educational videos focused on entrepreneurship for one of my business partners. But I recently pitched them on a new opportunity, which is setting up an accountability program for all their program participants. This is aligned with my previous work and their mission so they were receptive to the idea.So that's A.C.T.I.O.N. business ideation model. You can pick one or all of these, but I highly recommend offering audits since it establishes the baseline for all your other service offerings.Next up, we'll cover promoting your business.Realted: How Networking Is Necessary for Effective Entrepreneurship


Ask your network to spread the word about your businessI've interviewed hundreds of entrepreneurs, and 90 percent of their first clients came from their network. So before you start posting on social media begging strangers to work with you, start with the people who already know, like and trust you.Think of 10-20 people you know who can spread the word about your new business. This includes previous coworkers, friends and relatives. Ideally, these individuals would have access to a relevant network. Meaning they may know people or organizations that could use your services.Then, you're going to reach out to them and ask for their help. Here's a template you start with.Hey Omar,Hope all is well on your end.Reaching out to let you know that I've started a new business and I'm wondering if you could help me spread the word.In short, I help (target audience), (take this action) so they can (achieve a specific outcome)Would you happen to know of any individuals or companies that would be interested in this service? If so, I'd appreciate it if you could introduce us or just forward this email. 


Thanks for your support!You can send this message via email or messaging, whichever makes the most sense for you based on your relationship.Next stepsEntrepreneurship is challenging, but it doesn't have to be confusing. By following this process you'll be able to make money, save time and avoid burnout.If you don't get leads within the first seven days I suggest reaching out to more people in your network using the same message. This is most likely how you'll get your first client, so stick with it.


And if you'd like help growing your business consider joining me in the Smart Passive Income Pro community. You'll gain access to the courses, guidance and accountablilty needed to grow your business and avoid common pitfalls.Either way, I wish you the best of luck and if you have any questions feel free to contact me on LinkedIn or Instagram.

In 2015, 23-year-old Alexa Stimp, now owner and founder of The Shoe Fairy, was an avid gym-goer with a passion for fitness — and had a burgeoning interest in bodybuilding. She knew a couple of women who competed and saw the sport gaining momentum on Instagram.""I was like, You know what, I kind of want to do this,"" Stimp tells Entrepreneur. ""I want to see if I can challenge myself and do this.""Bodybuilding changed Stimp's entire life, she says, requiring rigorous preparation and discipline. At times, she found it to be an ""isolating and lonely"" experience too; eager to transform her mindset, Stimp began listening to motivational speakers — and learned a lot about herself and her goals along the way.

""I started to get scared of that being my future. And I became so in love with the sport I realized that I wanted to start a company within it.""Tagged Instagram posts revealed there were already numerous companies specializing in bikinis, jewelry and tanning, Stimp says, and she needed a product that could set her business apart. Before long, she recognized a major gap in the market: No one was focusing on shoes.Image Credit: Courtesy of The Shoe Fairy. Alexa Stimp. Although standard heels certainly aren't hard to come by, the type of heels preferred in bodybuilding — acrylic and thus ""very easy to show imperfections"" — are. Only two brands were well-known in the industry for their shoes back then, Stimp says. And she wanted to make a product that would outperform all of the ones out there.


Stimp continued working her 9-5 job and launched her venture as a side hustle, starting small. She used the resources she had to buy shoes wholesale, serving as a retailer and learning as she went. That first month, Stimp did $2,000 in sales, and the next, she did $4,000. She began to wonder what could be possible if she put all of her time and energy into her vision, taking it from a side hustle to a full-blown business. So, just three months into the new venture, she quit her 9-5 to find out.""I was like, if I want to be able to take over this entire industry, I need to create something better, and I need to make it make sense,"" Stimp says. ""The shoe needs to make sense for women. And I took that philosophy and extended it to the line of new heels. I want to create shoes for women that are by women, for women. They make sense, they fit well, they feel good, and they'll work. And that's always been my driving mission.""Related: He Launched His Creative Side Hustle Out of a Garage. Now It's Worth $225 Million.""I was so excited, but I tried one on, and my foot wouldn't even go through.""Then, when Stimp secured a manufacturer to help realize her dream, it seemed like a milestone ""a year-and-a-half in the making."" She placed an order for her first 1,000 pairs, but upon their arrival, was dismayed to find ""they were completely trash.""""I was so excited, but I tried one on, and my foot wouldn't even go through,"" Stimp says. ""My toes got stuck in the plastic, and I'm like, 'Wait what?' [I double-checked that it was a size 8], so I started ripping through tons of size 8s — and I couldn't get my foot in the shoe. It was like Cinderella's ugly stepsister.""Related: She Used $10,000 in Savings to Turn Her Side Hustle Into an 8-Figure Brand You've Probably SeenUpon closer inspection, Stimp saw that the interior cushion was coming through the seams: ""They were a mess."" Later, she'd learn that the manufacturer neglected to properly coat the plastic upper, so it shrank. It was back to the drawing board and a two-year setback.


Stimp reached out to another manufacturer from China who happened to be in New York City when she made contact; they met at Stimp's office in New Jersey and were able to go over the project together. Then, Stimp flew to China to work with them to review all of her options and create the mold.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by The Shoe Fairy® (@theshoefairy_)""When you do sampling and you're back here in the U. S., You don't know all the options that are available,"" Stimp explains. ""So I'm talking about all the different levels of plastic. All the different materials for the insoles. The insoles in my shoes are shiny; they're iridescent, they're very pretty. I wouldn't have known that. I picked that out when I was there. All the different levels of cushion, I was able to try everything when I was there.""""You can start where you are now with what you have now.""That would be a critical step in the right direction for the business. Today, nearly eight years later, The Shoe Fairy is beloved by celebrities, influencers, top bodybuilders and more — and is on track to see nearly $2 million in revenue in 2023.Like most entrepreneurs, Stimp's road to success wasn't linear or without some bumps along the way, but the lessons learned helped her come back stronger with every unexpected turn. And her best advice for any hopeful side hustler who wants to turn their great idea into the next big thing? Just get started — even if you start small.""People become paralyzed,"" Stimp says, ""because they think of everything they need to do and that they need to know everything and have everything. When really, you can start where you are now with what you have now. So, the best thing to do is to write out a plan. Don't get too ahead of yourself, just where you need to start. So for example, if you're going to be selling a product, identify what the product is, who it's for, and where you're going to get it. Start with small pieces at a time.""

56,"This Mom Started a $50,000 a Month Side Hustle After Dropping a Kindle on Her Baby's Head","Dec 13, 2023",Nick Loper,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/mom-starts-side-hustle-after-dropping-kindle-on-babys-head/466872,"
Lou Rice was breastfeeding her son Archie one night when disaster struck—she dropped her Kindle on his head.While that experience was upsetting for both of them, it sparked an idea for Lou and her husband, Ben, to create a solution.Ben fashioned a silicone strap with staples to attach Lou's Kindle to her hand and prevent any future dropping incidents. Lou tested it out over the next month and absolutely loved having the grip and security of the strap for comfortable one-handed reading during those long middle-of-the-night feeds.With that, the Strapsicle was born—a side hustle now generating over $50k a month selling innovative Kindle straps. Not only that, but Strapsicle is on pace for its first-ever 6-figure month after recently going viral on TikTok and Instagram.



You can hear the entire story on the Side Hustle Show podcast. 


Related: This Social Worker Started a Side Hustle to Pay Back Student Loans. It Earned $300,000 in One Year — So She Quit Her 9-5 Altogether.Ben, Lou, and Archie courtesy of StapisicleGetting the Strapsicle manufacturedAfter positive initial testing, Ben and Lou explored whether there were any similar products on the market and found very few competitors. The products they did find were rather unappealing.


""They had like little metal claws, or they're very industrial-looking, and nothing kind of sleek and stylish like our straps are,"" Lou says.This gave them confidence that a sleek, stylish silicone strap custom molded to fit Kindle devices could be a winning product. Luckily, they had a manufacturing contact in China through a friend to produce prototypes and ultimately fulfill inventory orders.It took a few rounds of back and forth with the factory to perfect the design of the very first Strapsicle strap. Once the final production sample was approved, Lou created an online survey and distributed it through Facebook, friends, and family. The feedback assured Lou they were solving a real customer problem, given the enthusiasm expressed by existing Kindle owners.With this validation fueling their desire to develop a solution for Lou's initial dropping challenge, they decided to move forward and place a minimum order quantity of 500 units for about $2,000, including shipping fees.


Giving away productAfter the first inventory shipment arrived, Lou and Ben were paralyzed on launching for months. But after listening to a podcast that inspired her, Strapsicle officially launched online by giving away products for free. Customers only paid the shipping costs and were only asked to provide feedback about the strap.This approach allowed Lou and Ben to build community and start a dialogue with real customers using Strapsicle on their Kindles. Plus, it enabled the gathering of user-generated content and reviews to aid subsequent marketing efforts.Lou spread the word online primarily through Facebook communities like female entrepreneurs groups and local neighborhood groups. She also made posts on LinkedIn and her personal Instagram account, yielding almost 100 sales in the first month.Related: This Retiree's 'No-Brainer' Side Hustle Makes More Than $1,000 a Month — and Is About to Grant Him Another Life-Changing Perk


Marketing on BookTokNever one to stand still, Lou soon stumbled upon BookTok — an engaged subculture on TikTok obsessed with reading and raving about their favorite books. She soon realized BookTok participants were an ideal target market, given their affinity for Kindles.Lou decided to experiment with a micro-influencer affiliate marketing strategy. This involved searching relevant Kindle hashtags like #Kindle and keywords to find nano and micro-influencers on TikTok and Instagram with small but targeted followings between 2,000-3,000 followers.She reached out to many micro-influencers, offered them free samples to try, and provided discount codes they could share with their followers to drive sales.The micro-influencer content spreads brand awareness and creates more user-generated content for Lou to repurpose on Strapsicle's social channels. She continues nurturing relationships with her influencers by sending new products and keeping in constant contact as they drive more and more traffic and sales.


This micro-influencer strategy and the initial free giveaway enabled Strapsicle to gain significant organic traction in just its first three months in business.Launching on AmazonLou and Ben started selling on Amazon using FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon) to ease order fulfillment and distribution, especially within the US market.They knew the power of Amazon but also understood the importance of driving external traffic to the listings. So Lou implemented referral bonus links and affiliate marketing through multiple channels back to the Amazon product pages.She continues contacting micro-influencers on TikTok and Instagram that cater to the Kindle niche. By providing them with Amazon discount codes instead of codes for Strapsicle, any resulting sales still credit the influencer while allowing the customer a seamless Amazon shopping experience.


This ongoing effort provides the essential external visibility to help Strapsicle's products rank higher in Amazon search results. And the high placement then enables more organic sales.Hitting $50k+ a monthFlash forward to today, and Strapsicle is flying high at over $50,000 monthly in sales between Strapsicle.com and Amazon. Lou credits consistent effort delivering micro-influencer seed content and wide distribution of affiliated links driving external traffic to Amazon product pages.The crowning achievement thus far has been a single viral TikTok video that generated over 2 million views. Combined with a ""The 9 Best Kindle Accessories to Shop on Amazon Under $35"" PR roundup Cosmopolitan published, including Strapsicle, the widespread exposure pushed Lou's side hustle over $100k in sales in its first month, topping six figures.Learning from their mistakesDespite breakout early success, Lou admits they've been figuring things out as they go. From pricing changes to get the optimal value-based customer conversions to sizing mixups that led to negative reviews, they've endured their fair share of lessons about selling on Amazon.


One hard lesson came from a factory quality control issue with their manufacturer sending the wrong-sized units to Amazon warehouses. It wasn't caught initially, leading confused customers to complain about ill-fitting straps.Lou used the opportunity to respond with thoughtful comments personally, send replacements from their Shopify-fulfilled inventory, and ultimately change disappointed 1-star reviews into delighted 5-star raves.This attention to individual customer care reminds Lou that Strapsicle isn't just another faceless corporate entity. As a bootstrapping startup and family passion project self-funded from her corporate salary, every sale counts.Lou also began receiving feedback that the versatile silicone strap design helped readers suffering from arthritis, Parkinson's, and nerve damage comfortably hold Kindle devices and alternatives from Kobo that usually slipped from their grasp.


Word spread and a woman with cerebral palsy even wrote to Lou and said, ""You've changed my life."" While Lou initially set out to solve a simple problem for exhausted parents like herself, this discovery added a greater sense of purpose and refinement to the brand's vision.

      Key Takeaways    



        Ingrid Bayer was no stranger to long hours and low pay as a certified K-12 teacher who worked in public schools for more than 25 years. 
      


        She was working as a university curriculum developer when she stumbled upon the side hustle that would change her life. 
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Ingrid Bayer, a certified K-12 teacher and former university curriculum developer who spends 30-40 hours per week tutoring with Varsity Tutors.Image Credit: Courtesy of Ingrid Bayer What were you doing before you started your side hustle, and why were you interested in tutoring independently? 



I started tutoring part-time in 2014. I was working for Grand Canyon University full-time as a curriculum developer. My friend worked for Varsity Tutors and asked me to help her son, who needed help in math. So, I agreed and started tutoring in person at her home.When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it? 


I officially started tutoring in the spring of 2014. I am a certified K-12 teacher and have worked in public schools for over 25 years. I love working with students and helping them learn, so it was an easy transition. At this time, I was writing and designing curriculum at the university and not teaching. I left public schools for a better income and benefits, but I missed direct contact with students, which was part of the inspiration to start tutoring. Years ago, when my children were toddlers, I was tutoring for my school district in Illinois and worked with special needs students, so I was comfortable with working in this style and going to the family home. I often worked with students who were seriously ill and could not attend school often with special learning needs. Some students had social-emotional problems and were not allowed to attend regular school, so I dealt with some challenging situations, including mental illness and students who behaved poorly.Related: He Launched His Creative Side Hustle Out of a Garage. Now It's Worth $225 Million.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground? I researched several different groups that offered tutoring and tried a few. As I mentioned earlier, my friend was a director at Varsity Tutors at the time and encouraged me to join and help her son, who needed help with math. That became a long relationship; at the time, her son was in first grade. He is now in high school and excels in math. I am still in contact with him and the family. I have a master's in curriculum and development, so as I work with students, I analyze their strengths and weaknesses in a subject and approach them to support their academic needs. I am also a certified gifted teacher and specialize in special needs students, focusing on their learning styles and thinking processes. I individualize my approach with each student and have found that to work well, and students have excelled. I also do my research and study subjects and have gathered materials to support the learning process for the students. Varsity Tutors has an excellent learning platform that I utilize, which is very effective with test prep and other academic subjects. My goal is to help the whole student succeed in a positive, supportive environment.


What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them? Initially, I was still working full-time at the university, so I limited the hours I would tutor. Eventually, I left the university job and started independent contractor jobs for other universities and schools. I also started teaching online university classes in critical thinking, creative thinking, problem-solving and logic. I enjoyed tutoring and meeting students and their families and was primarily tutoring in person until Covid. Then, I went online full-time, and the demand was great. I also tutored private clients at this time. Most of my work has been through word-of-mouth or through friends I know. School districts have also referred me and, of course, Varsity Tutors.Related: This Millennial Dad Just Wanted to Help His Daughter Care for Her Bearded Dragon. Then His Cricket-Breeding Side Hustle Exploded — Earning $27,000 in One Month.How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue, and at what point did the side hustle's income surpass that of your full-time job (if it did)? 


I started tutoring full-time in 2018 when I realized my tutoring rate was higher than my salary. As you know, teachers in Arizona are not paid well even with my advanced degrees — which seemed to be a detriment since they did not want to pay me at a higher rate. I was making about $47,000 annually before taxes, so more like $40,000. When Varsity Tutors began offering group classes, I could make a much higher hourly rate, which exceeded my salary at the university. The university paid a lump amount for a class based on enrollment. I had to grade and do a lot of prep and outside work, which I was not paid for. The hourly rate was not great and came to about $10/hour. I decided to go full-time tutoring and found it worked well financially and personally. I liked the flexibility of my schedule and the freedom to teach as I needed to without being micromanaged, which was an issue for me. I am an excellent teacher and have achieved many awards, including state and national recognition for my teaching and impact on students.How much average monthly or annual revenue does it bring in now? I am making an average of about $5,000 per month with Varsity Tutors, which does not include my private students and clients. My annual income is about $80,000, much better than $40,000. I appreciate the students and the support I have been blessed with in this endeavor. I never imagined that I would be doing this, but here it is.Related: She Started Her Side Hustle to Solve a Serious Problem With Outdoor Furniture.

I love working with people and helping them learn and discover the joy of learning. I am a teacher, and going independent has allowed me to teach freely from the comfort of my home. I have a flexible schedule and can live my life in a less stressful way. Follow your passion and build a website to help with PR to connect with others.

Prior to starting my side hustle, I was a licensed social worker for Duke University. I was looking at my salary and realizing I just did all of this hard work and I barely had enough to pay my student loans. I was also experiencing racism within the workplace, so I wanted to find my way to creating a work life that I felt respected and valued in. It was about creating the life that I wanted after feeling stuck with my social work job.When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?


I started my side hustle in 2018. I had just learned about the coaching industry from a friend who was sharing some with me, and I began to dive more into the industry. I found my inspiration for this business from my own story. Daily, I was using skills around sales to build that same level of trust quickly with those that I served. I also wanted to help other people build their businesses. I became inspired to serve other women of color: We can all build this life of freedom together.Related: This Millennial Dad Just Wanted to Help His Daughter Care for Her Bearded Dragon. Then His Cricket-Breeding Side Hustle Exploded — Earning $27,000 in One Month.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I first dove into doing as much learning as possible about the coaching industry, as this was the side hustle I was choosing. I listened to podcasts and gained as much knowledge as possible. From there, I started to use my story in order to promote my coaching. I would showcase myself commuting to work and working before and after my 9-5 to show how others could build their side hustle as well. I would go live on Instagram all the time, and people knew me for my rants and passionate speaking. I began to build a brand slowly about what I was coaching and quickly gained clients.


What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?Learning not to resent your 9-5 is so key. You want to make sure that you see your job as the biggest investor in your business and not the enemy of your business. It helps keep that financial pressure off of your business so you can build a strong business instead.I also learned how to manage my time well so that I was doing well in both areas. I kept the time between the two very separate.Another challenge was the three-and-half-hour commute I had to work as well as the long hours as a social worker. I learned to make the most of this time.


Finally, I learned that if I wanted to be able to make a side hustle a full-time business, I needed a financial plan. I worked to save a year's worth of expenses for business and personal so that I would not feel that strain on my side hustle if and when it was time to quit my job.Related: She Started Her Side Hustle to Solve a Serious Problem With Outdoor Furniture. It Blew Past Her Full-Time Job's Income — to $66,000 a Month.How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue, and at what point did the side hustle's income surpass that of your full-time job?I was consistently seeing monthly revenue pretty quickly. I would say it took a few months to get to that point. About a year later, I was hitting six figures and even got to $300,000 a year when this was still a side hustle. In 2020, at $300,000, I decided it was time to go full-time. I had far surpassed my social worker salary about a year and a half before.


You've turned your side hustle into a full-time business. How much average monthly or annual revenue does it bring in now?Today, I am bringing in $1.5 million with this as my full-time gig. This is my second year in a row hitting a million dollars or more.What's your advice for other side hustlers who hope to turn their ventures into successful businesses?1. Start out with one offer and one marketing platform and get really good at it.


Do not try to have every single marketing platform and tons of offers that you will try to sell. Focus on one side hustle offer and platform and get really good at it. Then once you are established, you can start to add more in, but this is a new skill. Give yourself time to be a master.2. Take on the identity of what you want.If you want to be a six-figure business owner, be that in your identity. Act like this. Talk about how you do this side hustle for work. Be proud and take on the mindset that this is going to be successful. Mindset is very powerful.3. Don't expect your job to bring you happiness.


Remember that your job is investing in your business by letting you make decisions in it without being your only income. Respect it and perform well until the end.4. Have a financial plan.As mentioned, I saved a year's worth of life and business expenses. This made it so that if I did not make another sale, I had runway. This just eases the pressure and stress once you go full-time so that you can make clear decisions.5. Learn the art of sales.


Sales will be something you need to learn. It is a skill, and it does not have to be something we do not like. Instead, lean into learning it by listening to podcasts or finding others who share how to sell well in your industry.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill.

60,Anyone Can Start a Passive Income Side Hustle For Easy Money — But Only If You Know These 5 Essential Tips First.,"Dec 8, 2023",Ryan Barone,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/anyone-can-start-a-passive-income-side-hustle-for-easy/465959,"
A new year is a great time to turn over a new leaf and gain more control over your financial future. Those looking to supplement income and gain more control over their financial future may want to consider starting a passive income side hustle.A side hustle is any activity or business venture that allows individuals to pursue their passions and earn extra money outside of their primary job or career. A side hustle that generates passive income requires minimal effort or doesn't require active participation at all. The rise of digital automation technology has made starting a passive income side hustle easier and more accessible than ever before.Passive income side hustles provide a variety of financial, personal and professional benefits. They can help people supplement income, pay off debts, put kids through college, save for vacations, establish a safety net and build generational wealth. Additionally, side hustles allow individuals to explore their passions while gaining valuable entrepreneurial experience and developing skills that can be beneficial to other areas of life and work. Here are five steps to help you start a passive income side hustle.



Related: 3 Traits That Turn a Side Hustle Into Wealth1. Let your skills, talents and passions guide you Determining which passive income side hustle to pursue is the obvious first step, but it's not necessarily as easy as you might imagine. Before pouring time, energy and money into a side hustle, think hard about what you like to do, what you're good at and what people value. To maximize your chances of success, you must check all three boxes off before embarking on your journey.


If you're a great writer but hate writing, becoming a freelance writer may lead to procrastination, frustration and burnout. Alternatively, tweaking it into a more passive venture, such as maintaining a blog with ads and sponsorships, may be more sustainable. Similarly, suppose you are great at something and like doing it, but people do not value it. In that case, it may be a great hobby, but it won't provide you with the supplemental income you're looking for unless you can adapt the idea into something that people are willing to pay for. Conversely, you may love photography but lack the proper skills to produce quality and marketable results. However, if you're ready to put effort into learning to become really good at taking photos, you can sell them to stock photography websites that can provide a source of passive income.Combining solid skills or natural talent with activities that bring you joy and fulfillment and add value to others is ideal for creating a successful side hustle. Possible ideas for side hustles that generate passive income include renting property, affiliate marketing, stock photography, YouTube automation, investing in dividend stocks or exchange-traded funds (EFTs), and creating an online course or ebook. The opportunities are endless.2. Conduct market researchOnce you've identified a suitable passive income side hustle, it's important to research its market segment to understand its unique characteristics and gauge the demand for your products or services. Consider what similar businesses are offering and charging in that space and how you might be able to differentiate yourself. This will help confirm there is a viable market for your side hustle idea and ensure you realize what it will take to succeed.Conducting due diligence research will also ensure you know any laws, regulations, and taxes that may apply to your new venture. For instance, if you're earning a more significant amount of income, be sure to read up on the IRS tax filing requirements or consult a tax professional for help and advice.


Likewise, study up on local, state and federal laws that pertain to your industry to ensure your side hustle complies with any laws or regulations. Any side hustle may require forming a legally recognized business entity, and there are seven business structures to choose from. It's essential to understand how they function, especially pertaining to tax implications and personal liability, in order to make an informed decision about which one is right for your side hustle. You may even want to consult an attorney and consider purchasing insurance for added protection.3. Consider time commitment and earning goalsBalancing a full-time job and family obligations with any side hustle can be challenging, even one that is considered passive. Therefore, practice effective time management by creating schedules and allocating blocks of time to work on your side hustle. Keeping track of your schedule for a couple of months can help you identify patterns and determine when you can devote time to your side hustle and how much time you will be able to commit to it. Setting realistic goals and prioritizing important tasks is essential to make the most efficient use of your time.It's also essential to think about your earning goals. If you don't have a clear idea about how much money you'd like to make, consider why you're starting a side hustle in the first place. If you're looking for extra income to pay off student loans, for example, make a budget to determine how much extra money you'll need to achieve that goal. Once you have a general idea of your financial goals, research the average amount of money you might make from your side hustle. Remember to compare earning potential to the amount of time you're willing to commit to your new venture. That way, you can set realistic earning goals to start. Once you get into the swing of things, you can always adjust your earning goals.Related: The 8 Best Online Side Hustles of 2023


4. Build a thorough (business) planA side hustle is a business — and just like any other business, it requires a viable plan to be successful. Depending on the type of passive side hustle you choose, building a solid foundation for your venture will require developing a thorough plan, at the very least, or a formal business plan if you're setting up a legal entity. To varying degrees, both plans should identify goals, set a pricing strategy, define target audiences, outline marketing strategies and capture financial projections. Putting your plan in writing will help you envision it holistically, develop it more fully, and discover any areas that may be weak or nonexistent.First, write an executive summary that articulates a clear vision and mission for the business and includes short and long-term goals, purpose and value propositions for the intended market(s). Next, provide detailed descriptions of the products or services to be offered, detailing specific features and benefits. It is essential to highlight any unique qualities that differentiate your business from its competitors and explain how your offering solves specific problems and fulfills specific needs. Finally, provide pricing, projected revenue, expenses and cash flows, as well as a breakdown of any required funding or investments.Once those basics of the business plan are well defined, you can begin building marketing personas. These are descriptions of the types of customers who may benefit from and be interested in your offerings and how you can find and appeal to these customers to build your business. Word of mouth may be effective at first, but you may eventually need to build a marketing plan to attract more customers. Leverage social media to create free business accounts and begin building a following. Ask your friends and family to support your business and help you spread the word.5. Start small, but plan bigIt's admirable to have big dreams and shoot for the stars. Remember that accomplishing such goals can only be done with scalable operations. Constantly question how you are spending your time when working on your side hustle and look for ways to automate manual tasks. The first goal in starting a business is going from zero to one — getting the first customer that values and pays for your work. However, scaling from one to many more requires a non-linear relationship between your time and sales made.


Whether your side hustle is real estate, YouTube automation, stock photography, or blogging, the right software and business operation can help you ensure that you are prepared to scale your side hustle without scaling your time commitment along with it. With thoughtful planning and effective time management, you can increase your chances of success as a side hustle entrepreneur.

Nolan Pelletier for Business Insider
Instead of relying on monolithic utilities to keep the lights on, the rising popularity of solar panels and battery storage could allow average Americans to sell electricity to their neighbors.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. For decades, electricity has flowed one way: from power producers to public utilities, which then distribute it over vast distances to households and businesses. That utility-to-consumer status quo, however, is getting challenged. A growing number of Americans have started generating electricity from solar panels installed at their homes. And new technologies and a fleet of startups are allowing people to not only independently power their homes but also store and sell excess solar power to their neighbors.With this shift, small-scale energy generation and storage facilities (like a residential building outfitted with a solar panel and battery) could not only become a source of income for the people who own the tech but it could improve things for everyone else. People on the traditional grid could see lower costs, greater grid reliability, and less volatile energy prices.



Instead of relying on monolithic utilities and power plants to keep the lights on, the rising popularity of solar panels and battery storage might upend the unidirectional utility power model and electricity markets. The country's electrical grid is quickly turning from a river into a lake, with people able to generate, share, and make money off their own electricity.Power plants on every roofWhile the home-installed solar industry is still a small slice of the country's energy generation, the number of people putting panels on their roofs is growing rapidly. Six percent of single-family, owner-occupied homes in the US had rooftop solar panels at the end of 2022, generating about 37 million megawatt hours a year — enough to power 3 million to 4 million households. And the rate of residential installation is booming: A record 700,000 homeowners installed arrays in 2022, according to the trade group Solar Energy Industries Association. Though the overall percentage of Americans with rooftop solar remains low, some states are much further down the road: California, Texas, and Florida were the top three in solar-installation capacity for the past three years. Many more people will be incentivized to install solar power and energy storage with the subsidies provided by the Inflation Reduction Act and the Solar Investment Tax Credit. In addition to taking power production into their own hands, many of these households are also installing battery-storage units, which collect surplus energy to be used on a (literal) rainy day or sold back into the grid. Beyond home setups, community solar — a system in which customers can subscribe to power produced by a local solar project — is expected to grow by 8% a year through 2028, eventually generating 14 gigawatts, enough to power over 10 million homes.


Once a household generates its own power and has a battery that stores excess energy, there are a few ways a homeowner could earn income from the tech. One way is to simply sell excess supply back to their utility, which pays the customer a fee for the right to distribute the electricity elsewhere. One of the largest California utilities, PG&E, partnered with the solar-energy startup Sunrun to pilot such a program, which paid customers an up-front $750 fee for the right to sell their stored energy to other customers on hot summer nights.And the market may become more lucrative for homeowners. Many newer solar setups use smart technology, which could determine the optimal energy-selling strategy. When spot energy prices are cheap, out-of-the-box trading software could buy power from the grid to power the household and store the solar energy generated on the roof. When prices are higher, it could sell excess supply from the battery back to a utility, thus maximizing the payments. Arcadia, a Washington, DC-based startup launched in 2014, already collects meter data from utilities to help its customers track carbon exposure and predict optimal times in the day to purchase electricity on the open market. This algorithmic trading program could help homeowners turn a passive profit and help smooth demand on the broader grid.The greater autonomy in power production and consumption may allow people to use the electrical devices they buy as mini batteries — a refrigerator or an electric vehicle might dynamically interact with the electricity market to charge themselves when power prices are low and feed some of their energy back to other devices when prices are higher. The US Department of Energy even gave a name to these aggregations of distributed resources: virtual power plants. The DOE's report on the future of VPPs projects that the tech could eventually generate 80 to 160 gigawatts of power annually, which could supply up to 20% of energy needs during times of peak demand in 2030 — while costing 40% to 60% less than alternatives such as natural gas.Algorithmic trading program could help homeowners sell some of their energy back into the grid, earning them a passive profit. Henglein and Steets/Getty via BIAnother option for homeowners is peer-to-peer energy trading. Instead of selling the electricity to the utility, which then distributes it, people could agree to sell their excess power directly to their neighbors using pre-existing grid infrastructure. While this sort of energy sharing would still require the physical cables, substations, or other infrastructure owned by a utility or a city (for which they would charge some fee), people could use third-party apps to buy and sell electricity directly from homes and businesses in their community that are using solar panels. Australia's Localvolts, for example, allows consumers to negotiate peer-to-peer clean-power contracts using an online-trading platform — similar to buying stocks from an online broker. Users buy and sell electricity with any counterparty, whether it's a neighbor or the broader electricity market.This kind of energy trading could eventually scale up so that consumers could customize their energy use depending on their needs and particular preferences. For instance, someone may elect to only buy clean energy produced by a specific group (small local businesses, for instance) or from a select set of producers based on various environmental, social, or geographical characteristics. While the central electrical utility would still be needed as a backup as the market scales, with enough surplus, the big players might eventually be cut out of supplying power to some homes.A win-winDistributed energy and virtual power plants are obviously beneficial to the people who decide to sell off their electricity — customers with installed solar roof capacity already save about $200 in yearly energy expenditures, and they could save $500 or more each year with the technological improvements provided by peer-to-peer energy trading and smart appliances. Beyond becoming a side hustle for sun-drenched homeowners, the new technology also has plenty of benefits for non-income generators as well.


Peer-to-peer energy sharing could drive down the cost of power for all consumers. The relatively cheap cost to produce solar electricity and the shorter distances to transport the power make it a more cost-effective option for those who are able to access VPPs and other energy-saving devices. There are, of course, concerns about the reliability of solar energy. While energy decentralization can't solve all of those problems — if the sun doesn't shine for a week, then consumers will have to rely on backup energy from the main grid — a network of distributed energy suppliers and storage backup can ease the peak loads so that utilities are able to better deploy their own energy. In a world with more self-sustaining households, the grid becomes more reliable and less prone to blackouts while consumers become less vulnerable to one-off price shocks during sudden heat spikes or deep freezes.Early evidence shows that the savings and increased reliability could be widespread. The purchase and installation of a distributed energy resource appears equitable across income ranges. In fact, households with incomes under $100,000 made up half of solar adoption in 2021.The growth of peer-to-peer power plants would also be a boost for the government's investment in green energy. The return on investment afforded by bill savings and surplus power sales would also reduce the need for government subsidies and tax breaks on clean power and storage, a benefit for fiscal planning and governmental budgeting.Making it a realityAustralia, much of the EU, the UK, and 14 US states allow electricity customers to choose their own power retailers. Texas and California, two of the largest solar-generating states in the US, have deregulated the electricity trade and allow the free flow of power, and more states may follow in their footsteps once the benefits of VPPs and DERs materialize.


By connecting solar-powered homes to neighboring houses and businesses, people could make some money while providing benefits for other consumers, their communities, and the planet at large.As more consumers join local power networks through platforms like Arcadia and Localvolts, the virtuous cycle of market forces and price competition could lower electricity prices. The optimization of power consumption may also lead to an imaginative reassessment of home devices and vehicles: Instead of blindly consuming energy while they charge, gadgets attached to the grid could become sources of energy in a shortage. For example, the cost of charging an electric car will come down as the vehicle learns to grab power from the grid only when prices are cheap — and it could even become a battery for other appliances in a pinch.As the world grapples with the need to shift away from oil and other fossil fuels, people will be looking for ways to make the electrical transition more cost-effective and secure. By connecting solar-powered homes to neighboring houses and businesses, people could make some money while providing benefits for other consumers, their communities, and the planet at large.Kartik Menon is a former Goldman Sachs securities trader who wrote quantitative strategies to trade equities and US-listed derivatives.

After attending the workshop, we tested the waters by approaching my mother, who used to rent out her backhouse to long-term tenants. I shared all the information we learned and began offering her accommodations as a short-term rental through Airbnb. It quickly became a profitable endeavor. When Melissa and I went on to buy our own house, we knew we loved the hospitality industry and decided to offer rooms in our home through Airbnb. Over time, we expanded our portfolio to 11 units, and now operate them as our full-time jobs. We have 10 separate properties, and one of them is a single property with two listings. All are located within Southern California.When selecting your properties, what did you look for to help ensure they'd be profitable for short-term rental through Airbnb?


Zev Forrest: First, I researched the location's short-term rental ordinance to make sure the property could be used as a short-term rental property via Airbnb. Our other criteria are constantly evolving, since our goals are changing based on how we see our company's brand. At first, we looked at single-family homes that could fit 8 to 10 people. Later, we started looking at one- or two-bedroom apartments as well that could accommodate traveling couples or corporate professionals. Now, our focus has been on mid-to-high-level luxe, single-family home properties located along the coast.My wife handles the day-to-day operation of our short-term rental business. I work full-time analyzing real estate deals so we can expand our portfolio. When I first look at a property, I always use the AirDNA service to acquire a detailed analysis in terms of its profit potential as a short-term rental property. This service can be a bit pricey, but we have found it's well worth the investment. If that report comes back favorable, I then look at Airbnb itself and search for similar listings to the property we're interested in acquiring that are in the same geographic area. I seek out geographic areas that have at least 10 different Airbnb properties with at least 40 reviews each.If the reviews are above 4.6, generally I consider this to be a good area to acquire a property. I also look at the occupancy rate of these other nearby properties and believe a 60 percent occupancy rate or higher is favorable. Then, depending on the size of the property, I look at the income potential, compared to what the mortgage and operating costs for that property will be, in relation to what we calculate will be the average nightly rate we could charge for that property. For a single-family home, after crunching the numbers before purchasing the property, I am seeking out at least a 30 percent return on the investment. If we're subleasing a home and using rental arbitrage, we're looking to earn between 1.5 to 2 times the lease payment that we'd be paying.When you first got started with your short-term rental business, how much capital did you originally have and how did you quickly expand the business to include 11 units?


Zev Forrest: The first property we started with was one we purchased for 10 percent down via a conventional loan. Speak with a mortgage broker or real estate attorney to figure out the lowest amount of money you can put down for an investment property, and the type of loan you should seek out. The property was priced around $370,000, but after the closing costs and other fees, this was another $60,000. After that, we spent about $12,000 to furnish and decorate the three-bedroom, 1,500-square-foot home. After acquiring this investment property, we did not have the funds to purchase others right away, so we began leasing additional properties and taking advantage of rental arbitrage. This is when you rent someone else's property for a long term and then sublease it out and manage it as a short-term rental property with the landlord's permission. So, if we are spending $2,000 per month for the long-term lease of a property, we aim to earn $4,000 per month using it for short-term rentals through Airbnb. We then earn that $2,000 spread. Through rental arbitrage, we were able to scale our business very quickly, because we were able to show the various landlords our proof of funds to support the long-term leases. Buy now: Entrepreneur Bookstore | Amazon | Barnes & NobleNow that you operate 11 short-term rental units, do you rely on property managers to help you manage them?Melissa Forrest: For the first few years, I managed the day-to-day operation of the properties and managed the cleaners and maintenance people. More recently, we have built a team that's comprised of virtual assistants that I have trained to handle the day-to-day operations involving the guests and the cleaners. The virtual assistants can make financial decisions up to a certain limit before getting me or my husband involved if there's an emergency. Because they are virtual assistants, this keeps our costs low. Rounding out the team, we have a reliable cleaning service and a maintenance service that is local to each unit. I initially find these services on TaskRabbit or Thumbtack, and then build up a relationship with them. For example, the cleaning service or maintenance service will also act as a runner, so if a guest calls and says they need extra towels, for example, the runner will quickly deliver them to the property. The virtual assistants handle all the communications with the guests.For new Airbnb hosts, I recommend having a list of 24-hour plumbers and electricians on call in case an emergency happens. For cleaning services, I originally used a professional cleaning company, but that was a nightmare. They sent out different cleaners to the properties each time, so there was a huge lack of consistency. We found it is much more economical to hire independent contractors as our cleaners, and they've turned out to be much more reliable and consistent. We often find cleaners through referrals and through social media. We can train them to clean and prepare each property for guests exactly how we want it done. The cleaners get to know the ins and outs of the property and how to maintain consistency when preparing and staging each property for each guest. The service called Turno can also be used for finding reliable cleaners, for example.What strategy do you use to set your nightly rates? 


Melissa Forrest: We look at comparable Airbnb properties in the area and pay attention to what the highest-rated and most successful properties are charging. I take this information and then use a dynamic pricing tool, called PriceLabs, to help us set a base nightly price. We then set a minimum price, which is the lowest rate we're willing to go for each unit. The dynamic pricing tool helps us set the optimal price, based on a wide range of factors. This service updates our pricing daily for each property. We believe using a dynamic pricing tool, like PriceLabs, is an absolute necessity for all Airbnb hosts. Not using a tool like this leaves a lot of money on the table.

In 2016, my daughter had a bearded dragon. She really loved it, so it was important that I helped her care for it. But buying crickets was becoming expensive, so I started researching how to breed them. It was really easy because crickets are rampant breeders. It does take some time to rotate their cages, but I eventually had a surplus of crickets. I knew there was a market for it online (because that's where I found the original idea to breed them). So I started letting people know in reptile forums that I had crickets to sell. I had immediate interest, and people kept coming back. So I stuck with it.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill. It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.


What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I'm a prototypical millennial side-hustler, and this wasn't my first time trying out a side hustle. What I learned from past mistakes was that I should not invest time, money or energy in websites or marketing until I had a product and a way to source that product. So when I started breeding crickets, I had a lightbulb moment that this was the product, and I could source that product. Once I had that lightbulb moment, I felt comfortable putting together a Shopify website and trying to promote that website to other reptile owners I met through reptile forums.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them? Learning how to ship crickets was a big hurdle. And even after doing this for seven years, I'm still trying to master shipping. The issue with shipping live animals is that the packaging has to be very specific. Meaning, it has to be vented — or insulated — depending on the time of the year and weather. Otherwise, your customers will receive deceased animals, which is a terrible experience. This means that you need expensive packaging and can't use free packaging products from the post office. So that adds to the expenses — also learning which shipping services to use. Next-day delivery is ideal but is often cost-prohibitive for many people. So you need to find that sweet spot for how long the animals can last en route while also understanding what the weather forecast looks like. This can often include a lot of communication with the customers. So that was something I wasn't prepared for, especially when I entered my first foray into winter shipping.


Image Credit: Courtesy of Jeff NealHow long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly and/or yearly revenue from your side hustle?It was right away that I saw revenue. I was making posts on reptile forums and getting instant replies for interest. When I saw the demand, I knew I should try to ramp up as best I could. But back to winter shipping — that was a big loss because I had to reship so many orders for free due to dead-on-arrivals. Or, because I was out of stock, I had to issue refunds. So that was very challenging. But once I got out of that first winter, I was able to get back into profitability.Related: She Had Side Hustles Flipping Beanie Babies and Christmas Presents. Then the 'Unconventional' Path Led to a Multimillion-Dollar Company of Her Own.How much average revenue does your side hustle bring in monthly and/or yearly? I earn about $30,000 per year in additional income from the side hustle.What's the highest monthly or annual revenue the side hustle's seen to date? Has your side hustle's income surpassed that of your full-time job at any point? Yes, it surpassed my full-time job during the summer of 2020 after Covid. It seemed everyone bought a bearded dragon, which I'm guessing was due to Covid and the lockdowns. And because all the local pet shops were closed, everyone went online looking for live insects. In August of 2020, the website saw $27,000 in revenue. That was the highest monthly revenue I've seen.


What do you enjoy most about your side hustle? It's profitable and gives me something to do with the kids. I'm the sole provider for a household of six, and it's nice having that extra income for my wife and me to do extras during vacations and weekend trips.Related: This Ballet Dancer Needed a Side Hustle When the Pandemic Stopped Performances. So She Spun Her Unique Skill Set Into a 6-Figure Business. What's your advice for other side-hustlers who hope to grow lucrative ventures of their own?


First, find a product and how to source it. Don't spend time, money and energy on building out a website and marketing that website without first knowing which product you are going to sell and where you are going to get that product from. Also, take note of what skills you learn when you start a side hustle. Many side hustles flop, and that's okay. You will learn many business skills trying a side hustle, and those skills are transferable to your full-time job, which can help you advance in your career. So don't worry about a side hustle failing. There is much to learn from failure.

What were you doing before you started your side hustle, and why were you interested in entrepreneurship? 



Before embarking on my entrepreneurial journey, I was employed as an international trade specialist. However, I always had a burning desire to create something I could call my own. The allure of the independence and autonomy that comes with being your own boss was simply too compelling to resist.When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?


My entrepreneurial journey began as a side hustle back in 2018. The spark of inspiration was kindled by my personal experiences. I found that the outdoor furniture covers that were available in the market were far from satisfactory. They were either exorbitantly priced or they were of subpar quality. I recognized a glaring gap in the market for outdoor furniture covers that were both affordable and of high quality.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill.

The initial steps I took on this journey were methodical and well thought out. I conducted in-depth market research to understand the nuances of the market. I also spent a considerable amount of time sourcing high-quality materials that would meet the expectations of my potential customers. Furthermore, I set up an ecommerce platform to facilitate easy and convenient transactions for my customers. A significant part of my initial efforts was also dedicated to understanding the specific needs and preferences of my target customers.


What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them? One of the biggest hurdles I faced was juggling my full-time job with my burgeoning side hustle. Additionally, managing the financial aspects of the business was a daunting task. However, I tackled these challenges head-on by setting clear boundaries, prioritizing tasks effectively and acquiring knowledge about financial management.Related: I Spent the Last 3 Years Building My Side Hustle Into a Full-Time Business.

66,People Are Making Tons of Money With Airbnb and They Don't Even Own Property. Here's How.,"Nov 28, 2023",Jason R. Rich,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-make-money-with-airbnb-without-owning-property/464290,"
In the new book, Start Your Own Airbnb Business, author Jason R. Rich breaks down all of the money-making possibilities with short-term rentals. In this excerpt, he explains ""rental arbitrage.""Buy now: Entrepreneur Bookstore | Amazon | Barnes & NobleInstead of purchasing or financing real estate to be used for short-term rental, some Airbnb hosts have discovered that it's less risky and more lucrative to pinpoint ideal properties and then sign long-term leases for those properties with their existing owners. Once the property is leased, it's then managed as an Airbnb property by the lessee. Of course, the property owner must agree to this arrangement and short-term rentals must be legal in that geographic area.



Subletting a property that you then plan to manage as an Airbnb short-term rental can also be considered a corporate lease. And yes, it includes some risk, but not as much as purchasing (or financing) a property outright. This process is referred to as ""rental arbitrage,"" which means you're renting out a property on a long-term basis for the sole purpose of listing it on Airbnb or a similar service and then managing it as a short-term rental. Buy now: Entrepreneur Bookstore | Amazon | Barnes & NobleChoosing this business model will require you to pay the property owner (lessor) a security deposit (which is typically two months' rent). You'll also need to hire an attorney to help broker the deal, acquire appropriate insurance, and then furnish the property—all of which must be calculated into your startup costs. You'll then incur all the usual fees associated with being an Airbnb host, including cleaning fees, landscaping fees, and potentially property maintenance fees.Airbnb hosts who have chosen to pursue this business model for one or more properties must do careful number crunching to ensure that, based on the anticipated occupancy rate when offered as an Airbnb property, it will generate enough revenue to cover the lease and all related expenses, plus generate at least a 20 percent profit each month.


A contingency plan must also be put in place to cover expenses when the Airbnb occupancy rate drops lower than expected, yet the property owner still expects their monthly lease payment and other expenses must also continue to be covered. Thus, you do not want to lease a property that will only generate Airbnb (or short-term rentals) seasonally, unless the profit you're able to generate during the peak season will cover your leasing and operating expenses for the entire year.According to iGMS, ""Once you have gotten the hang of how a corporate lease on Airbnb works, you can basically apply the same strategy to get a second property. This way you can grow your property portfolio and ultimately your business much faster. As you will be using others' properties, you can start a short-term rental business without owning any of your own rental properties.""If you choose to adopt a rental arbitrage business model, seriously consider forming and operating as an LLC (Limited Liability Corporation), which provides you with some added legal protections. Again, consult with an attorney before pursuing this type of short-term rental opportunity. Once you become fully acquainted with the corporate leasing strategy and have one unit successfully up and running (and profitable), you can grow your business by leasing additional properties that you'll also operate as short-term rentals via Airbnb.Profit PotentialLet's say you sign a long-term lease on a home or apartment that costs you $2,000 per month. You can then potentially sublet that property via Airbnb for $200 per night. Once you add your expenses, if you're able to maintain an occupancy rate that includes at least 12 to 15 paid nights per month, you'll probably wind up breaking even. Then, any additional nights you book via Airbnb will generate a profit for you. So, during a month with 30 days, your profit potential is around $2,000 (assuming 100 percent occupancy, which is rarely achievable on a consistent basis, unless you offer a superior property within an in-demand location and charge a competitive nightly rate compared to the competition, or you're able to consistently book long-term guests who reserve the property for one or more months at a time).


While these numbers are used for demonstration purposes only, don't even consider leasing a property that you're not extremely confident will have at least a 50 percent occupancy rate via bookings through Airbnb and similar services. Otherwise, the financial risk increases rather dramatically. According to Airbtics, ""There are certainly various ways to find rental arbitrage properties, but it may take some time to figure out the best ones for you if you don't conduct the necessary research carefully.""

I was working full-time in public health as a program manager. I always had an entrepreneurial spirit, but due to my medical background and career path, I never thought I'd actually act on my ideas.When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it? 


I started my side hustle of flipping furniture in February 2022 when I received a dentist bill of over $10,000. I needed to pay it off quickly, and I was scrolling through Facebook Marketplace when I thought of the idea.I worked at my office job 8-5 Monday through Friday, then hopped into my garage every day after work until around 8 p.m., sacrificing every weekend to work on my side hustle. I did this until January 2023 when I was sitting at my desk job and realized how much money I was losing by working there versus going full-time with my side hustle.Related: I Spent the Last 3 Years Building My Side Hustle Into a Full-Time Business. Here's What I Learned.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?


I bought a $50-ish nightstand and an orbital sander. I sanded it down, put some stain on it and added legs to make it a nice liquor cabinet. I believe I sold it a week later for about $195. I really enjoyed the process and loved the cash, plus I had leftover supplies, so I decided to keep going. I then began filming my process and story on my Instagram, @thefurnituredr, which opened up a whole other world of income possibilities.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?I had/have a big issue with trusting others to help me with tasks, so I did everything myself for a while. I finally found a great manager to help with brand collaborations (shoutout Melissa from Happy Place Management!) and hired some of my fiancé's cousins to help me manage social media comments. I also hired bookkeepers, CPAs and financial advisors to help me get my finances in order so I could focus on the fun part of my job...the creative aspect!Related: Are You Ready for a Side Hustle? Here's How to Know.How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue, and at what point did the side hustle's income surpass that of your full-time job?

I've learned the most from others who are not in my industry and found unique ways to apply their advice to my own business and niche. I've also found that scrolling social media feeds does nothing but limit my creativity and inspiration. The less I scroll, the more creative I become and the better my content and business perform.

In the new book, Start Your Own Airbnb Business, author Jason R. Rich breaks down the details of short-term rentals as a lucrative side hustle. In this excerpt, he explains how to set pricing based on your location and property type.How to Set Your Nightly PricingBefore you can set your nightly pricing, you need to understand what you're offering and what potential guests are willing to pay for that type of accommodation. The more space, privacy, luxury, and uniqueness you're able to provide to guests, the more you'll be able to charge. That said, your income potential for renting out one room of your residence that will accommodate one or two people will be much lower than renting out an entire multi-bedroom house or apartment that can accommodate an entire family, for example.Buy now: Entrepreneur Bookstore | Amazon | Barnes & NobleBeyond just the space or property type you're offering for accommodations, some of the other factors that go into price setting include:Your property's geographic location and popularity (being located close to a tourist attraction, theme park, lake, ocean, ski resort, or special event will allow you to charge a premium). Short-term rental properties in regions that attract a lot of tourists tend to have a higher occupancy rate and have a higher nightly rate based on demand. If your property is not in a major tourist area, you'll do better if it's close to public transportation, restaurants, activities, recreation centers, and shopping, for example. Hosts with properties close to hospitals or colleges tend to attract longer-term guests.The collection of amenities being offered. Amenities go beyond offering an iron and shampoo. Some amenities that are desirable include a swimming pool, fireplace, hot tub, fully equipped chef's kitchen, or a spectacular view.How many people your space can comfortably accommodate? This determines if you'll attract solo travelers, business travelers, couples, or families.The type of guests you're looking to attract. By catering to upscale guests, families with kids, people traveling with pets, honeymooners, or business travelers, for example, and offering accommodations and amenities that'll appeal to your intended guests, you can often charge premium rates.Seasonality. Ideally, you want your short-term rental property to be in demand throughout the year. However, many places attract seasonal tourists, whether it's for water-based activities in the summer or skiing in the winter. If your property will only attract bookings during certain times of the year, make sure you'll be able to maximize revenue during that period and consider offering significant discounts to increase your occupancy rate during the off-season(s).Your ratings and reviews as a host.Whether or not the property is pet-friendly, family-friendly, or suitable for a special occasion (such as a honeymoon).If the property is equipped for remote workers or business travelers.If the property is handicap accessible or suitable for guests with special needs; this, too, can increase your occupancy rate, but not necessarily allow you to charge a premium rate.Whether what you opt to charge is in line with your business goals and profit objectives.Analyze Your Local CompetitionStart by exploring the Airbnb website (or mobile app) and figure out what other hosts with comparable properties in your area are charging. Be sure to check pricing for weekdays, weekends, holiday periods, and weekly rates for each property. Pay attention to the amenities and type of property being offered. As a potential guest looking for accommodations, you can use Airbnb's filters to match the type of accommodations you're planning to offer in your geographic area. As you evaluate your local competition, pay attention to whether Instant Booking or Self Check-In options are offered, whether the competition is offering standard Airbnb accommodations, accommodations operated by a Superhost, operating an Airbnb Plus property, and what additional fees the individual hosts are charging.



Once you've become acquainted with your local competition from other Airbnb hosts, go online or call nearby hotels, motels, B&Bs, and/or resorts. Determine their nightly pricing and what amenities these properties offer. Ultimately, you need to be able to justify your pricing, in part, based on what others are charging for similar accommodations.What to Consider When Setting Your RatesBeyond setting a default nightly rate for your property, you may choose to charge added fees for specific services and require a refundable deposit. Then, based on demand and other factors, you may opt to increase that nightly rate on weekends (Friday and Saturday nights), during holiday periods, and/or during peak travel times (such as school vacation periods). Or, depending on your goals, you might opt to attract more guests by offering various types of discounts or promotions. As you're about to discover, Airbnb gives hosts a lot of flexibility when it comes to setting their pricing. Let's look at some of your options.Pros and Cons of Short-Term, Weekly, and Long-Term RentalsIn addition to taking advantage of Airbnb's own Smart Pricing tool, which automatically adjusts your nightly rate based on demand (which will be explained shortly), beyond setting a default nightly rate, you have the option of setting special weekend pricing, as well as discounted rates for weekly, monthly, or even longer-term bookings. For weekly bookings, for example, Airbnb recommends offering at least a 25 percent discount off your default nightly rate. For a monthly booking (28 consecutive days or longer), Airbnb recommends offering at least a 50 percent discount off your default nightly rate.


Buy now: Entrepreneur Bookstore | Amazon | Barnes & NobleThese discount recommendations are just general guidelines, not requirements. Some hosts opt to offer just a 10 percent discount for weeklong bookings and a 20 to 30 percent discount for monthlong bookings, for example. But most travelers using Airbnb to find accommodations expect to receive some type of discount if they book an entire week (seven or more nights), a month (28 or more nights), or for an even longer term.For example, if your property is located close to a college, you might attract visiting professors or students looking to stay with you for an entire semester (or longer). When you're offering your property for short stays, with a bit of luck and hard work, you'll hopefully achieve an above-average occupancy rate for your region. You'll be able to charge your full nightly rate (or even a premium during peak times) to your short-term guests. However, you'll have a lot of guest turnover. This means having to clean your property more often, manage more bookings, and have more interaction with a greater number of people.

70,How to Know If You're Ready to Leave Your 9-5 and Go All In on Your Side Hustle,"Nov 20, 2023",Jason Miller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/are-you-ready-to-ditch-your-9-5-for-your-side-hustle/464131,"
Ask yourself, why do you need to quit your 9-5 to go full-time into your side hustle? How will quitting help you and what is your motivation to do so? In the U.S., 28% of people state that becoming their own boss is their top motivator to go all into their side hustle.Maybe you have another reason for wanting to leave your job for entrepreneurship. You could want to make more money or spend more time working on your own business. If you think you're ready to leave your 9-5, ask yourself these three important questions honestly.Related: 44 Side Hustle Ideas to Make Extra Money in 2023



Do I have a proven business model that's been tested?Nearly 50% of businesses fail within their first five years of operation. This isn't to discourage you and in fact, can be used as motivation instead. Knowing this and learning from other businesses can help you minimize risks and figure out what your competition will be like.Making about two-thirds of your full-time job's salary for about a year at your side hustle is a good place to start on deciding if you're profitable enough to quit your job. You should also be using the money from your job to put money aside for emergencies. Running out of cash is one of the top reasons businesses fail so by having a cash cushion you'll be able to give your side hustle the time and attention it deserves to succeed. Everyone's expenses are different, but for me, I would want at least 6 to 12 months of savings.


If it's one thing I've learned, owning a business affects you mentally, emotionally and physically. And on the days that don't go as planned, you're going to have to stay strong and positive. By becoming bogged down with a few bad weeks here and there, your productivity will slide and you'll lose your motivation. That's why I preach business is less about motivation and more about consistency. Anyone can be motivated for a short period of time. But putting in constant effort even on the hard days, will separate the side hustlers from the full-time business owners.Do I have support?It's important to remember starting a business isn't just hard on you as an entrepreneur, but it's going to be challenging for your whole family. At least at the beginning, you may have less time and energy to spend with your spouse or kids and you'll need your spouse's support to do that and to get through business challenges. If you're spending more time on your business, your spouse may need to do more work at home or even have to work more hours to offset the financial responsibilities temporarily. Have you thought about how else quitting your job would affect your family? How would you deal with things like healthcare and benefits or daycare?Getting support from people who've been in your shoes can make all the difference on your entrepreneurial journey. Whether you're in a course and leaning on your teacher and peers for advice or other business owners in your industry, it's important to be open to feedback and to handle criticism with an open mind. When I was younger and didn't want to ask for help, I quickly learned how leaning on others for support was so important, especially when starting.Related: Can You Turn Your Side Hustle into a Business? Consider These 3 Things.


What's my backup plan?This one is controversial and can be a hard pill to swallow because many entrepreneurs see it as allowing yourself the option to fail or quit. But I think it's important to be realistic especially when you have other people counting on you to be the provider. That's one reason I always suggest not to burn bridges with former employers.Tell senior management about your plans first so they don't receive the news from one of your peers. Give your full two weeks' notice, or whatever your contract states. If you're in a management role, you may want to give more notice and let the company decide what they would prefer. Continue to show up and do your work to the best of your capability. Now isn't the time to slack. It not only says a lot about your character if you continue to show up with integrity, but it also ensures you're not putting extra pressure on your team. And avoid gossip and avoid speaking badly about the company or any employees. Doing this will also help keep your leave on a positive and friendly note.There are no real rules to follow when you're ready to go full-time into your side hustle because we're all different and so are our situations. I'm just giving you guidelines so you can start asking yourself the important questions to know if you're ready to leave your job. But if you think you're ready and you have a proven business model that's been consistently bringing in cash, have the right support, and have a backup plan, you're on your way to successfully quit your job and go all into your side hustle.

      Key Takeaways    



        Schulz started offering virtual corporate wellness and team events to combat the isolation caused by Covid-19.
      


        Although she's returned to her first love dance, she continues to work on her business alongside it — and has no plans to stop. 
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Danielle Schulz, a ballet dancer at the Metropolitan Opera and founder of The Triangle Sessions, a corporate wellness company offering company retreats, interactive wellness classes and team-building events. She is based in the Greater Philadelphia Area. Image Credit: Devin Cruz.You'd been a dancer with the Metropolitan Opera since 2014 when Covid hit. How did your life and work change in those early days of the pandemic, and when did you know it was time to supplement your income with a side hustle?



When Covid hit, I was in the middle of Die Fliegende Hollander and was slated to perform in Turandot a few weeks later. I had nurtured positions teaching fitness and ballet at New York City studios, which I continued via Zoom to stay financially afloat. However, I was also three months pregnant, and my husband was a full-time student. I had to get creative quickly. One of the first social impacts of Covid that everyone struggled with was isolation. It gave me the idea to start offering corporate wellness and team events to help employees stay connected in the newly virtual workplace.Related: Being an Entrepreneur Means Finding Profit in Your PassionHow did your professional background inspire you to launch The Triangle Sessions? How did that skill set translate to your entrepreneurial journey?I graduated in 2009 from NYU Tisch with a dance degree and a minor in art history. It was a terrible time to graduate, especially with an arts degree. I turned down an apprenticeship with a small ballet company to perform as a dancer on a cruise ship and travel the world. Believe it or not, this was simply the more practical approach at the time. I was able to give up my New York City apartment, live expense-free and save money. This experience served as a crash course in travel and tourism, something that would come into play 10 years later when organizing a large-scale retreat for a national law firm.After my cruise ship contract, I danced with a small contemporary company while waiting tables at high-end restaurants. It was the New York City restaurant scene that provided excellent training in wine, spirits and food pairings. Like the cruise ship, I learned the value of customer service and how to connect with a wide variety of people. Waiting tables still goes down as the hardest job I've ever had, but it was too physically demanding while dancing.Related: Shift Your Perspective From Getting to Giving to Get Unstuck


When I got my break at the Metropolitan Opera, a dream job for years, there was a catch…it still wasn't full-time. So, I had to supplement my income in a way that would be easier on my body. I became a certified yoga teacher, certified nutrition counselor and Ballet Beautiful trainer for celebrity clients. All of these skills allowed me to share a deeper understanding of the human body with a wide range of people. It set me up beautifully for teaching corporate wellness.For years, I continued to perform at the Metropolitan Opera while juggling a slew of part-time work. It wasn't until my aunt, a former ballroom champion and long-time business owner, told me something that I'll never forget: ""Dani, you already have the mentality of an entrepreneur in the way you support yourself. You have multiple income streams. Figure out how to work for yourself, not other people, so that you can share your knowledge on your own terms."" It was a lightbulb moment that got the wheels turning. It took a pandemic and a layoff from the Met Opera to pursue the endeavor full-time. What was your vision for The Triangle Sessions, and what were some of the first steps you took to get it off the ground?I wanted to implement the knowledge I developed in my professional dance career around healthy habits and performing at one's best. I wanted to replicate the camaraderie I had experienced in the dance world through high-quality, purpose-driven experiences and apply it to the corporate world.


When Covid first hit, I offered virtual wellness classes….yoga, meditation, desk stretching, etc., always with some type of social component. No one was interested. People just wanted alcohol and happy hours. I started incorporating educational wine and sake tastings WITH corporate wellness, and suddenly, there was interest! I found a fantastic vendor to help put together high-quality experience kits (and accommodate some of my wacky requests, like combining foam rollers with bottles of Prosecco and gourmet snacks), and I hit the ground running. Related: Side Hustles for These TimesHow did you approach continuing to build, and what does your revenue look like?Initially, the vast majority of business came from my own network, referrals and word-of-mouth. After some time hosting virtual team-building and wellness events, I became a small fish in a large pond. So, I partnered (and still continue to partner) with larger team-building event companies in which my services are offered. They have a dedicated sales team, and it provides steady revenue, all while nurturing my own clients and relationships. Annual revenue for 2022 was $110,000.


What were some of the biggest challenges along the way, and how did you navigate those?The biggest challenge is trying to anticipate the needs of organizations and their employees without straying too far from our own mission. Employee well-being and community are at the backbone of The Triangle Sessions. I keep an open mind and experiment to see where there's interest. In 2020, happy hours were in vogue. This last year it's been all about wellness and creativity. Luckily, I enjoy this process and love having an open dialogue with clients to learn about their needs. Many of our signature events, like our Build-A-Terrarium workshop, which combines plant care with self-care, have been inspired by client requests.Personally, I've struggled to find the balance between running The Triangle Sessions and wanting to continue to dance. Dance is my first love, my identity since I was three years old. I returned to the Met Opera part-time in 2021 and scaled back on the number of productions I usually perform to focus on building The Triangle Sessions. However, keeping my foot in the door at the Met sometimes leads to losing momentum. It's a risk I'm willing to take for now since I have the best of both worlds. Martha Graham once said, ""A dancer dies twice—once when they stop dancing, and this first death is the more painful."" These words ring true, but I'm grateful to be building another satisfying career around community, connectivity and high-quality performance.

Starting a Wellness Revolution.Do you have any advice for other professionals who want to start a side hustle or full-time business?Lean into your strengths. Learn your core values. Reflect on what makes you different. From there, assess how these skills can benefit others and bring out the best in communities. It may take a bit of experimentation and creativity, but the process can be surprisingly satisfying. Sometimes, you just need to start somewhere and see what happens. Celebrate the small wins and run (or dance!) at your own pace.

76,He Started a Side Hustle in His Dorm Room With 'a Bunch of Ingredients From Amazon and a Crockpot' — Now It's a $56 Million Brand in Walmarts Nationwide,"Nov 15, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/dorm-room-side-hustle-turns-into-56-million-aftercare-brand/465365,"
Oliver Zak, co-founder of tattoo aftercare brand Mad Rabbit, was at his third tattoo appointment when the alarm bells started to go off: Guidance was seriously lacking around the proper way to care for fresh ink, and the oft-recommended petroleum jelly solution didn't work for him — in fact, it only made his scabs worse.""For tattoos, scabs are pretty bad,"" Zak tells Entrepreneur. ""The ink gets lodged in the scab, and when the scabs fall off, your tattoo that you just spent tons of hours and pain and money on can look pretty rough after, as soon as week two. It was that initial pain point that drew me to wanting to formulate a more natural, clean and vegan solution for tattoo healing.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Mad Rabbit. Oliver Zak, left; Selom Agbitor, right.



It was 2019, the second semester of Zak's senior year of college, when he and Mad Rabbit co-founder Selom Agbitor got to work. With the help of Zak's mother and her apothecary knowledge, the duo created an all-natural moisturizer that was ""kind of a test"" to see if a natural brand in the tattoo space would resonate with people.""That product ended up being product that we ran with for the first two years.""""So we ended up ordering a bunch of ingredients from Amazon and a crockpot and trying recipe after recipe after recipe,"" Zak recalls, ""going off of the feedback of my mom's apothecary experience. That product [a spot moisturizer for tattoos with a shea and cocoa butter base] ended up being the product that we ran with for the first two years.""The summer after graduation, the co-founders focused on transitioning the side hustle out of Zak's kitchen and into a full-fledged venture. They flew to Los Angeles to interview manufacturers and doubled down on Facebook ads and brand-building through paid media. Within two years, Mad Rabbit's single balm product brought in nearly $3 million in revenue, Zak says. At that point, Zak and Agbitor knew they ""had something really special.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Mad RabbitThe hit product convinced them to expand, and in 2020, they were invited to appear on Shark Tank. Zak calls the experience ""a dream come true"" — growing up, he'd watched the show with his family every Friday. Ultimately, after 10 days of preparation in a Covid-bubble Las Vegas hotel room, Mad Rabbit struck a deal with Mark Cuban: $500,000 for a 12% stake in the company.


Related: How ZinePak Built a Growing Publishing Empire on the Back of Bieber Fever""Not only did [Shark Tank] help us with general brand and household awareness, but it was also a helpful opportunity for us to hop on the venture capital train and raise a proper seed round from a venture-backed firm,"" Zak says.The weekend after the co-founders' Shark Tank appearance, Mad Rabbit did an additional $500,000 in sales and rode that momentum into introductions with other venture capitalist groups, ultimately stumbling across Acronym Venture Capital, led by general partner Joshua Siegel.""He's just very founder-friendly,"" Zak says of Siegel. ""I like to think of him as a visionary because he got in very early on something people [overlooked]. People just assume tattoos are taboo and the market's too small for any sort of venture backing, but we ended up finding a fantastic partner as a result who is excited about the momentum that we've built [and] the progress that we've made.""


Image Credit: Courtesy of Mad Rabbit""It was a bit of an uphill battle as far as us really proving out that tattoos are a big thing, and they're here to stay, literally.""In March, Mad Rabbit announced a Series A investment of $10 million led by Lucas Brand Equity with Mark Cuban, Acronym Venture Capital, H Venture Partners and others, quadrupling the brand's valuation to $56 million.Like every business, Mad Rabbit faced its fair share of challenges throughout its founding journey, Zak notes. But one of the most recent — and ""exciting"" — ones? That would be securing the brand's place in retail. It's ""pretty easy for a brand to represent itself online,"" Zak says, but there's an additional hurdle when it comes to landing coveted space on physical shelves, especially if some view it as ""taboo.""

Now She's Helping Kids Launch Big Ideas of Their Own.""It was a bit of an uphill battle as far as proving that tattoos are a big thing, and they're here to stay, literally,"" Zak explains. In 2012, around 20% of adults had at least one tattoo in the U.S.; now, that number sits around 32%, according to Pew Research Center. ""So there's been massive cultural adoption of art that is permanent on bodies,"" Zak says.But the co-founders finally got retail giant Walmart on their side. The retailer took seven of Mad Rabbit's products nationwide, effectively rolling the brand out as the ""tattoo destination of mass America"" over the past few months, Zak says. Now, Mad Rabbit's ""tripling down on Walmart"" — collaborating with the retailer on ""a kind of tattoo roadshow,"" where the team travels to Walmarts across the U.S. to ""get people excited to come get tattooed, hopefully in the parking lot.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Mad Rabbit


""I always say that college is the lowest-risk time you could possibly learn some lessons — you don't have a full-time job to worry about.""Mad Rabbit also continues to ""invest pretty heavily"" into influencer and celebrity partnerships and ""go deeper"" within the tattoo artist community, which Zak credits with facilitating the growth of tattoo culture.""It's increasingly important for us to not only win them over as kind of the aftercare recommendation to replace that petroleum jelly pain point that I shared earlier, but we're also at the point where we're innovating on products that they use in their tattooing process,"" Zak says, ""so focusing on the professional channel and creating better products for the artist to use as well.""Related: How This High School Dropout Got Mark Cuban's Attention and Disrupted an Industry


And for other emerging entrepreneurs who hope to turn their side hustles into successful full-time businesses, Zak has a perhaps unexpected piece of advice: ""Keep it a side hustle as long as you can.""""Especially for those considering starting something in college,"" Zak explains. ""I always say that college is the lowest-risk time you could learn some lessons — you don't have a full-time job to worry about. You most likely don't have a wife and kids and a house to pay off. College really is the only time where you have a ton of [room] to fail.""

This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Nicholas Deniz was waiting to enter Disney World in Orlando with his clients last month when a park manager pulled him out of line.Deniz is a third-party tour guide. He said he was waiting with clients at the time to help them navigate the park.When Deniz walked away with the manager, he said two Orange County police officers greeted him.Corinne, one of Deniz's clients who was present at the time, said she ""felt horrible"" as she watched the scene unfold.



""It felt like he had done something terribly wrong, the way that they pulled him aside and spoke to him,"" said Corinne, whose last name is known to Insider and has been withheld for privacy concerns.After speaking with park staff, Deniz said a police officer handed him a trespass notice and told him he was indefinitely banned from all Walt Disney World properties. He said the officer told him the ban could be appealed via a handwritten letter addressed to Disney's security director after one year. Insider has reviewed a copy of the trespass notice.Those who violate the order could face arrest, according to local law.""Unauthorized commercial activities are not permitted at Disney World as clearly stated in our property rules,"" a Disney spokesperson told Insider in a statement. A spokesperson for the Orange County Sheriff's Office told Insider they have deputies assigned to work at the park every day.


Insider spoke with nine third-party business owners and tour guides impacted by a crack-down on their services, five of whom have received the notices themselves. Several say they've been operating for years — one for nearly three decades — and have never before had an issue.Many of these businesses help clients secure dining and lodging reservations at Disney World, design their itineraries, and help them navigate the parks.Several third-party business owners also told Insider that they provide services at a lower rate than Disney, which charges $450-$900 per hour for private tours. One third-party operator said their prices range from $180-$250 per hour, while another said their rate can go up to $300 per hour. (It's worth noting that Disney's tours can get visitors to the front of lines and into backstage areas that third-party operators can't.)Now, several owners and tour guides say they're facing financial insecurity as their jobs vanish, and they just want a seat at the table with Disney to find a solution.


""None of us are attempting to portray Disney in a negative light, but are just desperate for answers,"" Alayna Crutchfield, a third-party guide and owner of Elevate Amusement, told Insider.Third-party tour guides at Disney say they've been providing services for years with no problemsRamón Rodriguez has run his business, Theme Park Concierges, for 12 years. He received a trespass notice, which was reviewed by Insider, on October 4.""We provide a service to Disney itself by bringing clients, high-end clients,"" Rodriguez said. ""My clients aren't eating hamburgers and hot dogs and popcorn. They go to Disney's high-end restaurants. They stay at Disney's luxury hotels.""Murray Krasnoff runs a third-party concierge and tour guide business called Suntastic Service. He told Insider his company has operated since 1996 and never had an issue with Disney security before last month.


Murray Krasnoff pictured at Disney World. Courtesy of Murray Krasnoff via BIKrasnoff said his company specializes in helping visitors who have disabilities navigate the park. He received a trespass notice on October 11 from the Orange County Sheriff's Office when he walked onto Disney property.""I have four families in November and I have a party of 17 over Christmas week with three people with special needs,"" Krasnoff told Insider. ""I've been on the phone with them saying, 'I'm sorry to tell you this.' Now they're all stressing about what can be done.""


Crutchfield said she runs a similar business to Krasnoff and works with him often. She also received a trespass notice last month.""I've had to cancel,"" Crutchfield said. ""And a lot of my families, they have children with disabilities.""Disney World does offer specific services for visitors with disabilities, including the Disability Access Service — designed to help those who have difficulty waiting in lines for long periods of time — and rental vehicles to help people navigate the park.Since implementing the Disability Access Service in 2013, however, Disney has faced multiple lawsuits concerning its treatment of disabled visitors in both Florida and California.


A 2014 lawsuit filed on behalf of dozens of plaintiffs claimed Disney violated the Americans With Disabilities Act by making disabled guests wait too long in line. The majority of the plaintiffs cited experiences at the Florida location. A Florida judge ruled in favor of Disney in 2022, according to court documents.Disney says a rise in unauthorized activity and rule abuses led to the crackdownKrasnoff said he understands Disney is private property, but he's confused about why the industry was allowed to operate for so many years: ""Why now, all of a sudden, is this happening?""A spokesperson for Disney said the company is serving trespass notices to these businesses because they are conducting unauthorized activity — even if clients are paying outside park property — because the delivery of the service is occurring on park property.The spokesperson also said there has been an uptick in abuses of the Disability Access Service and other services, which impede park operations. The spokesperson declined to provide any documentation of this increase.


Several third-party tour guides and business owners agreed that not everyone in their industry behaves ethically.One third-party tour guide, who has been in the industry for six years, said there are several companies that are ""widely known"" to abuse Disney's rules. Her identity, which is known to Insider, has been withheld for privacy concerns.""For instance, these companies might tell guides to tell guest services they have Irritable Bowel Syndrome to get a disability pass for themselves,"" the business owner told Insider.Deniz said he had also witnessed unethical behavior in the industry.


""I initially worked for a different company,"" Deniz said. ""I left because their owner was involved in some of those unethical practices, and I didn't want to be associated with that any longer.""Nicholas Deniz poses with Mickey Mouse. Courtesy of Nicholas Deniz. via BIThe business owners and families that spoke to Insider said they did not participate in these practices.


Both Deniz and Hanks said they also spoke to Disney employees who told them they could operate on park property as long as they did not abuse park systems, like the Disability Access Service.Business owners say they're searching for answers — and want to work with Disney to find a solutionSeveral business owners and their employees told Insider that their only source of income has now disappeared.Melinda Hanks has run her business, Create a Dream, since 2008. She told Insider it's her family's only source of income.""This was my livelihood, and it's completely stopped,"" Hanks said.


Summer, one of Hanks' employees at Create a Dream, said she's lost her primary source of income, too. She asked to withhold her last name — which is known to Insider — over privacy concerns.""This was the only income that I was bringing in,"" Summer told Insider. ""Now I have to move, and I don't have a place to go.""Meanwhile, Rodriguez said he had to return $25,000 to his clients. He was forced to cancel their trips after receiving his trespass notice.Several of the business owners and tour guides told Insider all they want is to work with Disney to find a solution.Hanks told Insider she hopes that third-party guides can get a seat at the table with Disney to find a solution for both sides.Krasnoff agreed — he said he hopes third-party tour guides can work with Disney to find a solution that benefits both parties, such as a third-party tour guides association approved by Disney.""Why can't we have an association for the many guides here? Let's have an association. Let's put together guidelines of what's accepted, what's not accepted, and work together as affiliates,"" Krasnoff said.Krasnoff said he and his fellow tour guides ultimately just want answers.""We're not trying to bash Disney,"" Krasnoff said. ""We're just confused, saying, 'What just happened?'""

78,Airbnb Side Hustlers Are Making Thousands of Dollars Every Month. Here Are 10 Things to Know to Turn Your Extra Space Into Cash.,"Nov 7, 2023",Jason R. Rich,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/10-things-to-know-before-you-become-an-airbnb-host/464287,"
The new book, Start Your Own Airbnb Business outlines everything you need to know about making money with short-term rentals. In this excerpt, author Jason R. Rich outlines the important steps you should take before jumping in.Buy now: Entrepreneur Bookstore | Amazon | Barnes & NobleJust as with any business opportunity, there are a handful of prerequisites that will help lead to your success as an Airbnb host. As you first begin contemplating whether to become an Airbnb host, it's important to have a clear understanding of what you're signing up for. The following are 10 important factors to consider before you register to become an Airbnb host and begin having guests stay in your home or property.



Determine if local laws and/or the bylaws of your apartment complex, co-op board, or homeowner's association prevent you from utilizing your home or apartment to host paid guests via short-term rentals.Determine if you have the personality, time, wherewithal, and willingness to interact with and manage guests (strangers) who will be staying at your home or property.You're able to consistently provide a clean, comfortable, well-located, and desirable place for people to stay.Your lifestyle and schedule allow you to be available to your guests and have people staying in your home. If you have young children or unfriendly pets, for example, this could be problematic. If you're not going to be readily available, are you willing to pay a property manager to oversee your Airbnb rental(s)? This will be deducted from your potential profits.You're willing to set competitive nightly pricing, based on what you're offering, competition, and demand in your geographic area.You understand that as a host, customer service is an important key to your success. This will require an ongoing time commitment and effort on your part. Successful Airbnb hosts consistently receive positive feedback and great reviews from their guests. Earning anything less than stellar reviews and ratings will have a lasting and negative impact on your future success as a host.Prior to having guests pay to stay with you, it's necessary to sign up to become a host with Airbnb. This requires you to create a detailed, accurate, and well-written profile that conveys information about yourself and what you're offering. You'll also need to take and share professional-quality photos of your property. For the best results, seriously consider hiring a professional real estate photographer to take and edit your property images.Before each guest checks in, it is necessary to prepare your property. This means both cleaning it and providing a selection of amenities that will make guests feel more comfortable and welcome. As a result of COVID-19, guests now expect a thorough cleaning and disinfecting of the property in between stays. Adherence to Airbnb's five-step enhanced cleaning process is an absolute must. In 2023, and moving forward indefinitely, hosts must also follow Airbnb's COVID-19 safety practices, which change as new guidance is provided by the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention within the United States.Protect your own property and belongings. In addition to having adequate insurance (that covers you having paying guests stay in your home), make sure that any expensive décor (antiques, art, etc.), home electronics, and furnishings will remain safe, even with guests staying in your home. Through AirCover from Airbnb, hosts receive $3 million in damage protection (caused by guests to your home) but make sure your homeowner's or renter's insurance covers you serving as an Airbnb host and that you have ample liability insurance (beyond what's provided by Airbnb) if someone gets injured on your property, for example. This is something you should discuss, in advance, with your insurance broker.Develop a comprehensive list of ""House Rules"" that your guests will need to abide by. These rules need to be spelled out and clearly communicated to guests, and then enforced, but also be fair. The rules you set will help determine the types of guests who stay with you. For example, your House Rules can include: no smoking, no pets, no kids, no parties, no noise after 11 p.m., and/or no utilizing or accessing certain areas of your home or property.The Factors for Success as an Airbnb HostUltimately, how successful you can be as an Airbnb host depends on several key factors, including the location of your property, the type of accommodations you're able to offer, timing, and the overall experience you can offer to your guests. For example, offering a single bedroom within your home with a shared bathroom, which is in a rural area and not close to any major tourist attractions or local events and only offered on weekdays (as opposed to weekends and holidays), will generate a much lower income than an entire home or apartment that's within a major city or that's close to popular tourist attractions, and that's available during holiday or popular vacation periods. How much you can charge for your accommodations will also depend heavily on local competition. Before investing too much time and effort in becoming a host and listing your property, do research to ensure you'll be able to earn enough income to make your efforts financially worthwhile.Buy now: Entrepreneur Bookstore | Amazon | Barnes & NobleMeanwhile, if you plan to offer experiences as an ""Experience Host,"" want to earn the title ""Superhost,"" or hope to offer an Airbnb Luxe property or one that caters to business travelers, there are additional guidelines from Airbnb you'll need to abide by. Be sure to familiarize yourself with these requirements in advance.After considering each of the factors discussed thus far — if you still believe you have what it takes to be a successful Airbnb host, and you have a guestroom, apartment, home, or an unusual place for guests to stay, then you may have stumbled upon an opportunity that will allow you to earn extra revenue. Being a travel host will also allow you to meet new people and better utilize your property in a way that offsets your property-related costs/expenses—and maybe even generate a profit.

79,'You Have to Get Knocked Around a Little:' How This Entrepreneur Discovered the Value of Humility.,"Oct 30, 2023",Jeff Fenster,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/lessons-in-humility-and-resilience-rebuilding-from/464192,"
In a candid interview on the Jeff Fenster Show, entrepreneur and real estate investor Kent Clothier shares his remarkable journey from making millions to facing financial ruin within two years.His story is a powerful reminder of the importance of humility, resilience, and the willingness to learn from our mistakes. 



Humility trumps prideClothier attributes his downfall to his pride and a lack of appreciation for what he didn't know. He admits that he was too foolish to admit defeat and pursued litigation instead — a path that rarely leads to favorable outcomes. Reflecting on his experience, Kent says getting ""knocked around"" is necessary to achieve success.One of the critical lessons Kent learned from his ordeal was the significance of humility, acknowledging that success often requires being humbled and learning from our failures.


The power of 'reverse wholesaling'Despite the setbacks, Clothier managed to rebuild his business from scratch using a concept called reverse wholesaling. He emphasizes the need to turn hustle into a well-structured business by developing systems and processes. This approach allows entrepreneurs to scale their operations and achieve sustainable success.In the interview, Clothier shares valuable insights that can inspire and guide aspiring entrepreneurs. Here are a few quotes that encapsulate his wisdom:""You have to get knocked around a little bit to appreciate what it takes to be successful.""""The word 'can't' is not in my vocabulary. I'm resourceful, and I'll find a way to make it happen.""""Litigation is rarely the route to go. It's not about winning or losing — it's about finding a solution.""Valuing valuesClothier also highlights the importance of core values in personal and professional life. His family's core values revolve around four fundamental questions: why they do what they do, what they stand for, what they believe in passionately, and what they would be willing to die for. These values serve as a guiding compass for their actions and decisions.Clothier's journey from financial ruin to rebuilding his business is a powerful reminder of the importance of humility, resilience, and the willingness to learn from our mistakes. His story teaches us that success often requires getting knocked down and being resourceful in facing adversity. By embracing humility, developing systems, and focusing on opportunities, entrepreneurs can overcome challenges and achieve their goals.

Brian Phoenix told Insider he's been DJing at weddings for over 40 years.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. A 71-year-old DJ became a viral sensation on TikTok when he was filmed using his CD collection to play at a wedding, but he said he doesn't understand why people on the app took a liking to him.""Went to a wedding and they had the cutest old DJ who used his CD collection for all the music,"" read a caption on a TikTok video posted on October 10 by a creator named Miranda Dolph.



The clip showcased Brian Phoenix, who lives in Saco, Maine, and who has been DJing at weddings for over 40 years, handling his CDs in the corner of the venue. He told Insider that he always uses his collection of CDs and his laptop to play music at events.Dolph, 37, told Insider via Instagram DM that she filmed the clip of Phoenix while she was on the dancefloor at a friend's wedding.

It was awesome. I'm old enough to appreciate CDs and you don't often see someone still DJing weddings with them,"" she said.The video of Phoenix went viral, receiving 6 million views, and Phoenix told Insider he first watched the clip after a friend sent it to him but had no idea why it was so popular.""It's like 10 seconds of me standing there, which I don't understand what the big deal is,"" he said, describing his reaction to the post.


""It's what I've done for the last 40 years at weddings. It was another wedding and I did my usual 'best I can do, give them everything I got,' wedding,"" he said. @mirandameganne Replying to @Finn's dog mom ask and you shall recieve ? #dj #wedding #djs #cute #weddingtiktok #weddingtok #music #dance #musictok #innocent #cd #repsonse #weekendvibes #monday #protectthisman #dancefloor #djremix #nostalgia #mondaypost #hereyougo ♬ original sound - Miranda DolphIn a version of the clip posted by Dolph which uses the original audio, Phoenix played ""Levitating"" by Dua Lipa ft. Da Baby, which was released in 2020.


Phoenix told Insider that he personally prefers music from the 1950s and 60s, but at weddings he makes an effort to play songs that will appeal to the different age groups, saying he often plays contemporary and hip-hop music for younger people. He said he has often thought people watching him in action look at him and think to themselves, ""How does this guy know this music?""The 71-year-old credited his decades of experience as a DJ at weddings and on the radio, as well as around 18 years of prior experience DJing at a nightclub, for enabling him to become knowledgeable about what music people like.Though Phoenix told Insider he feels he ""didn't do anything that spectacular"" in the clip, commenters appeared to find the video heartwarming, and a number of users suggested they would like to have Phoenix DJ at their own events.""Please post his business details, tik Tok wants to hire him for our next events!"" read one top comment with over 34,000 likes.


Dolph went on to post another clip of Phoenix on TikTok, an excerpt of a video of the 71-year-old talking about his passion for DJing originally posted on YouTube by The Music Man DJ Service, which represents Pheonix. The company's owner Jason Strycharz told Insider via email that they have already received inquiries about Pheonix's availability off the back of his viral moment.Dolph told Insider, ""I think seeing someone just being themselves and following their passion, no matter their age, is what people enjoyed so much about the video."" @mirandameganne Replying to @Cynthia May the video you've all been waiting for ☺️ #dj #wedding #djs #cute #weddingtiktok #weddingtok #fy #music #dance #musictok #wholesome #cd #repsonse #weekendvibes #djremix #protectthisman #dancefloor #nostalgia #mondaypost #hereyougo #maine ♬ beauty of pixar - nilsodinsonOne commenter under Dolph's first video about Phoenix said they felt ""sad to see our elderly working,"" receiving 2,196 likes, but Phoenix told Insider he doesn't want to retire. He said that he spends 52 hours a week on average DJing, doing radio work from Monday to Friday, and playing weddings at the weekends.""I want to be out there. I want to be a part of it. I can do it, I'm good at it,"" he said.A number of other comments referred to Phoenix as ""elderly"" or ""old,"" but he said he wasn't insulted by it, rather he felt proud, he said. ""I'm still sharp, I'm on my game and I'm 71 years old. That's quite an accomplishment,"" he told Insider.

82,The Opportunities We Unlock As Solopreneurs,"Oct 12, 2023",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/the-opportunities-we-unlock-as-solopreneurs/463583,"
When Angela Shen sold her food tour business, Savor Seattle, it wasn't an easy decision—and it involved many tears. After pivoting her business to curated food boxes during the pandemic, Angela wasn't feeling challenged professionally or personally, so she decided it was time to move on.But the entrepreneurial drive that made her succeed with Savor Seattle never faded. After trying a corporate job and taking time off to travel, she decided to start something new: Savor the Wild Tours. Her new business offers novel food experiences in Washington's local wilderness, such as mushroom foraging and oyster shucking.""You should be a lifetime learner. If you've stopped or you feel like, 'I know enough, I'm a pro at this already,' that's no fun,"" Angela said. ""I'm having way more fun today than I have had in years.""



At Savor Seattle, Angela had a team of 30 to 35 team members creating and running food tours with her. With her new business, she's a solo entrepreneur and does all the work herself: finding locations, creating itineraries, and leading tours.When creating a new business, Angela also adopted a new mindset—less focus on success in terms of profits and more on providing quality experiences.


""It won't be 30,000 [customers] a year like we did before, maybe a couple hundred, maybe even a thousand,"" Angela said. ""That personal touch and that impact that we have is so much deeper, and it makes me happy. That is a marker of success that never was part of the equation before.""After owning and working on Savor Seattle for 17 years, Angela felt her identity was intertwined with the identity of the business. With Savor the Wild, she tries to compartmentalize work from her personal life to avoid stress and burnout. As a one-person operation, she's able to run the tours on her own schedule, allowing her to spend more quality time with her family and work on other business ventures, such as business consulting.""I was lucky as an entrepreneur to have started a successful business early in my career, so I have this privilege now of not having all of that pressure on me to say my success in life is defined by this one business,"" Angela said. ""I feel really proud of that, and my kids got to see that, and I think now it's about showing them and myself that I'm capable of more.""In addition to Savor the Wild having a similar namesake, Angela maintains Savor Seattle's values of diversity and inclusion in her new ventures. She makes sure every customer feels welcome at each experience, no matter what they look like or where they come from.


""I don't really look like your average mushroom forager. Most people I encounter in the woods look very different,"" Angela said. ""As someone who is of minority background and had to deal with adversity to get to where I'm today, and will continue to deal with it, I want to make it easier for others to come into this space and to do so in a way that feels safe and welcoming.""When debating big business decisions, other business owners can learn from Angela's journey, including the following tips:Stay true to your values. While Savor the Wild offers different experiences from Savor Seattle, both businesses foster a spirit of adventure and inclusion, representing the business owner's values.Form valuable partnerships. Throughout her journey, Angela found trustworthy business partners that helped her think through tough business decisions and even connected her with the company that bought Savor Seattle.Listen to your gut. When debating the sale of Savor Seattle, Angela listened to her hunch, leading her to a fulfilling decision that opened doors to new opportunities.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Angela, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.

When you have a hobby, nothing makes you happier than sharing it with others. Watching someone stand up on their surfboard for the first time, throw a clay pot on the wheel, or crunch into a warm baguette you baked together — it's the thrill of vicarious enjoyment. Now imagine getting paid $250 an hour to share that hobby from the comfort of your own home. Sound too good to be true? Well, Bill Reichman figured out how to do it.Reichman lives in a suburb of Chicago, and before he retired, he was the vice president of a transportation company. (""Think UPS only without the brown trucks."") But now, he has more time than ever for his true passion, and his method for monetizing it is available to people with all kinds of pastimes.

84,I Turned My Passion Into a Nonprofit Side Hustle — Here Are 3 Insights I've Learned in the Process.,"Oct 10, 2023",Jan Swartz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-insights-ive-learned-from-turning-my-passion-into-a/459300,"
About five years ago, I found myself back at Harvard with some of my fellow MBA grads, engaging in discussions with a very different lens than my 24-year-old self would have had.The exercise was part of a program a fellow grad and I co-created, in partnership with the university, to bring together alumni seeking to have greater impact and purpose in the second half of their careers.Research shows 70% of employees say their personal sense of purpose is defined by their work — with Gen Xers holding 61% of leadership roles globally, many seasoned leaders are contemplating how to find deeper meaning within the framework of longer careers and lifespans.



While I can attest that purpose can be found in a corporate job, there are also ways to expand your impact outside of work, such as starting a nonprofit or supporting a social venture. Here are three insights I've gained from starting a nonprofit side hustle in the second half of my career.Related: 5 Compelling Reasons Why Every Entrepreneur Should Consider Starting a Nonprofit Organization


1. Focus on what most speaks to your heartBack on campus, I was struck by something Thomas DeLong, a renowned Harvard professor, said to our group: ""If you don't know what to do with the back half of your life, run towards the thing that most breaks your heart.""As fulfilling as our corporate ventures can be, they won't always solve the societal problems we feel compelled to fix after life has kicked us around a little. If you're thinking of starting or joining a purpose-led venture, the first step is to identify the cause that most speaks to your heart — for me that was youth mental health.Getting clear on what fulfills you personally also helps align you professionally with the people who share your passion and drive. Shortly after heeding DeLong's advice, a fellow grad and I co-founded The Goodness Web together with our spouses. The nonprofit focuses on activating leaders to invest in solutions for youth mental health.Having senior leaders with varying backgrounds aligned on supporting youth mental health has been a powerful combination that has also brought perspective to my corporate career. The more senior you become at an organization, the more distant you often are from the front lines of action. From editing newsletters to putting together PowerPoint presentations, joining a social venture can be a humble reminder of how much work it takes to complete tasks when you're not in a position to outsource them.


Considering a staggering 79% of employees report quitting due to inadequate appreciation from their managers, this perspective shift can benefit both your career and your social venture.Related: Purpose-Driven Companies Grow 3 Times Faster — So Here's How to Become One Without Sacrificing Profit.2. Leverage strengths from your 'second curve'We often hear about Gen Z and millennials starting values-based ventures, but in many ways, older generations are uniquely positioned to have a social impact. In his book, Strength to Strength: Finding Success, Happiness and Deep Purpose in the Second Half of Life, Arthur Brooks talks about how the technical skills and functional knowledge we develop to create success in the first half of our careers, change as leaders approach the ""second curve.""While research has shown some skill sets decline as we age, aptitudes such as wisdom, teaching and sharing ideas tend to increase. Leaders wanting to start a social venture in the second half of their careers, should look to leverage these evolved strengths, along with the networks they've established over time.The experience I've gained over decades of working in a multi-billion-dollar corporation, for instance, has allowed me the vantage point to see where our nonprofit can strategically invest, scale systems and change initiatives across the youth mental health landscape.


Likewise, the vast network my co-founders and I have built over the years proved critical in establishing our first 100 founding families. The collective power of that network allowed us to grant $6.1 million to youth mental health organizations in our launch year alone. By leveraging our robust life experiences, we can often offer a unique lens into the best way to solve problems, which can accelerate progress at scale.Related: When It Makes Sense to Turn a Passion Project Into a Nonprofit3. Be open to expanding your connectionsIt's not uncommon for our worlds to get smaller as we age — mobility and travel can become restricted, as can our ability to participate in our communities. A meta-analysis of 277 studies on age-related social changes found friendship networks expand during adolescence and shrink during later adulthood.When you're looking to create social impact later in life, however, it's important to be open to expanding your connections. Reaching out to others who are passionate about your cause is not only the best way to raise necessary funds, but it's foundational for building a sense of community and a shared vision for your organization.


It can also be helpful to connect with other startup founders and organizations. One of the first things I did when I co-founded my nonprofit was join YPO, a global leadership community, made up of entrepreneurial thinkers who are inspired to make a difference.

85,From Side Hustle to Full-Time Success — 6 Ways to Turn Niche Interests into Profitable Ventures,"Oct 5, 2023",Bidhan Baruah,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/from-side-hustle-to-full-time-6-ways-to-turn-a-niche-into/462299,"
A few years ago, my friend Sabah turned her passion for cooking into a chef-on-demand business. She started off serving her local Cleveland area, quickly growing to cover other major Ohio cities and plans to expand even further. She is just one of the many people I know who have turned their passion project into a successful business.We all have our passion projects. We do them because they're fun, or we like the challenge, or they're our way of doing some good in the world. From time to time, though, our niche interests and hobbies lead us to marketable ideas. For many, that's as far as it goes; they don't know how to take the next step.Sabah had a shortcut — she's married to my friend and business partner, who knew not only the next step to take but all the steps after that. If you're not lucky enough to have a spouse or friend who can help, here's how to turn your passion project into a successful business.



Related: Ten Tips To Turn Your Passion Project Into A Business1. Run it by friendsWhen we have that eureka moment, it sometimes blinds us to flaws in our logic. Get a quick check. Run your idea by a few trusted friends. They may be able to point out roadblocks you didn't think of. Or they may know a way to help bring your idea to life.


2. Analyze the marketChances are, others have had your idea. Sabah wasn't the first to think of a chef-on-demand service, but when she analyzed the market, she realized her idea could still work. Market analysis requires thoroughly researching consumer trends and expectations, market size and the demand for your offering.To truly excel, you must conduct a thorough analysis of your rivals. While they may offer a comparable product, you must surpass them. By pinpointing what they lack, you can capitalize on it. Keep in mind their customer feedback is crucial in identifying gaps.When you look hard at similar businesses, you might find opportunities to fill the gaps they're leaving.3. NetworkNetworking with others who have launched their business or product can be invaluable. They're ahead of you on the journey and can help you avoid costly missteps.


If you're lucky, you may find someone with similar experience and a willingness to mentor you. A good mentor can help you find the path forward when you hit a roadblock.Keep the lines of communication open with your network and your mentor. They know the twists and turns and can save you a lot of headaches and expenses.4. Build an MVPIn the software development world, a minimum viable product (MVP) is a way to test your idea with a small group of early adopters. It's essentially an early product version with just a few core features.For Sabah, the MVP was a limited menu with a select set of chefs — and she was one of them. Once she proved her idea would work, she hired more chefs and added more meals to the menu based on the feedback she got from her customers.


The early and genuine feedback is the goal of an MVP. The lessons you learn fuel product improvements at the beginning of the development cycle when it's easier and less expensive to make changes.It also gives you evidence that either supports or exposes the flaws in your assumptions about the idea.Related: 5 Tips for Solidifying MVP, and Why It's the Most Important Aspect of Building a Startup5. Get helpSabah didn't build her business alone. She knew she needed help to build the web applications her fledgling company needed and outsourced that work. Trying to do everything leads to stress, burnout and costly mistakes. It also takes you longer to get to market, allowing competitors to beat you to the finish line.


Don't try to go it alone. Engage freelance help or outsource product development to a team with the knowledge and bandwidth to quickly build a high-quality product.Knowing when to get help involves recognizing your strengths and weaknesses. Maybe you can build the product but need help with market analysis. Or building a brand identity and marketing the product.Outsourcing some of the work also frees you up to focus on what you're good at and can take a lot of stress off your shoulders.Related: Asking For Help Is Good For You and Your Business


6. Keep your finger on the pulseMarkets and trends can shift rapidly. Ensure you're monitoring customer needs and what your competitors are doing. Otherwise, your product may be outdated by the time you get launched.It's been a joy to watch the growth of my friend's business. She's met challenges with grace and never let setbacks slow her down. And that, too, is key to turning your passion project into a successful business: believing in your vision enough to stick with it, no matter what.

86,"How This Seller Makes $12,000 a Month of Passive Income on Etsy","Oct 4, 2023",Pat Flynn,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-this-seller-makes-12000-a-month-of-passive-income-on/463095,"
When Christina Umerez first began drawing pet portraits, she had no idea it would replace her day job and give her the freedom to work just six hours a week. But that's precisely what happened. Christina opened up a profitable Etsy shop through hard work and effective strategy, using a combo of print-on-demand, audience targeting, and specific market research.



Today, Christina's shop generates passive income, requiring her to work only a few hours weekly for business maintenance and fresh designs.She recently chatted with Pat Flynn on the Smart Passive Income podcast to share how she made it possible. A pet passion projectUmerez had extra time on her hands when quarantine began, so she started researching side hustles to generate additional income while exploring a new creative outlet. This led to painting pet portraits for her friends. Eventually, the response was so positive that Umerez began selling custom prints on Etsy, the online shop for creative artists.During the holiday season, Umerez had so many orders that she was overwhelmed and struggled to meet the escalating demand. She knew if she wanted to keep her new business afloat, she needed to pivot.The print-on-demand solutionUmerez did her research and discovered print-on-demand, the process of outsourcing the printing and shipping of products through an external supplier.


She started implementing this system with her Etsy shop, allowing customers to print custom pet portraits on different products. Umerez immediately saw an increase in profits but still received more orders than she could fulfill. Then, she had an idea that changed everything.Umerez eliminated the customization and started premaking generic designs (outside of pet portraits) for her customers. She would then send them to her supplier to have them printed and shipped for her, significantly reducing her workload while she continued to generate revenue.""I remember just sitting there, and I was like, wait, I don't have to do anything,"" she says. ""I got an order, and there's just nothing I have to do. You just have to pay your supplier, but there's no work.""Leaving her day jobBy switching to print-on-demand and identifying her niche audience, Umerez watched her revenue rise from a consistent $300 to an impressive $12,000 per month. She decided to leave her day job, embracing the freedom and potential her pet portrait shop made possible.


Mastering EtsyHere's what Umerez learned about building her business on Etsy.1. Find your niche. Umerez's Etsy sales skyrocketed once she discovered her niche market with limited competition and a dedicated, passionate following. She initially tried marketing to ten to 20 different audiences to find the perfect fit. Once Christina pinpointed where she'd have the most success, she expanded into various sub-niches. This led to customers purchasing multiple related products, further increasing her revenue.2. Pick the right supplier. The first step in establishing a print-on-demand business is finding a supplier to print and ship the products. Several different suppliers are available, including Printful, Teespring, and Apliiq. To ensure the smooth operation of her business, Umerez utilizes Printify as her print-on-demand supplier.To streamline the process, Printify is linked directly to her Etsy store. When an order is placed, they handle creating and shipping the product. Umerez only has to step in when a customer complaint arises. Even then, Printify promptly issues a reprint or a refund so that Christina is not left financially responsible for any complications.


3. Stay ahead of the curve. To get inspired, Umerez spends time researching other best sellers on Etsy. She looks into what makes a good design, including exploring different fonts and colors that she can apply to her designs. She even utilizes ChatGPT to generate engaging content and witty sayings that she can incorporate into her designs.Umerez also notes the importance of standing out by curating a high-quality listing: an enticing photo and a compelling and relevant title.""What do you think someone is going to type in the search bar? And that if your product came up first, they would be like, yes, this is exactly what I was looking for,"" she says.4. Utilize Etsy-specific analytics and pricing strategies. Umerez optimizes her business through data analysis and strategic pricing. Her recommended approach is to include the cost of shipping in pricing—that way, potential customers aren't discouraged by unexpected expenses.


Umerez also takes advantage of Etsy's advertising to determine the performance of new designs. Analyzing the featured picture, product type, and design of a successful listing can provide valuable insights.Financial freedomGenerating nearly $100,000 in profit in 2022, Umerez's store is now almost entirely passive, only requiring about one hour daily to manage the business and create fresh designs.Her journey from a pet portrait side hustle to a thriving Etsy shop has given her the financial freedom and flexibility to pursue her passion for travel and other life goals. Her current focus is guiding others to replicate her success and achieve financial freedom.

87,"I Resell Tickets Online and Make Up to $32,000 in Profit a Month. Here's How I Do It.","Oct 3, 2023",Sasha Weilbaker,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/how-a-ticket-reselling-side-hustle-brings-in-30k-a-month/463078,"
This article originally appeared in Business Insider. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Shiraz Mawani, an accounting manager, ticket reseller, and YouTuber in Toronto. Insider has verified his earnings with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.I fell into ticket reselling in 2014. My friends and I used to go to an NHL playoff game every year. That year, the ticket prices were too high, so we decided to buy extra tickets, sell them for a higher price than we paid, and use the profits from the tickets to attend the game for a lower price.



I sold a couple of the tickets through Craigslist and Kijiji, a Canadian selling platform, and then decided to try to sell two tickets through StubHub — my first time using the platform. I didn't know much about it, and at the time, I didn't imagine that anyone would buy tickets online without any idea who the seller was.After posting the tickets, I was sitting at a restaurant with some friends, and I got an email saying that someone had bought them. We used the profits from reselling tickets to pay half the cost of the normal-price tickets, and my friends and I got to go to the game.


Nine years later, I still resell tickets in addition to my full-time job as an accounting manager. I make up to $32,000 a month in profit. Here's how I do it.First, I expanded into concertsA few months after the NHL playoff game, one of my friends told me that Bruno Mars and Katy Perry were coming to Toronto. They wanted to try to sell tickets the same way that we had for the NHL game — except this time, we weren't interested in attending the event ourselves.We continued reselling tickets to local events. After a while, my friend lost interest, but I continued to run with it. I was constantly looking for tickets going on sale in Toronto, and eventually the US.Now 65% of the tickets that I resell are to sporting events, while 35% are events including concerts, Broadway shows, and comedy events. That's just a personal preference because I'm not a big music person. Sports are what I know and where my focus is.


There are 2 sides to ticket resellingThere are people looking to sell a few tickets, and then there are ticket brokers looking to make a profit.Depending on which type of seller you are, there are different tools you have access to on each platform. The average seller sees only one side of the platform. Ticket brokers, though, have access to tools that identify which tickets are going on sale, a different rate structure, and a different suite of software.As a ticket broker, I use a point-of-sale system that uses an application programming interface to allow me to list tickets on multiple platforms at once. I'll list my inventory on my POS system, which I access for free, and it'll put the tickets on selling platforms such as StubHub using the API.My favorite selling platform is TickPick because I find that it has the best pricing for purchasing, and its customer service is excellent.


If there are tickets that expire or go unsold before events, I'll drop the prices, but there's always a limit to how low I'll go before I simply let the tickets sit.Pricing depends on each sellerI know many sellers who try to price their tickets for as cheap as possible. I wouldn't say that that's the wrong strategy, but it's not how I do ticket pricing.If there's a high search volume for an event or an artist with a strong social following, or they're going to a major city or specific venue, I may price the tickets more aggressively.While every ticket is priced differently, my general goal is to earn between a 30% and 40% profit margin. With my type of inventory, I'm normally closer to 30% after my sell-through fees are taken into account.


For sales that take place on online marketplaces, there's no price negotiationWhen I have individual buyers approach me, I'll try to offer them a fair price below the market value and may allow for small negotiations, but I generally keep firm on pricing.In May, I sold 850 tickets for just under $121,000 in sales, which equaled about $32,000 in profit, but this number ranges from month to month depending on the season. This year has been very positive for me, and I'm running about a $30,000-a-month profit on average.I started a YouTube channel in 2018My first YouTube videos were vlogs of me delivering tickets to will call locations in different cities so buyers could pick them up.Once I returned from these trips, I felt like I had a bit of knowledge that I could share with other people looking to resell tickets, so I started creating content about helping the average fan sell their tickets.


Mostly, people ask me what to do with their tickets if an event has been canceled, about timing for reselling tickets, and whether they can trust specific platforms.I spend between 20 and 40 hours a week working on my resale business, so it could be a full-time gig if I wanted it to be, but at this point, I consider ticket resale and my YouTube channel to be side hustles.

88,Is the 9-5 Lifestyle Over? How the Gig Economy Will Impact the Future of Work,"Sep 21, 2023",Kartik Jobanputra,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-the-gig-economy-will-impact-the-future-of-work/458482,"
In recent years, the global workforce landscape has undergone a significant transformation with the rise of the gig economy. Characterized by short-term contracts, freelance work and independent projects, the gig economy has redefined how people work, earn and engage with employment.In this article, we will delve into the multifaceted world of the gig economy, analyzing its advantages and drawbacks, assessing its impact on traditional employment paradigms and addressing the complex regulatory challenges it presents.Related: Investors Are Overlooking the Gig Economy. Here's How to Unlock Its Untapped Value.



Pros and consThe gig economy offers a range of advantages that resonate with both workers and employers. For workers, it provides flexibility and autonomy, allowing individuals to choose when, where and how they work. This appeals to those seeking a better work-life balance or juggling multiple commitments. Additionally, it enables individuals to diversify their skills, explore different industries and develop a varied portfolio of work experiences.The flexibility of gig work is particularly appealing in today's fast-paced world. It allows individuals to adapt their work schedules to their personal lives, making it easier to meet family obligations, pursue education, or engage in side projects. This adaptability enhances overall job satisfaction and contributes to a healthier work-life balance, which is often elusive in traditional full-time positions.


Moreover, the gig economy opens up opportunities for those who may have struggled to find traditional employment due to various barriers, such as geographical constraints or health issues. It's a lifeline for many who might otherwise be unemployed or underemployed.On the flip side, the gig economy presents its fair share of challenges. One of the prominent drawbacks is the lack of job security and employee benefits that traditional full-time jobs offer. Gig workers often lack access to health insurance, retirement plans and other essential perks. Moreover, the inconsistent nature of gig work can lead to income volatility, making financial planning and stability a constant concern. Without a steady income, essential expenses such as rent, groceries and healthcare become more precarious.Related: How the Rise of the Gig Economy Influences the WorkforceImpact on traditional employment modelsThe surge of the gig economy has disrupted the conventional employer-employee relationship. Traditional employment models are rooted in long-term commitments, while the gig economy thrives on short-term, project-based engagements. This shift has prompted companies to rethink hiring strategies and tap into the gig talent pool for specialized tasks. Businesses benefit from the ability to quickly scale up or down based on demand, fostering agility in a dynamic marketplace.


The gig economy has given rise to a new era of on-demand work. Companies can access a diverse and global talent pool with various skills and expertise. This allows for cost-effective solutions and enables businesses to remain competitive in an ever-changing market.Conversely, this transition has led to debates about job quality and the erosion of employee rights. Critics argue that gig workers are often treated as disposable resources, stripped of the protection and stability of formal employment. Balancing the benefits of flexibility with fair treatment and adequate compensation is an ongoing challenge that businesses and policymakers must address.Related: Gig Workers Are Marking the Homes of 'Tip-Baiters' on Google Maps. Find Out If Yours Is on Their List.Potential regulatory challengesThe gig economy's rapid growth has outpaced the development of comprehensive regulatory frameworks. One of the most pressing issues is classification: determining whether gig workers should be considered employees or independent contractors. This distinction carries legal and financial implications, influencing workers' entitlements to benefits and rights.


Regulation in the gig economy is a complex and evolving issue. Determining the employment status of gig workers is crucial because it dictates their access to benefits and protections. Some jurisdictions have implemented hybrid classifications that attempt to grant certain benefits to gig workers while maintaining their independent status. However, creating a universally acceptable model remains a complex endeavor.Moreover, as the gig economy spans international borders, issues related to taxation, social security contributions and cross-border labor rights have emerged. Policymakers are grappling with the challenge of harmonizing regulations across jurisdictions to ensure fair treatment and protect workers' rights without stifling innovation.Related: Is the Gig Economy Killing the 9-to-5 Job? No, But It's Giving It a Run for Its Money.The balancing act of the future work landscapeThe future of the gig economy lies in striking a balance between its advantages and the need for safeguards. Embracing technology and digital platforms can facilitate transparent communication, efficient matchmaking between workers and employers and even access to benefits. Innovative solutions, such as portable benefits that workers can carry across jobs, hold the potential to address the benefits gap.


Technology has the power to transform the gig economy for the better. Platforms that connect gig workers with job opportunities can also be used to provide training, access to affordable healthcare and retirement planning tools. This ensures that gig workers can access some of the benefits and security traditionally associated with full-time employment.As companies continue to rely on gig workers, they face pressure to develop ethical and responsible practices. Prioritizing fair wages, access to benefits and avenues for professional growth can mitigate some of the negative impacts associated with the gig economy.Fair compensation is a key aspect of ethical gig employment. Gig workers often grapple with low wages, unpredictable income and the absence of benefits. Companies that prioritize fair pay and transparent compensation structures can significantly improve the livelihoods of gig workers.ConclusionThe gig economy has reshaped the world of work and offered newfound flexibility and opportunities while challenging traditional norms. As its influence grows, it is crucial for stakeholders, including governments, businesses and workers, to collaborate in crafting balanced regulations that safeguard the rights and well-being of gig workers while fostering innovation and adaptability. By addressing regulatory challenges and committing to responsible practices, we can shape a future where the gig economy is a force for positive change in the modern workforce.

Say you're retired, living in a ""little tiny"" agricultural town with a population of 800 people, caring full-time for your spouse who recently suffered debilitating strokes — and you'd like to make $80,000 more dollars a year. As it happens, that would make you a lot like Patricia Farris, who is running a surprisingly lucrative side hustle out of her home in Fort Jones, California.But the point here — and the one that Farris made to me — is that if she can pull off a remote business like this, with the limitations of her circumstances, ""people with more time, in urban areas who could get part-time help, could do a lot more.""Farris is 67 now, and before retiring, she worked in the legal field. Her husband Barry, now 77, was a pharmaceutical rep who eventually went out on his own to invent products for pharmaceutical and medical companies. When he retired, he knew he wanted to make some extra income and put his passion for inventing to use, but he didn't want to deal with all the FDA approvals that go with medical trademark inventions.

91,'I Got Rid of My Desk': And 11 Other Weird Productivity Hacks That Are Oddly Effective.,"Sep 14, 2023",Nick Loper,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/11-productivity-hacks-that-are-weirdly-effective/458992,"
What are some quick, simple, and maybe a little weird productivity tricks entrepreneurs use to get more done?I'm always curious about that, so I asked my most productive and successful friends for the ""hacks"" and tools they use daily.You can find 27 fascinating and informative answers in the latest episode of the Side Hustle Show podcast.Below is a sampling of sage advice worth trying out today.Related: How to Start a 'Million Dollar' Morning Routine



Pat Flynn, Smart Passive IncomeOne of my favorite productivity hacks involves just a little note on my computer that says one single word: ""start."" An object at rest tends to stay at rest. And for me, I do a lot of things often that try to fill in that space before I know I'm supposed to do something. So, I often just procrastinate is really what I do. So, I just tell myself through this Post-it note on my computer, very simple, to just start.Favorite productivity tool: Habit Chair app, Do Not Disturb/Focus commandKate Erickson, Entrepreneurs on FireI get rid of my number one distraction right away in the morning before I start work. For me, that's a clean kitchen. I don't know what it is about dirty dishes in the sink, but if I leave them there, I know it will distract me all day. So, I do my dishes before I start work. Then, I remove all my distractions and any excuses I might have to not focus on the task at hand.Favorite productivity tool: Asana, Text Expander


Robert Farrington, The College InvestorThe first thing I do to start my day to give me motivation is I check my income from the day before. I do it before email or before I even go to my website. I tally up my earnings because that gives me the motivation to get through the grind of tasks that I actually have to do, whether it's my email or writing a blog post, or whatever it happens to be. But knowing that income I made gives me the motivation to continue to get through these tasks that can give me more income tomorrow.Favorite productivity tools: Asana, DripClaudia Pennington, SEO Audit GuideOne productivity tip that's worked for me has been to delete everything from my calendar so that I'm using my calendar for appointments only. Since I've stopped using my calendar as a to-do list, I'm actually getting more done in less time. I feel less stressed because I have fewer notifications popping up. Where do my tasks live now? In Trello. It's the one tool I can't live without. I have several boards set up for various projects. And within these boards, I use cards to track tasks for each project. I can easily add or remove tasks and change due dates within Trello as my priorities shift.Related: 10 Time Management Tips That Work


Madalyn Sklar, #TwitterSmarterI have an interesting productivity hack that I've been using for maybe 20 years now. Every day, you write out on a Post-it note, like the 3x3, Post-it with the lines on it. You write out your top six things that you need to get done. So basically, a to-do list of your top six things. And I have to say, it has worked really well. Here I am, like 20 years later, and I still do this every day.Favorite productivity tools: Evernote.Derek Doepker, Bestselling author of Content That SellsThree magic words, plus a micro commitment. The three magic words are: ""Can I just…"" and then you insert something that's so easy you're guaranteed to be able to do it, and it gets you into action. If I want to start writing and I'm procrastinating, I go, ""Can I just…"" open up the Word document and write two sentences, then I can quit. Once you get into it, you tend to want to keep going, and momentum generates motivation. Add a micro commitment such as, ""Can I just do two minutes of exercise, or can I just meditate for 30 seconds,"" whatever it is.Favorite productivity tool: Evernote


Mark Horozowski, MovingWorldsMan, call me old school, but my biggest productivity hack is definitely not anything hack-worthy at all. It involves getting up and getting a little bit of physical exercise, and at the end, taking some real intentional time to breathe. I would call it meditation, except I don't want to insult anybody. But taking some focused time to breathe, concentrate, and think ahead to what's going to happen during that day. And then taking a couple of notes on how I want to show up if it's big meetings or things that absolutely need to get done if it's crunch time, so nothing too fancy, Some good old body movement, some intention setting, and a pen and paper go a really long way to keep me on track.Matt Marr, Dear Mattie Show I'm a therapist, and I believe truly that your mental health helps your productive health. I live and work in a small apartment in Los Angeles. I just had so much crap everywhere, and I got rid of my desk. I know you're thinking this is the symbol of work. This is the mecca. But no, instead, I got rid of my desk, and I created this kind of inspirational, much less cluttered space where I sit, I think, I meditate, I journal, I plan my day. It's been such a better productive outcome for me than I ever imagined. Because it helps me organize my mind. So if you live in a small space, and you have a desk like me that was just honestly piling up your mail and keeping your iPhone chargers or their headphones or that little dongle thing that you keep losing from the iPhone, maybe it's time to get rid of your desk.Favorite productivity tools: BoomerangAmber Hurdle, host of Bombshell Business PodcastType the word ""Facebook"" in the search box of your emails and just search your inbox, not all of your email. This will quickly find most of the marketing emails that you're probably never going to get to read anyways, and put them all in the same page. Select all and then delete all. Most of these offers, newsletters, ads are going to say ""find us on Facebook,"" or have a Facebook link of some kind, so that is their inbox Deathwish.


John Corcoran, Smart Business RevolutionI started using a stand-up desk a couple of years ago, and now it makes me so much more efficient. If you're going to stand, you're going to work, you're not going to waste time fooling around on social media or whatever. Not to say that I'm perfect in that regard, but stand-up desks definitely makes you work more efficiently. And I also think that it makes me more alert when I'm working. I know if I need to work late into the evening and I sit down, I'm much more likely to fall asleep. You're not going to fall asleep standing up, that's for certain. So you can actually work a lot longer, which can be a good thing when you need to burn the midnight oil.Favorite productivity tool: Asana Nina Babel, Keep It 100 GirlOne must-have productivity tip for me is the 20/20/20 rule. Every 20 minutes, I walk 20 feet away for 20 seconds or more. And that's for two reasons. One to make sure that the blood is flowing in my legs. Secondly, to give my eyeballs a break.

      Key Takeaways    



        When acquaintances kept asking me to be a bridesmaid, I realized I had gotten good at the role.
      


        I decided to start a business as a bridesmaid-for-hire. My rates vary depending on a number of factors.
      


        I do everything a real friend would do, from helping them pick a wedding dress to making a toast. 
      



















Jen Glantz via Business Insider
The author as a bridesmaid.


This story originally appeared on Business Insider. When I was in my early 20s, most of my friends at the time were getting engaged. I quickly became familiar with serving a new role in their lives as a member of their bridal party. Being a bridesmaid has a rhythm to it — though every wedding is different, the role is mostly the same.I ordered my bridesmaid dress early, helped plan pre-wedding events, and took the bride out for monthly coffee and venting sessions. I also stayed sober so I could be the bride's go-to person for any pop-up problems.



Eventually, even people I had lost touch with started asking me to be a bridesmaid in their weddings. When I complained to my roommate about this, she nicknamed me a professional bridesmaid and told me it was likely people heard I was good at being a bridesmaid and wanted my expertise at their weddings, too.I decided to become a bridesmaid-for-hireI realized then that if distant friends needed me as their bridesmaid, perhaps strangers would as well. After all, I was reliable, helpful, and, above all, drama-free.


In June 2014, I posted an ad on Craigslist offering my services as a hired bridesmaid for strangers. Within 48 hours, I received hundreds of emails from people eager to hire me. I started the business Bridesmaid for Hire a few days after the ad was posted. Since then, I've been hired as a bridesmaid for people all over the world.The rate for my services depends on a few factors, including how many pre-wedding events they want me to attend, how many phone chats they want before the wedding, and how many hours they want me present on their wedding day. The price starts at about $2,700 for three phone calls and eight hours in person on the wedding day. The most I've been paid is $5,700 and that included more services, such as attending the bachelorette party and going wedding dress shopping with them.Being a hired bridesmaid for a stranger might seem sad or pathetic — it's anything but that. Not everyone has close friends. According to YouGov, only 55% of Americans have between two and five close friends. Even if it seems like someone has a lot of friends based on their social-media presence, it doesn't always mean they have a close group of friends who will show up for them when they really need something.So when people getting married start to think about who will be in their bridal party, it can feel overwhelming if there's nobody that comes to mind, or if your fiancé has more close friends than you do.


There are a few reasons people hire me to be their bridesmaidWhen people reach out to hire me, they usually write me a message that shares too much information about their life. What they're trying to tell me is that because of a variety of reasons, they don't have close friends right now to stand by their side.I often hear people say that they've grown apart from their good friends, have friends scattered all over the country, or find that their best friends are really busy and they don't want to bother them.In those instances, people are reaching out to me because they want a support system before and on the day of their wedding. Often, these are people who have felt lonely during other major events in their lives, and they've realized they don't want to feel that way on their wedding day.However, there are also people who reach out even though they do have other bridesmaids, they don't feel like they have enough support or the right kind of support. Sometimes my clients are people whose friends just aren't super reliable. If a bride feels like her friends aren't being helpful or creating too much drama, she might consider hiring me to step in and join the bridal party.


I have been hired by all kinds of people with different backgrounds and jobs. I've worked at a $500,000 wedding for a CEO of a company and I've worked at a $20,000 wedding for a retail employee.I'm often undercover and keep my job a complete secretMost of the time, when a client hires me they want it to be a secret. They often don't tell anyone that they paid me to be their bridesmaid. I usually have a fake name and backstory that helps me go undercover. I spend a few months learning about the person who hired me and really becoming that person's friend. The relationship we build is real. My goal isn't to be their fake friend for the day, it's to be an authentic support system. Because of this, I sometimes stay in touch with clients and have continued being friends with a few of them for years. But most of the time, I keep strict boundaries, and once the wedding ends, so does the communication and relationship with the client.I do everything for my clients that a real friend would do. I help them pick out their wedding dress, call them weekly to listen to challenges, plan a bachelorette party, and ensure they are stress-free on their wedding day. I wear a bridesmaid dress, walk down the aisle, and sometimes give a toast at the reception.It's not sad to hire a bridesmaid — it's braveGetting married can be overwhelming and stressful. For some people, having friends by their side can make a big difference in how they feel throughout their wedding adventure. If someone doesn't have close friends to turn to or doesn't have as many close friends as their fiancé, it's not weird to spend money and hire a professional who can step in and help with everything that's needed. People hire wedding planners to help with logistics all the time, and what I do isn't all that different; I emotionally support the people who will be front and center at these weddings.


The author. Courtesy of Jen GlantzFriendship isn't always so fluid. Sometimes you meet someone who stays in your life for a long time. Sometimes people you hoped would be there for you just disappear. But during your wedding time, everyone deserves to have a supportive friend by their side, even if it's someone they end up hiring.

94,"After Losing Work in the Writer's Strike, He Turned His 'Weird Niche Hobby' Into a Side Hustle That Brings in Hundreds of Dollars Per Sale","Sep 8, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/writers-strike-inspires-some-weird-side-hustles-in/458768,"
The strikes The Writer's Guild of America (WGA) commenced in May are still going — longer than some in the industry expected — and forcing actors and writers to find other ways to make ends meet.Many out-of-work Hollywood professionals are picking up side hustles to earn extra cash. Jesse McLaren, a writer for the late-night show Jimmy Kimmel Live! who transformed his snow globe hobby into an Etsy business, is one of them, NPR reported.Related: Hollywood Writers Just Announced They're on Strike | Entrepreneur



When the strike began, McLaren decided to monetize his talent for making custom snow globes: Now, he sells them on Etsy for $299 a pop, though he admitted to the outlet that business is ""shaky.""McLaren isn't alone in his side hustle ventures. Becky Portman, who was furloughed as a showrunner's assistant for the Peacock series Killing It, has been giving Hebrew lessons and substitute teaching; SAG-AFTRA member Michelle Allaire is running her diner in Culver City, per NPR.


Strikes aside, many creatives are used to supplementing their incomes. Even so, those who have pivoted to a side hustle, like McLaren, look forward to resuming their full-time gigs.""I want to make jokes again and I want snow globes to become just a weird niche hobby again instead of something I'm monetizing,"" McLaren told the outlet.Related: Hollywood Strikes: Insiders Brace for Industry 'Collapse' | EntrepreneurThe Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers are ""far from resolving the strike"" and still have to find a way into negotiation, Variety reported earlier this week.

      Key Takeaways    



        For some, the side hustle is another option born out of a necessity to earn extra cash. 
      


        For others, it is a hobby or creative venture that feeds their soul.
      












    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

""You are fired."" No one wants to hear those words, especially if your feeling of self-worth is tightly linked to your job. I was working in broadcasting for about a decade when I got fired. The television station eliminated my department and tried to make me quit to avoid paying unemployment. I would not, so they fired me. It was the best thing that ever happened.I always thought I would someday own a business. While working full-time, I freelanced as a video producer for many years. Today, you might call it a side hustle. I made good money and got comfortable with the extra cash. When I lost my full-time job, I looked at the options. Go back to work for someone else? Freelance? Side hustle? Open a business doing what I love?Related: 8 Easy Side Hustles in 2023



The optionsI knew I did not want to work for someone else. Like millions of others, I wanted more control over my life and work. When you freelance, you can control what work you take and what you turn down. However, it can also be lonely. You do not have a consistent team to rely on. You are a one-person operation doing everything.For some, the side hustle is another option born out of a necessity to earn extra cash. For others, it is a hobby or creative venture that feeds their soul. Generally, a side hustle is not a full-time endeavor, at least not immediately. I decided to stop freelancing or doing the side hustle and go for it. Thirty-five years later, my business is still thriving. I learned how to turn my passion into a credible and pretty cool business. If you decide to do the same, here are three things to consider.


Related: 5 Ways to Grow Your Side Hustle Into a Full-Time Income1. Can you go the distance?There are many examples of companies that grew quickly, took advantage of a trend to become household names and then failed to go the distance. Blockbuster. Kodak. Blackberry. Sears. We can learn from these case studies. No one has a crystal ball, so ask yourself some tough questions.Is your business idea something people want or need today? Will they still want it five years from now, ten years from now? Will you be able to introduce new or complimentary products and services? Or are you a ""one-hit wonder?"" To survive, you must be able to change course and adapt when the market changes.In my case, the need for media production by businesses has increased dramatically. What we create and how we create it has changed, but we have been able to adapt. It takes a huge effort to launch a business. Don't waste your effort creating a formal business if you cannot go far.


As a side note, some businesses are created to take advantage of a hot product or service. This short life-cycle business — think of pop-up stores — has a different objective.Related: I Built My Multimillion-Dollar Side-Hustle While Working a Full-Time Job and So Can You2. Can you build a team?When I first started my business, it was the epitome of ""lean."" A team of two. That is not unusual, but if you want to make an impact, you eventually need people. And not just any people. The right people.As a business leader, you must create the kind of place that reflects your vision — where the work gets done and people thrive. Culture is a huge buzzword. I like to keep it simple. I want people who value the same things that I do. Integrity. Honesty. Hard work. Fun. Creativity. Caring for each other, our customers and the work. You cannot build a team if you cannot articulate your vision. You cannot build a team if you are not action-oriented — do what you say you will do.


Building an external team of experts is also critical for turning a side hustle into a business. You need legal help, accountants and human resources. Business regulations are complicated and constantly changing. There is no way a smaller enterprise can do it alone. I have seen many try only to end up in court due to honest mistakes.You might have a great product or service, but it takes a team effort to make a business successful.Related: The 5 Pillars of Building a Culture of Success in a Startup3. Can you get the cash?Finding the money to launch your business can be daunting. It is ironic. You may not have the track record when you most need the money. When you do not need it, everyone wants to lend it to you. With freelancing or a side hustle, you can keep costs down. Work out of your home. Keep inventory low. As you start to buy equipment, hire people and market, the costs pile up quickly.


Would-be business owners often use credit cards to get started. They borrow from family and friends or use funding campaigns. When a family member wanted to buy a business and could not get a loan, my business loaned the money. I got it back, plus interest. However, that is not typical. The National Small Business Association (NSBA) recently reported that over one-third of small businesses (37%) cannot get adequate financing. That is the highest it has been since 2008.There are options. Remember that team of external advisors? Now is a good time to leverage their help. Advisors have relationships and can make introductions. Credit unions are an option, and there are alternative lending sources. You can go online, but be careful of predatory lenders and outrageous fees. The bottom line is that you need cash to launch and keep you going.Should you turn your side hustle into a business? That depends. There is freedom in doing your own thing and making great money. However, it is also rewarding to build a business. Be sure before you take the leap.

96,The 4 Best Side Hustles for Professionals Facing a Layoff,"Sep 2, 2023",Kanika Tolver,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-side-hustles-for-professionals-facing-a-layoff/450754,"
The job market, particularly in the tech sector, is volatile at the moment (to put it mildly), with many professionals worried about how they will make ends meet after being let go from high-paying positions and losing benefits. Worse yet, there's increasing uncertainty about the availability of new positions, in part because hiring processes have slowed down due to longer interview structures.But what if these professionals were able to start a business as a side hustle — to monetize what they already know from their old (or day) jobs? Many have doubtless long wanted to become entrepreneurs, and so this unpredictable time may also be the perfect one to creatively apply acquired education, experience and expertise.These options for doing just that can help professionals make extra income while enhancing their personal brands.



Become a paid speakerThere are thousands of fertile minds being paid regularly to speak at conferences, corporations and universities. But before beginning efforts in that direction, it's important to create two to three signature speaking topics that hit high points of your experience and what service you can provide, as well as semi-detailed descriptions for each. Once that's complete, a professional website needs to be made that includes a speaker media kit featuring video examples of presentations. (After the first few gigs, pad this video section with live audience clips.) Additionally — for both this field and those listed below — it might also be wise to create an LLC and get a business tax number, along with a logo.The speaking business is potentially very lucrative and offers the further advantage of exposure to new job opportunities.Related: 5 Keys to Building a Website That SellsConsider an adjunct professorshipThere are many industry executives affected by company layoffs who possess master's degrees, and so qualify as adjunct professors. Some teach remotely and/or just a few times a week. This can be a great way to give back to the next generation of professionals while getting paid to teach a subject that's aligned with professional expertise. Not to mention, being a professor is great for personal branding, with some landing consulting and other opportunities via the academic pipeline.Create paid contentDuring this digital era, selling content can be an at once enduring and lucrative way for professionals to make extra money by developing courses, books (including ebooks) and coaching programs. (Over the last three years, career-related paid content has done particularly well on platforms like Patreon, YouTube and TikTok.) Such material does best when properly branded, marketed and sold to the right audience, of course, so I recommend leveraging social media, email marketing lists and professional online communities to get the word out.Related: How To Start a YouTube Channel: Step-by-Step Guide


Seek a part-time remote jobPart-time remote jobs are amazing if you can land a good hourly rate. Many offer flex schedules in the evenings or on the weekends. Begin the search by harnessing websites like Indeed, LinkedIn and Glassdoor. Since companies are cutting back on full-time roles, this can be a great time to jump in, and there's always the chance that a part-time opportunity turns into full-time (if desired).

97,10 Proven Ways to Generate Passive Income in 2023,"Aug 30, 2023",Pat Flynn,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/10-passive-income-ideas-for-2023/458154,"
There are many ways to generate passive income and change your financial future. Whether you want to earn just an extra $1000 per month on the side or go into something full-time and replace your current salary, different passive income ideas require different work and time.Upfront work is required, so don't expect to get rich overnight, but with a plan in place and the right kind of motivation, you can see success much sooner than you think.1. Start an Online BusinessStarting an online business is the best way to generate revenue on autopilot.Why?You don't need a ton of cash upfront.You have a lot of room to make mistakes, andIt's one of the most fulfilling life adventures you could ever be on.I started my first online business in 2008 after being laid off from an architecture job I loved. My website helped architects pass a difficult exam, and people paid me for study material I created to help them prepare.



How much money did this business make?In one year, I generated over $200,000, more than double what I earned as an architect.2. Affiliate MarketingAffiliate marketing allows you to generate passive income simply by recommending existing products to other people. If you've ever recommended something to a friend, you know how to do affiliate marketing already.Affiliate marketing has been my most significant single source of revenue, bringing in over $4 million since 2009.So, how does affiliate marketing work, exactly?With affiliate marketing, you recommend other people or company's products and services to your following. You can talk about it on YouTube, a website, in an email, or even just with your social following. And, when someone purchases from your recommendation, you'll receive a commission from the sale.One of the most popular and accessible ways to get started is through the Amazon Affiliate Program. People already know and trust shopping from Amazon, and you'll have a massive range of products to select from.Just be sure only to choose products that you can stand behind, and that will serve your audience well, and be sure to always be upfront that a link you promote is an affiliate link.


To be successful with this, you'll need to put time into building an audience who trusts that you'll always steer them in the right direction and then follow through on that.Related: 12 Myths and Misconceptions of Affiliate Marketing3. Start a YouTube ChannelStarting a YouTube channel is an excellent option for making passive income online; it's free to get started, and if you create videos that people want to watch, you can generate revenue from ads, sponsorships, and even promoting your products.Recently, I started a new YouTube channel all about Pokemon cards called Deep Pocket Monster. In two years, this new channel has grown to over 500,000 subscribers, and it generates revenue from ads, sponsorships, and even affiliate marketing by promoting card shops and binders on my videos.


  4. Open a Paid Membership BusinessLike signing up for a gym membership, people join online memberships and pay recurring fees for the sense of community and value it brings them. In fact, we have a couple ourselves:Our SPI All-Access Pass is a community of up-and-coming entrepreneurs who get access to all of our courses, workshops, community events, and even guides to help them through the material.SPI PRO is our higher-level community of established business owners who want to network, connect, and share ideas with growth in mind. We require an application to get into this paid community.Both of our communities require a recurring payment (quarterly or annual), but people are happy to continue to pay that because they're getting more value in return.


With a membership business, you may need a platform to host your community. Circle is our top choice because it's easy to use and familiar to users who join. This is our affiliate link for Circle in case you'd like to check it out and give it a run!Related: 8 Best Podcasts for Entrepreneurs5. Make Print-on-Demand DesignsIf you have a keen eye for design and current trends and know how to use design software, selling print-on-demand designs could be a great option to create passive income.With print-on-demand, you don't have to buy any inventory ahead of time, so it's a low-risk business model.You'll work with a print provider, like Printful or Teespring, to sell merch (t-shirts, mugs, bags, etc.) customized with your designs and sold per order.When someone buys one of your designs, the print provider fulfills, prints, and ships the order on your behalf.The trickiest part is making unique, high-quality designs that inspire your people to purchase them.6. Offer Software as a Service (SaaS) BusinessAnother potentially lucrative option for passive income is to create an app or software that you can offer as a subscription service—also called software as a service (SaaS).


To do something like this requires coding knowledge or the funds to hire someone who knows how to code, but there are many resources available to find people who can do that kind of work for you, like Upwork.Remember that this is one of the more time-consuming options; it will take a good chunk of time to plan and get things up and running.Also, you will have to create and offer a truly valuable solution—and market your solution effectively—to make passive income with this, which isn't exactly easy.This is a challenging route., but it can be rewarding.Related: How to Successfully Launch a Product in Under 90 Days7. Create an Online CourseEveryone has a skill they can teach, so why not monetize yours AND help others by creating an online course?Making an online course isn't too difficult either, but it will take a lot of time and effort to ensure it's useful. We host our online courses on both Teachable and Circle, and it's an amazing way to package information into a place where people can experience a transformation or solve a problem.Once you've created the content and have everything set up, it can be an incredibly profitable source of passive income.There are several platforms, like Udemy or Skillshare, that you can choose from to host your course and facilitate getting your course paid viewers.However, I always recommend using your website to give you greater control and true ownership.8.

      Key Takeaways    



        Software salesperson Monisha Mirsa wanted to feed her friends who were essential workers during the pandemic so she made them cheese plates.
      


        When people started offering her money for her charcuterie arrangements she started a small business
      


        Three years later, BoardsbyMo has served thousands of charcuterie boards, catered hundreds of weddings/special events, and taught over 2,000 people the art of styling a board through workshops.

 Who would have ever thought that cheese boards could earn you $1 million?But that's exactly what happened to Monisha Mirsa, who grew her side hustle charcuterie board business, BoardsbyMo, to $1 million in revenue in just three years. Mirsa now runs the business full-time with a team of 7 employees.



She recently appeared on my podcast The Side Hustle Show, part of the Entrepreneur Podcast Network, to tell her extraordinary story.Photo courtesy of BoardsbyMo


Filling a need during the pandemicWhen the quarantine orders were put in place in Boston during the beginning of the pandemic, Mirsa started going a little ""stir crazy"" at home working for a software company.She had a lot of friends and family who were essential employees and healthcare workers. Seeing her friends working so hard gave her the idea to prepare some snack platters or home-cooked meals for them. Mirsa started dropping these off at hospitals around Boston for free.But some of the staff she gave platters to asking if they could buy some. That ""planted a little seed,"" Mirsa said. She didn't see this becoming a full-time job though, as she assumed she'd be going back to work in the near future.A month later a friend reached out and asked if Mirsa would make a cheeseboard for her mom for Mother's Day. She insisted on paying and also insisted that Mirsa start an Instagram account and think about turning this into a business. On May 5th, 2020, Mirs started her Instagram account, and on May 10th, she had her first order.


""It was never supposed to happen, I just kept thinking this is cool,"" Monisha said.Related: This Couple's Side Hustle Lets Them Stay for Free in High-End Homes Around the World, Making $20k a Month.Using InstagramAfter Mirsa started her Instagram account, she posted what she called, ""almost like a fake promotion"", which read:$40 date night board gets delivered to your doorstep, mix of cheese, charcuterie, fruit, nuts, jams, 2 days only, DM me to reserve yours now!She admits she had no idea what she was doing. Two hours later she had more than 20 DMs from complete strangers asking for one of these boards to be delivered.Mirsa said she was being found because she was tagging Boston food bloggers and using hashtags that promoted her boards. In that first year, she grew her account to around 20,000 followers.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Monisha Misra | BoardsbyMo (@boardsbymo) 


Building a WebsiteMirsa wanted her own platform where people could place orders and learn more about her business, so she built her site, BoardsByMo.com, on the eCommerce platform Shopify and integrated HubSpot so her orders flowed through.Starting workshopsMirsa also offered virtual charcuterie board-building workshops as corporate team-building exercises on Zoom. Given the inbound interest, Mirsa began teaching other aspiring charcuterie entrepreneurs how to start their own businesses.Related: How I Turned My Love for Travel Into a $50k a Month BusinessQuitting her 9 to 5 jobAfter consistently hitting her monthly revenue goals for 6 straight months, Mirsa gained the confidence to leave her stable 9-to-5 job and devote herself entirely to her passion.


You can hear my interview with her about that decision and what happened next here.Since making the jump and committing to BoardsbyMo, she has seen her Instagram following grow to around 120,000+ followers, 6 times what it was when she was working her office job.While quitting was nerve-wracking for Mirsa, she set a target revenue that made her comfortable stepping away from the reliability of a steady paycheck.""It was definitely one of the scariest things I think I've ever done,"" she said. But by focusing on her revenue goals and passion for charcuterie, she took the plunge into full-time entrepreneurship.


Tapping into B2B opportunitiesMirsa has since expanded her marketing to platforms like LinkedIn. With corporate catering now being a huge part of her business, she uses LinkedIn to target prospects planning large conferences, meetings, and events.She tries to keep it organic—posting about successes but also being open about challenges.Leveraging Email marketing strategiesMirsa's email newsletters highlight upcoming events like public workshops, special deals, and new product launches.She considers email marketing critical. ""I have a fear that one day all these social media platforms are just going to go away,"" she said. Email allows her to stay in touch with her audience.


To drive newsletter signups, Monisha positions BoardsbyMo as a thought leader in charcuterie—offering tips, tricks, and expertise. This provides more value beyond just promoting products.""It just shows people here's another local business that you can support and that you can frequent and purchase from later on,"" she said.The co-marketing workshops are free exposure events for both businesses involved. Mirsa and her partner coordinate marketing emails to promote the workshop and bring in new audiences.Diversifying revenue streamsIn terms of revenue streams, catering corporate events is now Mirsa's biggest moneymaker.""It's easier to book when people are spending company budgets rather than their own money,"" she said.Workshops are another major stream, including public collaborative workshops and private team-building events.Drawing on her software sales background, Mirsa created a small business strategy workshop that quickly gained popularity, even being used by Harvard Business School. She fills a gap by helping creative founders sell their passion projects.She offers charcuterie board workshops and classes through her business. The workshops are available as online courses on Teachable.


The main course is her sales and marketing strategy workshop, which costs $400 individually or $900 as part of a bundle with other courses. It includes pre-recorded videos and a downloadable workbook.The secret to her successAsked why her charcuterie business has stood out amongst the many similar cheese plate influencers that popped up in recent years, Mirsa believes the aesthetically pleasing nature of charcuterie boards gives her an automatic advantage on visual platforms like Instagram.But she says she started adding more behind-the-scenes, day-in-the-life type of content, showing the ""not sexy"" parts of running her business. She'll bring followers into the kitchen, cutting huge wheels of cheese for hours, with salami in her hair.This depicts ""a more organic and realistic depiction of what it's like to be a small business owner,"" she said.

Like many young couples, Austin Andrews and Jori Kerr wanted to travel but couldn't afford the sky-high expenses. Then Kerr stumbled upon a blog post touting the benefits of pet sitting.""I discovered we could stay in amazing homes around the world for free, caring for great animals,"" she recalls.They paid an annual fee (around $130/year) to join a service called Trusted House Sitters and waited for a response. After a few months, the couple from Bend, Oregon, got an invitation to go down to Grenada in the Caribbean for 14 days to care for a few pets.



The trip was magical, with endless sunsets, long walks on the beach, and free lodging.""That set our path. After that, we just knew that was what we wanted to do,"" says Andrews.


Two years later, the couple has made their love of travel and caring for animals a full-time job. Their company Nomads and Pawpads is a content marketing business that chronicles their adventures pet sitting in 11 countries in 5 different contents. In addition to staying in luxurious homes around the world for free, they earn up to $22,000 a month.Nomads and PawpadsRelated: These Dog Walkers Are Making $100,000 a YearStarting as a side hustleBefore launching Nomads and Pawpads, Andrews and Kerr were content just traveling the world taking care of pets as a side hustle.


Kerr worked at a brewery in customer service, and Andrews was a landscaper. They traveled during the winter when Andrews wasn't working, and Kerr could work remotely.Although their rent was free, they weren't getting paid to pet sit. Visa restrictions do not allow international house sitters to get paid for their work. House sitting is a free exchange. They occasionally received money to pet sit around the U.S., but international travel excited them. They needed to figure out a way to make it work.The solution: Write about their travels using affiliate marketing and social media collaborations to monetize. The couple uses their website, Instagram, and TikTok to market their pet-sitting lifestyle, offering advice, resources, and paid links to house exchange platforms such as Trusted House Sitters.Other popular pet-sitting sites include:HousesittersAmerica.comRover.comMindMyHouse.comAs content marketing revenue increased, they could quit their other jobs and take on full-time pet sitting. They now spend about 6 to 9 months out of the year abroad.


Some of their most memorable experiences include trips to the beaches of South Portugal and stays in Singapore and Hanoi.Most of the requests are easy—walk and feed the dog and/or cat, change the litter, give them fresh water, and light grooming. They're also asked to take out the garbage and collect the mail, simple requests that leave them plenty of free time to explore their location.But sometimes, pet owners require something a little out of the ordinary. Recently, they were asked to walk a cat in a stroller. They also had to feed a bearded dragon named Athena.""That was definitely one of our most exotic pets,"" says Andrews. ""But she was super easy.""Related: Do You Love Animals? Here Are 5 Ways You Can Turn Your Passion into Real MoneyIs pet sitting right for you?Pet sitting may sound like a fun and affordable way to see the world, but it's not for everyone. Andrews and Kerr believe there are a few traits you need to possess to make it work.You have to be an animal lover. Both Andrew and Kerr are big animal fans. Kerr grew up on a game bird farm with dreams of being a veterinarian. ""But I couldn't really handle the sad part of that,"" she says. ""Pet sitting is perfect because I still get to be around animals, and, you know, there are some stressful moments for sure.


You have to be flexible and creative. Travel schedules change, so you need to be willing to adapt. You also have to be creative about your going pay your way. Remember, international pet-sitting jobs only cover your housing costs. So you'll need to figure out how to pay for the rest of the trip. One bonus about Europe, says Andrews. ""It's much cheaper once you get there. It's like $60 to fly from Rome to Paris.""You have to be a good communicator. Make sure you're in good communication with the pet owners. Leaving your home and pets in the hands of strangers can be stressful. ""You wanna make sure everyone's comfortable and on the same page,"" says Andrews. Nomads and Pawpads

102,Don't Listen to This Myth About Having Both a Side Hustle and a Full-Time Job,"Jul 25, 2023",Patrick Ward,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/dont-listen-to-this-myth-about-side-hustles/454979,"
In this breakneck-paced world, one in which multiple income sources are increasingly embraced, side ventures unrelated to one's primary line of work have been the prevailing models. However, this trend has also led to a long line of entrepreneurial scams, as people try their hand at side hustles for which ""no experience is required.""A recent and detailed-below personal experience, I hope, can be fuel for a new paradigm, one that has the potential to redefine the way both entrepreneurs and those seeking employment approach their professional journeys, and particularly how they start new businesses.NanoGlobals began as a humble endeavor in 2020. Locked inside, and with an abundance of time on my hands, like many, I chose to pursue a side business. While I was enormously grateful to have maintained my primary source of income, a moment like 2020 offered a chance to reflect, including on facing the crises of tomorrow with stability and confidence. Rather than follow the usual path of a part-time enterprise unrelated to my primary expertise (dropshipping was the flavor of the month at the time), I quickly recognized that such a side venture did not have to be disconnected from the core skills of outsourcing and remote work I'd built over the previous decade. Instead, it could be a powerful extension, amplifying my unique value proposition.



Related: 10 Trending Side Hustles on TikTok. Are They Right For You?Fast-forward to 2023, and NanoGlobals has grown to over 60,000 visitors a month — a steady-revenue, strongly branded and authoritative B2B asset that has been cited in media outlets from Business Insider to The Yale Law Journal.


Upon leaving my previous job, one question was weighing on my mind: whether or not to take this new venture on full-time, and I wound up pursuing it that way for a time. As is often the case, though, a job opportunity came up: a chance to join Formula.Monks, the tech pillar of Media.Monks — the digital-first operating brand of London-based S4Capital.It sounded great on paper: a new brand in my domain of professional tech services — one with the resources of a global conglomerate. But a nagging question persisted as I engaged in the hiring process: What would happen to NanoGlobals? Unexpectedly, those thoughts were dispelled during hiring conversations that wound up focusing on the value my side venture could bring to Formula.Monks, as well as my inherent skill set. I realized something other companies, job seekers and entrepreneurs might be well advised to take note of: I wasn't being hired despite my side venture, but because of it.Related: She Quit Her 'Toxic' Job to Pursue a Freelancing Side Hustle. Now She Leads Her Team With Compassion, Makes 6 Figures and Even Bought a House.I've come to understand that embracing a side venture that aligns with one's professional aspirations can usher in new realms of employability — that entrepreneurs no longer have to choose between pursuing passions and securing a dream job. This paradigm shift can help them redefine what success for their ventures looks like: It doesn't have to be an IPO, it could be an acquihire. It's possible to seamlessly merge the two, creating a harmonious symphony of skills that at once captivates employers and distinguishes applicants from their peers — demonstrating versatility, adaptability and entrepreneurial spirit.


This approach can be a particularly powerful asset for individuals striving to excel in the ever-evolving digital landscape, in which simply having functional expertise is increasingly not enough. With AI disrupting several white-collar professions, the key to success is navigating and thriving in the worlds of both building and selling. If you produce a successful side hustle, it proves to future employers that you can do both.Related: 4 AI Trends That Have Helped the Creator Economy (and How to Take Advantage)So, my advice is simple: Don't be afraid to intertwine a side venture with your primary line of work. Embrace the power of synergy, and your employability will soar. In an era defined by disruption and innovation, it's time for entrepreneurs to rewrite the rules and unlock their full potential.

103,7 Ways to Earn Passive Income From Work You Have Already Completed,"Jul 24, 2023",Ginny Silver,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/7-ways-to-earn-passive-income-from-work-you-have-already/455590,"
The biggest shift in money-earning potential comes when we are able to eliminate the time for money exchange. As an entrepreneur your business may begin with a time-for-money model — you provide a service or product, and your income is limited by the number of hours required to do the work, create the product, or work with the client.This creates an income ceiling — we can only make as much income as hours in a day. This approach can be incredibly taxing on the entrepreneur — resulting in being overworked, burned out and treading water to survive the day-to-day operations of making ends meet, never reaching your profitability potential or ability to scale successfully.Most small businesses get trapped and die in this cycle – unsure how to break free of the time-for-money exchange. For those who can rethink their business model, an important first step is to find how to begin to make more income from work you have already done.



No matter your business type, you have some sort of bank of completed work. Whether it be online assets such as blog posts, digital products and video content or tangible work such as products and services rendered. Evaluate what your business has created and how you can use that finished work to bring in more income without reinventing the wheel.Related: 17 Passive Income Ideas to Increase Your Cash Flow in 2023


1. Re-purpose your content and post on money-making sitesIf your business creates online content, you could leave money on the table by not repurposing it into other forms and loading it on new platforms. Freelance article websites such as Medium allow you to monetize content. Video platforms such as YouTube will enable you to earn ad revenue from views on monetized channels. Google Adsense allows you to embed ads into your blog.Additionally, reformatting your content and placing it on sites to funnel in your target audience may not immediately result in income but can funnel in your target audience and point them to your paid products by providing links to your products and affiliates in your bio and other link sharing areas. For example, a business may already have a high-quality blog post on its website. This blog post can be turned into a Medium article, a YouTube video or a PDF guide to use as a lead magnet, a TikTok short and an Instagram reel. This would result in the content earning ad revenue on the blog.Related: TikTok Is the New Normal. 5 Reasons to Add TikTok to Your Content Marketing Strategy2. Integrate affiliate links into your online contentWhether you service clients, sell products or create content online, your business can integrate affiliate marketing to earn a new stream of income. Affiliate marketing allows businesses and creators to partner with businesses that want shared products and services. When accepted into a partner program, you can access unique affiliate links that track your referrals.


When a viewer clicks your link and makes a purchase, your referral link tracks the sale, and the business pays you a commission. Once in place on your content, affiliate links can generate a passive income that pays out long past the setup on evergreen content. The easiest way to begin affiliate marketing is by applying to and joining a larger affiliate network such as Share a Sale, Impact, Clickbank or Rakuten.3. Get sponsoredIf you create online content and have a following, you may miss out on sponsorship opportunities. When a business or creator is sponsored, they receive a fee in exchange for sharing a product or service in their content. These aren't just for those with massive audiences. Sponsors and marketing teams often have high value for smaller and more personal followings as they understand that creators with a small dedicated following can have a strong influence when sharing their trusted products and service referrals.Don't wait for sponsors to reach out to you — instead, be proactive. Create a press kit with a rate card and your viewer demographics and platform stats. Contact brands you would like to partner with and send along a pitch for a partnership and be sure to include your rate card.4. Create a digital productIf you can solve a problem, then you have a digital product itching to be made. PDF guides, online courses, digital templates, social media assets, tutorials and resource lists are just a few of the digital products you may want to consider.


Digital products will take time to create initially, but once the product has been made and is up and running, very little work may be needed to maintain it. With a solid marketing plan and sales funnel, your digital product could result in a large stream of mostly passive income once created. Think of what problem your business can solve that others need to solve as well.How have you solved this in the past? What work have you already created that addresses this problem? Do you have a blog post, a tutorial, a step-by-step guide, a video clip or a resource created that can be packaged as a product and made available for download?5. Sell assets to stock sitesIf your business creates digital assets – photos, videos or music – you may have assets that can be uploaded and sold as stock. Allowing platforms to license your assets to their customers in a stock library can be a great way to take work you have already created and profit from it in a new way. Websites such as Getty and Adobe allow users to create profiles and submit their assets for sale in exchange for royalty compensation.6. Rent out your spaceIf your business has an office, studio, or meeting space that isn't used all of the time but has been styled carefully for functionality and aesthetic, then you may be able to rent out the use of your space to other business owners and creators.


Websites such as Breather, Peerspace and Home Studio List allow users to book time by the hour or by the day in offices and studios for meetings, pop-up events and productions. This can be a highly profitable way to earn income from unused space on the work you have already done to set up and curate your space.Related: 5 Ways You Can Profit from Your Empty Office Space7. Set up sales funnels and automatePerhaps your business already sells digital products, integrates affiliate links or provides online services, but they simply aren't selling to their full potential. For work you have already created but lacking sales, try integrating a powerful automated sales funnel to get a stream of constant leads and income.Start with a lead magnet — a free piece of content that captures your target customer's information and subscribes them to your email list in exchange for a piece of valuable content. Then, amp up the value and establish trust in your brand by delivering additional free high-value content directly to their inbox. Once trust is established, become the go-to expert for your niche by continuing to over-deliver. Then, pitch a product that solves their problem.


No matter what you choose, don't overthink it. Choose one monetization booster from the list and focus on getting it up and running as soon as possible. Maximizing the amount of income potential from the work you have already created is an essential step in moving from the time-for-money exchange model and will help you to leap to work less and earn more.

104,7 Effective Side Hustles From Home,"Jul 20, 2023",Entrepreneur Deals,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/7-effective-side-hustles-from-home/458881,"
With the help of the internet and social media, having a practical side hustle has been more accessible than ever. Read on to learn about some of the most lucrative side hustle ideas to make extra cash from home.1. Managing a print-on-demand shopThere are many different avenues to starting a profitable online business. One of the more popular routes is print-on-demand. With Printful, an established print-on-demand provider, customers can personally design more than 300 products like t-shirts, bags, and posters. You don't need to be a graphic designer to use Printful; It's easy to create through their Design Maker or by importing other designs from online tools like Canva.Customers then make money by selling these items to an audience through various platforms. Printful integrates with more than 20 of the top e-commerce hosts like Etsy, Amazon, and Shopify. Social media has brought about a lot of awareness for these types of businesses and is only growing bigger and bigger from here.



This side hustle is becoming increasingly in demand as individuals create and market their own brands.2. Sell your used items onlineOne of the easiest ways to make extra money and clear out your living space is to sell old items. Today, there are many online stores and platforms where you can sell your used items, such as Amazon, Etsy, Facebook Marketplace, LetGo, Craigslist, eBay, social media posts, and more.


All you need is a camera, a phone or computer, and an internet connection to be able to get your items posted for sale. The most common things that can be sold online would be old furniture, baby items such as strollers, cribs, rockers, household appliances, and wall art.The best way to do this is to take clear photos of each item and post them with their state of condition and price. If this interests you, you can consider selling items for friends and family and collect a small commission on your sales.It is true what they say; one man's trash is another man's treasure. If your items had ended up in the trash, why not make some money off them?3. Start a blogStarting a blog through a platform like Squarespace or Weebly could be an extremely lucrative side hustle if you enjoy writing. Most individuals who love to write do not begin by doing it for money, and when breaking out into the online writing world, it can be a bit slow before seeing profits.


With consistency and time, online bloggers have the potential to bring in thousands of dollars each month, not only from their writing but from affiliate marketing ads and advertising. With these ads attached to your blog's website, you can make passive income which you have to do absolutely nothing to earn. The most successful blogs bring in more money than part-time jobs with way less effort, making it a great side hustle option.Over time, your blog can gain more followers, which means more money to fuel your side hustle.4. ProofreadingIf you are detail-oriented and love reading, proofreading can be an excellent way for you to make extra money on the side.Proofreading is in greater demand than one would think. With the rise of the internet, more businesses have websites; more people are writing blogs, articles, content, and general copy that require proofreading.

It also involves the transfer of money and data to execute these transactions.In essence, running an ecommerce business involves setting up an online store on a platform like Shopify, Amazon, eBay or Etsy, and selling products directly to customers. This business model is appealing because of its relatively low startup costs and the potential to reach a global audience.

Shopify is a popular choice for its user-friendly interface and comprehensive ecommerce functionality.


Amazon and Etsy, on the other hand, offer established marketplaces with millions of potential customers. It's worth noting that each platform comes with its own set of rules, fees and features, so it's important to conduct thorough market research to find the best fit for your business needs.The design and development of your ecommerce website also play a crucial role in its success. The aim is to create a high-quality site that is easy to navigate, visually appealing and designed to convert visitors into customers. You may decide to use a web development service or design the site yourself if you have the necessary skills.Launching your ecommerce store is only the beginning. To drive traffic and increase sales, you'll need to implement effective marketing strategies, which could include search engine optimization (SEO), social media marketing, email marketing and more.Your ecommerce venture could be your path to owning a thriving online business, selling products (physical or digital products) you are passionate about to customers around the globe.


2. PodcastingIn the landscape of digital entrepreneurship,podcasting has emerged as a unique and engaging platform for sharing information and telling stories. A podcast is a digital audio or video file series that a user can download or stream to listen to. As the host or producer of a podcast, you have the potential to reach a global audience, covering topics you are passionate about.Related: 5 Reasons Why Brands Should Think About Creating a Podcast Series in 2022To start your own podcast, you'll need some basic equipment, a quiet space to record and a topic you're passionate about. Content creation is at the heart of podcasting, so it's important to plan your episodes carefully and ensure they offer value to your listeners.Podcasts make money in several ways, primarily through sponsorships, advertisements and listener donations. Additionally, podcasting opens up opportunities for passive income. For instance, you can repurpose podcast content into blog posts or self-publish your episodes as a series of books.


Bear in mind that creating a successful podcast takes time and patience. Still, with commitment and the right strategies, it could become a profitable online business that not only makes money but also allows you to connect with audiences on a personal level.3. Virtual assistant businessIn today's fast-paced digital world, many entrepreneurs, professionals and small business owners are in need of virtual assistance, administrative tasks that are handled by a remote worker. Starting a virtual assistant business can be a cost-effective online business idea, given that it generally requires little more than a reliable internet connection and strong organizational skills.A virtual assistant's tasks can range from managing emails and schedules to handling social media accounts, data entry and more. Depending on your skill set, you might choose to offer services in a specific area, such as social media management or administrative support.Platforms like Upwork are commonly used for finding virtual assistant gigs. You can create a profile, set your own rates and apply for jobs that suit your skills. Over time, as you build a reputation for reliable, high-quality work, you can increase your rates and even hire other virtual assistants to grow your business and make money online.


The key to starting a successful virtual assistant business is identifying and marketing your skills to the right audience. With minimal startup costs and the potential for significant income, becoming a virtual assistant is one of the best online business ideas.4. Freelance graphic designIn the world of digital business, aesthetics matter. Companies are always in search of freelance graphic designers to help them create logos, marketing materials, social media graphics and more.

These platforms allow you to create a profile, showcase your portfolio and apply for projects that match your skills.


A key aspect of building your freelance graphic design business is creating a portfolio that showcases your skills and abilities. It's also essential to continually improve and expand your skillset as technology and design trends evolve quickly.While the startup costs for a freelance graphic design business can be relatively low, the potential for income can be quite high, especially as you gain experience and establish a reputation for quality work.In digital entrepreneurship, each journey begins with a single step. Whether starting a virtual assistant business or becoming a freelance graphic designer, the key is to choose an online business idea that aligns with your skills and interests, then pursue it with dedication and passion.5. Online courses and tutorialsThe demand for online learning platforms has skyrocketed in recent years, creating a lucrative opportunity for entrepreneurs who are experts in their fields. Creating online courses and tutorials is an excellent way to share your knowledge, build a community and generate a steady stream of income.


Online courses can be created on a variety of subjects, such as web design, digital marketing, data entry, business planning and more. Platforms like Udemy, Teachable and Coursera make it simple to create and sell online courses to students worldwide.As an online course creator, you not only create the course content but also market it to potential students. Successful marketing strategies might include SEO, content creation on a blog or YouTube channel and social media marketing.With some upfront effort in creating the course and setting up your marketing strategy, online courses can become a source of passive income, earning you money any time a new student enrolls.6. Dropshipping businessDropshipping is a business model where the business owner sells products without holding any inventory. When a product is sold, the seller purchases the item from a third party, who then ships it directly to the customer.


This business model has relatively low startup costs, as there's no need to purchase and store inventory upfront. Websites like Shopify can integrate with dropshipping plugins, making it easy to create an ecommerce site specifically for dropshipping.However, dropshipping requires diligent research and management. It involves choosing the right products, finding reliable suppliers and managing customer service. Marketing, particularly through social media platforms and SEO, is crucial in driving traffic to your dropshipping website and converting visitors into customers.With the right approach, a dropshipping business can provide a great source of income while allowing you to avoid the typical responsibilities and overheads of traditional retail.7. Self-publishingSelf-publishing is a profitable online business model where authors write, design and publish their own books, typically in digital and print formats. Thanks to platforms like Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing, Apple iBooks and Barnes & Noble Press, it's easier than ever to publish your own books and make them available to readers around the globe.


If you're a freelance writer or blogger with your own website already, you may be looking for great business ideas to further monetize your skills. Self-publishing a book would make a lot of sense — you've already captured your target audience, you have strong copywriting and proofreading skills and your work is in demand and very low cost.Additionally, you don't need a complex new business plan or expensive website design or editing software to self-publish a book and potentially make a lot of money.This business model offers the potential for passive income, as once your book is published, it can continue to generate sales without any additional work on your part. However, successful self-publishing requires more than just writing a book; it also involves marketing your book to potential readers. This might include building a website, growing an email list or using social media marketing.With creativity, writing skills and the right marketing strategy, self-publishing can become a profitable and fulfilling online business.Related: Here Are 55 Small Business IdeasChoose a path that fits your interestsEntering the world of digital entrepreneurship opens a world of innovative online business ideas.

Maddy Clements, owner of upcycled clothing company JUNK GOLD, ""always had an obsession with fashion"" and an eye for entrepreneurship — at just 11 years old, she was selling jewelry at a local boutique up the street from her house.So perhaps it's no surprise that the now 29-year-old decided to get her BFA in fashion design and launch her own clothing business in the process. She started JUNK GOLD as a thrifted styling service, inspired by the act of giving old clothes new life and the desire to combat the fashion industry's massive waste problem.""Where some may see an ugly old top at Goodwill, I see potential,"" Clements tells Entrepreneur. ""While studying fashion design in school, I often thrifted old clothing and textiles to use for my projects instead of buying new fabric to save money. I started enjoying the process of taking something old and drab and figuring out ways to make it new and exciting.""

      Key Takeaways    



        Janessa Leone saw hats as the perfect launchpad into the fashion world 
      


        She worked on the venture in college on the side; a trip to Paris would kick off its R&D phase 
      


        She had to push through self-doubt and seize opportunities as they came to find success

""I genuinely love hats,"" Janessa Leone, founder of the fashion brand Janessa Leoné, says. ""They're a beautiful accessory to — pun intended — top off a wardrobe and make you look so put together. It demands a level of confidence: I'm wearing a hat, and I'm noticeable. I'm going to own this and be very self-aware and present in my own body.""Leone had always dreamed of launching her own fashion brand growing up in San Diego, California. Hats seemed like the perfect way into the industry: Some of fashion's biggest brands, including Chanel and Halston, got their start with the accessory, after all.""Fashion's always cyclical,"" Leone says, ""[but] hats are such a cultural mainstay in Europe, and they weren't really in America [at the time]. I wanted to bridge the gap between my Italian heritage and California upbringing and use it as a way to launch into the fashion world.""



So that's just what she did.Today, Leone's brand, which began as a side hustle with $10,000 from her personal savings and just six sample hats, is an eight-figure business that's sold more than half a million hats and cultivated a celebrity fan base that includes Jessica Alba, Chrissy Teigen and Hailey Bieber, among others.


Image Credit: Courtesy of Janessa LeonéIt took Leone 10 years to achieve this level of renown, but to outsiders looking in, the brand's popularity skyrocketed seemingly overnight — Leone's sophisticated, recognizable hats, of ""quality that could withstand the test of time,"" proliferated in Hollywood and beyond. You've likely seen them, though you might not have been familiar with Leone herself.Related: 5 Inspiring Guys Who Prove Overnight Success Is BS | EntrepreneurDespite the brand's success, Leone's founding journey wasn't exactly a linear one. The L.A. designer sat down with Entrepreneur to share the fate-filled, ""quite kismet"" story of how her brand came to be.


""Everything was so perfectly aligned and beautifully romantic.""Leone's dad encouraged her to get a ""proper education,"" so she went to college and studied English literature. While in school, she traveled to Paris, and what she found on that trip would ultimately shift the trajectory of her career.It was a men's dress hat in a little vintage shop in the Marais neighborhood. Always one to appreciate the ""heritage and story of hats,"" Leone immediately set out to uncover the hat's origins and craftsmanship.The find spurred a deep research and development phase: She spoke with cowboys in Texas and Amish milliners in Pennsylvania to dissect how it was made — and who made it. The answer to the latter question came when Leone removed the hat's sweatband and found its maker's signature inside.His name? ""Leone"" — the very same as her own. The hat was made in Italy in the 1940s. ""Everything was so perfectly aligned and beautifully romantic,"" Leone recalls.


Leone had a clear vision and needed to find a manufacturer, but it wouldn't be easy. Although hatmaking saw a resurgence in the 1970s and 1980s, interest had waned, and the handmade aspect meant additional challenges.As a result, Leone received some very dismissive responses to her idea. You really want to do this? Women don't wear hats in America. ""It was quite patronizing,"" Leone says. ""There were a lot of 'sweethearts.'""But Leone stood firm, and armed with $10,000 in personal savings she'd earmarked for her venture, she finally found a manufacturer in Texas willing to give her a chance. She had six samples made — then hit another major roadblock.


Image Credit: Courtesy of Janessa LeonéRelated: Entrepreneurship Is All About Overcoming Obstacles | Entrepreneur""I talked myself out of it for about three years.""Leone was confident in her passion for fashion and design, but, still in her early 20s, the self-doubt crept in, and she wondered if she was on the right path. Who am I to think that I can do this? Who am I to think that I have what it takes?""Women worldwide are often told: 'Don't think of yourself that highly. You don't get to do that,'"" Leone says. ""So I talked myself out of it for about three years.""But another chance encounter would set Leone back on course. A friend invited her to a fashion event in L.A. and convinced her to bring one of the hats. ""If she didn't force me, I wouldn't have done it,"" Leone admits. ""And at that event, I met this fashion editor who was like, 'We have to build each other up. I want to support you. Come into my office. I want to see the collection. I want to hear how you started.'""


Image Credit: Courtesy of Janessa LeonéThat editor was Hillary Kerr; Leone met her in her office, and by the time she'd driven the two hours from L.A. back to San Diego, her inbox was flooded with emails: from Vogue, Elle, Zoe Report, Refinery29 and more.All of the press caught Barneys' attention — the luxury department store became the brand's first wholesaler, and it was ""off to the races"" from there. A celebrity hairstylist wanted to purchase Leone's hats to give to her clients. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley sent Leone flowers for her birthday a few months later, saying she was a fan. Taylor Swift selected one of Leone's hats to wear on the cover of her album 'Red.'""We've never paid influencers, never paid celebrities,"" Leone says. ""Everything has always been organic, and people are genuinely fans.""


If [customers] choose something that I design, that's wildly humbling and very inspiring.But it's not all about the star factor either, Leone stresses. She credits all of the brand's customers with ""great taste"" and a definitive understanding of what they want. Every time someone chooses Leone's brand, she considers it ""the biggest vote of confidence.""""You could wear anything, celebrity or not,"" Leone explains. ""If [customers] choose something that I design, that's wildly humbling and very inspiring, and it's like, Alright, I can keep going.""Janessa Leoné is now an internationally recognized lifestyle brand with manufacturers across the country; is sold at Bergdorf Goodman, Shopbop and Nordstrom; and has a flagship store in L.A.


Image Credit: Courtesy of Janessa LeonéLeone recently read Rick Rubin's The Creative ACT: A Way of Being, which touches on the moments in time when things come together, pushed forward by ""cosmic energy"" regardless of the action you take or don't, and says she feels similarly about what happened with her brand.""It's a beautiful thing about things that are well-made — they're going to last forever,"" Leone says. ""I feel like people were starting to want something well-made by someone that they could stand behind.""Related: 8 Things That Can Help You Become a Successful Fashion Entrepreneur

Traditionally, early retirement was defined as retiring at 60 — as opposed to 65. However, that's changed slightly over the years.For those born between 1943 and 1954, the full retirement age is 66. If you were born between 1955 and 1960, your full retirement age gradually increases until it reaches 67. Anyone born after 1960 is eligible for full retirement benefits at 67.Meanwhile, early retirement is being redefined.
