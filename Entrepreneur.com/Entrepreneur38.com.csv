1,Here's When – and How – You Should Hire an SEO Expert for Your Business,"Apr 25, 2024",Gajura Constantin,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/hiring-an-seo-expert-will-transform-your-business-heres-7/435990,"
Although many individuals understand the importance of search engine optimization (SEO) — the process of increasing your website's visibility on search engines like Google — very few people know precisely what it takes to implement an effective strategy. Unless you're already an expert in SEO marketing, your business might benefit from hiring a seasoned professional — full time or on a contract — to increase the exposure of your digital products.The same can be said of your broader marketing goals. While you may already have created a content strategy, working with an outside digital marketing agency can help drive more awareness to your business while you focus on other aspects of the operation. A good SEO expert will have been in the industry for a few years and will understand how the system works. They will be able to update your website to attract more organic traffic and increase your leads.Related: 5 Ways Businesses Can Get Traffic and Generate Leads



The case for hiring an SEO expertYou can enjoy the benefits of technical expertiseBoosting your business's online presence through SEO is complex. Part of it involves technical updates that greatly impact the visibility of your business, and an expert will implement a variety of processes that can help you outrank your competitors on Google, Bing and other search engines. Typically, an SEO expert will use some of the following strategies to improve your business:Conduct a site-wide SEO audit to determine what pages perform bestPerform keyword research and optimizationOptimize your URL structureRecommend new content creation strategiesOptimize title tags and meta descriptionsImprove your backlinking processEnhance your page and website loading speedsRelated: Don't Use The Same SEO Playbook As Your Competitors. Use These 3 SEO Tactics Instead.


You'll have more time to run your businessRunning a successful business is challenging — there are always administrative tasks competing for your attention. If you're disproportionately focused on SEO, other aspects of your business might suffer. By hiring an SEO expert, you can trust that your digital presence will thrive while you focus on the other important aspects of running a business.You'll stay on top of changing algorithmsSearch algorithms are constantly evolving as search engines alter their criteria for ranking websites – the system that worked two weeks ago may be outdated today. Unless it's something you're looking at every day, it will be hard to keep up to date with these constant changes. An SEO expert will look for ways to update your site as SEO criteria shift.You'll save money in the long runHiring an SEO expert is not cheap, especially if you want to get the best results. That being said, it's hard to make money if your website isn't attracting visitors. According to the 2023 ""State of SEO"" survey by Conductor, 93% of respondents said SEO positively impacted their digital growth and marketing goals, underscoring how important it is to invest in SEO strategies. Hiring an SEO expert to build your strategy ensures you're implementing website updates that will ultimately drive revenue.Your content profile will grow ""healthier""Google and other search engines often evaluate the content profiles of businesses before ranking their websites. If your content profile is not healthy — typically because you're not publishing compelling content — it is almost guaranteed that Google will not rank it high. An SEO expert can help you evaluate content gaps and overhaul your strategy by recommending a publishing cadence and helping your writers produce content that is valuable to your customers.


It'll give you an edge on your competitionWhen you search for keywords related to your business, you'll be frustrated if you see a competitor's product or service outranking yours. If that's the case, there's a good chance they have invested in SEO or other digital marketing strategies. Working with an expert can help you implement strategies to reduce the gap — and even surpass — the competition.Digital PR without an agency's helpThe more places the name of your business appears, the better — particularly online. When it comes to SEO, an effective public relations strategy will mean your business is being mentioned in news articles, industry publications and in the content created by other sources — an SEO tactic referred to as backlinking. The more often your company is mentioned or linked to, the higher you'll rank for keywords that are important to your business goals. To gain traction with backlinks, though, you'll need a public relations strategy.If you can't afford to hire a public relations agency to do this work for you, there are other ways to generate buzz and get your business's name out there. Use the following strategies to your advantage:Build real relationships: If you want media members to write about your business, don't simply send press releases and promotional emails their way. Instead, reach out and ask what content areas they're covering, offer yourself as a subject matter expert and see if they'd like to hear more about your business. Perhaps even try to schedule coffee or an informational phone call. By creating an authentic relationship with members of the press, you're more likely to get coverage.Research local media: One of the surest ways to alienate a reporter is to flood them with irrelevant pitches. Rather than send your pitches to the wrong people, figure out who in your area might cover topics related to your business. Read the work of different reporters and make an informed decision. Don't pitch a travel journalist a feature about your tech startup, for instance.Tell a story: Journalists often want to see if there's storytelling potential in your pitch, so be creative and build a narrative with your outreach. Who are the characters at the heart of your operation? How did your business get started? Is it benefitting your community or changing your industry in a unique way? Answering these questions in a pitch may pique a reporter's interest.Think ahead: Many publications are working weeks — often months — in advance to build their content calendar. If you have a story tied to a particular time peg, don't wait until the week before to pitch it. Reach out well in advance to give reporters and editors an opportunity to ask questions, assign the story, write it and run it through their editing process before publication.Respect reporters' time: Once you've found the right contact and sent a pitch, be tactful. If you don't hear back, follow up once or twice, but don't hound them every day or week. Reporters and editors are busy, and they simply might not have the capacity to respond. Your story might be compelling , but reporters are getting interesting pitches all the time. Never follow up with angry emails — it's unprofessional and it won't help your cause.Don't get discouraged: Building connections and pitching stories take time and persistence. Just because you don't hear back from someone does not mean your story isn't worthwhile. You might just need to find a new target publication, pitch a different journalist and build a new relationship.When and why to hire a marketing agencyAt a certain point, your business will need a dedicated person to oversee your various digital marketing, SEO or public relation efforts . If an internal, full-time hire doesn't make sense, you may be well served by partnering with an outside agency to take on one or many aspects of your broader digital marketing needs. To determine whether you should hire someone in house or on contract, consider the following:


Type of expertise: An in-house marketer will have in-depth knowledge of your business, know exactly what your team does and devote almost all of their working hours to your business. With an outside agency, you'll get access to an entire team of marketing professionals who have an array of expertise, but you might not get the same level of investment in your business.Communication style: Having someone in house means you will work side-by-side, have regular communication and can get ongoing, immediate updates. You won't have the same level of access with a marketing agency. You may have in-person meetings as the strategy is developed, but that will ultimately shift to email and phone communication.Budget: It's generally more expensive to hire your own marketing professional than to work with an agency. When you hire in house, keep in mind that you're going to have to pay a salary as well as the expenses that come with offering competitive benefits to quality employees. Still, it is often worth it for the right hire.Timeline: Small businesses may find themselves needing to create a marketing strategy, which can happen if customer growth plateaus, competitors begin gaining market share or new products are not taking off. In these situations, businesses might consider an agency, which could jump in immediately and help develop a marketing strategy. It takes longer to recruit, hire and train a new employee.If you decide to hire an outside marketing agency for your business, there are many factors to consider before signing a contract. Consider evaluating potential agencies based on the following:Credibility through social proof: A quick way to filter out dodgy agencies is to look at their experience and the social proof they give to build credibility. If they claim to have expertise in your industry, make sure their portfolio demonstrates the same. Check out their client testimonials on independent review aggregators, review their social media and perform due diligence by speaking with former clients.Avoid a one-size-fits-all approach: Be wary of agencies trying to sell you template-driven solutions. Often when an agency has delivered many projects, they may feel your company is no different. If their initial proposal is too generic, with no research and customized planning involved, they will likely offer run-of-the-mill services.Beware of the lowest bidder: If a company quotes you a very low cost compared to the competition and promises to deliver instant organic growth or unrealistic sales leads, think again. These may look like attractive propositions but are, in most instances, inaccurate.Ownership of intellectual property: Make sure that ideas, assets or any other collaborative output conceptualized and created are the rightful property of the firm hiring the agency. You'll want to keep these assets under your discretion and control. If the agency is being shady about ownership rights, it's time to reconsider.Work out the best deal: Start with asking for a request for proposal (RFP). Review proposals, ask questions and get clarity on the processes, team structures and communication styles. You can ask firms to prepare a sales pitch or arrange a marketing consultation. If you like the agency's approach but have two excellent contenders, go for a trial run. A small paid project that caters to a part of a business objective can be a distinguishing test.

2,Your Service Should Go Way Beyond Sales. 4 Ways to Build Long-lasting Relationships With Distributors and Retailers,"Apr 24, 2024",Adam Kroener,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-ways-to-build-long-lasting-relationships-with-retailers/472800,"
Business partnerships can make or break your company's success. Strong business partnerships lead to enhanced efficiency, innovation and staff retention, driving long-term success.I've witnessed my brand become among the top ten in RTD spirit sales across the US despite only selling in eleven states. Much of our 'unprecedented' success isn't unprecedented at all. It stems from a hardline focus on investing in building meaningful business relationships. We launched in 2019 and flourished even when most restaurants and bars couldn't stock our products. While many other factors saw us through those uncertain times, our thriving business relationships proved vital.While no one can predict the future, it is important to build pillars to help your company remain stable and scale during uncertain times. To build robust foundational success for your startup, small business, or freelance endeavors, read the four tips below on building long-lasting business relationships.



Related: Why These 5 Characteristics of Self-Reliance Will Guarantee Your SuccessTip 1. ""Expect Ingratitude."" — Dale Carnegie.My first tip could seem counterintuitive to the untrained eye. Yet, my years of trial and error have opened my eyes to the truth about the famed Dale Carnegie quote, ""Expect ingratitude."" This first tip is the foundation for my remaining suggestions, and it's a notion all professionals and entrepreneurs must appreciate and grasp. Expecting ingratitude isn't as pessimistic as it may appear. It's pragmatic and realistic, preventing disappointment because you won't over-inflate your expectations.


Managing expectations goes hand in hand with business success. In doing so, there won't be any blame game when things go wrong, as they inevitably do. There will only be a streamlined focus on solving the problem, taking full ownership of our actions, and driving the business forward. Instead of facing a string of disappointments, insightfully managed expectations strike a balance between unbridled ambition and remaining grounded, keeping your trajectory upward. Stay grounded but aim high, ensuring a win for everyone involved when outcomes exceed expectations.Related: Successful Businesses Have This One Thing in CommonTip #2: Take accountabilityIf something is not working, take ownership of the result. For example, while many across the sector complain distributors and retailers don't do enough for sales, at my company, Carbliss, we take a different approach.Our philosophy is the reality: Distributors provide logistical services to transport products from 'A' to 'B,' while retailers offer the platform to sell. It's not our partners' job to move the products off the shelves; it's ours. When products don't sell, we don't point fingers at our partners. Rather, we look inward and ask how we can improve. We take ownership and accountability for product sales.


Removing these burdens from our partners' shoulders has enabled us to cultivate a symbiotic relationship with them. We support them by letting them do what they do and expecting nothing more, and they support us by doing their job and then some. It's collaboration at its purest and most productive. Stay accountable to increase your collaboration.Tip #3: Offer substance instead of empty gestures.Strong business partnerships don't require glamorous dinner parties or appreciation galas. Perhaps it can mean elbow grease, facetime and handshakes. Be involved beyond emails and phone calls. Insert yourself into the action to prove you're a partner willing to roll up your sleeves and get involved, not just ""another brand.""Your business partners care far less about being wine and dined. Like our distributors and retailers, they'll respond best when you make them feel supported, valued, and part of something bigger.Tip #4: Be honest and transparentHow can your business prove its commitment to your partners' success? It starts with honesty and transparency about your offerings and expectations. Setting expectations immediately and sticking to them builds trust and respect. These efforts often yield pleasantly surprising positive outcomes. Even when outcomes don't get met, keep your business partners involved and stay honest, and this will pay off in the long run. These efforts go far in building lasting relationships.


Related: Stop Lying and Start Being Radically Honest With Your TeamWhen your products can double as commodities, the partners bringing them to market (e.g., distributors and retailers) are as pivotal to your success as your customers. Thus, your partners require a brand experience similar to what you offer customers. Try these suggestions to build thriving business relationships, cultivate loyalty and foster success.

3,How Investing in This Unorthodox Business Strategy Can Produce Strategic Results,"Apr 24, 2024",Adam Povlitz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/the-1-factor-to-invest-in-to-capitalize-on-a-recession/472538,"
Many businesses often prioritize cost-cutting measures during economic uncertainty. However, one strategy entrepreneurs should consider during a recession is investing in their salaried employees. While this may seem counterintuitive at first, there are several reasons why this can be a strategic move for businesses looking to survive and thrive in challenging economic times.Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now to find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.Loyalty and retentionFirst and foremost, investing in salaried employees can lead to increased loyalty and retention. During a recession, employees may feel anxious about job security and may be tempted to leave for greener pastures. By investing in their development and well-being, entrepreneurs can show their commitment to their employees and create a more engaged and motivated workforce. This can lead to higher retention rates, ultimately saving the company money in the long run by reducing turnover and recruitment expenses.Additionally, investing in salaried employees can lead to increased productivity and efficiency. Employees who feel valued are likelier to go above and beyond in their work and strive for excellence. This results in higher quality output, faster turnaround times, and a more competitive edge for the business.



Furthermore, investing in salaried employees can positively impact the company's reputation and brand. Customers and clients are more inclined to trust and support businesses that treat their employees well and prioritize their well-being. Maintaining a solid and positive reputation in a recession is crucial for attracting and retaining customers, potential investors, and partners.Related: From Coding to Creole Cooking — Here Are 5 Inspiring Success Stories of Black-Owned BusinessesLong term successOf course, investing in salaried employees does come with a cost. However, entrepreneurs should consider this an investment in their business's long-term success and sustainability. By prioritizing the well-being and development of their employees, organizations won't simply survive a recession but also emerge more resilient on the other side.


Investing in salaried employees during a recession should be a leading strategy for entrepreneurs navigating challenging economic times. During the most recent and ongoing economic volatility – and even during the pandemic – many companies laid off employees and stopped hiring. At Anago, we did the opposite, adding ten mid-to-senior level positions, including four executive and leadership team members (Chief Strategy Officer, Chief Operations Officer, VP of Marketing, and IT Director). We allocated 80% of new hires to sales and marketing and the remaining 20% to operations.Related: Find Out Which Brands Have Ranked on the Franchise 500 for Longest, Earning a Spot In our New 'Hall of Fame'During a recessionInvesting in salaried marketing professionals during a recession can be a powerful strategy for entrepreneurs navigating challenging economic times. Marketing is critical for businesses, as it drives customer acquisition, retention, and overall business growth. Here are a few reasons why investing in salaried marketing professionals can be a wise move during a recession:Strategic positioning: During a recession, businesses often face increased competition and tighter budgets. Investing in salaried marketing professionals can help enterprises to strategically position themselves in the market, differentiate their brand, and effectively communicate their value proposition to customers. This can give businesses a competitive edge.Adaptability and agility: The marketing landscape constantly evolves, with new trends, technologies, and consumer behaviors continually emerging. By investing in salaried marketing professionals, businesses can build a team that is agile, adaptable, and equipped to pivot quickly in response to changing market conditions. This can be especially important during a recession when businesses must be agile and responsive to shifts in consumer behavior and economic trends.Data-driven decision-making: In today's digital age, data is king. Salaried marketers have the skills and expertise to collect, analyze, and interpret data to make informed marketing decisions. By investing in a team of skilled marketing experts, businesses can leverage data-driven insights to optimize marketing campaigns, allocate resources effectively, and maximize ROI. This can be crucial during a recession, when every marketing dollar counts, and organizations need to ensure that their efforts are generating results.Brand building and customer loyalty: In uncertain times, maintaining a solid brand and fostering customer loyalty can be vital to sustaining business growth. Salaried marketing professionals can help businesses build and reinforce their brand identity, create engaging and memorable customer experiences, and cultivate long-lasting customer relationships.Investing in salaried marketing professionals during a recession can be a strategic move for entrepreneurs looking to drive business growth, stand out in the market, and develop long-term customer relationships. Businesses can position themselves for success during a recession and beyond by building a team of skilled and dedicated marketers. Investing in salaried marketing professionals is not just an expense but an asset that can yield significant returns for organizations in the long run.

4,Offering Your Valuable Knowledge and Services For Free Comes at a Price — Here's How to Avoid Paying It.,"Apr 24, 2024",Liang Zhao,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/this-is-the-true-cost-of-free-work-as-an-entrepreneur/472196,"
People enter entrepreneurship with the mindset that their creation will ""change the world."" The question is: What is the cost of changing the world, and more importantly, who pays?Even fictional heroes have to budget accordingly. There's a reason our most recognizable superheroes — the Tony Starks and Bruce Waynes of comic book fame — are all established, generationally wealthy billionaires who have the abundance of time and money to concern themselves with bigger, more worldly problems. Even Mission Impossible's IMF team is specifically hired to stop the bad guys for a large chunk of change. Everyone wants to be a hero, of course. But the crux of the issue is that, well, no one can afford to save the world for free.Truly passionate entrepreneurs can find themselves in a quandary when it comes to monetizing their efforts, especially when their primary motive isn't profit. When the harvest is for the greater good, whether for the gain of one person, the community or humanity as a whole, altruistic entrepreneurs find themselves frozen when forced to put a price on one's creation. The various scenarios where an entrepreneur might work for free:



Family or social obligations: The desire to support and share, coupled with the informal nature of such relationships, can lead to scenarios where work is heavily undervalued or under-compensated.Passion projects: When an entrepreneur is deeply invested in the results of a project, they might prioritize its completion or overvalue its impact without immediately thinking about the financial costs of the effort.Beta testing: Offering services for free for a case study or as a beta test could be a way for entrepreneurs to demonstrate results and capabilities to win business in the long run.Building skills and experience: Growing your skillset and gaining valuable experience can easily incentivize an entrepreneur to work without compensation as an apprentice or mentee, especially when it also offers a pathway to a new industry or network that isn't typically accessible to them.Market penetration: Offering free trials and sample work can help individuals and newer companies enter into a new market, launch a new product and attract a hard-to-reach customer base.The list of why an individual might work for free is exhaustive, and it can include many more incentives like strategic partnerships, philanthropic contributions and even educational purposes. The 2021 Volunteering in America Report found 60.7 million adults (23.2%) volunteered 4.1 billion hours. For an entrepreneur, unpaid or lowly paid work, though rich with potential, demands a slice of the entrepreneur's most precious resource: time.Related: The Only 2 Good Reasons to Work for Free


A currency of its own, time is paradoxically boundless and yet finite for the entrepreneur. The essence of the entrepreneurial spirit — ambition, passion and a relentless drive — can veer into murky waters if unchecked, especially when commitments continue to stack on top of one another.Many entrepreneurs work 60+ hours each week serving clients, juggling business operations, managing employees, volunteering and balancing family and friend obligations. But doing it all doesn't get a medal or the front page of the newspaper. In a survey of startup founders around the globe, Startup Snapshot found that 72% of founders struggle with mental health — with over 37% suffering from anxiety, 36% experiencing burnout and over 81% reporting that they feel the need to hide their stress, fears and challenges from others. Superheroes rarely count the toll their battles take on their psyche, and entrepreneurs too can overlook the mental and emotional expenditures of their quests.Another unintended dark side of entrepreneurial hero work is one that many so-called ""valued"" workers have faced before — in that the more that you do, the more that you're expected to do. Many clients, eager to capitalize on the dedication and availability of budding businesses, often feel at liberty to push boundaries, reaching out at all hours and expecting immediate responses. How often has a client called at 10 p.m. — or on a weekend — and expected urgent work to be completed without complaint, or more importantly, without additional compensation? For the new entrepreneurs who prioritize customer satisfaction above all, this could be a sincere opportunity to delight. But in the pursuit of building a reputation that shatters expectations, it begs the question: When does ambition become an exploitable liability rather than an asset?For an entrepreneur, how your time should be allocated is a decision that must be made with careful consideration — and for any initiative to continue to make a real and notable impact, it must also be financially viable. Time, effort and resources are all uniquely and equally as valuable to a growing business as the passion that fuels it.


Related: Entrepreneurship Can Be Draining — Try These 3 Strategies to Restore the Joy.To better navigate the relationship between generosity and professional standards, entrepreneurs can employ strategies that respect both their inherent value and entrepreneurial spirit, while still safeguarding their personal well-being. Here are some tips:Map out your schedule: There are only 24 hours in a day with no time-turner. Therefore, it is crucial to set limits around specific times when you are available for various types of work, including unpaid projects. The goal is to help manage expectations and prevent overcommitment.Set clear boundaries: Be upfront about the value and/or cost of your time. Communicate clearly when work is being offered as a favor, as a part of a strategic partnership or with the expectation of future reciprocity. Even between friends, a clear contract or agreement can help prevent future misunderstandings.Prioritize time management: Utilize time management tools and techniques to ensure that time is being allocated efficiently. Not all free work offers the same return when it comes to exposure, experience or potential business.Value one's work appropriately: Understand the market value of your services and strive to maintain that standard. It is always easier to start at a higher price that has a wider scope and work your price down rather than start too small.Keep tabs on one's contribution threshold: Regularly assessing one's contribution threshold helps to keep an eye on the entrepreneur's capacity tank. Driven by passion and motivation, a regular check-in provides a moment of reflection to assess whether time, energy and resources exerted are in balance with the benefits received. An imbalance can manifest into financial strain, lack of personal time or diminished passion for the work.Balance is imperative for sustaining the impact and viability of your endeavors. When it comes to the success of any venture, entrepreneurs must become comfortable in the space between fervor and practicality. Mastering these dueling motivations is crucial; acknowledging the true value of one's efforts ensures that the vision doesn't just survive the early stages of growth driven by motivation — it thrives with sufficient fuel and funds, without compromising the entrepreneur's mental, physical and emotional welfare in the attempt to change the world.Generosity in pursuit of vision should never overshadow an entrepreneur's professional worth. Time and energy is not infinite, but rather, finite.

5,This Google Update Could Be Tanking Your Traffic. Follow These Steps to Significantly Boost Your Page Views and Revenue Now.,"Apr 23, 2024",Ekaterina Ovodova,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/this-google-update-could-be-tanking-your-traffic-follow/471279,"
Google's March 2024 Core Update was a seismic event for blogs and website owners relying on organic search traffic. This significant algorithm change targeted low-quality content and AI-generated spam, leading to the deindexing of hundreds of websites in its early stages. The consequences were that severely affected sites lost valuable organic traffic and advertising revenue overnight.The update aligned with findings from an Originality AI study, which revealed a high prevalence of AI-generated content among the deindexed websites. 50% of impacted sites had 90-100% of their posts generated by AI.This crackdown demonstrates Google's commitment to enhancing search result quality and combating manipulative tactics like AI content spam. But it also raises an important question: How can website owners increase organic traffic significantly in this new reality?



Related: The Rules of SEO Are Changing — Here Are 5 Powerful Strategies to Help You Rank in 2024Strategies for increasing organic traffic in 2024 In the wake of the March 2024 Core Update, website owners must adapt their strategies to regain lost ground and significantly increase organic traffic. Here are some key focus areas:


1. Perform a comprehensive content auditThe first step is thoroughly analyzing your content. Use tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush to identify:Articles performing well but not ranking in the top search results (prioritize these)Content that has stopped performing after the updateUnderperforming content that has never ranked wellYou can strategically allocate your optimization efforts by understanding which content assets are working and which need improvement.2. Focus on your best-performing content that hasn't yet ranked #1 in searchesDouble down on your strengths to increase organic traffic rapidly. Find high-volume, low-competition keywords with a difficulty score of less than 10 that rank between 2 and 8. These are more likely to get that coveted highlight in the rich snippet position.Related: The Rules of SEO Are Changing — Here Are 5 Powerful Strategies to Help You Rank in 2024


3. Optimize for featured snippetsThe highlighted results at ""position zero"" above the primary organic listings are known as featured snippets. There are four primary categories of them:Paragraph snippetsList snippetsTable snippetsVideo snippets4. To improve the ranking of your website and attract more highlighted snippets, it is essential to adhere to current SEO best practices:Understanding the query's intent and matching the snippet format.Defining your topic succinctly in two to three sentences for paragraph snippets.Using objective, fact-based language and avoiding personal pronouns.Structuring content logically with proper heading tags.Writing simply and using language your audience understands.Above all, prioritize providing a superior user experience over basic keyword optimization.Google's stance on AI-generated contentWhile Google has not explicitly banned AI-generated content, the message is clear: quality, originality and user value are paramount. AI should be leveraged as a supportive tool, not replacing human expertise and creativity.


Matt G. Southern of Search Engine Journal aptly says, ""Google is not waging a war against AI; the battle is against mediocrity."" The responsible use of AI as a content creation aid is acceptable. Still, it must be coupled with human insight, editing and a commitment to providing genuinely valuable information to users. AI should be leveraged as a supportive tool, not replacing human expertise and creativity.Related:The intelligent use of AI While the update penalized sites for over-relying on AI content, Google's emphasis has always been on originality, depth and reader value. The ethical use of AI as a research aid and writing co-pilot is acceptable as long as human editing ensures unique, high-quality content.The future is E-E-A-T moving forward — Google's prioritization of Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) will be essential. Establish your topical authority by:


Citing reputable sources.Showcasing author expertise prominently.Providing accurate, trustworthy information.Ensuring an optimal user experience through intelligent design.Websites solely focused on keyword optimization rather than holistic quality signals will increasingly be left behind.The March 2024 Core Update ushered in a new era of search where quality, originality, and authority reign supreme. You can significantly increase organic traffic in this new landscape by auditing your content, capitalizing on your strengths, and adhering to E-E-A-T principles. The path ahead requires a steadfast commitment to creating an exceptional user experience through genuinely valuable content.

6,How to Actually Get Returns in Your Marketing Efforts,"Apr 23, 2024",Jaxon Parrott,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/heres-how-to-actually-get-an-roi-in-marketing/472311,"
In today's complex B2B marketing landscape, achieving a robust return on investment (ROI) requires a strategic approach combining channels, messaging and audience targeting. Among the many available channels, advertising in industry-vertical-focused newsletters stands out for its ability to deliver targeted, high-quality leads that can significantly enhance B2B marketing ROI.Of course, this strategy requires identifying newsletters most relevant to your target market—publications with a solid subscriber base, high engagement rates and quality content that aligns with your brand's messaging.However, due to the sheer volume of newsletter outlets, finding the right mix of reputable and relevant publications to include in a campaign can be daunting and time-consuming without applying the best available tools.



Fortunately, platforms like my company, Presspool.ai, leverage a vast, constantly vetted network of newsletter publishers from the entire universe of options, filtered with AI-powered audience demographics and engagement analysis.These new AI capabilities remove the time-sink and guesswork from choosing an initial batch of newsletters for your campaigns and support real-time targeting adjustments based on early engagement results as a campaign rolls out.


These innovative AI targeting capabilities, in turn, enable continual optimization of ROI, negating fraudulent bot clicks and wasted spending that might otherwise cannibalize a campaign without proper safeguards in place. Here are some strategic advantages of industry-vertical newsletters.Engaged audiences: Industry-vertical newsletters cater to niche markets, offering content tailored to professional interests. Subscribers are typically highly engaged, making them prime targets for B2B marketing messages.Enhanced credibility: By positioning your brand within respected industry publications, you inherit trust and authority by association with their newsletters. This improves brand perception and positively influences purchase decisions.Precision targeting: Newsletters allow you to zero in on your ideal customer profile, ensuring your marketing spend is directed towards leads with the highest potential for conversion.Cost efficiency: Compared to broad-reach advertising campaigns, the focused nature of industry vertical newsletters offers more bang for your buck, delivering your message directly to those most likely to be interested.Related: 10 Marketing Strategies to Fuel Your Business GrowthKeys to maximizing ROI with newsletters1. Tailor your message: Customize your ads to resonate with newsletter audiences. Understand subscribers' pain points, challenges, and interests to create a compelling, relevant copy (and images) that evoke a response.2. Use clear, action-oriented CTAs: Your call-to-action (CTA) should be unambiguous and encourage immediate action. Whether downloading a whitepaper, registering for a webinar, or signing up for a free trial, make it easy for readers to take the next step.


3. Leverage special offers: Exclusive offers, discounts, or early access to new products can entice readers to engage with your brand. Such incentives not only drive immediate action but also help in measuring the campaign's impact.4. Leverage analytics for insight: Utilize tracking URLs and monitor performance metrics such as click-through rates, conversion rates, and lead quality. This data lets you refine your strategy and improve future campaigns for better ROI.5. Test and optimize: Experiment with different ad formats, messaging, and creative elements to determine what works best.

7,10 Big Ways to Shine for National Small Business Week (and 5 Things to Avoid),"Apr 23, 2024",Jim Conroy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/10-big-ways-to-shine-for-national-small-business-week/471698,"
Small business is big business. More than half of all Americans either own a small business or work for one, and two out of three new American jobs are small-business jobs. National Small Business Week is a yearly event, one too few businesses take advantage of.For all the things Americans disagree about, small business is one they all support: According to Pew Research Center, 86% of Americans were reported to have a favorable opinion about small businesses in February (up from 80% in October of 2022).With big-time government support and the favor of almost every American, you should be taking advantage of National Small Business Week.Related: One Founder's Super-Sized Side Hustle Is Helping Small Businesses — and It's On Track to Generate More Than $50 Million This YearWhat to doNational Small Business Week is a great opportunity to remind customers, prospects and your community that you're in business, that you're an important part of the American economy and that you're an important part of the community. Through a few basic activities, you can leverage your community's predisposition to favor you. If you do it right, you'll find yourself with a few extra dollars in your pocket. You'll strengthen ties with current customers and connect with potential customers.



Keep these six basic goals in mind as you plan.Create awareness. Do something that tells everyone that you're a small business in the community.Thank your customers. Do something that shows your customers you appreciate their business.Tell your story. Explain who you are, what your business is and how you connect with customers and the community.Team up with other small businesses. Displaying a ""we're-all-in-it-together"" front to the community adds good feelings and keeps shoppers and customers in the neighborhood. This strategy is ideal when your business complements another (for instance, a home painting business and a landscaper, or a dogwalker and a veterinary clinic).Network. Building a relationship with others gets you mentioned and brings customers to your store, your phone and your website.Do business with other small businesses. As often as you can, do business with someone whose business will grow as yours does.Related: I've Served Small Businesses for More Than 10 Years — Here Are 3 Investments to Consider That Will Help You Succeed10 specific things to do to shine during National Small Business WeekBut what should you do? Here are some suggestions, but don't limit yourself to these alone. The more creative you are, the more successful you should be.Email customers to tell them you're making a big deal of National Small Business Week. Just tell your email list you're participating and what you're doing. Consider an email marketing platform if you haven't before. Many start with a free trial option; this email is a great opportunity to test them out. (And if you don't have an email list: make one!)Make a local promotion. Remind people that your business is part of their community. What you do will depend on your business, but some ideas can include discounts, buy-one-get-one-free, a free sample or trial service or a giveaway item for business conducted during the week. Announce it by email, a sign in your window or buy an ad in your local newspaper or community web page. Then track how well it works by comparing sales or web page codes. A document management system (DMS) helps handle the tracking by scanning all your receipts and invoices and assigning them to this promotion.Unpaid local media. Talk to your local media about doing a story on National Small Business Week and mention you're participating. They may wind up mentioning you in their story or even doing a remote from your venue if you've got a brick-and-mortar location. Most local radio and tv stations have a news hotline or tip line on their website. Local websites often want stories.Paid local media. Use local newspaper ads, flyers, posters and billboards or targeted digital ads.Education. Find a way to share what you know with prospects and customers. If you run a landscaping business, hold a class on how to select plants. If you're a web designer, hold a class on setting up a business website. Promote it in your email or in any of the ways mentioned above.Be social. Mention your participation on your Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, Pinterest or YouTube (if you have a channel). Talk about yourself and why you're in business. Be personable.

8,How to Remove Negative Reviews Online and Protect Your Online Reputation,"Apr 22, 2024",Scott Bartnick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-remove-negative-reviews-online-and-protect-your/468315,"
One of the biggest challenges businesses face is protecting their online reputation. Now that virtually everyone can access the internet from the convenience of their mobile device, many consumers use online reviews to share their experiences or inform their purchasing decisions. As such, many businesses are looking for new methods of online reputation management to build a positive online reputation.A strategic narrative is one of the most important tools a brand needs to survive challenges to its online reputation. A strategic narrative defines the brand's identity, values and purpose, which should drive every interaction the brand has with its customers. If a business's online presence and interactions with its customers don't align with this narrative, it could harm the company's online reputation.How online reviews affect your brand reputationReviews are extremely powerful to a brand's online image in both directions. Positive reviews create word-of-mouth recommendations that could attract new customers. On the other hand, bad online reviews can scare customers away — and even those who aren't scared away could view your brand negatively. 



However, while negative reviews are just as critical as positive content to a business, illegitimate negative reviews can be used in an attempt to destroy a business's positive reputation. These fake reviews, whether created by bots or a party breaking the review platform's terms of service (for instance, previous employees or a competitor), can have a disproportionately negative impact on the brand's reputation if left unchecked.Related: Your Online Reputation Is Powerful — Use These Methods to Enhance and Protect It.


How to remove fake online reviews to build a good reputationThankfully, most online review sites realize the unfair negative consequences of these fake reviews and allow businesses to flag and remove illegitimate reviews. As a business owner, platforms like Google and Trustpilot let you log in to your admin panel and report the review as breaking the platform's terms of service.  Generally speaking, these platforms all work similarly and are good about removing illegitimate reviews. For Google, it may take a few reports as different moderators may come to different conclusions about the legitimacy of the review. Trustpilot has premium support — sometimes even going so far as to track the IP address associated with the review to see if it is the registered address of a competitor. Employee review services like Glassdoor are an exception, where it can be much harder to get reviews removed because of the nature of these sites. While these steps are practical for illegitimate review management, they are not advisable for legitimate reviews. Even if you manage to get a legitimate review removed from a site successfully, that will leave the customer even more angry and likely to take action against your reputation, as you will not be seen as trustworthy. Instead, when facing legitimate negative reviews, respond to them in an ethical and well-thought-out way.Related: Don't Fall Victim to a Digital Hitman — Here Are 6 Ways to Protect Your Online Reputation From Fake Reviews


How to address legitimate negative online reviews to manage your reputationWhen dealing with legitimate negative reviews, all reputation management firms will tell you the same thing: having a crisis management strategy in place is essential. Although online content might not seem like a major crisis, it can balloon out of control if you don't know how to handle it. If you don't respond appropriately, you could escalate and worsen the situation, ruining your online brand image. Remember, with negative reviews, you're dealing with someone who is already unhappy with your company, so it is crucial to respond quickly to remedy the situation. Ideally, you can help the customer reach a resolution that encourages them to delete or at least adjust their review upwards. The first step in dealing with a legitimate negative review is to identify the root cause of the issue. If the reviewer left their name or contact info on their profile or in their review, find their order or account with you and identify what went wrong.Sometimes, the reviews you receive will be anonymous, in this case, your best option is to reply with a point of contact to reach out to so that they can provide more details. It's a good idea to apologize that they feel negatively but not admit fault — you are still unsure of the details.Once you have identified the party who left the negative review, try to remedy the solution. Generally, this means giving them a chance to improve their experience. For service-based companies, an ideal resolution might be a free month of your service or reassigning the customer to a different team, depending on the issue they experienced. For restaurants, the best course of action is probably inviting them back to have another meal on the house.


How to proactively approach online reputation managementThe best way to deal with negative reviews is to prevent them proactively. Of course, you won't be able to leave every single customer satisfied, but not every unhappy customer will leave a bad review. Strategies like transparent communication and authenticity across platforms can help prevent unhappy customers from becoming so disgruntled that they write negative reviews. Furthermore, you should conduct online reputation monitoring for any brand mentions. There are specialized software business leaders can use to monitor mentions of their company's name online. However, the ""DIY"" method of social listening — by using search engines and setting Google or social media alerts with the name as the keyword to flag relevant search results — is also an effective way of being notified when a customer has said something about the business. These alerts can allow you to respond to negative comments about your company in a timely manner. Although it's not always possible to remove negative online reviews, there are other tried and true methods for repairing and restoring your business's online reputation through effective crisis management. By actively engaging with your audience, implementing constructive feedback, and showcasing your commitment to customer satisfaction, you can gradually rebuild trust and improve your digital footprint. Remember, every challenge is an opportunity to demonstrate your dedication to excellence and to turn a negative situation into a positive outcome for your brand.Related: 9 Steps for Building a Reputation Management Plan That Wins Customers and Gives You an Edge

9,The SEC's New Climate Transparency Rules Mean Sustainability Isn't Just a Buzzword Anymore — Here's How to Embrace It.,"Apr 22, 2024",Christine Wetzler,https://www.entrepreneur.com/green-entrepreneur/what-the-secs-new-climate-transparency-rules-mean-for-you/470994,"
Discussing sensitive topics can be challenging for business owners. This is one of the top three or four reasons I receive initial calls for public relations assistance addressing a hot-button issue. The latest confusing trend is sustainability and how to talk about it openly. Surprisingly, people need clarification about how much to talk about it, why it's important and when to bring it up. There's even a new word for this fear: ""greenhushing.""The most recent bit of pressure on companies regarding eco-messaging is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) recent efforts to enforce regulations that protect investors and maintain market integrity. Basically, the SEC has revised environmental transparency rules and introduced mandatory climate risk disclosures for public companies.This is the first time a sustainability mandate has emerged nationally, and it's expected to have a notable impact. In my opinion, even for private companies, it's a call to pay attention and stop neglecting this discussion.



We are entering an era where climate objectives, targets and governance frameworks will become mandatory in corporate reporting. This shift also aligns with the increasing consumer demand for environmentally and ethically sustainable products — a trend that, despite its popularity, has seen many companies struggle to translate into tangible demand.Related: Sustainability for Entrepreneurs — Why It Matters (and How to Achieve It).


The paradox of consumer demand and greenwashingConsumers' enthusiasm for sustainable products often starkly contrasts with their actual purchasing behavior. While surveys indicate a robust desire for sustainability, sales frequently need to catch up to expectations for new, environmentally conscious products. This discrepancy is exacerbated by greenwashing — where claims of environmental stewardship are not backed by practice — further eroding consumer trust and complicating the landscape for genuine initiatives.I'd counsel any company today to prepare for sustainability discussions and engagement. It is now an unavoidable topic. Because I have been a fractional CMO and external public relations consultant since 2002, I've received many calls from companies facing these watershed moments. Here is the advice I'd give a leadership team aiming to be more vocal about sustainability.The imperative of transparencyIn this context, the necessity for transparency is undeniable. Beyond mere regulatory compliance, transparency is crucial for cultivating consumer trust and loyalty. Companies must now proactively measure and refine their approaches to climate change, so this journey has got to start with a comprehensive understanding of your environmental footprint, including greenhouse gas emissions, resource utilization and waste generation.Typically facilitated by external consultants or an internal sustainability team, this foundational assessment is critical for setting realistic sustainability goals and improvement strategies. Employing standardized tools and frameworks like the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and Life Cycle Assessment provides a methodical approach to this task and will result in data and benchmarks you can use consistently in your messaging efforts.


Armed with this data, specific and time-bound goals can be set that meet compliance requirements (if necessary) and drive significant environmental and social improvements. Engaging stakeholders, particularly employees, at this stage, helps bring to the surface any practical concerns and integrate these insights into the goal-setting process.Related: 70% of Consumers Say They'll Buy 'Green' Products, but Only 5% Actually Do. That's Due to a Common Marketing Mistake By Eco-Friendly Brands.The role of public relations in implementationPublic relations in the realm of sustainable messaging goes beyond just issuing press releases. PR is a strategic tool for amplifying and embedding climate-change initiatives into the corporate ethos. Compelling storytelling highlighting a company's progress and impacts on sustainability can significantly boost its reputation and foster third-party credibility.Leveraging various channels — from press releases and social media to comprehensive sustainability reports — enables these stories to reach and resonate with a broad audience, sparking engagement and advancing the sustainability agenda.


Cultivating a sustainability-centric culture internally is essential. Companies can ensure that sustainability principles are deeply ingrained in every aspect of their operation through regular educational programs, active participation in sustainability initiatives and acknowledgment of individual and team contributions. This not only reinforces the company's commitment to sustainability among employees but also mobilizes them and other stakeholders as ambassadors of these values.Continuous monitoring and evaluation of sustainability initiatives and how they are being perceived in public are vital measurement points to consider when assessing progress. Like any meaningful initiative, setting and tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) allow companies to measure effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. Further, engaging with employees and stakeholders through feedback will enrich this process and provide real-world insights.It seems counterintuitive, but in my experience, challenge is often in partnership with opportunity. Tackling tough subjects can uncover opportunities for innovation, stakeholder engagement and corporate accountability that otherwise would've been dormant. Talking specifically about sustainability is not always about compliance. It is a chance to appeal to buyers and lead the market with integrity, innovation and vision.

11,94% of Customers Say a Bad Review Made Them Avoid Buying From a Brand. Try These 4 Techniques to Protect Your Brand Reputation.,"Apr 19, 2024",Scott Keever,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-ways-to-protect-your-brand-reputation-from-bad-reviews/471818,"
Protecting your online reputation means more now than ever before. Roughly 94% of customers claim that a negative review has convinced them not to purchase from a brand. This indicates that ""bad"" comments can be problematic for business owners, but there are ways to approach them and turn them around to be more positive.At some point, you'll have to deal with negative customer comments online and must learn to respond to criticism effectively. There are countless techniques out there, but here are the ones we've used with great success at Keever SEO, taking our cue from some of the most popular brands.Related: Why You Must Monitor Your Online Reputation Before it Hurts You



1. Creating a separate support handleAs our brand grew, we struggled to complete our daily tasks. Conducting competitor research, mastering content marketing and sending out customer support emails made managing our online reputation challenging. One way we combatted that issue was by creating separate support handles, which is similar to what Nike did.Nike created a separate Twitter (now X) account (@NikeSupport) dedicated solely to handling customer questions and complaints. We used our company name and it's working well. The goal is to keep customer questions and comments in a single place. This helps you respond to your loyal fans quickly and efficiently, but it also reduces the risk of negativity in other feeds.


For example, our clients' Facebook pages often get flooded with questions and sometimes even negativity, as their customers need help to reach out. Once we added a separate X handle for support, everyone knew they could go there for queries and concerns. We recommend that you create a separate support handle for your brand. It doesn't take much time to complete, and it will make it easier to find and address negative comments.2. Using humor to respond to criticismWhile creating a separate handle for support is beneficial, we still found that some customers were a bit standoffish. Since we were focused on being funny, warm and welcoming, we took inspiration from the Joe Dough Sandwich Shop in NYC and sometimes used humor to deal with criticism.Humor should only be used for criticisms when the complaint isn't severe, and it's only appropriate if it matches your brand's tone and style. It's quite easy to trigger a backlash of unhappy customers if you aren't taking things seriously.When done well, humor diffuses a challenging and awkward situation. Joe Dough Sandwich Shop used this style to respond to a bad review on Yelp. The intelligent comment created a funny moment and boosted the brand's profile online. After a Yelp user complained that the meatball sandwich was the worst he'd ever had, the shop wrote about it on the chalkboard menu out front. People were commenting about how funny it was, which created more engagement.


If you plan to use humor to deal with complaints, we recommend doing it only when it makes sense. A comment of one sentence, such as ""this sandwich sucked,"" might fare well with a funny response, but someone who is raging over many paragraphs will likely need a more respectful and thought-out response.Related: What is Google Saying? Why a Positive Brand Reputation Online is So Important3. Showing that you're competentSometimes, a customer is angry so a polite response won't calm them. This has happened to us before, and it's disheartening to read those types of comments. However, ignoring them won't help — it might actually make things worse.One time, a person claimed our client offered terrible customer service. They went into great detail about their package deal and how they didn't assist them in making the arrangements they promised on the website. Ultimately, they were mistaken because the client didn't actually guarantee those things that were listed on the site.


We recommended that the client thank the person for their comment, directly address the issue and explain how they would fix the problem in the future so that no one else would be upset.Why did that work? Overall, we realized that viewers would see the person's comment and response and realize they were unreasonable. Though we appeased the original commenter by answering them, we also indicated to others that we were competent enough to handle all types of queries.4. Avoiding canned responses (even though it's easier)Investing in online reputation management is essential for all types of businesses, whether you're running a startup, a small company or a large corporation. You may think shortcuts like artificial intelligence (AI) are often a great way to respond to people's questions and needs, though they have their limits.You've likely heard of chatbots, which answer a customer's question without needing the human touch. It works well for traditional FAQs and other things but is not ideal for complaints.


When we observed clients switch from a human responder to a chatbot for review responses, we discovered that everything sounded canned (because it was). Though this isn't necessarily bad in some situations, it doesn't work for complaints because people want to feel heard.We then recommended that humans write the comments using scripts, but that still didn't work. Canned responses sound dull and often upset the commenter more. Therefore, it's always wise to have a real person craft the words. It might not be perfect, but it will offer a personalized touch.Related: Why Investing in Reputation Management is Crucial for Your Business StrategyThe bottom lineThough many tools are available to help you manage your online reputation, it's all about how you react to people's comments. There are bound to be negative reviews periodically, and you must decide how to respond.


Humor and sarcasm can be great comeback options. However, those only work when the issue isn't severe. Likewise, creating a separate support handle can be helpful because it keeps all the negativity or queries in one spot.Overall, you want to respond quickly to negative comments, avoid canned responses and explain how you'll address the issues customers bring up. Doing these things (and implementing any changes) shows that you care about the consumer and their experiences.Whether you use online reputation management tools, hire a separate staff member to write responses or tackle the job alone, acting quickly and responding professionally is crucial.

12,5 Must-Try Real Estate Marketing Ideas That Will Attract Buyers,"Apr 18, 2024",Jessica Wong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/5-must-try-real-estate-marketing-ideas-that-will-attract/471592,"
Real estate agents depend on powerful marketing strategies to engage buyers and close sales. In the age of digital marketing, for-sale signs on front lawns are no longer enough to convince sellers to choose a particular agent and to attract homebuyers. Technology-based marketing strategies like content marketing can set agents apart in a crowded marketplace and help them grow their businesses.Content marketing in the real estate sector is about more than pitching properties to potential buyers. As an integral part of a comprehensive marketing strategy, this approach ""provides useful and relevant content to your prospects and customers.""The goal is to establish relationships that will eventually lead to sales. Content marketing helps build brand awareness, allows leading real estate agents to establish their authority within the sector, and generates leads.



By pursuing content marketing, real estate professionals grow their reputation and lay the foundation for future sales.Related: How To Build a Strong Real Estate Brand Online and Increase Trust With Clients


1. Identify target audiences and buyer personasBefore disseminating content, real estate businesses must define their target audiences and buyer personas. Without that step, the information risks getting lost and potentially alienating its audience.For example, a young family looking to purchase their first home will look for different information than a couple of empty-nesters looking to downsize once their kids have left home. Real estate firms may be targeting both market segments. However, to reach them effectively, they must tailor their messages and choose their marketing channels wisely.Determining audiences and personas goes beyond demographics. The most effective marketers understand their audiences' interests and address their pain points.Related: Know Your Audience, Conquer the Market — The Importance of Buyer Personas in Franchise Marketing


2. Create compelling visual contentThe term content marketing is often used synonymously with blogs and social media posts. However, visual content often has a greater impact when it comes to showcasing property.High-quality images of an apartment or a house are the most basic form of visual content. Virtual tours or drone videos can attract even more attention and capture potential buyers' imagination.Both options allow real estate agents to tell a story rather than sell a property. Imagine discovering a property for the first time: put yourself in the viewer's position and tell the story of their journey in a video. Another creative option would be to stage a day in the life of a family in their new home, highlighting how this particular property meets their needs.3. Leverage video marketingIn recent years, video marketing has been one of the main growth areas within content marketing. Explainer video company Wyzowl found in a survey that more than 90% of businesses used video as a marketing tool, and just under 90% considered it an important part of their content marketing strategy.


In 2023 In the United States alone, businesses are likely to spend nearly $85 billion on video advertising in 2024, an increase of 9.9% compared to 2023. Consumers have embraced video content, too.Regarding real estate, videos can simply showcase a property better than still images. No matter how many images an agent or a photographer takes, they may miss an element of tying those images together. Aside from walkthroughs, neighborhood tours and client testimonials also make for exciting video content.Interactive and virtual content are taking these developments one step further. Innovative applications can help real estate professionals create tours that allow viewers to choose the direction they move in when viewing a property online.Related: 3 Emerging Trends Shaping the Future of Real Estate


4. Blogging and thought leadershipSo far, this article has focused on visual content, but it would be wrong to discount written content for a real estate agent's content marketing strategy. Blogs and thought leadership pieces allow companies and their key team members to establish themselves as experts in their field.Depending on target audiences, content covering market trends, sharing homebuying tips, or offering guides to specific neighborhoods can work very well. The key to successful blogs and leadership pieces is understanding what the audience wants. Ask yourself what information your potential buyers cannot find elsewhere, think about their pain points, and address those.5. Social mediaFew content marketing strategies would be complete without the inclusion of social media channels. Social media platforms offer estate agents a chance to connect directly to their customers, distribute content, and engage with their audiences.Social media offers excellent opportunities to share visual and written content that may otherwise have remained undiscovered. To harness the power of social media effectively, estate agencies need to ensure that the platform's and the content's audiences are well matched. Facebook may be the most popular platform for real estate agents now, but this may change as different generations enter the property market. Aside from platform choice, consistency is another critical component of a successful social media marketing strategy.


How to measure success and iterationOne of the biggest advantages of digital marketing channels over their more traditional counterparts is the ability to measure success.Start by defining the key performance indicators that you want to measure. For videos, this could be the number of views or comments. For blog posts, it could be comments and shares or a growth in traffic to your website.Not every content piece will be highly effective. Regular performance assessment and measurement allow real estate agents to adapt and iterate their content to make it even more relevant for their audiences.Content marketing is a highly cost-effective part of a real estate agent's marketing strategy that can help create and increase brand awareness and build relationships with key audiences. Both visual and written content can deliver excellent results in the real estate sector. To further improve the impact of a campaign, real estate marketers need to measure the performance of their content and fine-tune their approach as necessary.

Later, after her 10-year-old son was exposed to pesticides and suffered brain and immune system damage, she took another hard look at environmental factors that might contribute to healing.""His immune system had been so damaged that he could not detoxify the things we're all exposed to every day,"" Nelson says, ""and he would have extreme reactions. I took one box and thought, Oh, I'll keep my favorite perfumes in here, favorite skincare products and things, in the closet, and when he gets better, I will bring them back out."" However, according to Nelson, the box's removal made such a significant difference that it showed her ""how important it is to [recognize] how powerful these chemicals are."" Nelson's son started to heal, and when word of mouth spread, she developed a course to help other people better understand the products in their homes.

Diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, Evans was told by doctors that ""no lifestyle change"" could help her heal and to take birth control indefinitely; in college, she faced a range of symptoms — muscle aches, loss of motor skills and more — and says she was prescribed numerous medications to no avail. At the time, Evans and her aunt Marilee weren't particularly close, but she consulted with her and realized that some simple lifestyle changes just might help her feel better.According to Evans, removing certain products with synthetic ingredients and eating whole foods did help her condition improve, and as graduation neared, she decided to spend eight weeks with Nelson in the Texas Hill Country, where she'd learn more about healthy living from her aunt. Her friend Kelly joined her, and despite being in good health, also noticed a transformation — ""My dry itchy eyes, headaches, muscle aches are all gone,"" Love recalls, adding, ""the more I learned about all this, it just made sense to me: Of course, the type of fuel we put in our bodies matters for how we feel, how we think, how we act.""

The organization also notes that even naturally occurring fragrances, such as citrus, ""can react to produce dangerous pollutants indoors.""


""Nontoxic"" labels on products aren't the be-all and end-all either, Nelson notes. After all, ""it's the dose that makes the poison,"" as the Swiss physician and chemist Paracelsus said nearly 500 years ago. According to Nelson, looking at the ingredients themselves is key. The founders want people to feel empowered to examine any product — from Branch Basics or another company — and understand the ingredients being used. To that end, they offer a $99 ""Toss the Toxins"" course to ""walk you through a step-by-step process to remove products that pollute your home and body.""Related: Go Green Or Go Home: 3 Ways Industrial Facilities Can Clean Up Their Acts""Our 32-ounce liquid concentrate cleans your windows, cleans your baby's bottom, cleans your produce.""Branch Basics' ""minimalist"" product line is meant to make the whole process easier — and save time.

It's so safe it can be used on the skin.""


""Our 32-ounce liquid concentrate cleans your windows, cleans your baby's bottom, cleans your produce, takes off your eye makeup, cleans your countertops [or] your hardwood floors — whatever depending on the the ratio,"" Evans adds.The approach is resonating with customers, the company reports. Gross sales grew around 42% year over year from 2022 to 2023, with revenue hitting $40 million last year. The company currently has more than 50,000 product subscribers, 600,000 email subscribers and 10,000 five-star reviews on its concentrate and Oxygen Boost, which amplifies the power of the concentrate ""for tough cleaning jobs.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Branch Basics""We know that human health is our priority... [that] keeps everything aligned.""The company's laser-focused commitment to its customers — it reportedly responds to every single customer question on Instagram and TikTok — no doubt fosters a lot of that brand loyalty.

15,How New Businesses Can Create a Content Marketing Strategy,"Apr 18, 2024",Daria Gonzalez,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/8-things-tech-startups-must-do-before-creating-a-content/463170,"
Wherever you are in your business journey, you'll need a content strategy to communicate with external and internal audiences — whether they're potential customers, new employees or other industry experts. As your business grows, your content strategy will naturally evolve. Using the tips below — which range from launching a content strategy plan to optimizing for audience growth — you can prepare for that evolution.Getting Started1. Build your strategy from the ground upInvesting in content creation might not feel like a priority when you're just starting out, but the impact of a well-executed strategy can be immense. If you have a limited marketing budget, content is a cost-effective way to reach your target audience compared to paid advertising.Moreover, it can showcase traction with potential customers. If you're courting investors, the success of your content can be used as proof of the popularity of your product. You will also benefit from early audience discovery by monitoring how your customers respond to your messaging, thus gaining a better understanding of what resonates with them.



2. Avoid shortcutsIf you fail to create a strategy from scratch, you'll risk producing inconsistent messaging. Instead of a haphazard approach, start with a concept the whole company can buy into. Don't assume you know your audience intimately; gather data to build a comprehensive understanding of who you're aiming to reach so you can create content that resonates. As you grow, monitor which methods are working or failing. Then, you can make informed decisions about your strategy based on performance.3. Understand your audienceThere are two approaches to use when defining your target audience. The problem-solving approach considers your customers' pain points and how your brand's solution is different from your competitors. The customer-persona approach is about creating a hypothetical representation of your brand's ideal customer based on research and data. By understanding your customers' motivations and needs, you can tailor your messaging and offerings to better meet those needs and stand out from the competition.Related: How Buyer Personas Can Transform Your Marketing and Get Results4. Look inward, not outwardA robust content strategy begins with looking at your own brand, not at your competitors'. Make sure you're answering these questions when building out your strategy:What's your business vision and mission? This relates to your company's values, culture and purpose.How would you describe your brand's personality? This pertains to the human characteristics attributed to your brand.How would you define your brand's voice? This is about how your brand sounds to customers.Being able to definitively answer these questions will help you express your brand value to external audiences.5. Know your value proposition and unique sales propositionsOnly after you've studied your company's internal characteristics is it time to look outward and see how you compare to competitors. Your value proposition and unique sales propositions (USPs) will help form the basis of your content strategy. Your value proposition is based on information about what your competitors are offering. It's important to understand their strengths and weaknesses so you can articulate why your brand offers a better solution. Your unique sales propositions augment the value proposition by defining the specific features and benefits that make your products stand out.


6. Establish realistic and measurable goalsYour business goals will inform the goals of your content strategy. To help set strategic goals, start with a realistic planning time frame. For example, six months gives you enough time to gain momentum, test out different hypotheses and track performance. A long-term approach helps you focus on building a solid foundation instead of looking for quick results. Content can take a while to ramp up, but if you approach it with a long-term perspective, you'll eventually reap the benefits.7. Transition from content strategy to content planWhen executing your plan, one of the first steps is identifying your priority marketing channels — which will be determined by what your research has told you about your audience. These channels may include your website, email, various social media platforms or even mailers. Then, it's time to map your content-posting schedule to an editorial calendar, keeping in mind the themes that most resonate with your audience. By creating a content calendar, you can ensure that your content is consistent, relevant and serves your overall goals.8. Measure, track and optimize contentA data-driven approach is essential. By tracking your strategy's performance, you can see trends and tweak accordingly to improve the traction of your content. Depending on your goals, you'll need to measure key performance indicators (KPIs), including website traffic, social engagement, conversion rates and lead generation. Here's the case for data-driven content marketing success:With data, you can make more informed decisions about your content and improve how you're targeting your audience.Data helps you better understand your customer's journey and develop more personalized content that speaks to their specific needs.By understanding what's working and what's not, you can avoid spending time and money on content that doesn't perform well.Data helps you optimize your content distribution strategy to reach your target audience with the right message at the right time.Data can help you track progress over time and see how your content marketing efforts impact the bottom line.Related: 7 Crucial Metrics to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Your Marketing CampaignsTypes of ContentThe difference between content and content marketingOn the internet, content is anything that expresses thoughts, information or experiences through written, visual or audio media. The photos uploaded to Instagram are content. The videos uploaded to YouTube are content. This article is content.Content marketing, on the other hand, is a strategic approach to marketing that emphasizes the creation and delivery of valuable information or ideas to attract, retain and convert a clearly defined audience.Content marketing can take many forms — email, social media, case studies and blogs — but it's differentiated from mere content by strategically providing solutions to your audience's problems — with the goal of raising the profile of your company and its products or solutions. If you're putting your audience first, addressing pain points and producing exceptional content, then you'll grow your brand while also cultivating authority and trust. That's content marketing.The difference between thought leadership and content marketingThought leadership garners a lot of attention among entrepreneurs and those aiming to pick up more traction and increase brand recognition. Content marketing serves a similar purpose, but many people are unsure what the differences between the two are. The four primary factors that differentiate them are as follows:


Content marketing is top-down. Typically, content marketers are businesses talking to potential customers or clients. Thought leadership, on the other hand, is peer-to-peer. The objective of content marketing strategies is ultimately to sell a product or service. With thought leadership, the primary goal is not to sell but rather to create a business relationship.Big ideas matter. Although content marketing aims to provide value to readers, thought leaders must offer something groundbreaking. If you call yourself a thought leader, you must present deeper insights than your competitors.Thought leadership is higher in the sales funnel. Thought leadership is often deployed by large organizations selling high-ticket items in a complex and long-lasting sales process. When thought leadership is deployed, the central objective is to make an impression that presents the author and their company as experts.Content marketing is published on your platforms. Thought leadership is often published in industry publications, which means the writing style tends to be less promotional.What is premium content?Premium content is any content format meant to be higher quality, more in-depth or more valuable than what you typically produce. Some of the most common examples of premium content include ebooks, white papers, original research and online courses. This is the type of content your audience might pay for while they could read a blog post for free. Producing these valuable content types might help you generate leads, as people are more willing to volunteer their information if they gain access to high-quality content like a white paper.What is snackable content?Snackable content is uncomplicated and short-form content that can be digested quickly — like a snack. Its origins stem from social media, where infographics, memes, GIFs and reels now dominate user feeds. It doesn't require effort from users to read or engage with, but it also can provide awareness of your business.Because of its ability to capture users' attention, snackable content on your website — maybe via an infographic, listicle or fun quiz — can drive users to your website and keep them there. Snackable content is also mobile-friendly, which can draw larger audiences. It can even improve your search engine optimization (SEO) strategy, helping more people find you in the first place.Driving EngagementWhat is quality content?Quality should always be your top content priority. Search engines like Google reward helpful, reliable, people-first content, but even more importantly, quality content significantly affects your readers and customers. Content should be original and easy to read with no spelling or grammatical issues. It should also be relevant and timeless. When it comes to SEO, consider these critical factors:Traits of quality contentLength: In general, blog posts and articles should be 1,000 to 3,000 words. Landing pages or description pages perform better at 300 to 500 words.Structure: Format your content using title (H1) and subheader (H2 and greater) tags. This semantic structure boosts your SEO score.Links: Linking to internal and authoritative external webpages increases traffic and performance.Keywords (and keyword density): Using keywords relevant to your topic is critical. But be careful. A keyword density that is too high can lower your SEO ranking (experts generally recommend a density between 1% and 2%).Usefulness: Create content that features original research with comprehensive insights that go beyond what else will appear in search results.Meta title and description: A catchy meta title and description that includes your primary keyword or phrase will attract readers.How to optimize quality controlBe sure to review each piece of content before it's published. This takes time, but it's essential to consistently produce quality work. Follow these guidelines for each piece of published content:Organize your workflow: Use tools that allow you to manage content formats and run it through a pipeline of drafting, editing, revising and publishing. Involve other team members in the workflow to ensure enough people see each piece of content.Avoid plagiarism: Plagiarism isn't just an ethical or quality concern; search engine algorithms downgrade pilfered content. Use plagiarism checkers to ensure your content is unique.Eliminate spelling and grammar mistakes: Ideally, you should hire an editor to proofread your content and catch typos, syntax, diction and grammatical errors. If you don't have an editor, take advantage of online tools. Many products can help you clean up your writing.How to create viral contentMany brands want their content to go viral, but whether this happens or not is out of their control. There's no switch you can flip that will create a viral moment, but these seven factors will give your content better odds of taking off:High emotions: According to a study from the Journal of Marketing Research, content that leaves readers awe-inspired, excited, angry or amused is more likely to be shared than low-arousal content that evokes contentment or sadness.Practicality: Useful and educational content is also more likely to go viral, as people enjoy sharing this type of content for altruistic reasons. This is part of the reason that ""how-to"" lists perform so well.Readability: Your content might contain groundbreaking information, but it's useless if it's too dense. Run your work through a readability test and aim for a reading comprehension level of an eighth grader.Power words: Inserting power words with emotional triggers into your title and introduction will help hook your audience and get them to share the content. Here's a list with more than 800 examples.Trustworthiness: People share credible content. You can build trust in your content by quoting experts in your field and citing statistics and sources.Visual appeal: As with readability, layout matters. Readers typically want easy-to-navigate websites with clean designs and consistent visual elements.Timeliness: When you post is as important as what you post. Research your audience's behavior and site traffic so you can deliver and promote valuable content during peak hours.Content promotion tipsReaching a large audience requires you to devote resources to promoting your work — on social media channels, through email and elsewhere. Although the content itself is the bedrock of your marketing strategy, promotion is also paramount.The case for content promotion:Good content is useless in a vacuum. If you've just launched a blog, people won't find it unless you spend at least some time and money on promotion. Because of this, early-stage content promotion is essential.Promotion is (arguably) less expensive than creation. When you pay for content creation, you're taking a bit of a gamble because there's no guarantee that your content will function as intended. But when you pay on a per-click basis for advertising, you practically guarantee a stream of visitors to your website.Promotion can maximize your creation investment. Even if you have only a few pieces of content, continued adaptation and promotional investment can help you reap more value from your content creation over time.Keys to being successful in content marketing:Start with a strong foundation. If your blog is empty or if its content is hard to understand, no promotional strategy in the world will be able to salvage it. At a minimum, you should have at least a few strong resources on your website that people perceive as authoritative and trustworthy.Promote strategically. You don't need to spend large amounts of money to see results as long as you're strategic. Focus on platforms where you've traditionally seen strong engagement, or exclusively promote content that is already well-received by your followers.Learn and adapt. Perhaps most importantly, you must study your content marketing metrics to learn which of your investments is paying off. Is your content creation investment seeing a better return than your promotional investment? If you can answer this question, you can make better content marketing decisions.Refining Your ApproachAs your marketing strategy evolves, it's important to implement tools and strategies that will make content production more efficient and, ultimately, more lucrative. You don't need to have every tool and strategy in place on day one, but it's important to refine your operation as you grow.


Content marketing toolsThere are countless tools and software products for marketers — some of which are more essential than others. To help you determine what you actually need, here are nine of the most important types of content marketing tools:Content management system (CMS): WordPress is perhaps the most well-known CMS, but many platforms allow you to manage online content and give access to contributors. A good CMS lets content teams create content without needing to be a coding expert.Customer relationship management system (CRM): A CRM is used to manage a company's relationships and ultimately close more business. Several companies offer CRMs, including Salesforce, HubSpot and Marketo, but you'll need to do significant research before selecting the right option.Email marketing platform: It's essential to be able to reach your customers with email — via a regular newsletter or one-off updates. A good email marketing platform will offer CRM integration, allow you to manage customer and prospect information and track key metrics, such as click-through and open rates.Marketing automation system: Several aspects of marketing, including social media posts, email and lead generation, can be automated with the right software. Ideally, it should also be easy to use and integrate with your CRM and other tools.Key performance indicator tracker: KPIs are the most important metrics that your business strategy is being measured against, like revenue, contact form submissions, inbound leads and more. You can create your own with a spreadsheet or use a pre-made tracker.Project management software: Project management software is used for project planning, content workflow scheduling and allocating resources. Asana, Monday and Trello are some options, but you can also create your own system.Design software: Creative work often requires some sort of graphic design, and using software such as Canva or Adobe will be key. With the right design tools, you can ensure your visual content captures your audience's attention.Analytics software: You'll need an analytics tool to report how your content channels perform and how your campaigns influence revenue. Without one, you won't have data to track your KPIs. Google Analytics is perhaps the most well-known tool, but there are plenty of others to choose from.Social media management software: A social media management platform provides an efficient way to create and schedule posts across a variety of social channels. HubSpot, Hootsuite and Buffer are a few of the more well-known tools, but there are many others.How to write compelling content that convertsOnline readers are bombarded with information and selective about the content they consume. The way you write has a major impact on if you'll attract an audience. Your content should provide valuable information and answers to consumers and needs to strike a tone that connects with them.To accomplish this, follow these two pillars of great website content:Use a conversational tone: Focusing on conversational content throughout your website copy can help you open an ongoing dialogue with your followers, improve brand awareness and encourage engagement. This is why you see businesses incorporating user-generated content like customer feedback, testimonials and snippets from reviews on their websites — it backs up the claims they make about their product or service.Incorporate storytelling: Every aspect of online marketing goes back to storytelling. People love good stories. You can have an excellent product, service and team, but if you're not able to tell a good story about your company, you'll lose out on your audience. This might include your origin story, a testimonial from an employee or an example of how your product changed someone's life.Content monetization strategiesAlthough content marketing efforts can build awareness and ultimately lead to sales, they can also be a revenue driver on their own. If you're writing blog posts, recording a podcast or live streaming on a regular basis, you can use most of these strategies to make money:Direct advertising: If you're producing enough content, you'll likely be able to sell ads. It's a simple strategy, but be careful: Your audience might not appreciate being inundated with ads.Sponsorships/affiliate links: With sponsorships, you'll make money by talking about specific products or featuring someone else's content for free. With affiliate links in your content, you'll generate revenue as a percentage of the sales you influence.Donations: Platforms like Patreon make it easy for content creators to accept donations for their continued work, and platforms like Twitch have a built-in donation option.Premium content: You can also make money with optional premium content that's more in-depth or exclusive than your typical work. Bloggers often provide premium content in the form of an ebook or collection.Subscriptions: Depending on the nature of your content, readers might be interested in an ad-free experience via a paid subscription. A subscription could also grant your audience access to an entirely different content feed.Merchandise: If you have a large following, selling products like shirts, hats or mugs with your branding can generate revenue and give you a platform for free advertising.Exclusive rights: If your content gains a big enough audience, a platform might pay you to use its platform exclusively, preventing its competition from capitalizing. These deals are rare but lucrative.Now that you understand the basics of creating — and implementing — a content marketing program, it's time to produce and promote your work. Conduct research to understand your audience, use analytics to measure your goals and use the tools and strategies in this guide to help you along the way. Soon, your content strategy will be firing on all cylinders.

16,"A Step-by-Step Guide on How to Make Money With Facebook Ads, According to Experts","Apr 17, 2024",R.L. Adams,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-make-money-with-facebook-ads/305380,"
It's hard to know exactly what will work on Facebook these days. The world's largest social media platform — owned by and rebranded as Meta — is constantly updating its algorithms and policies, which can create uncertainty for content creators and advertisers. However, with more than 3 billion users, Facebook offers a unique opportunity to drive traffic to your website, boost awareness for your business and grow your online audience.Facebook ads can become a key component of your sales funnel, and when you understand how they work and what strategies perform best, you can create cost-effective campaigns that meet your needs and, ultimately, drive revenue. So, how do you go about doing that? Follow the tips below — which range from audience targeting to budgeting and more — and begin reaping the benefits of advertising on Facebook.How to craft your message.Everyone wants to make money with their Facebook ads, but many people don't know how to craft the right message. By following the ""Feel-Felt-Found"" formula you can create messaging that is both engaging and effective.



Feel: The goal is to connect and show empathy. Let your audience know you understand how they feel – this should address their pain points and the origin of their issue. Let them know that you're solving their problem with your product or service.Felt: The next part in the empathy bridge is to relate that you've felt the same way: You know how they feel because you've felt that way too, and that feeling was the catalyst for the product or service you created to address the problem.Found: This is where you tell the prospects about the solution you found or the origins of the solution. Here, you'll describe something that worked for you or that you've implemented and has worked for others.Businesses big and small have found success using this formula to create ads. For instance, when Dove created Project #ShowUs in 2019 to help women focus on body positivity, they made it a key pillar of their Facebook ad strategy. By creating empathy with their customers, they reached 900,000 people globally and significantly expanded their audience.How to reach your target marketMaking money with Facebook ads requires you to find the right audience. And to do so, it's worth understanding the Pareto Principle, which says that 80% of your results come from 20% of your effort.This principle applies across the board. The majority of your sales will come from 20% of your customers, and 80% of your income will come from 20% of your work. This concept applies to every aspect of your e-commerce business – but to make it work you have to narrow down your audience to 20%. To do that, consider the ""follow-frequent-fund"" formula.Follow: Who do your prospects follow? What do they read? This might be an industry leader, a specific Facebook Group or other business pages. Once you know who they're following, you can use that information to better target your ads.Frequent: The next question to ask yourself is what your prospects frequent, meaning where they go and what they do on a daily basis. Facebook lets you narrow down ads by interests, so understanding this information will be key to your ad-building process.Fund: The final part of the formula is to determine where your prospects are spending their money – this is often where their heart and their passions lie. If you can answer this question, you'll hone in on your target audience with precision.Creating your magnetWhat does your lead magnet — the item or service that you're offering people to grab their attention — look like? Making money with paid ads of any kind involves delivering something of value. This could be a cheat sheet, a checklist or an ebook. Think about something you can deliver that can be read in about 10 to 15 minutes.Make sure that every step of your sales funnel delivers real value.When creating a lead magnet, ask yourself: ""What can I offer the marketplace that will add value?"" To help you figure out the best lead magnet for your business, follow this four-step method that follows the S-A-G-E acronym.


""S"" stands for SHORT. Remember: the lead magnet should be able to be read and understood in 10 or 15 minutes.""A"" stands for ACTIONABLE. Identify the difference between information and insight. Insightful content tells the prospect what to do with the information they're being given in order to achieve a very specific result.""G"" stands for GOAL-ORIENTED. Each piece of content should be goal-oriented. Everyone is looking for a solution that gets them closer to their goals. If you're the one who presents them with the solution, they're going to associate their progress with you. That makes them more likely to come back and spend money with you.""E"" stands for EASY. Everyone wants an easy solution – it has to be simple. How do you determine if it's simple? Ask yourself the following question: ""If I were to give this information to an 8-year-old, could they then apply it to their business?""Create the sales mechanismThe next step in your quest to make money from your ads is to create the sales mechanism, also known as a sales funnel. A sales funnel is the process of finding a prospect and bringing them into your ecosystem to eventually become a customer. What can you put in place so that those people who buy not only know you, but also like your company enough to purchase directly from you? When the prospect is ready to purchase the product or service, the goal is that you have already developed a positive relationship with them so they choose your company over your competitors.Best practices for building the perfect Facebook adThere are a variety of ways to approach the ad-creation process on Facebook. Photos and promotional videos can draw audiences in, but you must also write engaging ad copy that's clear and prompts viewers to take an action. Here are the key elements of a great Facebook ad:Think visually: Hooking users immediately will give your ad a greater chance of driving post engagements. Design something visually impactful by using high-quality photos, bright colors and easy-to-read text. Consider using video ads, too, as they lead to the highest click rates of any format.Be concise: You only need a few words to catch your audience's attention. However, your ad does need to prove your product's value. Be pithy, but tell the audience what your product or service will do for them.Include a clear call to action: You may have created a visually appealing ad, but it won't lead to conversions if you don't tell people where to go. That's where a clear call to action (CTA) comes in. Tell your users you want them to click, download or call today. Because a CTA takes up precious text, it's okay to think outside the box.Facebook ad FAQsHow do I promote my small business on Facebook?Targeted ad campaigns help you reach the right people with your message and increase the chances of it driving engagement. To start, take advantage of Facebook's Audience Insights feature to gain insight into the demographics of your ideal customers.Are Facebook ads worth it in 2024?The short answer? Yes. Facebook can be a great way to promote your business over the next year. While there are many ways to advertise online, Facebook is still one of the most cost-effective advertising methods on the internet.How much does a Facebook ad cost?The cost of an ad varies depending on how many people you want to see it, how long you want it to run and factors including location and audience type. However, you can set both daily and lifetime budgets and Facebook will drive engagement based on those parameters. If your total budget for the ad is $100, consider running it for five days at $20 per day.How do I start a Facebook ad campaign?If you want to start a Facebook ad campaign, you must create a business page and Facebook Business Manager account – but to do this you must already have a personal Facebook page. If you don't, you'll need to create one.Once you've launched your business page, define the objectives for your ad campaign (e.g. driving traffic to your website, getting more likes and followers or maximizing reach). Next, target your audience by age, gender, location, interests and other factors. Once you've completed those steps, create an engaging ad with high-quality visuals, compelling copy and calls to action. Finally, set your ad budget parameters and publish your ad. It will then be reviewed by Facebook and, if approved, it will go live.How do Facebook ads work?Facebook advertisements target users based on their behaviors, interests and other demographic information. When a user sees your ad on their timeline, they'll be measured as part of the ad's reach. If they click on the ad or interact with it (via reacting, commenting or sharing), their behavior will be counted as an engagement. When creating an ad, keep in mind that you can restrict your efforts to Facebook or, using Meta Ads Manager, you can share your ad on Meta's other platforms including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp.


How do Google ads compare to Facebook?With Google Ads, you can target people actively searching for keywords related to your business or product. By contrast, Facebook ads let you target people based on their interests and other demographic information, so visual ads are served to them while they're spending time on social media.The benefit of Facebook is that it enables you to be more selective about the type of person you are trying to reach.Do Facebook ads work for small businesses?Yes. Regardless of the size of your business or daily budget, Facebook can be a powerful tool. You can tailor your ads with precise segmentation to reach the right audience, helping them make more impactful connections and increase awareness of your business.For how long should I run a Facebook ad?The duration of your ads will vary based on audience engagement, but the short answer is you should run ads for as long as they are effective and within your budget. While many advertisers use an interval of one or two weeks to test an ad, Facebook will let you keep a single ad live for as long as 90 days.How do I find my target audience for Facebook ads?Before launching any serious advertising initiative, it's important to conduct market research. Where do your customers live? How old are they? What are their interests? Some of this can be done informally via surveys and direct outreach, but you can also use software like Google Analytics to better understand your audience demographics. Once you've done this, you can target your Facebook advertising efforts accordingly.How do I measure the success of my Facebook ads?The best way to measure the success of an ad campaign is by tracking its performance with Facebook Audience Insights. This tool will help you measure impressions, clicks, conversion rate and more to determine which ads are performing best and providing the most value. As your advertising strategy evolves, you can determine your KPIs — such as cost-per-click or engagement rate.What is a good budget for running Facebook ads?There's no one-size-fits-all budget recommendation, as you can launch a Facebook ad spending as little as five dollars per day. The more you spend, the more people you'll reach, and those figures largely depend on the size of your business. However, it's worth testing your ads with a small budget before allocating more money to any campaign. Determine what works best and invest from there.What is the average return on ad spend for a Facebook campaign?The average return on ad spend (ROAS) for a Facebook campaign can vary depending on your target audience and how well your ads perform. Generally, you should aim to get a ROAS of at least one to five times — meaning you're earning back the amount you spent to run the campaigns. To calculate your ROAS, divide your total profit by the amount you spent on running the ad.Phrases to avoid in Facebook adsFacebook's advertising policies can seem awfully opaque, as there are certain topics and words that may lead to your ad being rejected. Worse, your ad account could be suspended if you have too many rejected ads. If you're running ads about politics or social issues, you must get your page verified and confirm your identity with Facebook. Even if your ad doesn't have any content about politics or social issues, there are a few phrases and writing styles you should avoid.


Too many personal attributes: The Facebook algorithm will penalize you for using too much ""you"" or ""your"" language. Essentially, they don't want you to make assumptions about people based on their attributes. While a few instances of ""you"" and ""your"" may be permissible, Facebook's transparency center recommends you limit the use of this type of language. For instance, the following phrase may be rejected for making assumptions about motherhood: ""Are you a busy mom with no time to make healthy meals for your family?""Capital letters and exclamation points: You don't want to ""yell"" at potential customers, which is the impression phrases in all capital letters can give. Use capital letters and exclamation points sparingly and only to emphasize important words. Facebook may reject your ad for having too much exclamatory language as it could violate the platform's grammar and profanity rules.Sensitive topics: Topics like health, weight loss, beauty products and anti-aging supplements are closely monitored by Facebook and may lead to your ad being rejected. The platform outlines these categories under its personal health and misleading or false content policies. You'll want to avoid ad copy like this, for instance: ""Tired of diets that don't work? Want to lose weight without counting calories?""""Get rich quick"" language: Facebook does not like ""make money"" schemes, work-from-home opportunities that encourage people to quit their jobs or financial claims that might not be possible for everyone to achieve. The platform addresses these issues in its multilevel marketing and prohibited financial services policies. So, be careful using language around making money and reframe true income opportunities to focus on the benefits you're offering.Profanity: Facebook tries to maintain a family-friendly environment, and wants to avoid a parent scrolling through content with a child by their side encountering a four-letter curse word on a sponsored post. Along those same lines, sexual images and overt language around intimacy are nonstarters as well.Products and services not allowed on Facebook adsBecause the platform has various content restrictions when it comes to advertising, Facebook may not be a viable place for your ads. Some products and services are outright restricted, like tobacco, while other products, like alcohol, must comply with applicable laws and licenses. For a complete list of products that are restricted or banned, visit Facebook's transparency center. Below are some common examples:Ads promoting adult content or services are prohibited.Ads promoting dating services must have prior written permission from Facebook.Ad may not promote prescription drugs without written permission from Facebook.Ads for over-the-counter drugs must comply with applicable laws and may not be targeted to anyone under the age of 18.Ads promoting cannabis or related products are prohibited.Now that you understand the dos and don'ts of Facebook advertising, it's time to get creative and grow your audience. No matter how large your online business or budget, advertising on Facebook is an opportunity to hone your advertising strategy and harness the power of the world's largest social media audience.

In today's dynamic business landscape, characterized by rapid change and constant flux, one thing remains constant: the value of trust. Think of it as fuel for commerce — a precious commodity that can make or break a business in the blink of an eye.Take a look at the numbers: 71% of people are more likely to buy from brands they trust. And Gen Z? They practically demand trust from the brands they buy. With 58% of consumers doing their homework before they even think about hitting that ""buy now"" button, it's clear we're not just talking about a passing trend here.So, what's a business to do in a world where trust reigns supreme? It's simple, really — embrace it or get left behind. Gone are the days of slick sales pitches and smoke and mirrors. Today's consumers want authenticity, transparency and a genuine connection.



This may seem like a daunting task, but the hard work is worth the opportunity: By prioritizing trust in everything you do — from product development to customer engagement — you can unlock a world of benefits. Think customer loyalty, a sterling reputation, an army of brand advocates and a competitive edge in the marketplace.So, as we dive into the intricacies of trust-building, let's remember one thing: Trust isn't just a nice-to-have; it's a necessity. It's the secret ingredient that can elevate your business from ""good"" to ""great"" faster than you can say, ""Trust me on this.""

19,How to Get People to Open – And Read – Your Emails,"Apr 17, 2024",Entrepreneur Staff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/8-proven-strategies-to-get-people-to-open-and-read-your/383975,"
Think about the last time a brand emailed you. Did you open the email? Did you read the whole thing? Did it drive you to buy something or engage with the company? Did you even notice who sent the message before marking it as ""read"" or sending it to the trash?These days, inboxes are flooded: On average, a person receives 121 emails per day. While you may think your company's emails stand out, a large portion of your subscribers will delete those emails before they're ever opened. To avoid quickly landing into the trash, you need to craft effective marketing emails. This requires strategy and precision.Using email marketing to your company's advantage is about more than the content of the emails themselves; you need to build a list of users and addresses, avoid complaints of spam, follow the laws and maintain consistency in outreach — all in the hopes of driving consumers to action.



Below, you'll find essential tips and insights to help you build a dynamic email marketing plan. But before sending a single message, it's important to understand how email providers work in the first place.Understanding email sender reputationOne factor that can truly make or break your email campaign is email sender reputation. This is an evaluation made by email providers (Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, etc.) to assess the quality of senders. Every provider aims to keep inboxes free of spam, and they've come up with formulas that act much like a credit score for email.A long history of sending out valuable and relevant information will boost your reputation while bombarding messages and trying too hard to push sales will hurt it. The lower a sender's reputation, the more likely their message will go straight to your spam folder.It's hard to convert users to consumers when they never see your message in the first place, so you'll want to maintain — and improve — your email sender reputation. Here are some factors to keep an eye on:Email list quality and accuracyIf your contacts are old or obsolete, you could damage your reputation by continuing to send emails to those irrelevant email addresses. Why? Because it will lead to more bounce-backs and unopened messages. As your click-through rate falls, so too does your sender reputation.Email consistency (and volume)If you go from sending one email per week to sending dozens of emails per day, you will raise red flags for being spam.


Email contentIf you use suspicious trigger words in your subject line or body text, your emails could also be flagged as spam, preventing your message from being delivered and blemishing your sender reputation. These triggers include phrases like ""free gifts,"" messages in all caps and subject lines that make exaggerated claims (e.g.,""100% free,"" ""Be your own boss,"" ""Get out of debt"").Open ratesIf people are commonly deleting your emails without reading them, your reputation score will also decline. The higher your open rate, the better your reputation will be.Long domain historyThe longer you've sent emails from the same domain, the more solid your reputation will be. Unfortunately, newcomers are at a distinct disadvantage, as there are no shortcuts to establishing a long history.Spam flagUsers typically mark your emails as spam when you're sending too many messages or the messages aren't relevant to them. Providers take note of this, and each instance hurts your email sender reputation.Proven strategies to get people to open and read your emailsYour email list is updated and intact. Now you have the opportunity to speak directly to consumers. What do you want to say? Why are you saying it? And most importantly, how do you get your audience to actually read your emails?Use these eight simple strategies to get your audience's attention:1. Craft attention-grabbing subject linesThe subject line is often the difference between a user opening your email or sending it straight to trash. Entice readers by playing to their curiosities. Consider these two subject lines, for instance: ""Your August newsletter has arrived"" and ""How Harry changed his life in 28 days with AS Plus."" Which email are you more likely to open? Probably the latter because it's enticing; it demands your attention. Consider running A/B tests on your subject lines to find what's most effective with your recipients.2. Be consistentChoose how often you're going to email your list, and stick to it. No one likes getting random emails at random times. Sending emails on a schedule also tells inbox providers that you have a legitimate business, so your emails are more likely to stay out of the spam folder. This consistency also applies to design and tone: Your emails should have a standard look and voice.


3. Provide valueMake sure you consistently deliver quality content. Your emails should provide value to your audience instead of just touting your brand. This could be financial advice, recipes, interesting data points — anything related, but not directly tied, to your brand.4. Don't try to sound smartThe easiest way to lose email subscribers — and, ultimately, sales — is to sound too lofty or formal in your messaging. If you want to connect with your audience, talk to them as if you're speaking to a friend. Be conversational in your language and tone, and share your knowledge in an approachable manner.5. Share social proofHow did a client of yours overcome their struggles thanks to your help? Did your services save John thousands on his taxes? Did your coaching help Mary land that job? Don't be afraid to share wins with your audience. Once consumers learn how you've helped others, they're more likely to seek out those services.6. Make your emails interactivePeople want to be heard, so give your audience that opportunity to share their perspectives. Send them a quick email with a question, ask them to take part in a short survey or see what topics they'd like to read from you in the future. This will increase your email open rates and could provide you with ideas for future campaigns.7. Be an innovatorIf all your competitors are sending daily emails, send emails twice a week. If your competitors only aim to sell, make sure you're building trust by first providing additional value in your emails. Use an approach that makes sense for your specific brand, industry and audience.Factors to consider when scheduling your marketing emailsA successful email campaign takes more than captivating content; like in business, timing is everything. With click-through rates as low as 2% for some industries, one of the best ways to get users to open — and read — your emails is by knowing how often to send them.If you bombard subscribers with emails, they'll eventually grow tired of receiving them and opt out of messages. A Chadwick Martin Bailey study found that of users who unsubscribe, 69% of them reported receiving ""too many emails"" as the culprit. Send too few emails, though, and your messages may get lost in the ether.There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to how often you should send promotional emails. Every business and its audience is different. But no matter your industry or company size, consider these factors when planning the cadence of your email marketing:


Industry statsStudy your competitors; track how many emails they send each week. This can help you compare your strategy to theirs – but don't blatantly copy them. Every business has its own incentives, and your competitors may be sending more (or less) emails because they have a specific goal. Keep tabs on peers, and customize your strategy for your needs.Nature of product or servicesThe number of emails you send largely depends on what you're offering your customers. For example, if you sell air conditioners, you'd send more emails in summer than in winter. If you run a news agency, your subscribers should expect daily emails to stay informed. Find out how your brand fits into the lives of consumers and design your outreach based on those findings. Around 32% of users unsubscribe from brands due to ""irrelevant or useless"" emails. Don't make the mistake of sending emails just for the sake of it.What your customers wantLet your customers choose how many emails they wish to receive. Present this option when they sign up for newsletters or send out a poll to subscribers. If you give users what they want, at the rate they want it, they'll be more likely to open and read your messages.What to double-check before hitting ""send"" on your email campaignEverything is ready: your email list is built, your content is written, and you're ready to spread your message. But before you do, it's essential to check your work.The content of your emails should establish trust with consumers, and nothing breaks that trust like sloppiness. Typos, broken links, unformatted text — these may seem like small slip-ups, but they send the wrong message to subscribers. If your company can't send an error-free email, why should consumers trust you when making a big purchase or signing a multi-year contract? Before sending your marketing email, double-check the following:Test links and your template several timesYour social media icons, your ""View in browser"" and ""Unsubscribe"" links, your calls to action — do they all work properly? You can test them manually or, if you need more reassurance, use a tool like Litmus, which tests email campaigns across operating systems and devices. Be sure to confirm that your links and templates work across browsers and devices: 63% of emails are opened on mobile phones, and formatting can change across platforms.Examine your reports and email list qualityInspect your email verifier reports and see if anything has changed recently. Do you notice a drop in your click-through rates? Have you gotten any spam complaints? HubSpot research found that email databases deteriorate at an average rate of 2.1% per month. That's enough to cause your emails to land in the spam folder, so double-check these data — and remove addresses that bounce — before launching your campaign.Triple-check your copyTypos are not only embarrassing, but they also convey a lack of professionalism and attention to detail. In addition to a few pairs of human eyes, use a grammar and spell-checking tool to ensure your copy is error-free. You can also test your emails by sending them to a select group of employees who will then provide feedback.


How to avoid email spam complaintsSpam messages account for more than 46% of email traffic, and email providers are constantly blocking and filtering them. As a user, it's helpful to report junk emails and avoid future outreach. But issues arise when legitimate emails like yours get reported. The acceptable industry standard is one complaint for every 1,000 emails sent. Rise above that, and you risk all of your messages landing in spam, as Google warns. Thankfully, avoiding that fate isn't hard when you follow some basic rules:Only email consenting subscribersIf you're considering buying or renting an email list, think again. Even your closest friends must go through the subscription process, not just your customers. If someone complains about your email, remove that person from your list immediately, as they're more likely to mark your message as spam and hurt your sender reputation.Use your brand name in the ""from"" fieldYour subscribers should immediately know who is sending the email. When users don't recognize an address, they're more likely to mark it as junk.Standardize double opt-inDouble opt-in is a process in which your system automatically sends an email to new subscribers, asking them to click a confirmation link. This prevents fake signups and ensures your list of recipients is expecting to hear from you.Stick to your scheduleFind an ideal cadence of sending marketing emails and stick to it long-term. It's the most effective way to build engagement, and it sets expectations for subscribers, meaning fewer complaints.Be predictable — to a pointIf you're planning a rebrand, ensure that your visuals remain aligned with your core branding elements. This clarity drives engagement and brand loyalty, which leads to higher sales.How to grow your email listYour email list is essential to not only engaging current customers, but also reaching future ones. This communication establishes trust, builds brand loyalty and opens a dialogue between company and consumer. It's natural, then, that a growing email list leads to higher demand and more revenue.This can be a slow and steady process, but here are some easy-to-implement tips for growing an email list:


1. Add more sign-up forms to your platformsHave at least two sign-up forms on your website and add one to your blog, as well. Make the process frictionless by reducing the number of forms to fill out and posting these sign-ups on your social media pages.2. Use social media more intentionallyYour social media channels are a great tool to capture more email addresses. Promote your email list consistently in posts, social profiles and videos, highlighting what followers gain by signing up.3. Include a sign-up link in all of your emailsThis way, if your email is forwarded, the person who receives it can easily opt-in to future communications from you.4. Encourage promotion by word of mouthTalk to your peers, friends and customers about the helpful information you share via email. Encourage them to not only subscribe but also to share your subscription form with others.5. Get permissionEmailing someone who hasn't granted permission to receive communication is a surefire way to sabotage your own deliverability. People who haven't opted-in to your emails are less likely to engage and more likely to report you as spam. Even if they're a customer, they must express a clear interest in getting marketing emails from you.6. Check every new email addressProminent email verification platforms will allow you to check a few email addresses for free, a good option if your list is growing slowly. However, at least twice a year, make sure you run your entire list through an email verifier. This will provide you with peace of mind knowing actual humans are receiving your emails.7. Use Google's reCAPTCHA on your sign-up formsAny obstacle you can put between your email list and fake sign-ups helps to build a healthier email campaign. A program like Google's reCAPTCHA uses a variety of algorithms to tell humans and bots apart. While some spambots can bypass even the most advanced anti-spam systems, reCAPTCHA will help you protect the health of your email list by detecting fake addresses.8. Part with dormant subscribers every three monthsKeeping dormant, unengaged subscribers on your list leads to lower click-through rates and signals to inbox providers like Google and Microsoft that your content isn't relevant. The email marketing platform Rejoiner suggests removing contacts every three months or so. This will boost your open rate and leave email providers less likely to send your messages to spam.


How to nurture and monetize your email listOnce you have an email list, it's time to push consumers to action. At its most productive, email marketing has an ROI of $45 for every dollar spent, making it one of the most effective marketing channels for businesses.But monetizing your email list takes time. Large subscriber lists don't always translate to profits, and tapping into subscribers' spending power takes creativity. Engagement is key: The more subscribers engage with your content, the more likely they are to buy your product or pay for your services. When it's time to start monetizing your email list, the following tips can help keep you on track:Monitor your conversion rateThe goal of any email marketing campaign is a high conversion rate (e.g. the percentage of subscribers who become paying customers). This is one of — if not the — most important data point for your email campaigns. Track your conversion rate for every sent email, and see what drives users to act.Personalize your messagesLook in your own inbox and ask yourself what stands out and why. The emails that get your attention are likely tailored for you. Segment your email list according to purchase history or demographics like age or location, and personalize your message for those segmented audiences. To better understand what your subscribers want, consider gathering more information on your sign-up forms. An astounding 77% of consumers are willing to share information with brands to get a personalized experience.The laws of email marketingIgnoring best practices for email marketing may not only hurt your campaign but could also result in broken laws and heavy fines. The CAN-SPAM Act, a 2003 law applying to commercial email messages, was enacted to protect consumers and prevent the proliferation of junk mail. End up on the wrong side of the law, and your company could be on the hook for up to $51,744 for each email violating the act.What makes a message commercial? It's broad. For example, a message doesn't have to promote a product or service directly to be considered commercial: Emails that promote content (e.g., blog posts, articles or tutorials) would be considered commercial because they indirectly promote the company. Operate under the assumption that every message your company sends is commercial.Those who follow the best practices for avoiding spam complaints will mostly be covered. But if you want to legally adhere to the CAN-SPAM Act — and steer clear of fines that could wipe out your company — avoid these legal pitfalls:False header or sender informationYour messages must accurately identify both the person and business that initiated the message. The header information should also include the originating domain (typically your business' web domain) and real email address.


Misleading subject lineThe subject line should clearly explain what the recipient will get when they open the message. Both inaccurate and vague subject lines could land you in trouble.Hiding ad disclosuresIf a message is an advertisement or promotional in nature, your email must communicate this. Leave no room for ambiguity.Concealing your locationYour messages must include a valid postal address registered with the U.S. Postal Service.No unsubscribe optionCommercial emails must include an easy way for users to unsubscribe. This process must be free of fees or conditions. Ensure users can opt out by visiting a single webpage or sending just one email.Not completing user opt-outsIf a user unsubscribes, you must honor that request within 10 business days. Once a person unsubscribes, you're not allowed to transfer or sell that person's email address to other marketers.Not keeping tabs on third partiesIf you hire another person or company to manage your email marketing, you're still responsible for complying with the CAN-SPAM Act. Monitor their activities for compliance on an ongoing basis, and make sure they know the law, too.Start sending those emailsIt's time to get your email marketing plan off the ground. But don't think of all this advice as one-and-done. Maintaining a healthy and successful email marketing campaign requires discipline — audits of your email list, systems to proofread and edit content and a strict schedule. Track your progress and adapt strategies, if necessary. So long as you follow these best practices, you'll be on your way to creating a dynamic email program.

20,Successful Brands Use These 4 Radical Practices to Attract Loyal Customers,"Apr 17, 2024",Adam Kroener,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-successful-brands-should-embrace-radical-transparency/472395,"
In today's marketplace, consumer trust has become paramount for businesses seeking lasting success. A study by Edelman found that 81% of buyers cite brand trust as a deciding factor in their loyalties and purchasing behaviors. With the proliferation of information sources, companies can no longer maintain opaque practices obscuring key details. They must operate in full transparency to earn customer confidence and allegiance.As the CEO of Carbliss, an alcoholic beverage brand, I've witnessed firsthand how radical transparency around all production and business operations drives powerful consumer loyalty and business growth. From our earliest days, we committed to an unwavering open-book approach that has helped cement valuable, long-lasting relationships with our customer base. Below are the four criteria and best practices we prioritize to maintain transparency and customer loyalty.1. Hands-on customer dialogueToday's empowered consumers can easily see right through that disingenuous smokescreen. What they crave from the brands they embrace is true candor about every key aspect, including the ingredients, sourcing practices, pricing rationale, regulatory challenges, and more underpinning the products they consume.



One key way I nurture this culture of authenticity is by being directly involved with a huge volume of customer inquiries myself. This past year alone, I answered around 8,000 emails from Carbliss distributors, retailers, consumers and fans.Ongoing candid dialogue is critical for comprehensively understanding how customers perceive our brand identity, product qualities, and customer service experiences in an unfiltered way.


Through raw, unapologetic honesty in these interactions, even when the facts may be unfavorable or unpleasant for the customer to accept, we actively cultivate invaluable trust. The simple truth is that you cannot build enduring customer loyalty through automated and impersonal responses or convoluted corporate jargon.Related: Don't Talk to Another Customer Until You Learn This Simple Customer Service Secret2. Shining light on complexitiesEmbracing this level of radical transparency means being prepared sometimes to face intense scrutiny from confused, perhaps deflated customers seeking simpler truths. We've found that the payoff is an extraordinarily powerful brand reputation anchored in truth that ultimately breeds sacred trust and loyalty.At my company, we willingly spotlight the very details that other brands may conceal or try to downplay, like our need to use ""artificially colored"" labels on cans despite the colors being derived from natural sources, like the brilliant blue of butterfly pea flowers.


We take every opportunity to explain the nuances of regulatory complexities that result in obligatory technical labeling jargon. We balance that by reaffirming our core principles of prioritizing high-quality ingredients that we legitimately consume ourselves and provide to friends and family without hesitation.3.

22,Jon Bon Jovi and His Son Jesse Want You to Play 'Pink Pong' With Their Top-Rated Rosé This Summer. You Game?,"Apr 15, 2024",William Salvi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-jon-bon-jovi-and-his-son-jesses-rose-is-built-for-fun/472478,"
This week The CEO Series brought us to New York City where I got to play a heated game of ""pink pong"" against Jesse Bongiovi, the co-founder of Hampton Water, the highest-rated French rosé in America. Jesse started this company with his dad, Jon Bon Jovi, who you may know as the world-famous musician, back in 2018 and since its launch, the brand has won a ton of accolades and has stocked a ton of wine fridges — it's currently the country's third best-selling French rosé.Watch the video above to learn all about the launch and explosive growth of this company, and to find out which of us was crowned the pink pong champ!Origin of the company""I came up with the concept back in 2016. My family had a place out in East Hampton, on the east end of Long Island, for basically my whole life. And the running joke out there was that people drank more rosé than they drank water. My family was no different. And once I turned 21, I started to realize that my friends were showing up with bottles of rosé at bonfires and pool parties. But they were not buying the high-end, classic stuff. They were too intimidated, and it was too expensive. But the liquid was nowhere near as quality as these high-end French rosés, so I started to form this idea that you could create a lifestyle brand, and bridge the gap between high-quality wines and brands like White Girl Rosé and Babe Rosé. So I designed the label, designed the bottle, and came up with this concept of the Hampton Life. We partnered with Gerard Bertrand in 2018 to make the liquid. It is a French Provence style rosé, grown in the Languedoc region.""Related: A Look Inside the Company That Is Making $500 Million a Year Serving Italian Beef Sandwiches Made Famous by 'The Bear'A family passion""For us, this is not a celebrity brand. It's a family business. And the important thing about our storytelling as a brand has always been the father-son story. Our message has always been that we're a French rosé that speaks to you in a way that no other French rosé does. We have incredible ratings. We have a unique-looking name and label. And oh, by the way, this is the guy that brought it to you. And so that's always been the cherry on top. It's never been what we lead with. Now, does it help that my father is who he is? I'm not too proud to say that it's not a great way to get our foot in the door. But what we realized right away is that all the press and attention is great, but in the end, it needs to taste great and that's what has people coming back to buy another bottle.""



Thinking outside the bottle""This brand is about fun. Playing pink pong and things like that. No other rosé brand is doing this kind of stuff. For me, it's all about inspiring you to have a good time while you're drinking this. Are you creating great memories? Are you spending time with those that you love? We want to break down that barrier of entry to make it so that it's approachable, to make it so that it's fun, to make it so that a 23-year-old who has never bought a high-quality 90-point-rated wine wants to give it a try.""Check out more profiles of innovative and impactful leaders by visiting The CEO Series archives.

24,7 Link-Building Tactics You Need to Know to Skyrocket Your Website's Rankings,"Apr 12, 2024",Jeff Peroutka,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/7-techniques-for-successful-website-link-building/470502,"
Climbing the Search Engine Results Page ranking requires sophisticated SEO practices, including link building — the process of acquiring inbound links or attracting other websites to link to your content. If done right, it is a powerful growth strategy that can propel web pages' visibility and authority.When sites link to your content, they direct traffic your way, which is, of course, essential for discoverability and exposure, especially if a site is newly made. Perhaps even more importantly, backlinks' quality and quantity are among Google's most important ranking factors, as well as determinants of a site's domain authority. Put simply, a site will never perform well SEO-wise unless its' managers strive for successful link-building.Here are some effective techniques that will juice that vital task.



1. Pitch to relevant and authoritative websitesOutreach, or requesting website owners (in your niche or industry) to link to your website, is one of the foremost link-building tactics. To be effective, it's important to craft a compelling and convincing pitch, one that includes how useful, in-depth and unique your content is—both relevant and informative, and not something that can be easily produced by a novice blog writer.As much as possible, make your outreach personalized yet professional, and avoid using templates. This helps to effectively convey a desire to improve not only your link profile but also the value you're providing to site visitors.


Email is usually the go-to outreach channel for link building, but you can also consider social media platforms, especially if the recipient is active on these channels.Related: 2 Things You Need to Convince Google You're an Expert In Your Niche And Drive Traffic2. Broken link buildingMany websites have external ""broken"" or ""dead"" links that direct users to inaccessible or non-existent pages. Such links can harm a site's UX and SEO performance, and website owners are typically on the lookout for ways of addressing them.Via broken link building, you can reach out to websites in the hope that they will consider your content as a ""replacement"" for their dead links. This is similar to the above outreach technique (except that your request centers on providing an alternative external link), so the same tips apply — including highlighting new content's originality, accuracy and helpfulness.


3. Produce 'link-worthy' contentAn organic way to boost your inbound links is to create quality content. When other websites deem yours helpful, factual and original, they are more likely to link to associated pages, even without you reaching out to them. So, what makes content link-worthy? Value. If writers, bloggers and journalists see worthwhile information or opinions in content, they'll likely include its' links in their work.Examples of such content:• Step-by-step guides: In-depth instructional primers (with illustrations or videos) that solve problems with specific and valuable takeaways.• Professional interviews: Acquired opinions from industry leaders can provide credible material worth referencing.• Data analysis: Extracting insights from data using statistical tools—potentially valuable for other content creators.• Polls: In-the-moment analysis: a finger on the public pulse regarding an issue.• Case studies: Accounts of real experiences—whether from individuals or organizations—which can provide a nuanced analysis of various problems/situations.• Research studies: This can be an original experimental or descriptive research that aims to generate new findings about a subject.• Visual content: Including graphs, charts, infographics and images.• Online resources and tools: Digital tools that people can use to more easily perform tasks. For example, a website's tax calculator can be used as an inbound link by content that discusses tax preparations.Related: The Step-by-Step Guide to Creating and Publishing Quality Content4. Benchmarking competitors' linksTo see how you can improve your link profile, compare it to others in your sector. Check out their pages, see which ones generate the most backlinks, then make a guess as to why. (For example, a competitor might perform well because of well-structured how-to guides or data-driven insight posts.)


Moreover, ""glimpsing"" at competitors' link profiles will likely present potential link sources relevant to your content. You might discover websites, blogs or directories interested in linking to content like yours, and you can then approach them.5. Guest bloggingThis process involves sharing content for other websites in the hope of getting links back to your site and offers a number of benefits. First, guest blogging reliably results in both audience and traffic growth. Second, it's a cost-effective link-building solution. As you write guest blogs, include links within the copy that point to your own content — easy and without any monetary cost.Be strategic, however, when choosing sites to approach; they must be credible and have high domain authority to ensure that your site will actually benefit.Related: 4 Ways Guest Blogging Grows Your Blog Audience Quickly


6. Look for unlinked mentionsOther websites might mention your website or digital business without linking to it. While this potentially improves your exposure, it's additionally beneficial to request actual backlinks from site owners.7. Apply the ""skyscraper technique""This term and strategy refer to outperforming widely linked competitor content by producing a more comprehensive and valuable alternative. Once you have published your improved version, approach websites that link to your competitor's content and request that they link to your enhanced version instead.Managed effectively, the result will be not just new inbound links but also nabbing traffic from competitors as you climb the search results. To make this technique work, however, it's important to thoroughly assess how to noticeably surpass the quality of a competitor's content—perhaps by having a more authoritative author, updating facts and data, adding new viewpoints or insights, incorporating visual elements and/or making the entirety simply easier to read.Related: 5 Ways to Steal Your Competitor's Web Traffic


Successful link-building involves smart outreach to relevant websites, production of link-magnet content, assessing competitors' link profiles and other tactics. All will fuel the objective of improving website user experience and offering real value to readers. Once achieved, you'll have a robust link profile that propels SEO success.

25,What the C-Suite Needs to Know About the True Power of Earned Media,"Apr 12, 2024",Kelly Fletcher,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-ceos-need-to-know-about-the-true-power-of-earned-media/471993,"
Being part of the C-suite in any company is a monumental responsibility that demands a diverse skill set and a deep understanding of various facets of business. To reach such a position typically involves years of hard work, experience and a fair share of challenges.CEOs, especially, are often tasked with overseeing multiple aspects of the business, from sales growth to financial stability and brand management. While C-suite members are undoubtedly knowledgeable, there's one area that often escapes their attention: earned media.Related: What Is Earned Media and What Is Its Value?



Why earned media mattersEarned media holds a significant place in an organization's success story because of its ability to bolster credibility, enhance brand reputation and widen the reach of its message. Unlike paid media, which includes advertisements, earned media comprises press coverage, social media mentions and word-of-mouth referrals. Consumers tend to trust earned media more because it's seen as impartial and genuine.Research by YouGov indicates more than 90% of consumers put their faith in earned media. Positive coverage from reputable sources not only validates the credibility of the organization but also introduces it to new audiences, thereby boosting brand visibility and awareness. Additionally, earned media sparks conversations and interactions, fostering deeper engagement with the audience and strengthening brand loyalty. In fact, a substantial portion — ranging from 25 to 40% — of all traffic and lead generation originates from earned media. By leveraging the power of earned media, organizations can amplify their message, establish authority in their industry and drive sustainable growth.


Why the C-suite often overlooks earned mediaIn my firm's experience, CEOs and executive teams tend to overlook earned media due to several misconceptions:Perception of importance: Some CEOs underestimate the significance of earned media compared to other marketing channels. They may not fully grasp its impact on brand reputation, trust and consumer perception.Resource constraints: Developing a robust earned media strategy requires time, effort and resources. CEOs may prioritize areas of the business that offer immediate returns, overlooking the long-term benefits of earned media initiatives.Measurement challenges: Many CEOs mistakenly believe that earned media is difficult to measure. However, advancements in analytics tools like GA4, UTM tags and media monitoring software have made it highly measurable.Focus on immediate ROI: CEOs often feel pressure to deliver immediate returns on investment, leading them to overlook the time-intensive nature of earned media strategies.Perhaps most importantly, earned media is a strategic long-game tactic that CEOs must grasp to harness its full potential. Unlike paid media, which often yields immediate results but comes with hefty price tags, earned media requires patience and persistence. While paid placements can cost thousands of dollars, securing coverage through earned channels like bylined articles demands only the investment of time in writing and pitching.Although the process may not deliver instant gratification, the trust-building outcomes it generates over time are invaluable. CEOs who recognize and commit to earned media stand to reap significant dividends in credibility, reputation and sustained audience engagement.Related: 6 Strategies to Maximize Earned Media for Your Brand


Reframing the narrative: Aligning earned media with the marketing sales funnel and buyer's journeyChallenging the conventional wisdom, I've come to realize that earned media is more versatile and impactful than commonly believed. It permeates every stage of the marketing sales funnel and the buyer's journey, from building awareness to fostering loyalty.Consider this scenario: You craft a compelling bylined article showcasing your industry expertise and addressing a common challenge your customers face. The article gets published in a major media outlet, generating awareness for your brand. You then share the article on social media, targeting users in the consideration phase who have already engaged with your brand. Additionally, you incorporate the article into your website content and email newsletters, catering to prospects in the consideration phase. As prospects move into the conversion stage, you leverage the article's credibility to drive conversions, solidifying their trust in your brand. Finally, in the loyalty phase, you utilize testimonials, a form of earned media, to reinforce brand advocacy and deepen customer loyalty.Related: Why Earned Media is the Best Way to Earn Your ReputationFor in-house public relations and marketing executives, bridging the comprehension gap within the C-suite presents a formidable challenge. While traditional business education often overlooks earned media, its potential for exceptional results remains undeniable. Encouraging the C-suite to embrace earned media requires patience and persistence, accompanied by a compelling showcase of its tangible benefits. As the business landscape evolves, urging the C-suite to explore earned media can unlock new avenues of growth and elevate the organization's narrative to new heights.

26,Bantam Bagels' Founder Fell Into a Mindset Trap 'People Don't Talk About' After Selling the Now-Defunct Business for $34 Million — Here's What Happened,"Apr 12, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-happened-to-bantam-bagels-founder-reveals-her-struggle/472502,"
In 2013, Elyse Oleksak, co-founder of Bantam Bagels, got a call from her husband Nick about a bite-sized snack that would set some big plans in motion. ""Mini bagels stuffed with cream cheese,"" Oleksak recalls him saying in her recently released memoir A Shark Ate My Bagel: How We Built Bantam Bagels. ""Sort of like doughnut holes, but bagels."" Oleksak had heard plenty of ambitious ideas from her entrepreneurially-minded husband in the past, but tiny stuffed bagels were one she could get behind. The duo met at a grocery store after work to start experimenting.Image Credit: Courtesy of Elyse OleksakIt was the beginning of Bantam Bagels' near-decade-long journey, one that cycled through ""success followed by failure"" and ""elation followed by panic,"" Oleksak tells Entrepreneur exclusively.



The business made a splash on Shark Tank, where the Oleksaks struck a $275,000 deal for 11% equity with Lori Greiner (hence the title of Oleksak's book) in 2014. In the next several years, it saw sales hit $45 million as it expanded the product line to include mini stuffed pancakes and egg bites, landed in 10,000 stores and 8,500 Starbucks and was ultimately acquired by the Ohio-based T. Marzetti Company for $34 million in 2018 before ceasing operations in 2022.Related: All 7 'Shark Tank' Stars Share Tips on How to Become a Millionaire


""We were going to die in the wake of our own success if we didn't do something about it soon.""Like many entrepreneurs who find themselves at the helm of a fast-growing business, the Oleksaks had an ""aha moment"" when they realized their cash-versus-growth dilemma. ""We got to a point where even though this was our baby and it was something that we had owned at near 100% for so long, we were going to die in the wake of our own success if we didn't do something about it soon,"" Oleksak says. So the Oleksaks sold to T. Marzetti. It felt like a perfect match, Oleksak recalls, and the couple stayed on in marketing and product development capacities.However, getting used to her new relationship with the company wasn't easy, Oleksak admits. It's a struggle that didn't make it into the book, she says, but an important one nevertheless. According to Oleksak, with all of the focus on success stories and flashy sales, there's an all-too-common experience that gets lost in the narrative because ""people don't talk about"" it: How do you cope when all of your hard work pays off and your dream finally comes true?""Every single ounce and fiber of our being was dedicated to the survival and growth of this company [for years],"" Oleksak explains, ""so when you operate in this fight or flight mode for so long, it just becomes who you are."" Simultaneously chasing success and steeling for calamity takes a serious mental toll, Oleksak says, and when there were no more fires to put out, her brain began ""inventing disasters"" that didn't exist and therefore had no concrete solutions — a never-ending ""spiral.""


Related: 4 Ways Highly Successful People Handle Tough Times and Get Back on Track""When we were left feeling safe and at peace, I almost didn't know what to do with that safety and peace.""""We found loving arms for our explosive child,"" Oleksak says. ""We did it. But every single sense of self and success [had been] wrapped in this swirl of panic at all times, so when we were left feeling safe and at peace, I almost didn't know what to do with that safety and peace. Your brain almost doesn't know what to do when it stops. I personally went through an extreme breakdown."" Oleksak likens the experience to those of professional athletes who have to redefine themselves after a career in sports.Seeing your biggest dream become a reality can be amazing, but you have to prepare your brain for a complete mindset shift and pick up the appropriate tools to navigate that, according to Oleksak. The entrepreneur is a huge proponent of therapy and credits it with helping her recalibrate what it takes to get from one day to the next without considering chaos a foregone conclusion. ""I worked through a lot to find mental peace and stability and be able to be present again in the moment,"" she says.


Unfortunately, just a couple of years after T. Marzetti acquired Bantam Bagels, the pandemic put pressure on the supply chain, making it a challenge to stock the same variety of products as retailers streamlined processes wherever possible. By that point, Oleksak says she and her husband had given up a lot of decision-making authority and weren't involved in the conversations that ultimately led T. Marzetti to stop production of the brand. Still, Oleksak — and the nearly 1,500 people who signed a petition in support of Bantam Bagels' return — would love to see the products make a comeback one day.Related: 5 Ways to Protect Your Mental HealthAs Oleksak reflected on her entrepreneurial journey ""full of ups and downs,"" she kept coming back to all of the connections she'd made along the way — from every customer who purchased a Bantam Bagel to the manufacturers who took a chance on the product, celebrity endorsers including Oprah, Sarah Jessica Parker and Whoopi Goldberg, and so many more — and wanted to give back with a behind-the-scenes look at lessons learned over the years. So Oleksak put pen to paper and drafted A Shark Ate My Bagel, then opted to self-publish it ""the entrepreneurial way,"" with a marketing plan that included her own website and an Amazon push.""Thank God I organized all those lessons because, man, did I make a lot of mistakes,"" Oleksak laughs. These days, she's approaching the publication of her book as she would the launch of a ""mini business"" and says she's putting most of her energy into that right now. But she also looks forward to working with small businesses in the future, helping them avoid the mistakes she made and secure wins of their own.

27,The Unseen Reason You Feel So Overwhelmed — and How It Impacts Your Business,"Apr 11, 2024",Joy Gendusa,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-unseen-reason-you-feel-so-overwhelmed-and-how-to/472167,"
In 1998, when I started my business, PostcardMania, the first cell phone with a color screen hit the market. Facebook didn't exist, phones absolutely didn't fit in our pockets, and people still wrote checks in the grocery store.The internet was in its infancy, and we weren't saturated with tech to where it overtook our daily lives. It was new and fascinating but still relegated to a desktop.Just two decades later, and we can't go a single day without our smartphones in our hands, social media has replaced most personal interactions, and checks are obsolete with cash not far behind.



Between 2000 and 2018, studies show that the average American has nearly tripled their time online, going from 9.4 hours online per week to 23.6 in 2018 — and that was pre-pandemic. Some studies put the jump in pandemic screen time between 60-80% for adults. All this scrolling has us feeling some type of way: 46% of the respondents in one study said too much screen time was a major culprit of constant tiredness.Not only does digital overwhelm distract us — a study found that U.S. residents check their smartphones 352 times a day, affecting our productivity — but it can also lead to real health issues. Medical research concludes that too much screen time leads to insomnia, visual problems, decreased bone density and high blood pressure. Beyond physical ailments, digital overload has effects on our mental and emotional health, increasing anxiety and depression.


Some businesses see the solution as an outright cell phone ban at work. Yet this can lead to disgruntled employees who feel more like toddlers at daycare than entrusted adults. I've always found people respond best to autonomy — give them ownership over something, and their care factor increases.There is a better way to balance a modern workplace to maintain meaningful connections and accomplish our goals for success. All it takes are some intentional changes...Related: The Dangers of Digital Fatigue, and How to Prioritize Your Mental HealthCreate new opportunities for in-person connection at workThe pandemic reshaped the workplace when work-from-home rates tripled from 2019 to 2021, but it may have created disconnection for the sake of convenience. So how can you reforge those in-office connections?


Try replacing one Zoom meeting a week with in-person meetups, either at the office or even at a local coffee shop. Or host one large company-wide meeting once a week in person (like I do) so that the entire staff can see each other face to face across separate departments.Besides simply meeting about projects, start implementing fun, team-building events that create moments for genuine connection and creativity. Let each department in your company brainstorm and come up with these fun activities, like mini golf, going to an escape room or obstacle course. Even working out together a couple times a week could be a way to bring team members together.Improve staff performance with off-screen organization and productivity toolsIt probably doesn't surprise you that someone like me — the CEO of a multi-million-dollar direct mail company — would still enjoy checking the mailbox every day and fingering through the letters and cards to see what's there. But these days, I'm noticing more professionals putting their phones down and picking up paper and a pen.Whether someone is mailing a letter, writing in a journal or sitting down to plan out their week with a calendar book, there is something alluring about striking a smooth piece of paper with ink and marking our goals, thoughts and desires down.


The deliberate act of interacting with a physical object forces us to slow down, savor the moment and be fully present in the experience. Help staff members plan out their weeks and avoid digital distractions by giving them paper planners, desk calendars or journals. Consider investing in branded journals as well to improve company morale and pride.The benefits may trickle down to your bottom line — numerous studies show that reading comprehension, focus and memory can all be improved by switching from screen-based reading to something paper-based.Related: The Surprising Reason Why This Young Tech Entrepreneur Swears By Pen and PaperUse direct mail marketing to increase revenue and cover expensesCreating more in-person meetups and events as well as giving out more tangible tools for organization does have a cost. One way to increase your budget for these objectives is to drive up revenue with direct mail marketing.


The United States Postal Service partnered with researchers from Temple University's Center for Neural Decision Making to study the reason print holds more gravitas for us as humans. Turns out, after intense scientific study, the reason direct mail makes a greater impact is because of the way our brains respond to stimulation.Holding a physical advertisement activates our senses of touch, smell and sight and elicits an emotional response inside a specific neural area of the brain that allows us to recall the ad for a longer period of time. Ultimately, the study determined that print ads increased the desirability of the product as opposed to digital ads that were forgotten faster.Not only can direct mail make a great impression on your target audience and ideal customer, its response rate is up to nine times higher than that of email. In fact, in 2023, 74% of marketers agreed that direct mail delivers the best return on investment.Also, studies found that there was an 18% greater return on investment when the business incorporated direct mail in their multichannel marketing mix as opposed to relying on digital alone.


One of my clients, an RV and motor home flipper, mailed about 24,000 postcards and made $50,000 in revenue for an ROI of 590%. We have over 700 other direct mail case studies with even more eye-popping ROIs, some as high as several thousand.Related: How to Boost Your Business With Direct Mail Automation and Retargeting — a Detailed Beginner's GuideAfter making some of these adjustments, write down exactly how those changes affected your business and relationships.

28,What Damian Lillard Taught Me About Personal Branding,"Apr 11, 2024",Nicole Bernard,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-damian-lillard-taught-me-about-personal-branding/472150,"
For Christmas, we got my son two tickets to the Portland Trailblazers vs. Milwaukie Bucks game. We live about an hour from PDX, so technically, the Blazers are our home team. And we love them — always have. I grew up watching Clyde the Glide take on Jordan, Pippen and Grant in the 1992 finals (they lost to the Bulls, by the way). I'm not sure who was more excited about the tickets — me or my 10-year-old son!If you're unfamiliar with Damian Lillard, aka Dame Time, you should be! Drafted in the 1st round (6th overall) to the Blazers in 2012 from a small school in Utah, Damian has spent his entire career in Portland — until this season.When the opportunity to play with Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks came up, nobody could blame him for taking the opportunity for a chance to win a championship.



You would think the people of Portland, and Oregon, for that matter, would be mad.Far from it.


When my son and I went to the game, you could feel the love and appreciation for Damian. The organization even put half of its iconic Rip City structure in green in front of the Moda Center! It is typically red and black only.When they announced his name, there was a two-minute standing ovation. I have the video of it; I can prove it. Some signs read, ""Win Your Ring and Come Home,"" and many read, ""We Miss You."" Adidas dedicated a basketball court at their Portland campus to him the day before the game. It is the first and only time they have dedicated any building to an athlete. Portland was still selling Lillard jerseys (for twice the price of last year, I might add!)So, after seeing all of this and feeling love for him at the game. I wondered, what makes him so different? Why do people feel so connected to him?Related: I Emailed All 30 NBA Owners, Asking Them to Meet With Me. Here's What Happened.


What makes Dame differentHe has truly connected with his fans. But on a personal level. Yes, he shares pictures of his adorable children, his music and his brands on social media, but it's more than that.As mentioned above, he came from a small school. He has shared how he wasn't always sought after and how he had to work harder. He's shared how he had to put time behind the scenes when nobody was watching (or, quite frankly, cared) and didn't know if he would actually make it to the NBA.I feel like many of us can connect with that. Especially entrepreneurs. We put a lot of work in behind the scenes, and we're unsure if it will be enough.All athletes, celebrities, and mega-successful entrepreneurs are real humans, but we don't always get to see that side of them or really connect with them. Damian has brought us along for the ride.


In addition to his personal story, Damian has spent (a lot of) time giving back to the city of Portland. Not only is he the all-time leading scorer for the Blazers, but he also founded the Lillard Foundation, was highly involved in the RESPECT program in many PDX high schools, and gave his time to the Special Olympics. He is like a family member at college for a semester, and we're ready for him to come home.A few weeks ago, the Blazers played the Bulls in Chicago. Guess who was at the game? Dame Time. He literally drove from Milwaukee to Chicago to support his old team. For most people, a two-hour drive to see an NBA game wouldn't be that crazy, but for a professional athlete on a Monday night?That shows who Damian is. I honestly don't know how many professional athletes would do that on their night off. And that's why people love him. He shows that he cares. He gives without expectation.Related: 5 Simple Steps to Build a Personal Brand


How to improve your personal brand like Damian LillardMarketing will always be based on relationships. Creating them. Building them. Strengthening them. Enjoying them.Damian crushes this.Personal branding is becoming more important because people crave more connections (especially post-pandemic). And the fact is, like Dame Time, we all have a personal brand whether we like it or not, so it's advantageous to put some effort into your brand. We may not have his exposure, but we all have a story to tell. People to help. Dreams to pursue.A personal brand is so much more than your color scheme, tagline, or logo. It's your vibe. It's how you want to make people feel when they come across your social media platforms, sign up for your email list or browse your website. It's more than pictures of your products, travels or kids. Don't get me wrong, those are part of it, but it's how you make them feel.

29,How to Overtake Your Competition With Creative Brand Precision,"Apr 10, 2024",Bora Celik,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/disruption-through-design-how-brands-can-beat-out-their/471347,"
What do you do when every shelf and screen overflows with options? Your brand needs to do more than show up; it must shine. Exceptional design is a significant way to shine. It goes beyond colors and logos to become a story, a feeling, a memorable moment. More than aesthetics, it's about wielding design as a strategic tool to cut through the noise and as a deliberate strategy to disrupt the status quo.My first startup, Jukely, excelled in design. My co-founder was an incredible designer, one of the first designers at Kickstarter. Through his design vision, we kickstarted a movement by innovating in a stale space and created the world's first concert subscription service. Our product was featured as one of the best apps multiple times in Apple's app store, which gave us credibility.At the core of this exploration is a belief in the power of design to alter perceptions. In this article, I explore how challenger brands can stand out through striking design and how they draw a clear line between them and the incumbents.



Related: 4 Ways Brands Can Educate Their Customers and Win HeartsStanding out: The real dealNavigating the crowded marketplace today is like finding your voice in a roaring concert. Every brand is vying for attention, hoping to leave a lasting impression. This challenge requires more than just traditional advertising or a flashy logo. It demands a strategic approach to design — a method that intertwines aesthetics with function, creating an experience that resonates deeply with consumers.


The essence of standing out lies in the ability to merge visual appeal with storytelling, ensuring that every interaction with the brand is not just seen but felt. This approach transforms casual browsers into loyal customers, encouraging them to choose your brand amidst a sea of options. Design, in this context, acts as the silent ambassador of your brand, speaking volumes without uttering a single word.Keep it simpleToday's consumer is bombarded with choices, making the decision-making process increasingly complex. In this chaos, simplicity becomes a beacon of clarity and assurance. Brands that master the art of distilling their message into clean, innovative design capture attention and earn trust.Ritual demonstrates this beautifully by stripping away the unnecessary and focusing on what matters. By introducing a clear, minimalist bottle that showcases its equally transparent capsules, Ritual invites consumers into a visual and physical experience of openness and honesty. Their minimalist packaging is a testament to their philosophy, highlighting the quality and thoughtfulness of what's inside. It's a bold statement in an industry often cluttered with claims and counterclaims, providing a clear, unambiguous message about the brand's values and commitment to transparency. This simplicity extends to the user experience, making the journey from discovery to purchase seamless and straightforward.Related: Why Brands are Simplifying Their Logos and Visual Identity


Connecting on a deeper levelThe power of design transcends mere aesthetics; it has the potential to evoke feelings and forge emotional connections. When a product transcends its utility and becomes a part of the consumer's identity, it has achieved something remarkable. Brightland's approach to olive oil packaging illustrates this perfectly.By engaging artists to create visually stunning labels, they turn each bottle into a collector's item, a token of beauty that stands out in the monotony of kitchen staples. Each bottle becomes a conversation piece, a medium through which consumers share their tastes and values. I've seen numerous reviews where the reviewer was attracted to the brand based on how the bottles would look in their kitchen. This deeper connection is what transforms first-time buyers into brand evangelists, creating a community of users who don't just use the product but love and advocate for it.Related: How to Design an Eye-Catching Website That Truly Captures Your AudienceStorytime through designA well-crafted design does more than please the eye; it serves as a window into the soul of the brand, inviting consumers into a narrative that captivates and enchants. Onyx Coffee's award-winning packaging is a masterclass in this art of storytelling. Each bag is meticulously designed to hint at the unique story of its origin, processing method, and flavor profile. This narrative approach transforms the act of purchasing coffee into an exploratory adventure, inviting consumers to experience the journey from farm to cup. The packaging serves as a prelude to the product itself, setting expectations and building anticipation.


This level of engagement ensures that Onyx doesn't just sell coffee; it offers an immersive experience that begins at the point of sale and continues to the last sip. It's a testament to how thoughtful design can elevate a brand, turning everyday transactions into meaningful interactions.The lesson here? When brands get bold with design, they lay out their ethos for the world to see. And in a market crowded with choices, this courage to be different paints the future of how we connect with what we buy. Looking ahead, it's the brands that embrace this blend of innovation and authenticity that will lead the pack, turning everyday choices into gateways of discovery.

31,5 Innovative Ways to Give Your Customers the Personalized Experiences They Want,"Apr 10, 2024",Nicholas Leighton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-give-your-customers-the-personalized-experiences/431007,"
Standing out in today's crowded marketplace can be extremely challenging, especially for small businesses in a sea of major competitors. Winning the attention of customers requires a new approach. Consumers today no longer want to be treated like cattle being herded toward similar products. Instead, they want to feel special. They want unique experiences that are created just for them.We all know that personalizing the customer experience is a great strategy. That's why nearly 90% of marketers see a positive ROI after investing in personalized campaigns. These companies on average earn 40% more revenue than brands that don't embrace personalization.Unfortunately, over the last few decades, consumers have become desensitized to the old, boring methods of personalization. Consumers expect companies to go the extra mile when it comes to crafting personalized experiences. The rise of technology is unlocking new capabilities in the personalization space that will enable companies to successfully achieve impressive levels of hyper-personalization.



Related: Why a 'Personal' Customer Experience Is Critical to Your Business' Success1. AI-powered personalizationIn the past, companies were only capable of personalizing marketing and customer experiences for broadly defined demographics such as gender, age, economic status and geographic location. Of course, consumers can still have numerous different needs, interests and preferences despite being in the same group.


The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the way companies personalize their customer experience by allowing customer experiences to be tailored to a very specific level. AI has the power to seamlessly create unique marketing and content for thousands of customers based on dozens of different data points.2. Interactive experiencesConsumers don't just want to buy products; they want to have exciting and memorable experiences. This is why experiential marketing has nearly a 40% success rate. In the digital space, the opportunities are practically limitless. Pairing experiences with personalization is a winning strategy.Coca-Cola accomplished this with the introduction of their Freestyle Machines that provide an interactive experience while customers personalize their own flavor combinations. These experiences don't have to exist in just the real world. Brands can also use augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) to create entirely unique, digital experiences for each customer.Related: How Experiential Marketing Events Can Skyrocket Your ROI


3. Voice-activated personalizationMore and more devices and applications are incorporating voice-activated features, digital assistants and chatbots to assist consumers with everyday tasks. These tools are perfectly positioned to gather important data and learn about the users' preferences and routines through regular interaction. This information, along with preset preferences and prior activity, can then be used to send personalized recommendations.4. Cross-channel personalizationCross-channel personalization has emerged as a critical strategy for businesses aiming to create seamless and cohesive customer experiences across various touchpoints. In today's interconnected digital landscape, customers expect consistency and relevance regardless of the channel they engage with.For instance, a retail brand could recommend personalized products to its customers based on their past purchases and browsing history when visiting their website. Later, when the same customer visits the brand's physical store, they can continue the conversation by sending targeted promotions via a mobile app that complements their online shopping preferences.Leveraging advanced analytics, AI-powered algorithms and customer data platforms, businesses can gain insights into individual preferences and behaviors, allowing them to tailor content, offers and interactions across each of these channels.


Related: 3 Tips for Using Consumer Data to Create More Personalized Experiences5. Predictive analyticsPredictive analytics takes personalization to the next level by leveraging advanced data to attempt to predict a consumer's future behavior or anticipate their needs. The most obvious example is Amazon, which employs predictive analytics to analyze past purchase behavior, browsing history and demographic data to recommend additional personalized products to shoppers. By harnessing predictive analytics, businesses can forecast customer preferences, identify trends and proactively offer tailored recommendations and promotions. This strategic approach not only enhances customer satisfaction but also drives sales and fosters long-term loyalty.Personalization is about more than just tailoring marketing messages to land a sale. The underlying benefits are much deeper. Personalizing the customer's experience is a great way to build a connection with the customer and enhance brand loyalty. This, in turn, translates into happier customers and healthier revenue.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Danny Trejo, an insurance agent who started grow-at-home citrus business Via Citrus in 2020.Where did you find the inspiration for your side hustle? I started working on Via Citrus shortly after moving to New York City, inspired by the nostalgia for the citrus groves of Central Florida. I grew up on a large citrus nursery filled with the sights and scents of orange blooms — a vivid part of my childhood that I always cherished.



While I had always wanted to be part of the citrus nursery business, I wanted to contribute in a different way that not only brought value to the business but also meaning to myself. The distance from my roots, coupled with the longing for the familiar fragrance of orange blossoms, sparked the idea to share this piece of my home with others. It was then that I realized I could educate others on how to grow citrus trees — no matter where they were located — by opening an online store.Related: What to Watch - The Most Inspiring Shows for EntrepreneursImage Credit: Courtesy of Via CitrusWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground? What were some challenges? Starting out, I faced the daunting task of setting up an ecommerce platform. With no prior experience in websites, I had to start from scratch, learning the ins and outs of online retail, from design to development.


Simultaneously, I tackled the important step of defining our product line. Given the vast diversity of citrus varieties ranging from oranges, lemons, limes, tangerines and grapefruits, I had to make decisions about which to offer. This involved researching citrus growth habits and the unique selling points of each citrus type to curate a selection that would appeal to a broad audience.Equally important was determining the size of the plants Via Citrus was going to offer. This decision was a delicate balance. On one hand, offering plants that were too small could lead to customer disappointment, as they might not immediately appreciate the beauty or potential of their purchase. On the other hand, larger plants, while more visually appealing and closer to bearing fruit, would incur prohibitive shipping costs, making them less accessible to a wider audience. This required careful consideration of the growth stages of citrus plants, shipping logistics and customer expectations to select sizes that offered the best value for our customers and the business.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?


The first couple of months saw under $1,000 each thanks to family and friends who supported the launch of Via Citrus. However, it wasn't long before we were averaging about $7,000 per month in revenue, with May (Mother's Day) and December (Christmas) being our busiest.What does average monthly revenue look like now? We see $36,000 per month in sales. May and December continue to be our best sales months.What do you enjoy most about this side hustle? It keeps me in touch with my roots — pun intended — by working on this project with my dad. Growing up surrounded citrus, where my dad dedicated over 40 years of his life, has deeply influenced my appreciation for the cultivation and care of citrus. Now as the person behind Via Citrus, I am able to maintain and strengthen this bond despite being six hours away from the farm. Via Citrus serves as a vital link to my father and the work he continues to do. He's not just the grower — he's out there selecting and packaging each citrus plant we send out to our customers. This hands-on approach from him ensures that every plant we deliver carries a piece of our family's dedication and love for citrus cultivation.


Image Credit: Courtesy of Via CitrusAs you consider the business's future, what are you most excited about? The booming plant industry and the significant steps we are taking to grow alongside it get me excited. As our world gets more digital, people are turning to gardening and indoor plants for both hobby and home decor to take a break from their screens. This trend presents a promising opportunity for Via Citrus, as our unique offering of citrus plants aligns with this growing interest.What is particularly thrilling is our recent purchase of new land for the development of additional greenhouses. These new greenhouses will have the capacity to increase our variety of citrus offers, improve our cultivation process and ensure we can meet the growing demand from our customers.

For me, I wanted to get everything right the first time: the perfect-looking website, the perfect variety, size, packaging, images, etc. I was spending too much time perfecting. Perfection is somewhat of a double-edged sword. No one was seeing my website or buying my citrus plants. Therefore, my quest for perfection limited my ability to get any consumer feedback to make anything better. Eventually, after years of planning and perfecting, I launched the website. The few customers who did engage became invaluable sources of feedback. Their insights helped us refine our offers in ways I hadn't anticipated.It's important to get your product out there, even if it's a limited run of your product. Early feedback provides incredible insights and can steer your side hustle in a direction that better meets market needs and preferences.

Decades ago, I went to a breakout session at a BNI conference that was called ""The Mathematical Formula for Networking Success."" Well, as the founder of the organization, I absolutely had to see this presentation to learn the working formula for successful business networking.The speaker began his presentation by writing a formula on the flip chart. He talked about ""D"" representing Dunbar's average number of relationships and ""M"" representing Metcalf's law (also known as the Squared Connection Effect). He continued with a very convoluted and confusing formula doing the square root of one thing and multiplying it by something that seemed totally irrelevant to me.He hesitated as he spoke to us. He put his fingertips to his lips and hemmed and hawed in his presentation. It was uncomfortably clear to all of us that he was confused and bewildered by his own formula. Not only that, but we were also very confused and bewildered by his formula as well. We all sat there feeling pretty embarrassed for him.

36,6 Marketing Lessons Small Businesses Can Learn From the Big Players,"Apr 5, 2024",Joseph Camberato,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/marketing-lessons-small-businesses-can-learn-from-the-big/471902,"
Going to the movies doesn't generate the same excitement it used to. The price of tickets and popcorn are higher than ever, and you don't have to wait long for your favorite movies to be streaming on Amazon.But in 2023, Barbie made people excited to go to the movies again. The film brought in $1.45 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of the year. While Barbie's success is due to the directing and quality of the film, it's hard to overlook the film's excellent marketing strategy.As a small business owner, you can learn valuable marketing lessons by studying major marketing campaigns like Barbie and, more recently, Dune: Part 2. Let's look at six major takeaways you can apply to your next product launch.



Related: 'Barbie' Was a Marketing Masterpiece. Here's Why.1. Incorporate social mediaA large part of Barbie's success is due to its social media campaign — the movie was heavily promoted on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and Twitter. You could find behind-the-scenes content, trailers, memes and interactive posts.


There were promotional hashtags, like #BarbieMovieMagic, which encouraged fans to create and share user-generated content. The Barbie team also partnered with celebrities and influencers who shared their experiences and thoughts about the movie.The Barbie movie is an example of what can happen when you leverage social media to its fullest extent. When used effectively, it can create unstoppable momentum that pushes a brand or product into the public eye.2. Collaborate with other brandsThe Barbie marketing campaign focused on collaborating with other brands to promote the movie. In total, Mattel partnered with over 100 brands — for example, Forever 21 created Barbie-inspired clothing like crop tops, mesh tees and hoodies.Airbnb listed the iconic Malibu DreamHouse on its site. Restaurant chains like McDonald's, Burger King and Cold Stone also partnered with Barbie to promote the movie. Cold Stone's pink cotton candy ice cream shake even went viral on TikTok.


It's hard to market a product on your own, and Barbie demonstrates what can happen when you create mutually beneficial partnerships on a very large scale. The right partnerships can generate more excitement among your audience and put your brand in front of entirely new audiences.Related: 5 Ways to Effectively Utilize Marketing Collaborations3. Create brand consistencyWhen you think of Barbie, there's probably one thing that comes to mind — the color pink. Barbie pink became a central part of the movie. The color was not only used throughout the movie but also incorporated in all of the promotional materials and campaigns.Even blank billboards with nothing more than the color pink and the date of the film's release were instantly recognized as promoting the film. Once the movie was released, people began flooding the theatres dressed in their best Barbie pink outfits.


Brand consistency matters because it helps customers create an emotional connection to your products. When customers immediately recognize your brand, it creates familiarity and a greater sense of trust.4. Encourage user-generated contentUser-generated content may not be applicable to every marketing campaign, but if you can use it, it's an effective tool. User-generated content was pivotal to marketing Barbie, and fans were constantly encouraged to engage with the movie.There was a Barbie selfie generator that allowed fans to edit themselves into the movie poster. And there was tons of user-generated content posted on social media. User-generated content can not only create a buzz around a product launch but also give your audience a sense of ownership around it.Related: The Beginner's Guide to User-Generated Content


5. Start earlyMost people probably became aware of the Barbie movie last spring or summer during the months leading up to its release. However, the marketing team spent years planning its launch and setting up partnerships.In fact, the first marketing materials debuted in 2022 at CinemaCon with a photo of Barbie in her pink convertible. By starting early, the marketing team could be selective about its partnership and narrow in on the best strategies.Effective marketing campaigns don't open overnight — the earlier you begin marketing a product launch, the more time you have to create awareness. Plus, marketing early and often gives you a chance to test out different strategies and see what works.6. Know your audienceOne of the biggest things the Barbie marketing campaign demonstrates is a deep understanding of its audience. The Barbie brand has been around since 1959, and the movie embraced the power of nostalgia to appeal to older fans who grew up with the dolls.


At the same time, the movie's focus on diversity and inclusion made it relevant to younger generations. The movie succeeded by giving fans what they really wanted — an experience that resonated with people of all ages.When you know your audience, you can create relevant, targeted content you know they'll identify with. It also helps you create a relationship with your audience and create long-term customer loyalty.

Customer service has never been more important. Today's customers not only desire fast and seamless service but also expect a personalized and delightful customer experience (CX). To add even more to the mix, the stakes are high for businesses that don't measure up. According to a recent PwC report, one-third of customers would leave a brand they love after one bad experience.The good news is that succeeding in customer service can reap incredible benefits for businesses. In fact, 86% of customers are willing to pay more for a great CX, per the Tempkin Group. Due to these factors, customer service has become one of the top priorities for businesses in 2024. Here are three CX trends every business leader should buy into to help them excel in 2024.The evolving role of self-service technologyToday's customers expect fast, seamless and convenient service. One recent study found that half of all customers will not wait more than 3 minutes in a store. It's unrealistic to expect businesses to provide instant, in-person service all the time – that's where technology has to play a role. Gone are the days when these technologies were viewed as taboo. On the contrary, many of today's customers prefer customer service, which technology supports in some way. Per a recent study by Aspect, 73% of customers want the ability to solve product or service issues independently. Even many small businesses and franchises should invest in technologies like self-service kiosks or technology tools that support customer service efforts.



If your business hasn't invested in self-service technology for customers, 2024 might just be the year to do so. A great place to start is with self-service kiosks onsite. This is a tool that The UPS Store recently introduced, with over 1,800 self-service kiosks now installed at franchise locations across the country. These kiosks streamline online returns and item drop-offs for The UPS Store customers and offer an option to get in and out of the store faster than ever. Whether self-service works into your business plan or not, technology will be a key player in customer service in 2024.Related: 10 Reasons Why Good Customer Service Is Your Most Important Metric


Connecting with Gen-ZYou may not realize this, but Gen Z is growing up fast. The oldest members of this generation will be much closer to 30 this year than 20. With Gen Zers becoming a bigger sect of most companies' customer base, one of the biggest CX trends in 2024 will be the importance of appealing to this group. So, where should you start? One place is on social media. As the first actual digital-native generation, Gen Zers are often most comfortable interacting with companies on social media. A survey by Hubspot found that 90% of Gen Z expect brands to be active on social media, and 13% claim social media as the preferred form of customer service. If you're not on social media, 2024 is a great year to use it.This shouldn't just be reserved for large national brands; even small businesses should find ways to be active and interact with younger customers on social media. LinkedIn or Instagram are great places to start for most companies, but consider where you feel most comfortable or which platform your customers are most active on. Authenticity must be prioritized in social media customer service, especially when interacting with Gen Z. In addition to responding to customer needs, being active on social media will allow your company to build more trust with Gen Z and interact with customers more often.Related: What You Must Know About the Next Generations of ConsumersHarnessing customer insightsOne CX trend that has persisted in its importance is using customer service interactions for their insights. While customer service should prioritize the customer experience, all companies should also look for ways to learn from these interactions. This can be achieved through high-tech and low-tech means. For example, businesses can use data intelligence software to get real-time insights or social media analytics to collect information. Plenty of data intelligence vendors can offer real-time insights based on customer touchpoints. On the other hand, businesses can also tap their customer service employees for their insights following a customer interaction.


Employees often have some of the best feedback to offer since they interact daily with customers. All businesses should view their customer touchpoints as an opportunity to not only make their customers happy but also as a chance to learn and adapt for the future. In 2024, you should consider finding ways to better obtain customer insights, whether that be through investing in data analytics or looking for insights from your employees.Providing great customer service should always be a priority for business leaders, but it continues to be more important each year. As we move through 2024, be sure to keep tabs on customer service trends, especially when it comes to the importance of self-service, appealing to Gen Z and harnessing customer insights.

For example, if you have a family law firm in Los Angeles, some terms to search for could be ""LA family law,"" ""family lawyer Los Angeles,"" ""LA divorce lawyer,"" etc.Then, confirm that the terms you are searching for have: 1) search volume and 2) medium to low competition. This ensures that you are targeting terms that people are actually searching for.


Finally, apply these keywords to the respective pages of your website, creating individual landing pages for each product or service. For example, if you are a hair stylist in Seattle, you might have pages targeting ""Haircuts | Seattle,"" ""Hair Color Salon | Seattle,"" and ""Hair Treatments | Seattle.""To ""optimize"" your landing pages for your target keywords, use the respective keywords in the page title, in the headings (where fitting) and throughout the body copy naturally.

39,Ensure Customer Loyalty By Hyperfocusing on These Customer Needs,"Apr 4, 2024",Bidhan Baruah,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-ensure-customer-loyalty-by-focusing-on-this-customer/471775,"
A great deal of attention has been paid to improving the customer experience to grow your company. While the customer experience is critical, a related area deserves more attention: the customer's desired outcome. The terms ""customer experience,"" ""customer outcome,"" and ""customer success"" are often used interchangeably.However, each of these terms is distinctly different and represents a stage in your customer's journey. Of the three, the customer outcome can impact your company's success most. The customer outcome determines whether customers feel successful after using your product or service. Notice that I didn't say ""are successful."" They can achieve the outcome they want without ""feeling"" successful.It's the difference between a required outcome and a desired outcome.



Required vs. Desired OutcomesThe customer outcome is the goal your customer wants to achieve. Whatever it is, they can't reach it on their own; they need help. Helping them achieve their goal is why they're using your product or service.The required outcome is what they want to achieve — the bare minimum. For example, they want to rent a car. If they make a reservation with your rental business and you have a car waiting for them when they arrive, you've met their required outcome.


But do they feel successful? That depends on whether you've met their required outcome in the way they expected you to. That's the desired outcome.If they're traveling for pleasure, they may want a minivan to seat their entire family and luggage. They may want a luxury sedan to impress a client if they're traveling for business. The family vacationer and the business traveler have the same required outcome — renting a vehicle — but different desired outcomes.If, for example, they end up with each other's vehicles, you've met their required outcomes but not their desired outcomes. The sedan isn't going to fit a family plus their luggage comfortably, and the minivan isn't going to impress the client.In a nutshell, the required outcome is what the customer wants to achieve. In the above example, it's traveling from one point to another.


The desired outcome is the required outcome plus the appropriate customer experience. In the example, it's delivering the right vehicle for the family and the business traveler to make the experience seamless.Related: 9 Hidden Reasons Your Customers Will Leave YouKnow your ideal customerIn order to deliver the desired outcome, you need to learn everything you can about your ideal customer.Your ideal customer is more than just someone who might buy your product or service. An ideal customer has problems you can effectively solve. They understand your value proposition. They're not only willing to pay for your product but also purchase it frequently enough to have a high lifetime value while needing little in the way of customer support.


Your ideal customer also aligns with your brand image and values. They appreciate what your business stands for and become loyal advocates.To attract these valuable consumers, you need to know their demographics—age, gender, income, location, and similar data. You also need to know how they shop, what media they consume, their purchasing habits and so on. Learning about their interests, values and personality traits completes the picture.Tailor the customer experienceThe more you know about your ideal customer, the more you'll be able to improve the customer experience — every touchpoint, interaction, engagement — and ultimately make them feel successful when they finally use your product.The customer experience is the perception a customer forms based on all touchpoints, interactions and engagements they have with your company, your brand and your product.


Touchpoints are single moments when a customer is exposed to your company's brand, product, employees, or messaging. Every billboard, banner ad and TV commercial they see is a touchpoint. Touchpoints set an expectation of the customer experience, communicating what it's like to do business with you.Related: How Customer Success Can Supercharge Your RevenueInteractions are two-way communications between a potential customer and your business. When someone replies to a post your company makes on social media, that's an interaction. When they talk to your chatbot or customer service representative, that's an interaction. Visting your website or sharing a blog post you wrote is an interaction. Each interaction gives customers more information about the quality they can expect from your product or service.Engagements involve some level of commitment from the customer. They make an initial purchase or subscribe to your service. They make a reservation to rent a vehicle from your fleet. They sign up for a free trial. They liked your touchpoints and interactions enough to commit to doing business with you.


All of the touchpoints, interactions and engagements customers have with your business are part of the customer experience. In a way, it's a promise to the customer of how you'll treat them if they do business with you.Your company delivers on that promise when a customer achieves their desired outcome.Related: 12 Golden Rules for Customer Experience StrategyGo the extra mileHyperfocusing on the customer's desired outcome often means understanding their definition of success better than they understand it themselves.


Let's return to the example of the family renting a minivan. The parents' desired outcome is a reliable vehicle large enough to comfortably accommodate themselves, their kids and all their luggage. If that's what's waiting for them when they arrive, they'll feel successful.But when you understand what it's like to take a road trip with children, you can improve on that feeling of success. Your company might include a book of travel games the family can enjoy together, for example, or a booklet of fun day trips within driving distance — something extra that the customer didn't expect but adds to their experience.When you provide a customer experience and desired outcome that exceeds their expectations, you haven't just created a customer; you've created an advocate for your brand. They'll leave rave reviews, tell their friends and colleagues about you, and keep giving you their business for as long as you continue wowing them.

41,What Big Brands Can Learn From Mom & Pop Shops to Connect With Their Customers,"Apr 3, 2024",Ben Crudo,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/what-big-brands-can-learn-from-mom-and-pop-stores-to/470830,"
For online retailers, the pandemic sales surge is officially ancient history.Direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands are filing for bankruptcy. Luxury retailers that raced online, like Louis Vuitton and Chanel, are licking their wounds. Globally, digital retail's share of total sales has flatlined at around 20%. If you're a big brand, the prognosis can look pretty grim unless, that is, you start thinking small. Online brands that are surviving and thriving are increasingly taking a page out of the playbook of much smaller retailers — especially when it comes to tech.As the founder of an agency that helps brands with ecommerce strategy, I've seen how smaller players are driven by the need to act fast and do more with less. That means adopting new and cost-effective tech before their larger peers. Resourceful and creative, retail small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are also intimately involved with their customers online. And unlike large companies, they don't have internal silos blocking their digital progress.



All of those strengths hold valuable lessons for big and growing retailers. Here's what they can learn from smaller brands when it comes to harnessing retail tech.Related: 4 Ways to Understand the Rise and Fall of DTC Brands


For your ecommerce platform, think speed and convenienceBecause they have to move fast, small retailers typically opt for an ecommerce platform that's robust, nimble and adaptable. The quicker they can stand up a site, and the less technical expertise required to sustain it, the better.Legacy enterprise platforms — costly, clunky and hard-to-customize — have long been the go-to for big brands. In the past, these were the only tools capable of reliably handling the volume of sales and SKUs of a major retailer. But that situation has changed.When the clothing retailer Banana Republic launched its furniture and home decor wing late last year, it went with an ecommerce platform originally known for serving small creators and entrepreneurs, Shopify.Why? At this point, every up-to-date platform has lots of bells and whistles. What actually matters isn't individual features as much as usability and flexibility. Does the platform have low barriers to launching a retail site? Does it have a robust app ecosystem that's integrated with its services? (Delivering on that front is Shopify, which has a marketplace of roughly 3,000 apps.) When it comes time to customize your site, does the platform have a host of agency and technology partners who can help get the job done?Think of choosing a platform like buying a car. You want something reliable, safe and easy to service — even if you may not know exactly how everything works under the hood.Outsource tech setup and customizationUnlike many other big retailers, Banana Republic also knew better than to build its own online platform. Major brands often fall into that trap, hiring huge engineering teams tasked with keeping ecommerce in-house.


News flash: Retailers aren't technology companies. They wouldn't rely on their in-house counsel to handle sensitive legal matters. So how is it any different for retail tech, a point of direct contact with customers?Retail SMBs are big fans of brand-new technology, with two-thirds saying they're open to embracing it. But startups know that the highest value comes from time spent on strategy, not getting in the weeds of implementation. That's why it's often better to outsource tech setup to an ecommerce agency.Because such firms typically deal with many different businesses, they have no shortage of tips and tricks to offer clients. They can also select the right platform, find the smart people a brand needs to compete online and play a key role in site customization.Related: 4 Ways Brands Can Educate Their Customers and Win Hearts


Invest in a direct line to customersSmaller online retailers also understand the power of using tech to connect directly with customers. This, after all, was the original promise of DTC commerce. Instead of sending your customers to a big box store or other middleman, you could cultivate a direct, personal relationship — providing better service and building lifetime loyalty in the process.To make the most of this pipeline, small retailers have long embraced tools that facilitate conversational commerce, i.e., one-on-one digital conversations with consumers. Way back in 2016, online clothing retailer Spring created its own live messaging and personal shopping service.Today, this trend continues. Because video, generative AI and other newer technologies for connecting with shoppers are affordable and accessible, smaller retailers have been first out of the gate with them, too. For example, energy drink startup EBoost is using shopper data to create ""digital twins"" of customers, then harnessing generative AI to chat with them, gaining insights into shoppers' future behavior.Small brands also excel at personalizing customer experiences and using technology to take this to the next level. This can take the form of everything from virtual appointments with in-store salespeople to fully personalized product recommendations based on customer history and preferences.Besides shrinking customer acquisition costs by as much as 50%, personalization can boost revenue by 5 to 15% and marketing ROI by 10 to 30%. Seven out of 10 consumers expect companies to offer personalized interactions, and three-quarters get frustrated when they don't deliver.Big brands are increasingly taking a page from this playbook. Through Nike By You, for instance, shoppers can create custom shoes by using a 3D model to choose colors and materials, plus their own ID.


Break down walls that hinder sales strategyBesides knowing their customers, small retailers have a clear, detailed picture of their ecommerce business itself — another strength that bigger players should strive to emulate.That's because their IT, customer service, merchandising and other departments are all — by necessity — in constant communication. So it's easier to see that the higher cost of drawing site traffic is hurting sales margins, for example, or that long shipping times are driving customers away. Smaller retailers can pounce on such problems and fix them.Big brands? Not so much. All of those business functions tend to be siloed, creating roadblocks that frustrate growth. In a recent survey by customer relationship management company Zendesk, only about one in five business leaders said their teams share data well.Here, too, choosing the right tools can help. Look for an ecommerce platform that gathers all of the crucial metrics — sales, conversion rate, visitor sessions — together in one place. It should also let retailers dig into and visualize that data with ease and then share it easily across the company.


For retail brands, technology is ultimately a means to an end: connecting with and serving customers. In a tough market, making smart tech choices can go a long way toward closing that gap.

42,How to Maintain Brand Authenticity in an Increasingly Skeptical World,"Apr 3, 2024",Christine Alemany,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-maintain-brand-authenticity-in-a-skeptical-world/471826,"
The digital world has made it more challenging than ever for brands to stand out in what is fast becoming an increasingly competitive, overly crowded marketplace. These days, what truly makes or breaks a brand is authenticity. It is an important factor in determining which brands to support for 88% of consumers, according to Stackla, with another 46% saying they would willingly pay more for a brand they trust, according to Salsify.Trust, in particular, is the foundation of all relationships, including those between consumers and brands. It helps establish a connection, and that connection can build loyalty. The problem is that a growing number of scandals and corporate wrongdoings have eroded people's faith in many institutions. And in an era characterized by bias, misinformation and inflated corporate profits, brand trust is not what it used to be. Edelman found that about 30% of consumers believe that businesses spread false or misleading information. That is troubling.How brands can build trust in a digital world is still a matter up for debate, largely because what it means for a brand to be authentic is hard to pin down. What does it mean to be truly authentic? How exactly do you convey authenticity to consumers? Cultivating and maintaining brand authenticity is tricky, and each brand will do things differently. However, there are a few steps that all brand leaders can take to get started:



Related: How to Build an Authentic Brand1. Establish boundariesTrustworthy businesses stay in their lane. They understand who they are and come to market with a distinct brand commitment. More importantly, they never stray from that commitment, which can go a long way in building consumer trust online. Setting boundaries for your brand not only helps you navigate the digital realm but also focuses your time and resources on what matters.


LEGO understood this out of the gate, setting its boundaries within the play ethos. The brand focused on its impact: to create a toy that prepares a child for life. This ethos extends beyond the product. Even its charitable arm, the LEGO Foundation, was established with a mission to empower children to become life-long learners.Keep in mind, however, that boundaries are meant to be formative rather than restrictive. Use these boundaries to inform marketing efforts, business decisions and the like. Rely on them to institute guidelines on how employees interact with consumers on social media channels. Each channel is a large sandbox with lots of people playing. Be careful that anyone who represents your business does not contradict your brand ideals.2. Build credibilityCredibility takes years to build, and it can be lost instantly. Transparency helps, especially when it comes to the ""why"" of your brand. With transparency, few questions remain about your purpose or value. Many newer brands also go so far as to show how the ""sausage is made"" or bring their target audience into a beta in the hopes of encouraging word of mouth and consumer trust online.Even after credibility is built, you can never take your eye off the ball. Consumers are one Google search away from finding out if you are being disingenuous or spinning a story for your benefit. Once they see you overstep, they are going to question every step you take going forward. Perception is reality, after all. Keep your messaging free of spin, and never sidestep an inconvenient truth.


If you're unsure how consumers view your brand, monitor social media. Put out a survey. Hold a focus group. Get to know what customers consider important. Engaging allows you to gauge sentiments and get a read on whether your brand is actually staying in the lane you have chosen. Then, implement changes that address consumers' feedback and monitor the impact. Showing customers that you value their opinions can lead to long-lasting relationships and a stellar reputation.Related: How to Build Credibility and Trust With Effective Content Creation3. Be consistentConsistency is one of the hallmarks of authenticity, and it entails more than visual branding. No matter the channel, all the messaging from your business should align with your brand identity, mission and values. Otherwise, mistrust, if not suspicion, will quickly set in.Dr. Bronner's is an excellent example of how a brand can take consistency to another level. Its founder believed in creating products that have a positive impact on the people who make them and the greater community, leading to the brand's cosmic principles. These principles are not just words on a label but the foundation of the business. Whether expanding public awareness of environmental and social issues or sourcing fair trade ingredients, there is never doubt about what Dr. Bronner's stands for.


This is not to say your brand can never evolve. Consistency and adaptability can coexist, but a brand evolution should be deliberate and public when it involves changing your position or purpose. And though you might lose customers, keeping mum is a far cry from how to maintain brand authenticity during periods of brand transitions. If you do make a change, however, keep your finger on the pulse of your customer base. Are you following through on your promises? Are you prioritizing the issues most critical to them?Related: Why Consistency Is Vital to Your Branding EffortsThe fight for consumer trust is ongoing, and it will not end any time soon. How brands build trust in a digital world begins with authenticity. Savvy leaders understand the need to leverage this concept to build profitable, sustainable businesses that stand the test of time.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features 29-year-old Jason Nelson, who turned his wedding entertainment side hustle into full-time business The Essential Jason Nelson. Image Credit: Michael Romeo CreationsWhat was your day job when you started your side hustle, and why were you interested in entrepreneurship?When I started playing the saxophone and piano for weddings, private events and nightlife in 2019, I worked as an email marketing coordinator for a retail company in the New Jersey suburbs. I've always been extremely passionate about chasing happiness over money, so becoming an entrepreneur happened by coincidence when I discovered a way to combine my love for entertaining others with my love for mainstream party music.



Related: I Started a Semi-Passive Side Hustle That Earns $33,000 a Week on Amazon: 'Selling There Is a No-BrainerHappiness for me is the ability to wake up every day to do what I love and know that my work makes a difference in the lives of others. After all, being able to entertain over 200 wedding couples during the happiest day of their lives and hearing the phrase, ""You were literally the life of the party. You made our wedding — we couldn't imagine it without you,"" truly humbles me and makes me want to entertain as many people as I can all over the world.


When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it? While I started my side hustle in March 2019, I've played the piano for more than 21 years and the alto saxophone for over 18 years. From an early age, I learned that I have a perfect pitch which has allowed me to play any song by ear.When I attended Rutgers, I became obsessed with mainstream house music. During my free time in college, I enjoyed spending hundreds of hours mixing dance tracks in my DJ software program to make mixes for my friends to play at parties (and even DJ'ed for my friends at parties from time to time, too). Around 2015, I started an Instagram account where I posted short videos of popular songs on the piano and sax (The Chainsmokers, Post Malone, Blink-182, Fetty Wap, etc.) and eventually was hired by a friend's sister to play cocktail hour piano at her wedding. She also had me play along with the DJ for her intro to her reception, and I ended up staying the entire wedding.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I was so attracted to the adrenaline rush from my first wedding that I became obsessed with replicating the feeling. I contacted several entertainment companies in the New Jersey/New York area and quickly started getting booked to play at events. Above any compliments I received about my musical talents on the sax and piano, I kept hearing the word ""energy."" ""Oh my God, you literally have so much energy"" and ""You're literally the life of the party"" were two phrases I heard over and over again, so I realized that my passion for entertaining others far outweighed any passion I've ever had for music.Related: This Gen Zer's Stylish Side Hustle Earns About $20,000 a Month and Paid Off His Parents' $200,000 Debt: 'I Enjoy the Hands-Off Nature'


While playing several events each weekend, I focused on building relationships with different vendors in my industry, including DJs, event planners, photographers, videographers and other entertainers. I also continued gathering content (both photo and video) from my events to grow my Instagram and TikTok accounts, where at least 50% of my event leads now come from. I'm so fortunate to be able to post content from weddings and other events and have the opportunity to reach virtually anyone across the entire world, which has led me to travel for incredible destination events in places like Puerto Rico, St. Maarten, and later this year, Aruba and Dubai.@essentialjasonnelson Wedding guest energy was off the charts at this one ?? #weddings #destinationweddings #rosecliffmansion #rosecliffmansionwedding #theknot #weddingwire #bridetobe ♬ original sound - THE ESSENTIAL JASON NELSONWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?I wanted to leave my 9-5 marketing job at the start of 2020, but once the pandemic hit in March, I lost practically all of my event bookings lined up for the rest of the year. However, I was so fortunate to still have a paycheck and work from home when most full-time event industry professionals were shut down. I remained patient and continued to grow my side hustle by networking virtually, posting content and working on the administrative part of my business because I knew it was only a matter of time before events came back. Sure enough, we saw a surge of events being played (including weddings) in 2021, and I knew I made the right decision to leave the 9-5 world.Since the majority of my event bookings are operated through my LLC (I don't have an agent or any employees), a few years ago, when I started receiving an increase in demand for myself at events, there was a period when I was overwhelmed with how manual the booking process was (scheduling calls, sending contracts and invoices, etc.). However, I started automating my booking process in 2022 using HoneyBook, which I now use to automate the process from a client inquiry through booking. I have so much more free time to devote to innovating my entertainment style in the ever-changing industry and can focus on getting myself physically ready to be on my feet and bring energy to the dance floor for many hours each weekend.Related: I Was a 25-Year-Old Nurse When I Started a Side Hustle to Combat Anxiety.

How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?Within the first year of launching my side hustle, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to play the sax at Angelina Pivarnick of Jersey Shore's wedding and the grand opening party for The Edge NYC. Events like these so early on in my career gave me the confidence to want to take my side hustle full-time. I was on track to earn between $45,000 and $50,000 in 2020, and at the time, my goal was to find a way to replace my email marketing income.You've since turned the side hustle into a full-time business. What does total revenue look like now?I currently earn between $150,000 and $175,000 a year playing events and was fortunate to make $176,000 in 2023.What do you enjoy most about running your own business?Being able to share my love of entertaining others through joyful celebrations is what I love most about owning my own business. I also love the ability to set my own schedule and decide when I want to work and when I want to take time off for myself. I'm so thankful that I have full control over my business and continue to strive to find the perfect balance between my career and my personal life.Related: 4 Simple Mistakes That Can Crush Your Creative Side Hustle, From an Expert Who Raised $45 Million to Support Independent Workers


What's your advice for others hoping to start successful side hustles of their own?Ask yourself the question, If money didn't exist, what would you do? I never feel like I'm working because I love what I do. While it may be frustrating to not see an immediate ROI with customers and sales, continue to build your business based on what you'd do if money didn't exist so you can continue to have fun along the way and not get lost in why you started the business in the first place. Always be prepared, show up on time, strive to work well with others and be able to adapt to any and all situations.Find your strengths and triple down on them. What sets you apart from everybody else?Also, use social media to your advantage, especially since it's absolutely free to post! You never know what might happen by being unafraid to share your story with the world. Be yourself, and I promise you, there will be someone who will resonate with you and your story.This article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of being a Young Entrepreneur®.

45,How to Choose the Right AI Partner for Your Business,"Mar 29, 2024",Adam Chandler,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/a-checklist-for-selecting-an-ai-partner/471570,"
Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and automation is more than a trend — it's a strategic imperative. It has been shown that ""60% of business owners believe AI will increase productivity,"" and ""42% believe it will streamline job processes.""Selecting the right partner is crucial for marketing professionals aiming to increase location owner adoption, boost visibility at a corporate level and streamline operations and advertising. Let's discuss the key considerations to help guide marketing experts in this journey.The essential considerationsThe first thing to consider is expertise and experience. When evaluating potential partners, assess their track record in driving location owner adoption. Look for partners with proven experience in implementing successful marketing strategies and automation techniques tailored for streamlined operations and increased adoption at the local level.



When referring to proven experience, this includes asking the right questions. What are those? For starters, what is their average increase in location adoption rates per brand? How do they safeguard their technology and client data to ensure trust and transparency? Do they have clients you can speak with and receive testimonials from that can speak to the specific challenges your brand and team are facing?Related: 4 Ways AI Is Revolutionizing Targeted Advertising — And How to Balance Its Ethical Implications


Next, look at the customization and scalability factors. Effective marketing strategies require tailored approaches. Ensure your partner implements client feedback and grows to customize their AI solutions to enhance location-specific initiatives. Regarding scalability, check to see that corporate-level visibility and expansion are seamlessly integrated.The third key factor to assess when looking for a compatible marketing partner is whether their existing technologies are compatible with your marketing goals. A capable partner should provide easy integration for an efficient and cohesive advertising ecosystem, ensuring that all parts work harmoniously together. One way to check on this is to conduct a pilot project that tests integration capabilities. Other things you should consider for a vendor partner checklist include:Scalability — Confirm that the vendor's solution can scale to meet the brand's growing needs and user base.Data Security — Ensure that the vendor complies with data security and privacy standards relevant to the industry.Performance Metrics — Define key performance indicators (KPIs) and ensure the vendor can provide relevant metrics.Customization Options — Access the level of customization the vendor allows to tailor the solution to your brand's specific requirements, voice and standards.User Experience — Evaluate the impact of the integration on the overall user experience for both internal teams and location owners.Ongoing Support and Maintenance—Confirm the vendor's availability to support your brand's team members and assess how they troubleshoot and provide maintenance.Compliance — Verify that the vendor's solution can seamlessly interact with other third-party tools and services.Testing and QA Processes — Discuss the vendor's testing and quality assurance processes to ensure a smooth integration and minimize potential issues.Updates and Upgrades — Ask about the frequency of updates and upgrades to the vendor's solution and their process for ensuring backward compatibility.Related: AI is the Antithesis of Authenticity — But There's Hope. Here's How We Can Align Our Human Values with AI.Going beyond the basicsIt's time to take your search a step further. All the components highlighted above are indicators of a successful integration and trial period with a partner brand, but let's get team-specific.


In any partnership, you want to ensure transparency and communication are at the forefront. Effective collaboration demands clear communication channels. Choose a partner emphasizing transparency in processes, timelines and potential challenges. This ensures a smooth workflow and minimizes potential disruptions. Also, check to see that this possible partner is not only your time and communication but also that of your location owners. Assess how they will interact with your brand owners and what that may look like on an ongoing basis. Is this the communication they need? Can they provide aid, guidance and support to your leadership team and individual location owners? If the answer is yes, this may be your perfect partner.Marketing strategies are dynamic, requiring partners who can adapt to change. Assess a potential partner's flexibility in accommodating new marketing strategies, changes and feedback to ensure dynamic and effective advertising campaigns. Also, the importance of a cost-effective partnership cannot be overstated. Evaluate the overall value proposition, ensuring that your investment translates into increased ROI And efficient budget utilization.Related: 5 Trends Shaping the Next Generation of Digital MarketingUse your case studies to your advantage.Real-world examples offer valuable insights. Explore case studies and success stories showcasing how a specific AI/automation partner has contributed to location owner adoption, corporate visibility and improved marketing efficiency. The brand's clients are the biggest examples of what you have in store and the leaps and bounds your brand may be able to jump when you partner with them.


In conclusion, selecting the right AI/automation partner for enhanced marketing strategies requires a thoughtful and thorough evaluation. By prioritizing expertise, customization, integration capabilities and other vital considerations, marketing professionals can forge partnerships that meet and exceed their goals — ultimately driving increased location owner adoption, corporate visibility and a more streamlined and practical approach to advertising.

46,You'll Never Succeed in a Complex Market Unless You Try These Strategies,"Mar 29, 2024",Tim Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/try-these-proven-strategies-to-stand-out-in-complex-markets/470697,"
An issue many marketing teams face today is how to successfully differentiate their company and product suite in a complex and ever-evolving industry. Achieving this differentiation results in multiple benefits, including a shorter sales cycle and higher margins. But success requires taking a new look at all aspects of the company's brand and marketing program.I began thinking about this article last April as I walked through the RSA conference, one of the cybersecurity industry's flagship events. A remarkable number of companies in different segments of cybersecurity made similar claims, to the point that despite serving a wide range of cybersecurity companies over approximately 25 years, I had difficulty discerning the differences in their value propositions.Throughout this article, I use the cybersecurity industry as an example, but the points here apply to a wide range of other industries as well.Related: 3 Ways to Differentiate Your Business in a Competitive MarketDefining a complex industryThere are multiple factors that can cause a marketing team to consider their market a complex one. Three of these include:



Multiple, discrete sub-segments: Complex industries typically include a wide range of sub-segments that are discrete, but often may have some overlap. To obtain a complete solution, customers often have to purchase solutions representing multiple sub-segments. In cybersecurity, just a few of these sub-segments include infrastructure, network, endpoint, application and IoT security — all achieving something similar, but within different areas of a network.Significant revenue potential: Complex industries typically offer solutions highly valued by customers, who are willing to invest aggressively, leading to ongoing, rapid growth in the industry. Grand View Research estimated the global cybersecurity market topped $222 billion in sales in 2023 and is projected to grow at a 12.3% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2030.Fiercely competitive: Two conditions tend to make complex industries highly competitive. First, the significant revenue potential attracts a large number of players, often companies with deep pockets. And, because the barriers to entry between sub-segments can be low, these players can sometimes make relatively simple changes to their products to compete in different sub-segments. The code written to create endpoint security solutions can be rewritten to create an IoT security solution with relative ease versus starting from scratch.Strategies to create differentiationSome approaches to create differentiation are obvious, others are more subtle. In brief, here are three ways to make your organization stand out in a crowded pack:Define anew who you are: A very useful exercise is to take a new look at how you define your organization based on models such as Simon Sinek's Golden Circle, built on answering the deceptively simple questions of what, how and why your organization does what it does, starting with the most difficult question: Defining your why — like ""We started XX to develop new medicines to save children"" — can create powerful bonds with your customers beyond product speeds and feeds.Look for competitor weaknesses: Seek out where your organization and products excel and your competitors may have weaknesses. Is your code more efficient, is your customer service better? These are areas where you can create distance between your organization and competitors.Find unmet customer needs: Companies that successfully answer the ""why"" of their organization often receive a greater level of trust and loyalty from their customers. This enables them to more honestly communicate and gain feedback from their customers, allowing them to identify unmet needs that, if fulfilled, enhance that trust and loyalty.Related: Stop Working So Hard. Differentiate Yourself Instead.And then the question becomes how to communicate your organization's differentiation. Here are several proven, effective suggestions:Update your value proposition and ensure it is included prominently in all customer touchpoints. On your website, for example, in addition to being front and center on your home page, it should be communicated throughout your site.Define your market graphically. Create a Gartner magic quadrant or similar style graphic that definitively highlights your organization's unique value proposition versus competitors.Consider independent testing. If your organization is claiming differentiation based on the performance of your hardware or software, securing validation testing from an independent, third-party expert source can be valuable. Because these expert sources must protect their reputations, their opinions are seen by customers and others as highly credible.Keep your messaging simple. In many business sectors, especially in tech, messaging often involves jargon that can be impenetrable. Keeping messaging simple is almost always more powerful and cuts through the noise of jargon.Maintain a high profile. Building and supporting an active, multi-functional marketing program gives your organization the levers to continuously reinforce your differentiation.Additional benefits of enhanced differentiationThe most obvious benefit of creating differentiation is ensuring customers and prospects understand your value proposition when they are making purchases. Other benefits can include:


Better quality leads: Prospects that better understand your organization's value proposition and continue to interact are much more likely to actually need your product or service.Reduced sales cycle: Higher-quality, more informed leads will make purchase decisions faster, reducing the resources required from your sales team to close deals.Higher margins: Better quality leads that close faster and understand your organization's value proposition are often more likely to expand their engagement with you if you fulfill your value proposition.Easier recruiting: If prospective employees have a clear idea of your organization's value proposition and its differentiating versus ""one of the pack,"" they will be more likely to accept a position offered.More effective fundraising: Organizations that carve out a unique position for themselves and own that position are more likely to secure funding. VCs and other investors typically look for portfolio companies with a clear, unique offering.Related: Your Differentiators Suck. Follow These 5 Steps to Stand Out From Your Competition.There are many benefits to operating in complex markets in terms of market need, potential profitability and expansion opportunities. But the key to successful operations is developing and supporting a clearly differentiated value proposition that separates your organization from potential competitors.

47,3 Emerging Trends Shaping the Future of Real Estate,"Mar 28, 2024",Jessica Wong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/these-real-estate-trends-are-set-to-change-the-market/471590,"
Marketing has always been central to successful real estate sales, but how buyers and properties connect has changed dramatically over the past decade. While real estate agents still place signs on front lawns, digital technology has become the tool of choice for leading realtors. Conducting virtual tours, using augmented reality (AR) applications and artificial intelligence (AI) are just three trends poised to change the industry.Digital technology in real estate marketingDigital technology is critical to successful real estate marketing. According to data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), 97% of homebuyers used the internet to find a property in 2020. Granted, that figure may have been influenced by the pandemic. However, more recent data confirms the trend.Figures from 2023 show that more than four in ten homebuyers start their search online, and 50% of buyers are finding their next property online. With one exception, all generations are likely to see their new home online before contacting a realtor. The only exception is the so-called 'silent generation' of people born between 1928 and 1946. Their search tends to commence by contacting a real estate agent.



The picture is clear — without digital technology, real estate sales would be impossible, and more than 90% of realtors use relevant tools daily, including social media, websites and other channels. To truly stand out, though, realtors need to look to emerging technologies.Related: This Is the Secret Sauce Behind Effective AI and ML Technology


1. Transforming the viewing experience with virtual toursDuring the pandemic, in-person property viewings and open house events became impossible. Even before 2020, these viewings were less than ideal for buyers not living locally. To bridge the gap between properties and buyers, agents used professional imagery.The pandemic forced real estate agents to offer something better than still images, giving birth to virtual tours of properties. Virtual tours 'walk' potential buyers through a property, often while filming what viewers would have seen, to provide them with an experience that comes close to visiting the house in person.Virtual tours benefit both buyers and sellers. Aside from offering a more engaging overall experience, prospective buyers better understand the property before committing to a viewing. Sellers will also find the process more convenient, as they have to show the property less frequently.Today, statistics show that listings featuring videos attract more than 400% more attention than others. Virtual tour developers Walk Us Through Ltd cite the example of Seattle-based Redfin Corporation, whose listings with virtual tours receive 50% more views than those without. Those properties also sell faster and for a higher price than comparable listings.


2. Leveraging augmented reality in real estate marketingAugmented reality applications take property visibility one step further. Through AR, buyers can not only see what the property looks like at the moment but also overlay digital information to test a different look.AR allows real estate agents to stage properties in different styles to suit buyers. Rather than taking a virtual tour of an empty, undecorated property, viewers can compare various furnishing styles or change the designated use of rooms to a degree. An easy way of thinking about AR is to imagine moving furniture around the property without doing any of the heavy lifting.One of the main goals of in-person viewings is to give potential buyers a chance to imagine themselves living in that property. AR allows them to do just that, only to a higher degree. Real estate agents offering their clients this experience can choose from various applications.3. How AI influences real estateArguably, artificial intelligence has recently captured more headlines than any other emerging technology. Its strength lies in distilling actionable information from vast quantities of data. In real estate marketing, agents can use AI to process prospective buyer information and deliver personalized property recommendations.


AI can also be a good first point of contact for new customer inquiries, connecting the right customer to the most suitable agent within a company. By delivering personalized property recommendations, AI is not replacing human agents but helping them work more efficiently.Consider a location with a lot of housing stock available. A real estate agent can't remember all the details of those properties. Conversely, AI thrives at crunching data that helps deliver the best possible customer experience.In addition, real estate agents save time. Rather than showing their clients many properties, which can be time-consuming, they can take buyers directly to those houses that best match their requirements.Taking advantage of these emerging technologies could be easier than many real estate agents think. Aside from working with a dedicated developer, agents can use ready-made applications to enhance their property listings and create a more engaging experience for their clients.


The goal is to work smarter rather than harder and accelerate property sales overall. Delivering a more customized client experience contributes to that goal while increasing overall client satisfaction. Perhaps most importantly, embracing these emerging technologies will allow agents to position themselves as leaders in their market.Related: 5 Ways AI Can Help Real Estate AgentsThe future of real estate marketingJust a few years ago, virtual tours of a property would have been a figment of the imagination. Technological developments and the pandemic's influence have made those tours an integral part of countless property sales.As technologies like AI and AR continue to develop, the real estate sector is only beginning to explore them. Future developments in AR could include a wider choice of more realistic staging options. Buyers may also be able to explore the neighborhood they are considering without ever having to leave their homes. Understanding and implementing them now is critical to real estate agents' success.

Her Product Was in Macy's Within the Year — Seeing Nearly $350,000 in Sales.","Mar 28, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/her-shocking-discovery-led-to-a-side-hustle-and-over-300k/471768,"
In 2022, Elenor Mak, now founder of doll company Jilly Bing, was busy balancing her business development role at a healthcare company and raising her 2-year-old and 4-year-old children. Back then, she ""was definitely not looking to start"" a side hustle. She'd founded an ecommerce fashion company in the past and knew what it took to get a business up and running. But that changed when her young daughter Jillian began playing with stuffed animals and dolls.Image Credit: Courtesy of Jilly Bing. Elenor Mak.""It reminded me of my own childhood,"" Mak tells Entrepreneur. ""You're playing with dolls; you're trying to make sense of the world. She was bossing her dolls around, like, 'Eat your dinner. Wash your hands.' Acting like a mom. Not in those words, but at age two, sort of using those words, simpler versions of those words.""



Related: How to Go From Side Hustle to 7-Figure Business and Beyond, According to 3 Women Who Did ItOne day, Mak's mother gave her granddaughter a ""beautiful blonde, blue-eyed doll."" When Mak asked her why she'd chosen that doll instead of one that looked like her daughter, her mother said, ""It was the prettiest one on the shelf."" Despite knowing her mother meant well, Mak found those words ""so heavy,"" a reminder of her own experience with lack of representation as a child.


""They gave them an Asian name, like Ling, or like a bad haircut. It was so shocking and disappointing.""Mak decided to buy her daughter a doll that looked like her and figured it would be a straightforward process: Because I live in San Francisco, and it's 2022. But it wasn't. Her local toy store didn't have one. Neither did the second she visited. Or the third. The toy aisles at major retailers like Target and Toys""R""Us seemed as though they ""had not evolved"" since Mak was a kid, nearly four decades before.""There were just rows and rows of Caucasian dolls, brunettes, and then at the very end of the aisle, you would have these dolls that I think were intended to be Asian because they were holding a panda bear,"" Mak recalls. ""They gave them an Asian name, like Ling, or like a bad haircut. It was so shocking and disappointing.""Mak looked to Asia for more options, but asking her relatives what they could find only turned up ""Eurasian-looking dolls,"" she says, adding that ""dolls largely represent what society thinks is beautiful, and in Asia, what's beautiful is still the Caucasian sort of features."" Mak remembered wishing she were beautiful like the dolls she had growing up, and ""her mommy bear instincts"" kicked in — she was determined to get her daughter a doll that looked like her, even if she had to make it herself.

Although she admits the creative component wasn't where she excelled (""My 6-year-old son is a better artist than me,"" she quips), she had a clear vision when it came to the business side and the potential for major demand: ""The Asian American population is one of the fastest-growing — we're 7% of the country's population.""And how hard could it be to make a doll in an age where we're churning out Teslas and developing AI? She recalls thinking. As it turns out, ""it's really hard — really hard — to make a good doll,"" Mak says. Fortunately, her business background helped her develop an essential ""superpower"": ""finding really good people."" Mak did cold outreaches to Asian designers at large toy brands and leveraged her own extensive network to connect with professionals who could bring the dream to life.


Image Credit: Courtesy of Jilly Bing. Elenor Mak and her daughter Jillian with the Jilly doll.By June 2022, they had their team of four. Mak conducted a lot of research over the next several months, speaking with Asian families and looking at photographs of kids and dolls to really try to understand what parents wanted. ""It's not just about saying, 'Oh, this doll's Asian,'"" Mak says. ""But what mattered to them? What were the features? What were the backstories?"" In December of that year, the prototype for Jilly Bing, named for Mak's daughter Jillian and the Chinese word for cookie, ""bing gan"" (Jillian's first word), was ready to share with the world.Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a Month""Adult women would write in and be like, 'Oh my gosh, it's like healing for my inner child.'""Jilly Bing started shipping dolls in August 2023 — and sold out of its stock of 2,000 within six weeks. Greta Gerwig's blockbuster hit Barbie had also put the spotlight on dolls that summer, ""opening up the national conversation"" and presenting ""an opportunity for us to change the narrative for not just our Asian children, but all children,"" Mak says. At that point, Mak realized the ""high-risk, high-effort"" passion project she'd worked on as a side hustle for the past couple of years — taking late-night business calls after her kids were asleep and balancing it all with her full-time day job — would benefit from her undivided attention.Jilly Bing also appeared on the Today show around that time, and the positive response was ""overwhelming."" ""Adult women would write in and be like, 'Oh my gosh, it's like healing for my inner child. Life would have been so different if I had a doll that looked like me growing up,'"" Mak says. ""Even non-Asian parents writing [in to say], 'Oh my gosh, I think my kids should have dolls that look like their friends.'""By early this year, Jilly Bing was on shelves at Macy's; the retailer reached out after the Today segment.

""Seeing the kids' reactions to having a doll that looks like them keeps me going [more than] everything else.""To date, Jilly Bing has sold approximately 5,000 dolls, Mak says. At $68 apiece, that's more than $300,000 in sales.And Mak's favorite part about running her business? That would be the testimonials from her young customers. ""It's seeing the photos,"" Mak says. ""And hearing the stories [from them] — and my own daughter — saying, 'She looks like me. She has black hair like me.' [And] little Asian boys saying, 'She's beautiful like my mama.' It's just seeing the kids' reactions to having a doll that looks like them that keeps me going [more than] everything else.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Jilly Bing. 


Mak had to ""trust her gut"" to start the side hustle turned full-fledged business that's leaving its mark on the toy industry and beyond, and she looks forward to building the brand out in the years to come.""I am most excited about being able to create characters,"" Mak says. ""We started to branch into comics because it's a doll, but we're starting to create the stories. I've got a vision of a whole cast of Asian American characters that actually reflect what Asian America looks like today. We have mixed Asian children, you have boys, you have Southeast Asian. Jilly's our first doll, so I'm excited to grow and introduce the world to the rest of Jilly Bing's friends.""

49,5 Ways to Get on the Media's Good Side (and Stay There),"Mar 28, 2024",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-get-on-the-medias-good-side/470500,"
In this on-screen world we all share, the surest way to get your business noticed is through all the various media channels people see on their devices, whether that's inclusion in newsfeeds, articles in online news outlets, featured segments on TV shows, appearances on podcasts, video clips on YouTube or, of course, promotional bits across all the other ubiquitous social media platforms.And how do you get on those channels? Through media people themselves — all the journalists, reporters, influencers, and publication writers and editors who receive your pitches, read your press releases, view your videos and decide who will get a chance to appear onstage … and who will linger in the wings.But anyone and everyone is vying for the media's attention. You can significantly increase your odds of getting some by establishing friendly relations with your contact people and outlets of choice. As a 20-year public relations veteran, here are some of my tips and tricks of the trade for forming viable and valuable connections with the media.



Let's start off by emphasizing that the goal here isn't just to get on the media's good side; even more importantly, you want to stay away from their bad side by refraining from annoying habits and intrusions. Follow these guidelines, and you'll have friends in the sandbox with you in no time!Habit #1: Be (a little) patientRome wasn't built in a day, nor will your company's empire. As you're trying to grow your reputation and industry standing, you can't expect immediate responses from media people, who get thousands — literally thousands — of inquiries a week. If you haven't heard back for a while, you can follow up the same week you initially reached out, but never the same day or even the next day.


Some news is timely, yes, like your Fourth of July promotion or your Christmas Wish List idea, so it's understandable you'd get antsy waiting for a response. But it's on you, not the media contact, to make sure your pitches are submitted in time to get them in front of the right eyes. For items that aren't time-sensitive, patience will get you further than prodding. I'm not saying to just wait around and hope for the best; I'm saying to wait a respectful amount of time for the individual to field and research your message, which shows respect for their role and the pressures they're under.Related: 8 Etiquette Tips to Stay on the Good Side of the MediaHabit #2: Reinforce instead of repeatWhen it is appropriate to nudge a little? Don't just send the exact same message, duplicating the original content. Rather, add something new of value to your message — something that makes your pitch even stronger or more appealing.Say you're trying to get coverage for a new wellness supplement; you can remind the media person that you sent them an email on so-and-so date, but then explain that they might also like to know that your product comes in at a 20% lower price point than its closest competitor and include a testimonial from a satisfied customer. Now they have more information to lure them, not just the same information you previously sent.


Habit #3: Communicate, don't just contactReaching out to the media should entail more than just ""making contact."" What you want to make is impact. You do that by crafting your submissions into meaningful communication as opposed to just a dry inquiry of interest. Embed links the reader can follow to get more detail. Include a really well-selected image or two to add visual interest. Invite the media person to engage with the content somehow.Example: My firm recently submitted a pitch for National Margarita Day for one of my restaurant clients. We incorporated a captivating image of a frothy marg in a stunning glass next to a plate of mouthwatering nachos. We promised the TV producer that if they booked a demo segment with our client's master bartender, they'd get to sample the drinks and eats afterward.Habit #4: Get personalThe more you ""send out"" to the media, the more you'll ""take in"" about particular contacts and relationships you're forging. For instance, you might hear back from someone who apologizes for not getting back to you sooner because they were out on maternity leave. Or a reply might mention that they'll follow up with you when they return from vacation.When and if you acquire personal intel like this, file it away and use it! Make sure your next message congratulates them on their new parenthood or asks how their vacation went. You can even add a line about your own parenting experience or recall a great restaurant you tried when you went to Barbados too. There's so much formality and form-letter-type communications in media relations that when something comes over with a bit of sincerity and warmth, it'll stand out more.


Related: 3 Ways to Attract Media CoverageHabit #5: Practice perseveranceYou know that mom you see at the soccer games who seems really cool and interesting? That guy you see in the cafeteria whose fashion style you admire? You asked her to lunch, but she couldn't go that day. You approached him to introduce yourself, and he said he was sorry, but he had to answer his ringing phone. If you genuinely hope to make a connection with this person, you gotta keep extending your hand, extending the invitation, extending effort.The same applies to connecting with the media. If a pitch doesn't get picked up, don't take it personally, just pitch again another day, another way. Instead of making your outreach about ""Look at me, publish me, promote me!"" make it about how what you're pitching will benefit the media person's audience, readership or followership.Stay in touch. Be assertive but not aggressive, persistent but not pesky. Show your personality in your outreach, which will allow the recipients of your efforts to show a little of theirs in kind.


All these tips might not land you what you're looking for right of the gate. But you'll be more welcome at the door and you'll be closer to your goal of establishing a two-way, mutually beneficial relationship — maybe even a friendship — with a select group of media personnel influential in your area of business.

50,31 Ways to Market Your Business on a Budget,"Mar 28, 2024",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/no-money-no-problem-30-low-budget-marketing-ideas-for/327097,"
As the old adage goes, you have to spend money to make money — so if you want your business to grow, you need to devote resources to marketing and advertising. But if you're on a tight budget, you don't have to wait until your coffers are full. Instead, use these 31 low-budget marketing and advertising ideas to get your name and product out there without breaking the bank. Be sure to read on for key tips from advertising experts about how to scale your promotional efforts. 1. Hone Your PitchYou never know who you'll run into, so always be prepared to market your business. The most effective way to do this is by having a compelling elevator pitch — something that you can break out in a moment's notice without it feeling too rehearsed. It's not easy, especially because most people have short attention spans. 



How can you perfect your elevator pitch? A few tips: Know what motivates your audience.Tell a concise story that shows your expertise.Anticipate key questions about your competitive advantage.2. Get Involved in Your Community When people think of marketing, they often think of large-scale national campaigns. But sometimes it's best to think small and see what's happening at a local level. Sponsor a 5k race or a Little League team, set up a table at a local event or print bookmarks and leave them at the library. Your own community is probably more dynamic than you think, so don't overlook ways to grow your business right at home.3. Ask for ReferralsReferrals are among the most effective — and cost-effective — ways to generate new business. The problem is, people often feel uncomfortable when asking for referrals. Thankfully, there are plenty of ways to do it without having to feel awkward or desperate. Here are a few of ideas to get you started:Ask for referrals via email, in person or at the bottom of your invoices.Focus on your best client or customers.Offer incentives like a gift card, discounts on future work or small gifts.Make it easy. Use email scripts or plugins on your site.Give referrals yourself. Paying it forward builds goodwill. 4. Join In-Person Networking Groups and Events Networking is key. After all, it's one of the most effective ways to build meaningful relationships that can help grow your business. If you haven't already, join face-to-face networking groups in your community, such as your local chamber of commerce. These organizations frequently hold business mixers and other events that will help you connect with potential customers. Check out local business events on Meetup.com, or see what events your local chamber or small business association is hosting.You can also become a member of business organizations, like Business Networking International, the Young Entrepreneur's Council, the Entrepreneur's Organization, or SCORE. It's also worth keeping an eye out for industry-specific trade shows, which can be great sources of information and lead to important connections. 


5. Apply for Business AwardsIt's common for industries and organizations to give awards honoring the best businesses for customer service, overall value, community impact and more. In many cases, you just need to apply to be in the running. If you win, it will boost the credibility of your business. Many local newspapers and magazines will also give these awards annually, and when there are reader's choice categories you can encourage your network to vote for you. 6. Target InfluencersWith the dominance of social media, working with influencers has become a popular method of marketing. Influencers can promote products to audiences you might not reach with traditional advertising strategies — just make sure you find an influencer specific to your industry (you don't want to work with someone who is reaching the wrong audience), and offer that person free products or services in exchange for a review. 7. Practice Cold Calling and EmailingEven in today's world, cold calling and emailing can still be effective ways to obtain new business — and the practice doesn't cost you anything but time. Of course, there's more to it than just picking up the phone and calling someone, or sending them an email. Here are some pointers:Don't focus on the sale. The idea is to create an opportunity for you to make your pitch.Prepare an effective opening statement that includes greeting, introduction, the benefits of your product/service and a transition to a question or conversation.Prepare a script so that you can answer any questions or concerns.Set up an appointment — you can share your calendar with them so they can see your availability and select a time that works for them.Always be pleasant to whoever picks up the phone or responds to your email.Be persistent. It may take three or four contacts to set up an appointment.8. Offer to SpeakThere are plenty of opportunities for you to speak in front of an audience. In fact, industry conferences, volunteer organizations, local business groups, community colleges and libraries are usually in need of speakers. As a result, you'll get some name recognition, contacts and publicity. You could also offer to host an event or class, which would broaden awareness of your business and connect you with potential customers. 9. Publish Top-Notch ContentOne way to get your business noticed is by writing content that readers find valuable. To that end, consider adding a blog to your business website and publishing useful advice about industry trends, product-specific updates and behind-the-scenes looks at your business. Share the content on social media channels and you can grow an audience of potential customers. You can also write for industry publications and build a reputation as a subject-matter expert in your field. Reach out to industry organizations or publications that accept contributor posts, build a relationship with editors and prove your expertise. 


10. Repurpose Your ContentDo you have old content out there? If so, you may be able to recycle it and grow your audience on additional platforms without having to create brand-new assets. For example, you could take a study you conducted and make it into an infographic, you could take a collection of blog posts on a specific topic and create an eBook or the podcast you just taped could become a YouTube video. You don't have to start from scratch each time you produce content, but you shouldn't merely reuse content without tweaking or refreshing it for the appropriate audience. 11. Collect Email Addresses and Start a NewsletterEmail is a huge player in online content marketing and advertising. Make sure you're growing email lists and managing your outreach with an email-marketing program like Mailchimp, HubSpot or others. When you publish content, send it to your email lists via a newsletter. This will keep potential customers tuned into all the valuable information you're publishing — which will strengthen your business reputation — while also keeping them apprised of special discounts, events and business updates. 12. Host Webinars on Your SiteHosting webinars can be costly; however, some companies offer free or low-cost options for small business owners. Some cheap options are MeetCheap. If you are looking for an even cheaper option, YouTube Live Streaming is 100% free, provided you have a verified YouTube channel.13. Run an Online ContestPromotional giveaways and contests can be effective ways to build awareness and introduce your business to potential customers. Ideally, your contest or giveaway should contain your products or services, such as the chance to win a free subscription to your service or a recently released product. Promote the contest on social media and don't forget to announce the winner. Just be sure that you abide by your state's rules for running a contest. 14. Give Your Product Away This may sound counterproductive, but don't hesitate to offer people a free trial of your service or a free sample of your product. If they like what you're offering, they may well purchase more of your products or services. You can also offer coupons to get customers in the door for the first time and, hopefully, keep them coming back.It might also be worth designing swag — keychains, water bottles and shirts — with your logo and giving it away at events. This free branded merchandise can raise the profile of your company and help it become more of a household name in your market. 15. Create a Free Google My Business AccountIf you want your business to show up in local search, a Google My Business account is a necessity. This will ensure your business is visible not only on search but also on Google Maps.


16. Create a Free Yelp ListingIf you are a local business, consider adding your business to Yelp. It's free, and can be a great way to increase your visibility in the search engines.17. Secure Your Online PresenceHopefully, you've already listed your business on search engine local directories, as well as created pages on Facebook, LinkedIn and other social media platforms. Even if you don't intend to use social media often, it's smart to future-proof your business name by securing social handles. The same is true for your website: You should secure your domain name as soon as possible, and make sure you stay up to date on renewals. You can confirm your information – such as your website, business owners and contact information – are correct and current by using tools like Yext.18. Get Free PR with HAROHow does free PR in national magazines and websites sound? Create a free account with HARO. (Help a Reporter Out) and respond to relevant media queries.19. Create Business Cards and Other Materials It's very easy to design and order your own business cards these days. Keep them handy wherever you go and don't be stingy about giving someone your card. Doing so will help you broaden the reach of your business. Other materials — like informational one-sheets or postcards — can also be effective ways of marketing your product or services. If you attend events, you can hand those materials out and connect with new audiences.20. Start a PodcastStarting a podcast doesn't have to be expensive — you just need to purchase a microphone, understand the basics of hosting and learn how to edit audio (or hire someone to edit for you). With consistency over time, your podcast can build awareness of your business, showcase your knowledge and humanize your brand. 21. Make Your Outreach PersonalIf you have existing customers, take the time to show them how much you appreciate their support. You could do this by writing them a handwritten ""thank you"" note or giving them a shout-out in a video or podcast. This goodwill is likely to make an impression, and may even lead them to tell others how you went above and beyond to make them feel important. 22. Make the Most of Employee Email SignaturesThis is a simple and cost-effective way to market your business. Just have your team add a short sentence with a call to action in their email signatures along with your logo. Now, whenever they send out an email, there's an unobtrusive marketing message being seen by potential customers.


23. Respond to QueriesTake the time to answer questions in places like Google's business reviews, social media comment sections, or sites like Quora. Monitoring online forums that are relevant to your industry is also a great place to respond to potential customers. This is a simple and cheap way to build trust and potentially get noticed by a new audience. 24. Get Serious About Social Media It takes time to be active on social media and grow your audience, but if you know what you're doing, you can have a real impact without having to spend much money. Create a Facebook Group and invite people to follow it, launch an Instagram account and post pictures or videos of your product, start connecting with people on LinkedIn and consider even making a TikTok account. If you have a limited advertising budget, it could be worth spending money on social media to build a following. 25. Embrace ""Guerilla Marketing"" and Other Unusual IdeasEffective advertising and marketing involves putting in more effort than your competitors. Don't be afraid to pound the pavement and put hangers on doorknobs, place flyers under windshield wipers or brand your vehicle. Guerilla marketing involves doing the things others might not expect, like creating an installation of street art, projecting your logo onto the side of a building or even planning some type of publicity stunt. There are many ways to get people's attention – becreative. 26. Take advantage of Facebook and Google's free ad creditsFacebook and Google are always giving away free ad credit vouchers. When you are signing up for services like web hosting or Google Ads, take advantage of the free vouchers they offer and take PPC (pay-per-click)_advertising for a test drive.27. Spend on Advertising for Key Demographics If you're trying to advertise with a limited budget, you need to make sure you're getting high value out of your spend. One key way you can do this: target your advertising spending based on audience demographics. Use tools like Google Analytics and social media data to figure out the demographics that define your customers. Maybe most of your customers are college educated and between the ages of 31 and 45. Use that information to target your advertisements on various platforms. It's also worth looking for promotional credits. Digital campaigns can get pricey, but you may be able to find discounts from Google or social media sites that offer incentive programs for first-time advertisers and allow you to target specific demographics. 28. Collaborate with Affiliates and Other Partners Teaming up with another business related to your industry is a great way to introduce your product to a new audience. You can do this by collaborating online — by hosting a webinar, for instance — or by hosting exclusive in-person events together. You could team up with a local brewery for a networking event, or host a customer appreciation night in conjunction with a business with whom you share referrals. If you offer a digital product (like an ebook), you can also look into affiliate or agencies and resellers, which earn a commission by marketing your product and generating leads. However, you'll need to make sure your pricing structure takes into account their fees.


29. Take Advantage of Audio Advertising According to the World Advertising Research Center, there is a big gap between time spent with audio and its ad spend — meaning there are huge opportunities for advertising on podcasts, radio shows and elsewhere. Programmatic audio advertising (the automated selling and insertion of ads) enables a data-driven approach that produces efficient targeting and measurement. Audio hosting platforms like Spotify, SoundCloud, Pandora and others rely on a process called dynamic ad insertion, which advertisers can use to serve ads in both live and on-demand content. 30. Consider Advertising Outdoors Advertising outdoors is one of the original forms of business promotion. In the industry, it's referred to as out-of-home advertising, but the concept — which includes billboards, yard signs, digital projections and other creative approaches — is a relatively simple one. Before you start thinking it's outdated, data suggests out-of-home advertising is still effective. Plus, with detailed analytics now available — movement patterns, audience saturation and more — you can optimize outdoor campaigns beyond previous capabilities. 31. Don't Forget Newspapers and MagazinesWhile print media isn't as strong as it once was, newspapers and magazines can still offer valuable advertising opportunities — especially at the local level and for those trying to reach an older audience. The costs will vary based on several factors: the publication you choose, the size and color of your ad, the frequency and whether or not it will also run online. Print media with larger circulations will be more expensive, but don't overlook community bulletins or local media where you can still get good value for cheaper. Bonus: Advertising Principles to Follow from David Ogilvy David Ogilvy, often referred to as the ""father of advertising,"" was a British executive who ran one of the most successful ad agencies of the twentieth century. His clients included Schweppes, Rolls-Royce and Shell, and his principles have been studied by marketers for decades. In Craig Simpson's book, The Advertising Solution, Ogilvy's principles are outlined as follows: Creative brilliance: Marketers need to come up with concepts that not only catch their best targets' attention, but also sell them on the product. Ogilvy was a proponent of the ""big idea"" — a concept that cap­tures the imagination of your audience and puts your product (or yourself) on the map.Research: Ogilvy didn't believe in blowing smoke. His copy was meticulously based in fact, and he did careful research about a product that he could then build a campaign around.Actual results: Ogilvy was a strong believer in judging the quality of an ad by its success at selling the product. Always test the outcome of an ad, and if it isn't selling, make changes.Professional discipline: Advertising executives were not dabblers in the creative realm. They needed to hone their craft and develop programs to train the next generation of adver­tisers. Three Rules for Shameless Success Debbie Allen, an entrepreneur, business mentor and author, has published several books about the importance of sales, marketing and advertising. In Success Is Easy, which she published in 2019, Allen writes about the importance of self promotion.""It's easy to promote yourself when you believe in the value of what you offer,"" she writes in her book. ""To move to a higher level of success, you must practice promoting and selling in ways that may feel uncomfortable at first. Next time you experience a feeling of discomfort in self-promotion or the feeling of rejection creeps in, move toward it instead of away from it.""Allen offers the following three rules for shameless success: 


Have your own personal style. Dare to be differ­ent.Never give up even when others don't believe in you or your ideas.Stand out. Position yourself in front of the right people to get noticed.Now that you're armed with these marketing and advertising ideas and you've heard from the pros, it's time to put these lessons to work. Pick a handful of approaches to try first, create an advertising plan and work with your team to spread the word about your venture. Even if you don't have a huge promotion budget, with creativity and a thoughtful strategy, you'll reach an engaged audience and grow your business prospects.

""How much will you charge to promote the event on your socials?""An event organizer asked me this question in regards to an event that I'm being paid to speak at.Super simple question, incredibly challenging to answer.



When it comes to charging for keynotes, panels or workshops; I'm crystal clear on my pricing. But for some reason, when it comes to charging for a social media post, I get stuck. Here's why:I post on LinkedIn everyday as it – feel free to follow me there if you'd like to learn more about developing business resilience – so it's not like creating one more post is a major chore or a pattern interrupt.


However, if someone is asking how much you charge, that means they see value in what you do. That's great news! But again, that causes a new problem. How much should you charge?This is a question that plagues many paid content creators, whether it's your full time gig or a one-off project. In my experience, the best way to find the answer is to ask other creators how much they're getting paid. But how can you find other creators who are willing to be open about how much they're getting for their work so you can charge your true value?Fortunately, Canopy has solved that problem for you. Described as ""a semi-anonymous social app for peer-to-peer knowledge sharing. A safe space for Creators to ask questions and gain industry insights when it comes to building a career as a Creator,"" this platform allows you to learn from other creators who are on a similar journey.The founder of Canopy, Ayomi Samaraweera, worked as a management consultant for several years. She discovered her passion for the Creator Economy during the pandemic when she joined TikTok's Communications team and went on to become the Global Head of Internal Communications.


She then decided to move on and launch Canopy, which now boasts an online community of over 1,000 creators. I was able to meet several of them in person during a recent event at Shopify's NYC office and I'll share a few of their stories below.My goal is to show you that now matter what you talk about, or how many followers you have, your work is valued and you should be fairly compensated for it.Related: 5 Ways to Get on the Media's Good Side (and Stay There)Kary Santayana - Inspiring and motivating radical non-conformers to show up as the most authentic version of themselvesKary's main audience is people with intersectional identities in the 18-35 year old range, but all are welcome. As a trans, non-binary, mixed-race creator, they aim to be the representation they didn't have growing up. When asked about the goal of their content, Kary stated, ""I hope that people watch and engage with my content and feel empowered to show up as who they are meant to be, wear what they want to wear, and exist freely in a world that wants to put people into boxes.""


Although Kary is a brave individual, they still struggled with the uncertainty and isolation that can come with being a content creator. They shared how Canopy has helped: ""As a nano-creator who is fairly new to my creator monetization journey (less than a year), it's easy to feel like I'm navigating this industry alone. Am I charging the right rates? Does the algorithm hate me? Canopy for Creators has helped to reduce this feeling of isolation and act as a resource for creators to ask their questions, gain a sense of community, and build a network.""Follow Kary on InstagramBrandon Smithwrick - Proving you can generate revenue as a LinkedIn CreatorBrandon is a B2B influencer on LinkedIn, where he shares his expertise on various topics such as content marketing, social media, entrepreneurship, business development, and personal development. His work has allowed him to collaborate with brands including Notion, LinkedIn, Etsy, Gymshark, Semrush, and more.His ultimate goal is to be the mentor that he never had when he was starting out in his professional career. After becoming a paid content creator, he found himself needing that mentorship again. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube are so popular for content creation that it's easy to find pricing information, but LinkedIn is different.


Brandon explained his challenge and breakthrough: ""I couldn't find any resources on how to price my content, but then I found Canopy, and it's been a lifesaver! It's helped me figure out how to charge for endorsements and also how to help other creators with their pricing issues. Plus, as a creator, it's great to have a community to talk to and vent with about the everyday struggles of content creation.""Follow Brandon on LinkedinRelated: A TikTok Ban Could Threaten the Livelihood of Many Entrepreneurs — Here's How Businesses Can Protect ThemselvesTameka Bazile - Creating social content to help you create better social contentTameka creates content about social media as a profession and as a culture with a focus on social media managers, creators and marketing professionals.

53,My Wife's Nutritionist Gets Better Sales Than You — Here's Why.,"Mar 26, 2024",Ramon Ray,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-win-over-customers-by-listening-and-following-up/471307,"
Recently, my wife hired a nutritionist to help her get healthy and improve her diet. My wife is not easily swayed, and she likes to weigh potential outcomes and consequences before committing to a course of action. So, I asked my wife why she had hired one nutritionist and not the several others she had interviewed.She said there were two main reasons: she felt heard, and the nutritionist followed up.Know what your customer wantsThe nutritionists my wife didn't choose seemed to be selling her something she didn't want. She felt it was like she was going to a painter to help her paint her house, but they kept wanting to do landscaping.



The other nutritionists were nice and pleasant. But my wife had a very special and specific need. She didn't want medicine or Weight Watchers. She wanted a guide and a coach to help her in her daily routine. This nutritionist who got the job actually listened and understood what my wife wanted.Related: Are You Really Listening to Your Customers? Probably Not, But You Should.


Follow up, follow up, follow up!Secondly, the nutritionist who was hired followed up. Often, your next customer will not buy from you the first time you have a conversation with them.Maybe they're not ready quite yet. Maybe they're in the middle of traffic when you speak with them. Maybe there are screaming kids in the car. Maybe it's simply a bad time.Whether you're a nutritionist, lawyer, accountant, web designer or any other type of entrepreneur, these two principles of understanding who your customers are — and what they want — and the power of following up are essential for the growth of your business.Related: How to Write Follow-Up Emails That Get Answered


How to better understand your future customerUnderstanding who your customers are and their problems and concerns is essential for small business owners and entrepreneurs to grasp. My best sales happen when I really listen to and understand the customer. Here are a few tips to help you do this better.1. The importance of questions. Understanding your potential clients is all about asking insightful questions. This practice isn't limited to the queries themselves but extends to how you ask the question. It is crucial to initiate conversations that make your customers feel at ease when expressing their preferences and thoughts.2. Active listening and engagement. Listening actively is as crucial as the questions asked. This involves tuning into not just the words spoken but also gleaning insights from the tone, the pauses and the enthusiasm behind them. Exploring their previous encounters with similar services or products can shed light on their preferences, helping tailor your service or product to better meet their needs. The nutritionist my wife hired did a great job asking the right questions and understanding her needs.3. Understanding customer expectations. Inquiring about your customers' definition of success gives you a clear picture of their goals. This not only aids in aligning your offerings with their expectations but also demonstrates your commitment to fulfilling their unique needs.

CRM platforms can help you consolidate client data, including contact details, preferences, and previous engagements. They also enable personalized follow-ups. They can even help you know when it's time to reach out to clients based on predefined schedules or after specific triggers, ensuring no client feels neglected. Tools such as Hubspot, Keap, Zoho CRM, and Nimble are great for this.2. Task reminders for consistency. Task reminder apps are simpler tools but immensely powerful for keeping follow-ups on track. They can be set to remind you to reach out to your clients at optimal times, making the process more systematic. This approach is particularly effective for individual professionals or small businesses that might not need the full suite of CRM functionalities but still prioritize consistent communication. Tools such as Asana, Google Tasks, Outlook 365 Tasks and many others can help.3. Marketing automation. Marketing automation takes follow-ups to a new level. From sending personalized emails based on client actions to scheduling social media posts that keep your business in the loop, these tools make client engagement continuous and consistent. For instance, after an initial consultation, a nutritionist could set up an automated email sequence to share helpful tips, encouraging messages or gentle reminders to book a follow-up appointment, seamlessly maintaining the client relationship.

She got my wife — who is not easily sold (I might add) — to buy a product.Follow up. Keep following up with the customer, especially if you know you're a fit for them and have the solution they need. Don't be annoying — but follow up. Understand who your customer is, their goals and needs, and how you can help them reach their desired outcome.

54,Want Success? Invest in Your Biggest Enemy,"Mar 26, 2024",Jon Michail,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/want-people-to-follow-you-invest-in-yourself/471357,"
When most people think, talk or try to research investment, they often focus on opportunities in areas like real estate and stocks. For many people, investment is all about financial gains. Of course, pursuing and building an investment portfolio that would yield financial gains is a commendable feat. Yet, an investment that is equally as important, if not more, is self-investment.Self-investment is hard because one can often be their own worst enemy, as they are intimately aware of their weaknesses and insecurities, which can lead to self-doubt and self-sabotage. Their inner critic often amplifies their fears and magnifies their failures, hindering their progress and potential for growth.According to Warren Buffet, one of the most successful and wealthiest men in the world, ""The best investment you can make is an investment in yourself… The more you learn, the more you'll earn."" This statement is not cliché; it is straightforward and practical, but people still often overlook the importance of self-investment.



Whether you want to earn the highest figures, reach the peak of your professional career or become a better person overall, investing in yourself is non-negotiable. It's that sort of investment that yields a substantial gain every time.Now that we're in a constantly and rapidly evolving era, self-investment — an investment in personal development and self-growth, is the best insurance policy for these challenging times. Here are some instances of how self-investment can set you up to nurture growth, personal fulfillment and career success.


Enhancing personal growth and developmentIt's impossible to talk about self-investment without its impact on personal growth and development. Self-investment involves using available resources to improve your overall well-being. This goes beyond formal education; self-investment sets one on a path of continuous learning and development by pursuing passions, curiosity and innate skills. Apart from the apparent rewards, those who remain dedicated cultivate adaptability and resilience — the ability to be flexible, composed and decisive in crucial times. These traits are essential for anyone who will successfully navigate today's competition and uncertainty.By investing in their personal growth and development, individuals become self-aware and authentic to their true selves. This sets the foundation for a purposeful and successful life.Related: Want to Succeed? Learn to Say 'No'Promoting mental and physical well-beingMost people are not proactive, paying little to no attention to their mental and physical well-being in pursuing success until a problem arises, and then they react. People often believe their physical and psychological well-being must suffer if they're to attain success until a problem arises. This couldn't be farther from the truth; to give yourself the best chance of achieving your goals, your mental and physical well-being has to be in the best conditions possible. By investing in your mental and physical well-being, you get to

Self-investment helps nurture a healthy relationship with the pursuit of money. You can create feasible financial goals because you understand the importance of savings and planning. The result is that it almost looks like you earn more than you do because you still have enough to pursue your goals and aspirations. By investing in yourself, you equip yourself with the basics and foundational knowledge necessary to live the life you aspire for.Advancing your careerGlobal incidents in the last couple of years, like the pandemic, have emphasized that the modern workplace is dynamic. You can't afford to stay stagnant. However, when you consciously invest in yourself, you plug yourself into lifelong learning and the perfection of your strengths. By so doing, even when there are disruptions, you're well equipped not just to cope and stay relevant but also to use such disruptions to further advance your career.Also, proper self-investment allows you to refine your skill set continuously, thus giving you the right to establish yourself as a thought leader in your industry.


Related: Why You Need to Invest in Your Happiness (and How to Do It)Improving social and emotional intelligenceThe success and meaning of every relationship, whether personal or business, are determined by those involved's social and emotional intelligence. By investing in yourself, you develop the ability to communicate effectively. Improved emotional intelligence means not only knowing what to say and when to inspire those around you, but you're also able to gracefully manage and resolve conflicts, thereby making you a professional and distinguished leader. This modern day is characterized by diversity, so interpersonal skills, empathy and emotional regulation are needed to navigate social complexities with grace successfully.Building legacy and impactThe final reason we're going to discuss self-investment is the subsequent impact such a person can have in the community. By striving to become the best possible version of ourselves, we spread our impact and influence across our immediate environment. This impact can come from providing resources, mentorship or philanthropy to drive progress and build a legacy in society. To put this in simple terms, the better we become as individuals, the better our contributions and services to society will be.Related: 4 Ways to Begin Investing in Yourself

Not only does self-investment set you apart, but you also give yourself a better advantage in achieving all your goals while living a prosperous and fulfilling life.In navigating the challenges of our modern society, we should always remember that our greatest investment lies in treasures within.

55,Revive Your Content Strategy With These 7 Powerful Techniques,"Mar 22, 2024",Nikola Baldikov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/revive-your-content-strategy-with-these-powerful-techniques/471221,"
There's a new kid on the block in the inbound marketing space. While practically every marketer worth their salt knows about inbound marketing, the new concept I'd like to introduce is inbound blogging and its multifaceted techniques.A critical aspect of every business's marketing toolkit, inbound blogging is a cost-effective and powerful way to attract your target audience without being annoying, intrusive or noisy — and without spending as much as you would on paid ads or other outbound marketing methods.Below, I dive head-first into what inbound blogging is, explain its importance and share my techniques, plus a case study of success. Let's get started.Related: Inbound Marketing -- What is it and Why Does it Matter?What is inbound blogging?Inbound blogging is a strategy that aims to drive traffic to your website through high-quality, value-adding blog posts organically. Through this approach, your audience comes to your business for answers and is more likely to convert into paying customers. Ultimately, it's a way of attracting rather than interrupting prospects while offering exceptional value. That's why inbound blogging should not be underestimated.



Ever since the term ""inbound marketing"" was coined, every experienced marketer has focused on the steps of attracting, nurturing, converting, engaging, closing and delighting leads.While there may be numerous variations of these steps, the idea is the same: to leverage pull techniques that earn your business attention and not pay for it through traditional or digital ""outbound marketing"" techniques.Why is this important? The answer is quite simple yet hard to swallow: Today's audiences are becoming blind to advertising. The more you try to push a product or service on them, the less likely they are to convert.That's where inbound blogging shines.


The importance of inbound blogging for your content strategyWhen you're using pull as opposed to push techniques, your business is much more likely to attract and retain customers. Also, through inbound blogging, your business can establish itself as a thought leader in your industry, earning you trust, credibility and much-coveted leads. This positioning is not only great for your brand, it's also essential for your bottom line.Using inbound blogging as a vital part of your content strategy helps in the following ways:Give your audiences a more authentic way of reaching you and foster trust in your business.By using channels your target audience uses, you have a higher chance of connecting with them.Empower your customers by offering them a tailored experience that gives them greater control over their interactions with your business.Generate qualified contacts and leads through inbound blogging efforts.You'll own the channels for your own organic and direct customer acquisition and a database of qualified contacts.Grow the reach of and community around your brand and boost brand loyalty.Position your business as an expert in your sector.Increase the quality and quantity of traffic to your website exponentially while improving your search engine optimization (SEO) to improve your search engine rankings.Drive more conversions with lower advertising and customer acquisition costs.Track results and key performance indicators more easily and modify blogs through a continuous feedback loop that gives you a chance to learn and evolve.Increase revenue and profitability and enjoy long-term value for your business.Related: 3 Inbound Marketing Myths You Can't Afford to OverlookInbound blogging techniques to revive your content strategyIf you are ready to enjoy all these results, there are several inbound blogging techniques that I use as part of my process to help clients get to the top.1. Keyword research and analysisThere is keyword research that uses keywords without high value or a great chance of ranking, and there is keyword research that identifies topics that resonate with your target audience. Ideally, the factors I consider when doing keyword research for companies' blogs are:


High search volumeRelevance to prospectsSearch intentLow competitionBusiness potential to convertHere, I'd like to add that analyzing the search intent and studying the results is an exceptionally powerful way to get the process started. When we choose a primary keyword to target for a blog post, we look at whether it's informational, transactional, navigational, etc. We also consider the type of content that is already ranking on the search engine results page (SERP) and analyze its style and format — be it sales pages, tutorials, guides, videos, etc.2. Creating the content briefWhen we create the content brief for writing, we carefully study various aspects of the future blog article. This involves evaluating the ideal article length and which secondary keywords should be included in the content. We then create an outline for the article based on an analysis of other articles that already rank on the topic for the same keyword. In these outlines, we make sure to avoid unnecessary or fluff content, add information that's valuable to the user's search intent and generate a unique angle to make the article stand out.3. Content creationOnce the keyword research and outline are completed, it's time to craft your blog article. The ideal blog post will always balance out aspects such as copy length, the brand's tone of voice and ideal buyer persona profiles.


What it should not be is superficial. Instead, it should be shareable, solve problems, be educational and informative, and also offer high levels of value and expertise to build trust in the brand.4. SEO-optimized contentThe article has been written, but it is still not yet ready to be published. We now turn to some cutting-edge SEO tools to help optimize the content additionally. Some of the tools that are a part of our daily staple include NeuronWriter, WriterZen, and SurferSEO.A tool such as NeuronWriter, for example, allows us to pull top-ranking articles for our keyword, extract the main keywords used by competitors and insert them naturally into our content. It also enables us to optimize our meta titles and descriptions, not only by featuring the primary keyword but also by ensuring we remain within the pixel limits. All this boosts the overall optimization score and our chances of ranking high for the keyword.5. Internal linkingInternal links are links to other articles on your website. They create the necessary link ""flows and loops"" within your blog articles and can enhance the speed of your rankings. However, what most people do is add internal links from new content to their old content. Meanwhile, they forget to add internal links from existing articles to the newly-published content.


6. Off-page SEOAs part of off-page SEO, link building is the next step to a successful inbound blogging strategy. Backlinks are links to your article, with an accurate anchor text, published on other websites' articles. These websites must have high authority and domain rating.Backlinks matter because they boost your link equity. In link building, there are certain white-hat strategies that Google loves. Several of these backlink-building strategies are:Writing guest postsNiche editsSubscribing to and building links through platforms such as Help a Reporter Out (HARO) and othersEarning backlinks may be a slow and steady process, but it is highly worthwhile in the end because they help improve your position on search engine results pages. By building quality links, you are signaling to Google that your website is credible and trustworthy. And your audience will appreciate this as you climb up the rankings.7. Content auditsThe final step is to constantly monitor and analyze the performance of your blog articles. What I normally do is go back to the same article within six to 12 months and analyze its performance.If it is not ranking well, we try to understand the reasons why. We explore whether it contains unnecessary information or needs additional talking points. If it has a poor structure, we may not have answered the search intent. Additionally, the article may be too short or too long, and we need to revise that.


Only once we've fully understood the causes of the low rankings and optimized the article to as great an extent as possible compared to our competitors, we move on to building backlinks (if necessary, and if we notice there are too few of these links).All in all, it's a long-term game, but the results are highly worth it.Related: The Ultimate Guide to Conducting a Content Audit — Step-by-Step Process for Optimizing Your Website's ContentMy team and I implemented the exact techniques for our client Brosix. And based on this inbound blogging strategy, we increased the organic traffic for this client from 19,727 to 86,428 — signaling 348% growth in one year.


Тhere you have it — the impressive results of inbound blogging in a nutshell. It's not about a haphazard approach. It is a detailed and holistic strategy that involves in-depth work, analysis and continuous improvements. I encourage you to start implementing these inbound blogging techniques in your own content strategy to experience the true potential of this approach.

1. Artificial intelligence is the new blackArtificial Intelligence has been revolutionizing digital marketing for the last three years by giving users access to advanced data analysis, automated decision-making processes and personalized customer interactions through machine learning algorithms. In the beginning, it was rocket science, but now the technology has become accessible and user-friendly.The applications of AI in digital marketing are vast and diverse. Chatbots have become popular for businesses, offering real-time customer support and enhancing user experience. Predictive analytics — another key feature of artificial intelligence — helps marketers anticipate consumer behavior and trends, enabling them to make data-driven strategies. Customer segmentation, a crucial aspect of marketing, has been greatly improved by AI's ability to process big data and identify specific customer profiles for targeted campaigns.

57,It's Time to Clean Up Your Act — How to Manage Your Reputation in the Era of AI,"Mar 22, 2024",David Klein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-manage-your-reputation-in-the-era-of-ai/471258,"
The traditional method of reputation management was to create new, positive content to drown out negative news about a company, pushing it back in the search results. Either that or the company's attorney contacted webmasters to get the damaging content removed. But those days are quickly disappearing. Enter the Search Generative Experience (SGE) — the integration of Google's AI into search results. It was gradually rolled out in 2023, and it's about to turn the world of reputation management upside-down.SGE results are designed to help the user make better decisions faster. This means providing deeper context and more balanced information (good and bad) and placing it at the top of the page before organic results (non-paid or non-sponsored results based purely on relevance). With this change to the ground rules of reputational management, brands need to fundamentally shift how they manage their online presence.Related: Why Investing in Reputation Management is Crucial for Your Business Strategy



The SGE shift: Adopting an experience-first approachCompared to the ""old"" Google, SGE results rely more on third-party references than a company's website. Since SGE seeks to highlight more diverse viewpoints and sources, it is more likely to showcase both positive and negative perspectives about a brand. So, gone are the days of being able to bury a bad news day by flooding the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) with better headlines.In this new landscape, reputation management must center on addressing user complaints — and not just at the surface level. Responding to criticism is a start, but SGE is pushing companies to continuously listen to user needs and make an effort to grow and improve as a result. With CX now having more relevance to reputation management than ever before, meeting these expectations requires a three-pronged effort that starts and ends with the user in mind.


1. Stay accountable to your usersGoogle's complex algorithm still strives to cater to the user's needs but will now prioritize content from publishers that do the same. So, a user-centric approach will require brands to:Seek a deeper understanding of user search intent before creating articles and web pages. Only then can brands address users' specific questions comprehensively enough for Google's LLMs to assign value to them.Understand what customers are saying about brands via social listening.Build confidence in readers by offering the most complete and up-to-date information across the company blog and other channels. Verify sources and clearly attribute them (especially AI-generated excerpts), as well as conduct regular audits to identify obsolete or outdated information.Encourage reviews, comments and user-generated content (UGC) on and off your website. This helps user complaints rise to the surface (and, hopefully, get resolved).Related: 5 Ways to Optimize Your Content for Better Google Rankings2. Partner with trusted third partiesSGE prioritizes information from high-quality sources that align with Google's EEAT model, meaning sources that exemplify experience, expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness. With third-party voices holding even greater weight, brands need to partner with credible outlets to proactively:Ensure consistency in how the brand and its values are expressed across the web. This starts with demonstrating authority in your own content but extends to publishing clear initiatives and brand guidelines, so it is easier for third parties to represent your company accurately.Prevent misinformation by routinely reviewing content related to the company and contacting outlets to correct errors and provide context.Mitigate negative third-party information by quickly (and diplomatically) addressing critical feedback, whether from a journalist claiming greenwashing or a dissatisfied user.Related: How to Manage (and Monitor) Your Reputation on Social Media


3. Amplify your audience's diverse voicesAs the search experience evolves, brands don't have to wait idly to see how it changes public perception of their company. To continue maintaining and improving your reputation, focus on the user experiences that you can control by:Tailoring content and outreach to specific communities, especially underserved ones. This requires a nuanced understanding of audience demographics, user preferences and pain points that a brand can use to personalize content and the entire user experience.Collaborate and partner with a diverse group of voices. Avoid simply leveraging influencers and thought leaders for promotion and instead, build relationships based on shared values and mutual respect.Experimenting with new tools to improve the UX, like offering interactive content and real-time personalization. Harness data analytics and machine learning to deliver content that best meets each user's needs at the moment. As third-party cookies are phased out, personalization faces new challenges, but emerging tech also means new possibilities.Putting SGE principles into actionWhile the deeper causes of customer complaints will now surface more easily, your newsroom should not be the first responder to reputation challenges. Take the hypothetical case study of an online retailer for strategies likely to have the greatest impact in the SGE landscape:Empowering consumer confidence: When customers complain about inaccurate sizing and product descriptions, the brand responds by creating size guides, fit quizzes and virtual dressing rooms.Responding to customer concerns: Shipping delays and high shipping costs frustrate customers. So, the brand ramps up communications about wait times and offers transparent pricing breakdowns. Plus, they integrate a third-party app to keep customers updated on order status.Strengthening shared values: Journalists report on unsustainable manufacturing practices in the retail industry. In response, the company begins publishing quarterly reports on its ESG commitments and shares stats and stories on social media to improve transparency.Proactively shaping customer experiences: Unresponsive customer service reps and slow order processing fuel dissatisfaction. The brand rolls out social listening and sentiment analysis tools to act on real-time data. They also empower their team to offer fast, concrete resolutions.As SGE becomes deeply integrated into search experiences, reputation management is now a continuous conversation, not a one-time fix. Stay engaged with your audience, listen to their concerns and proactively address issues as they arise. Don't spin or bury negative information. Instead, take responsibility and demonstrate your commitment to improvement. For brands with the right mindset, SGE is not a threat but an opportunity to create better products, services and experiences that resonate with your audience.

58,How to Determine the Right Pricing Strategy for Your Small Business,"Mar 21, 2024",Nicholas Leighton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-choose-the-right-pricing-strategy-for-your-small/471188,"
Since reaching a peak of over 9% in 2022, inflation appears to finally be cooling for the average consumer. Over the last two years, companies across the globe have worked diligently to protect their profit margins by increasing their prices as their costs rose. For small business owners, this creates a number of challenges. Many consumers are still facing the pressures as wages haven't kept pace with inflation rates. As a result, consumers are more cautious than ever about each dollar they spend.To make matters more complicated, AI and other technologies are opening the door to new products and lower barriers to entry in many industries. This advancement is also helping to reduce operating costs as companies shed unnecessary labor and streamline their operations and processes. Now, many companies are realizing that they need to start being more competitive with their pricing to retain their existing customers and attract new ones.For small business owners, defining the right pricing strategy can feel overwhelming. In addition, price wars rarely have winners as each company tries to outdo the other until both are left with little to no profit. Not only are price wars harmful, but entrepreneurs may struggle — especially if they are trying to win on price alone against a major competitor. Here are some tips to help you find the right pricing balance.



Related: Did You Price Your Product Right? How to Know.1. Evaluate the competitionYour competition and the industry can provide a lot of guidance when it comes to pricing strategies. Within each industry, there are typically standard markups or profit margins that are recognized as normal ranges. This can help small business owners understand if their costs are too high or low relative to their sales price.


By evaluating a range of competitors, it's also possible to determine the upper and lower price tolerance for consumers. If the most expensive product in your market is $200, there is a good indication that this is close to the maximum amount consumers will be willing to pay for a similar product.2. Ignore the competitionBefore you assume that I contradicted the first point, it's important that you don't price your product by simply copying your competitors. While your competition's pricing may be a helpful guide to understanding if you are within the acceptable ranges of the market, picking an arbitrary number is a losing strategy.Instead, focus on what value you are bringing to consumers instead of the price alone. Unfortunately, too many entrepreneurs believe they can beat the competition by being the cheapest business in town. This mindset will often lead to underpricing your product or service.Instead, focus on how much consumers might be willing to pay based on the value that your business provides.


3. Consider subscription pricingMaking consistent sales is the key to long-term business success. If you have a product that requires being sold over and over, you might be able to introduce some form of recurring or subscription pricing. This not only helps keep revenue flowing into your business, but it provides long-range visibility into your anticipated revenue. This is helpful for both strategic planning and securing better financing through investors or a bank line of credit.Related: The Price Is Right: How to Price Your Product for Long-Term Success4. Flexible or tiered pricingMost businesses serve a wide range of customers. Offering flexible or tiered pricing can increase your revenue by enabling you to reach a wider range of customers. Tiered pricing also supports a sales strategy known as price anchoring. By offering three or more pricing tiers, you can position your premium and most expensive options as the best value, encouraging more upsells.5. Loss-leader pricingWhile it's not always best to be the cheapest, this can be an effective strategy for entrepreneurs who are looking to generate early buzz in the market or encourage their first clients to try out their services. This strategy is known as loss-leader pricing, where you sell your product just at or slightly below your breakeven point.


It's important to caution that low pricing could backfire if consumers believe you are priced low because you have an inferior product or are desperate to make a sale. To counter this effect, the trick is to tie low pricing to a limited timeframe. This creates a sense of urgency to make a purchase and also lets the consumer know that you believe your product is worth more than the current price.6. Offer transparent pricingConsumers want to work with companies that they believe are trustworthy. Shady pricing and hidden fees are the perfect way to damage a relationship with your customers. It's always best to be upfront and transparent about your product pricing. At the end of the day, if sharing your price scares away customers, it's a good indication that you need to revisit your pricing strategy or do a better job of demonstrating the product's value.Related: An Entrepreneur's Guide to Startup Pricing Strategies

59,Want to Get Your Product into the Hands of Celebrities and Secure Endorsements? Here's an Effective Strategy You Need to Try.,"Mar 21, 2024",Danielle Sabrina,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/use-this-effective-strategy-to-secure-celebrity-endorsements/471113,"
Brands can catapult their visibility and appeal by placing their products in the hands of celebrities; think about how quickly a product goes viral after someone like Kim Kardashian posts about it. However, securing celebrity endorsements can be challenging and costly without the right connections. From my experience running an agency, even when you have access to celebrities and brands, success hinges on seizing the right moment with an unforgettable presentation.One of the most effective strategies I use at my agency to get products into the hands of celebrities is through celebrity gifting suites at high-profile events like the Oscars, Grammys and Super Bowl. Gifting suites are exclusive spaces where companies can showcase their products to A-listers in a more intimate setting.Unlike traditional trade show environments, where products might simply be displayed, gifting suites require you to captivate attendees with engaging presentations and charm them with your personal charisma. Most celebrities are always sent free products, which, more often than not, are passed on to family and friends. Gifting suites, however, offer a distinct advantage by facilitating a more personal and direct way to place your product into celebrities' hands.



I recently attended the GBK Celebrity Gifting Suite for Oscar weekend at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills. The event was filled with A-list celebrities like Viola Davis, who were walking around getting introduced to a range of products from new stem cell-infused skincare to high-end ski accessories.The primary benefit of participating in gifting suites is the opportunity for extensive media coverage. The moment a celebrity is seen with your product or gives it a nod on social media, it acts as an unofficial stamp of approval for your brand. This kind of endorsement can significantly boost your brand's image and drive sales. These events offer a rare chance for brands to interact personally with celebrities, creating an intimate product experience that can lead to real interest and a strong connection.


Related: How Your Business Can Harness the Power of Celebrity Endorsements to Skyrocket Your Online Growth and Brand AwarenessUnderstanding the costsParticipation in celebrity gifting suites does come with a price tag. Depending on the prominence of the event and the suite's exclusivity, costs can range from a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars. This fee usually covers the space within the suite, inclusion in promotional materials and, sometimes, the opportunity to interact personally with the attending celebrities. For many brands, this investment is justified by the potential return in terms of publicity and the chance to align with the star power of the attendees.Presentation is keyWhen it comes to presenting your product in a gifting suite, the key is to stand out. Remember, celebrities and their entourages will be browsing many products, so making a memorable impression is crucial. High-quality, visually appealing packaging is a must. Additionally, consider offering a unique, hands-on experience with your product. Personalize the experience or the product itself to make it more memorable. For instance, engraving a celebrity's name on the product or offering a bespoke version can significantly increase its appeal.One brand that stood out to me at GBK's Gifting Suite was Jane Foodie, a woman-owned flash frozen food company based in Yonkers, NY. Her display caught my eye, easily the best one at the event. The canned foods reminded me of vintage Campbell cans; I could smell how delicious they smelled from across the venue as Jane prepared her favorites to share with the crowd. The take-home product was a cute brown paper bag-inspired insulated lunch box with samples of her food and a $300 gift certificate inside a sealed aluminum soup can.


Related: 10 Ways to Get a Celebrity to Use Your ProductFollowing up effectivelyThe work doesn't end once the event is over. Effective follow-up is crucial to capitalize on the initial engagement. Shortly after the event, send personalized thank-you notes to the celebrities who showed interest in your product, reminding them of your encounter. If applicable, include any photographs of them with your product you were able to capture during the event.Following up with the press is equally important. Prepare press releases that highlight your product's presence at the event and, if possible, any celebrity interactions. Be proactive in reaching out to industry publications, blogs and social media influencers who might be interested in your story.Moreover, keep an eye on social media for any mentions or photographs from celebrities who received your product. Engaging with these posts — whether through likes, comments or shares — can further amplify your product's visibility.


The bigger pictureWhile celebrity gifting suites offer a unique opportunity for brand exposure, they are just one part of a broader marketing strategy. Success in these venues requires careful planning, from selecting the right event to participate in to effectively presenting your product and following up afterward. The costs associated with these events can be significant, so it's vital to weigh them against the potential benefits for your brand.In conclusion, celebrity gifting suites around major events like the Oscars, Grammys and Golden Globe Awards present an enticing avenue for brands to gain visibility and endorsement. By understanding the benefits, costs and strategies for effective presentation and follow-up, brands can leverage these opportunities to catapult their products into the spotlight. As with any marketing endeavor, success in celebrity gifting suites demands creativity, preparation and a keen understanding of your audience. For those brands that navigate these waters successfully, the rewards can be as dazzling as the events themselves.Related: Celebrity Placements are the ""Holy Grail"" of Marketing.

60,AI is the Antithesis of Authenticity — But There's Hope. Here's How We Can Align Our Human Values with AI.,"Mar 20, 2024",Sunny Dublick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-align-human-values-with-artificial-intelligence/470900,"
Everyone's talking about AI. There's excitement, fear, apprehension, confusion… let's just say a lot of mixed emotions.The plus side is the concept of saving money and eliminating redundancies. I've worked with many organizations that are using ChatGPT to write their copy or create procedures for their organization. Generative AI gets smarter and more accurate over time as it learns, so surely the future is ripe with possibilities for how businesses can use this.Something about it has felt yucky to me from the start, though.



It began with conversations I had with friends in the marketing industry about fears their livelihoods would be affected. Who wants to pay a graphic designer when you can get AI to make you a logo? Who needs a copywriter when you have ChatGPT? A lot of creatives feel uneasy, and understandably so. Are our skills so easily replaced?Look at the recent actor's strike or the Sarah Silverman-led lawsuit about ChatGPT. Anytime AI comes up, copyright concerns are right along with it. Today's news was an article about fears AI could use deepfakes to influence the upcoming election. It's clear the uncertainty surrounding how we use AI technology is everywhere. One of the biggest concerns is who's steering the ship. With regulation low and possibility oh so high, how do we know how to use it? What is cringe-worthy (I'm looking at you people using AI-generated LinkedIn headshots), and what is acceptable?


Related: AI Is Coming For Your Jobs — Anyone Who Says Otherwise Is In Denial. Here's How You Can Embrace AI to Avoid Being Left Behind.I recently read that some companies are now using AI influencers on Instagram. They look 100% human and even get brand deals to promote their products, such as clothing and hair care. Again, I am talking about a robot here (have I entered the Matrix?). Something about this struck a deep chord with me. It felt deceptive and, frankly, lazy.I am a human who values authenticity very highly. To me, AI is the antithesis of authenticity. Using ChatGPT to write content feels like having a friend do my homework. Using AI to create graphics feels like a slight to all the talented creatives I know. I struggled with my resistance though: was I like my parents who didn't want to sign up for an email address or the internet because they thought it was just a fad?In an effort to not make myself a technology dinosaur, I posed myself this question, and I invite you to do the same:How can I use AI in a way that is aligned with my values?When I ask myself questions like: would I want to read content by others created with ChatGPT? My answer is no. So, I write all my own content. How would I feel about AI creating my headshots? No, again. So I hired a photographer, putting out my photos unfiltered.In business and in life, I value creativity, authenticity, quality and fun. When I return to this — when I root myself in the question of how to utilize technology in a way that is in line with my values — the answer becomes crystal clear.I use AI for inspiration. Sometimes, when I am stuck on a headline or brand statement, I will ask it to find similar words or ways of saying something so I can play around with it. It's fun for me and aligns with my value of creativity. I also love the concept of using it as a way to poke fun at our culture, like when McDonald's Brazil asked ChatGPT to name the world's most iconic burger and displayed the full result in outdoor ads throughout São Paulo (which led to an AI retaliation from Burger King). That was such a fun way to approach trending technology and apply it to brand marketing.


So I leave you with this: While we're still figuring it out — which, as entrepreneurs and marketers, we are always doing in some way or another — I like to take on the role of a scientist. I observe, see what works for me, and figure out what I feel good about using and applying to my brand as the technology evolves.Related: How to Keep Yourself Relevant in the Age of AII think AI has the potential to bring out the best and the worst in us. As an entrepreneur, you don't have all the resources at your disposal, so AI has so many amazing implications. I just want to encourage us not to lose the plot: we're still marketing to human beings — the species of complex emotions, competing priorities and, above all, heart — which is something AI can't replicate.The brands that win the AI game are going to be the ones that use it in line with their values; it's a way to show how we live those out. No one would be surprised if the dollar store was using AI influencers and ChatGPT prompts. If Louis Vuitton did, that would be a much different story.


Find what works best for you, but don't lose your values.

62,Nextdoor's CMO Says Small Businesses Are Underutilizing One Critical Tool That Could Propel Their Marketing Efforts,"Mar 19, 2024",Heidi Andersen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/businesses-are-underutilizing-one-critical-tool-that-could/469501,"
Major companies across every sector are rushing to adopt Generative AI (GenAI), but it's small businesses that stand to realize major leaps with the advent of this incredible technology, particularly in their marketing strategies. Despite the technology's pervasive presence in the news, a 2023 McKinsey survey found that only 10% to 14% of companies utilize GenAI in their marketing efforts, a sign that businesses of all sizes are struggling to wrap their heads around how the technology can have an immediate impact on their sales workflow. Yet, GenAI presents a unique opportunity for SMBs to create personalized and impactful campaigns.The technology holds tremendous potential for creating highly personalized advertisements that create deeper connections with important consumer cohorts while saving time and effort. As the CMO of Nextdoor, we recently rolled out an AI Assistant tool aimed at empowering small businesses to connect with the approximately — 85 million neighbors on the platform. Our team sees this as an important first step in onboarding SMBs, the beating heart of our neighborhoods, to the technology so they can become early adopters of GenAI to future-proof their business, get ahead of marketing trends, and continue serving their communities as best they can.Related: How Generative AI Will Revolutionize The Future of Your Brand



Unleashing creativity and connection for SMBs with GenAIGenAI can help advertisers craft messages that engage with the local communities' distinctive wants, needs, and priorities. This approach empowers marketers to effectively reach the consumers most relevant to them without the need for costly market research. The ability to create such targeted content not only increases the relevance of marketing efforts but also significantly enhances customer engagement and loyalty.The power of GenAI in creating highly personalized campaigns is transforming the advertising landscape and creating new advantages for early adopters. Many platforms, including Nextdoor, are leveraging this technology to enable advertisers to tap into the communities that matter with quality content. A 2023 Optimove survey reflects this shift, indicating that a majority of consumers (55%) view AI-driven marketing positively, appreciating its role in tailoring shopping experiences. This trend highlights the potential for businesses to engage with consumers in new ways.


Enhancing efficiency and reach for small businessesGenAI is revolutionizing how marketers approach campaign development – a massive asset to SMBs that are dedicating a majority of their resources to other aspects of the business. By automating and optimizing the marketing process, these marketers are positioned to work smarter, not harder. A Harvard Business School study showed that AI assistance led to a 12.2% increase in task completion and a 25.1% faster execution rate. For SMBs, integrating GenAI with hyper-local insights from their community further enhances the impact of these campaigns, allowing for more granular targeting of specific consumer groups.This shift is particularly beneficial for small businesses, which often lack extensive marketing teams. GenAI tools, when used correctly, can level the playing field, providing the means to create high-impact campaigns that resonate deeply with local audiences. The future of marketing lies in developing hyper-local and tailored campaigns, as consumers are most responsive to messages that align with their surroundings and interests.Related: How Generative AI Is Fueling the Rise of Fake News and Online FraudThe responsible future of GenAI in marketingAs we look ahead, it's crucial for small businesses to adopt GenAI responsibly. This means being transparent about its use, safeguarding user privacy, ensuring human oversight, and screening for biases. Nextdoor's approach to integrating GenAI, combined with its deep local insights, exemplifies how businesses can develop granular marketing campaigns that appeal to specific audiences effectively.


For the marketing industry, embracing a community-focused strategy enhanced by GenAI is not just a trend but a necessity. It's about creating campaigns that are not only effective but also enrich the communities they target. The era of marketing powered by GenAI is here, and it's transforming the landscape in ways that particularly benefit SMBs.

63,Is SEO Worth It for Small Businesses? Here's What You Need to Know.,"Mar 19, 2024",Nick Zviadadze,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/is-seo-worth-it-for-small-businesses/470804,"
Many small business owners view search engine optimization (SEO) as a luxury rather than a necessity. Given the pressures of day-to-day operations and tight budgets, they think of SEO as a complex and technical field dominated by big websites with hefty marketing budgets.This perspective can result in missed opportunities for organic growth, leaving small businesses behind competitors who leverage SEO techniques effectively.In this article, I explain how SEO offers a sustainable path to success and why it is crucial for small businesses.Related: Why SEO Is Critical for Small Businesses (and How to Improve It)SEO is as important as everDespite the changing nature of digital marketing, SEO is as important as ever. Sure, the rules of the game are constantly changing, but that's exactly what makes SEO a key strategy for small businesses.



It's all about staying in the loop with the latest trends and best practices, which any great SEO agency should be doing. That way, your website can rank well on search engines and drive organic traffic consistently.Let's explore what makes SEO an essential tool to grow your small business and why it's crucial for the long-term success of your business.3 SEO benefits for small businessesUnlocking the power of SEO can be a game-changer for your businesses. The right moves — like creating great SEO content or building quality backlinks — can elevate your online rankings and visibility.Some additional SEO benefits include:


1. Strong brand identitySecuring the top spot on Google for keywords relevant to your business helps you establish credibility in your market. When your small business ranks first, it's a win for your brand's identity.Customers trust Google to give them the most relevant information and recommendations. So, if you rank well, they associate your brand with the best products and services they seek.For example, every time someone searches for a specialty coffee blend and your coffee shop pops up first, you suddenly turn into a go-to spot for specialty coffee. This association cements your brand in customers' minds, making them recommend you when somebody asks for quality coffee.2. Long-term growthSEO takes a while to kick in, but once it does, you quickly realize why it's so great. Think of it like planting a garden. Sure, it requires patience and care, but the results are well worth it. Plus, once you hit that top spot, maintaining it becomes so much easier, provided you stay clear of common SEO mistakes.


So, while SEO takes longer to see the results, it helps you grow sustainably in the long run. In addition, it sets a great foundation for other marketing strategies you want to try.Whether you go for social media ads, email marketing or influencer collaborations, a strong SEO base ensures these efforts are built on solid ground. That amplifies their impact and drives your business toward new heights.3. Low-cost lead generationWhile SEO requires an initial investment, it is more cost-effective compared to other advertising strategies. Once your website starts ranking well on search engines, you don't have to spend tons of money like you do with paid advertising.This shift from constant spending to strategic maintenance means you're pulling in leads without continuous ad spending, which reduces your customer acquisition costs.


For example, if someone types ""where to find the best espresso"" in Google and your shop pops up first, you've just gained a lead without spending an extra penny on ads for that click.Over time, this organic traffic translates into a steady stream of customers, which reduces your overall cost to attract new coffee lovers to your shop.Related: 9 SEO Tips to Help You Rank No. 1 on Google in 2024SEO is a long-term strategyThe essence of SEO lies in building a sustainable online presence that withstands all algorithm changes and grows stronger with time.


One of the key reasons SEO is such a powerful long-term strategy is its cumulative effect. Each quality piece of SEO content you publish adds another layer to your online visibility.These efforts compound over time, improving your website's authority and making it easier for potential customers to find you. That includes a variety of search queries, not just a few targeted keywords.Strategies like guest posting extend your reach and build quality backlinks, further cementing your position in search engine rankings. These ensure your business remains visible and relevant.However, SEO's long-term nature might not align with the immediate needs of new small businesses that are under pressure to generate quick returns. That's why relying solely on SEO might not be the best strategy for those with a limited runway.


Is SEO worth it for small businesses?Yes, SEO is definitely worth it for small businesses, offering undeniable benefits like strong brand identity, sustainable long-term growth and cost-effective lead generation.However, it's important to remember the caveats: SEO is a long-term commitment and might not suit businesses that need quick wins.Balancing SEO approaches like link-building and content creation with other marketing strategies can provide immediate results while laying the groundwork for future success.Related: 5 SEO Tips to Grow Your Small Business

64,"She Never Wanted to Start a Business, But Chronic Insomnia Was Motivation — Here's How She Achieved 8 Figures in Sales and 8 Hours of Sleep a Night","Mar 19, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/bearabys-founder-surpassed-20m-in-sales-gets-better-sleep/471256,"
Dr. Kathrin Hamm, founder and CEO of sleep-wellness company Bearaby, never wanted to be an entrepreneur. After graduating with her Ph.D. in economics, she started as an economist at the World Bank. Her work took her all over the world and provided invaluable insight into the small, medium and women-founded enterprises she tried to convince banks to lend to — but she ""learned firsthand how hard it is, especially in developing countries, for women to get access to finance and start and grow their businesses.""During her time in India and Bangladesh especially, Hamm faced long, ""exhausting"" travel days. She'd ""never been a good sleeper,"" waking easily even as a child, and she developed a chronic case of insomnia. It began ""on a more moderate level,"" with difficulty falling and staying asleep, before the periods of wakefulness became longer and longer, motivating her to look into different solutions.Image Credit: Courtesy of Bearaby. Kathrin Hamm.



She started by investigating various mattress options, but when she dug deeper, she found an article discussing weighted blankets. The piece focused on helping children with sensory issues, Hamm recalls, but it also mentioned that evenly distributed weight on an adult body could support better sleep. Hamm was immediately intrigued — as a potential customer.Related: The No-Excuse Approach to Sleep and Work Performance for Entrepreneurs


""Let me buy a product, sleep better and then move on with my career.""""I came from a consumer lens,"" Hamm says, ""and knowing how hard it is for women to start a business, I [was] like, Yeah, I'm good here. I don't want to start a business or even think about becoming an entrepreneur. Let me buy a product, sleep better and then move on with my career.""However, the purchase process proved difficult. Unable to find options online, Hamm had to go to a pharmacy in Germany, where she's from, to place an order. Six weeks later, a ""big bean bag"" arrived. It was orange and blue and ""very noisy,"" Hamm says. She was reluctant to even try it at first and wondered if she'd made a mistake.""But then I put it on during the day on a weekend, and I just passed out after 10 minutes,"" Hamm says. ""And I woke up more than two hours later, [after] a solid nap, completely passed out, and I'm like, Wow, this is magic. This thing works for me.""


Related: Fighting Sleep Is a Losing Management Strategy. Let Your Employees Take Naps.So Hamm kept using the blanket at night, but there was a problem: Because the blanket was filled with plastic beads to add weight, she often got too hot. The underlying functionality works; the weight on my body works, Hamm remembers thinking, but how it is made doesn't work. After some research, Hamm discovered that the technology, which largely consisted of bead-filled chambers between layers of blanket, had been around for 30 years — ""Nobody had innovated anything about this product.""""Why can't you just use strips of cotton?""Hamm decided to experiment with alternative designs. She drew some inspiration from her time spent in India, ""where there's a culture of making rugs, knitting, crocheting,"" but the ultimate breakthrough came from a conversation with her mom. Hamm had been considering changing the material or adding holes for airflow when her mom said, ""Why can't you just use strips of cotton?"" They would create a thick yarn that could be knit together for natural airflow, eliminating the need for heavy artificial materials that shift around and reduce comfort. That idea led to the development of Bearaby's first small blanket, made from a cut-up t-shirt.


Confident she was onto something, Hamm opted to take a year's leave from her job to focus on the business. ""I didn't want to take too much of a risk, again, knowing that it can get really hard,"" she admits. ""[But] my boss was super supportive, and she said, 'Look, if it doesn't work out, we make a case study out of it.'""Hamm withdrew $120,000 from her retirement fund and raised just over $250,000 from a crowdfunding campaign to fund the prototypes for the first batch of blankets. She also looked into patents, but they were expensive, so she did the drawing herself, then had a lawyer put together a provisional patent application, which entitles the filer to 18 months before they have to pay more money. That went through just a couple of days before launch in December 2018; the blanket sold out in two weeks and was the only product of its kind on the market for a couple of years, Hamm says.Image Credit: Courtesy of BearabyRelated: How to Take Advantage of the 'First-to-File' Patent System


Despite the early success, the more than 50 factories that Hamm approached weren't inclined to take on the product. They'd never seen anything like it: It wasn't apparel, and it wasn't bedding. So, for that first year and a half, Hamm rented a small garage outfitted with knitting machines and knitters to churn out the first products. The strong sales helped the business continue to finance production, which was a good thing, too — because people still weren't all that interested in investing in the first-of-its-kind product.""In hindsight, we had to learn to be profitable.""Hamm leaned into the ""bootstrap"" mentality, which was a blessing in disguise. ""In hindsight, we had to learn to be profitable,"" she explains, ""to become in tune with our production processes and marketing processes, to be efficient, which sometimes you didn't see at that time in the direct-to-consumer space. Everyone was like, 'I raised that much money, and I'm putting that much million on a marketing spend.' So we never had it, but now, in an environment where money is not flowing [as] freely, we never had that money in the first place, so we are feeling pretty good right now.""Bearaby saw another major advantage in brand loyalty. Hamm notes that people seeking wellness and sleep tend to form an ""emotional connection"" with the blanket,"" and that it's easy to fall in love with a brand that helps you sleep better. Substantial interest also translated into an early retail presence. Just five months in, Bearaby was in West Elm, thanks to customers who walked in and wanted to try the blanket. That happened with Nordstrom, too.


Related: Customer Loyalty Is Your Holy Grail for Success. Here's How to Cultivate It.As Bearaby considered expansion, it centered on functional products that would uphold its commitment to quality and sustainability (the company is certified by third-party organizations, including The Global Organic Textile Standard, The Forest Stewardship Council and The Global Recycled Standard). Because anxiety so often goes hand in hand with insomnia, the company landed on its warmables line; boasting a weighted and heated neck wrap, bottle and lap pad, it ""takes the nervous system to zero,"" Hamm says.Image Credit: Courtesy of BearabyNaturally, Bearaby's products have become an integral part of Hamm's own sleep routine, and as she's gotten older, she's realized even more just how much sleep she actually needs. ""Now I sleep for a minimum of eight hours,"" she says. ""I'm training myself to get nine to 10 hours of sleep, obviously not every night, but definitely every weekend. Also, [it helps] whenever I get a chance to take a nap, like just a 20-minute nap to reset. [I make sure that I have] these conscious breaks, whether [it's] napping or deep breathing because running a business is a marathon, and if we don't take care of our bodies, we're not able to do that over a very long time.""


""Just have tunnel vision for one year, and then reevaluate after those 365 days.""Hamm's five-year marathon with Bearaby has led to over eight figures in sales and more than 10 patents — but it all started with a single, somewhat reluctant leap of faith. And according to the founder, that's exactly what it takes to be successful.""Once you believe in a product, just take a chance and give yourself a year,"" Hamm says. ""It's much more manageable if you [have] a considerable time frame where it's like, Okay, in that year, I'm giving everything I have, 100%. Because sometimes we second guess ourselves. After [a few] months or six weeks, we don't see the success, [and] we start doubting ourselves. You say [I have] one year, and I'm not asking if this is working. Just have tunnel vision for one year, and then reevaluate after those 365 days.""This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

The environment at Yo' Mama's, a comfort food restaurant in Birmingham, Alabama, is just what it sounds like: a warm space that makes customers feel at home. Owned and operated by Crystal Peterson and her family, the establishment wins over customers through its quick and engaging counter service.Crystal and her mom got their start selling food at jazz festivals in Florida back in 2011. When they moved into a brick-and-mortar in 2014, Crystal developed her unique business model through market research.""I actually [ate] at every single restaurant I could think of that could be comparable to [mine] and [looked] at what was missing,"" she revealed. ""Was it the customer service aspect? Was it the portion size? Was it the flavor?""



What she found was that counter service is a win for both the owner and the customer. When guests aren't waiting thirty minutes to order their food, Crystal doesn't have to stress about turning tables and can provide the quality customer service that is so crucial to success.It's also important to understand your customer base. Crystal's restaurant tends to draw in travelers and workers looking for a bite to eat during their mid-day break. Because of this, she aims to create a ""getaway"" space where customers can relax in the middle of a busy day and enjoy a delicious meal without worrying about long wait times.


Yo' Mama's regulars, like Yelp Elite Delia S., love the way Crystal and her staff approach customer service, greeting customers at the counter and walking them through the menu.""I remember the interpersonal contact that this restaurant does on a consistent basis,"" Delia said. ""The vibe I got was, 'We're excited you're here. We appreciate your business, and we also want to make this an establishment where you will continue to visit and tell other people about it.'""Key to Yo' Mama's top-tier service is Crystal's involvement in the business's day-to-day operations. She knows that morale starts from the top and makes an effort to be at the restaurant as often as she can, engaging with her staff and customers.""What I've known is that workers work better when the owner's in the building,"" she said. ""You get a better product, so the customer is more satisfied.""


Crystal has also made her business a hit by focusing on a niche. Her gluten-free menu attracts people who can't satisfy their dietary needs at just any restaurant, and it also creates an element of surprise and delight for customers who don't come in looking for gluten-free food and still enjoy their meal.This focus on accommodating dietary restrictions has helped Yo' Mama's create a strong community where every diner feels included.""I've literally had customers that have come in and cried because their kid has never been able to eat in a restaurant because they are gluten intolerant. And they [can] actually sit there and enjoy a meal with them instead of having to bring a snack in for them to eat or get[ting] food from another restaurant [to] bring to them.""Building this kind of welcoming and accessible space for the local community aids Crystal's ultimate goal as a business owner to support the local economy. She emphasized that if you and your neighbors don't spend your money where you live, nobody else will, especially if everyone commutes to larger cities or towns.


""You have to be a citizen, and [being] a citizen equates to using your money right by your house instead of going to the other side of town,"" she said.Spending money at Black-owned businesses, who are often hindered by stereotypes, is especially important. Delia makes an effort not only to visit local Black-owned businesses but shout them out on Yelp whenever she can, letting people know that these spots are for everyone to visit and enjoy.""Oftentimes in restaurants, I don't think the playing field is fair. As a Yelp Elite, I am more drawn to trying as many of the smaller, often Black-owned restaurants that our city has to offer because there's such a large Black community—but that doesn't mean that only Black people are eating Black food. Restaurants are spaces that have the ability to traverse across class, race, region. You go into Yo' Mama's, and you see a diversity of people there gathering around this comfort food.""Delia also makes sure all her reviews are thoughtful, filling gaps on Yelp Pages by uploading missing photos of dishes and menus and choosing not to post about negative experiences unless she has valuable tips for owners or other guests.


Crystal brings this same level of intentionality to her review responses as an owner. She has found that some consumers only review a business when they want to express frustration or have expectations that Crystal can't satisfy, like an issue with her pricing. She chooses not to let these customers bring down her energy or service-focused mindset. By managing her emotions in the face of backlash, Crystal is able to engage with customers in a more productive way.""Some [customers] are coming in looking to lose. Some of the problems that people have don't even include me. So if I can control my emotions to change your emotions, then maybe we can win this and you can actually enjoy the experience.""In addition to an inviting restaurant atmosphere, Yo' Mama's believes in:Understanding your customers and your role in the business community. Gain an edge by researching your competitors and thinking about how you can fill gaps in their offerings.Restaurants as a space for diverse, inclusive community. Accommodating the needs of all your customers, including those with dietary restrictions, can help everyone who enters your space feel seen and welcome.Being flexible in the face of chaos. Navigate unexpected business obstacles by keeping the well-being of your customers and staff at the forefront.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Crystal and Delia, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.

68,The 'Always Sunny' Guys Liked the Idea of Mocking Celebrity Brands — and Wound Up Creating a Best-Selling Product of Their Own,"Mar 15, 2024",Dan Bova,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/the-story-behind-the-always-sunny-guys-irish-american/471032,"
If you created the longest-running live-action sitcom in U.S. TV history, you'd probably want to toast your success. And what better way to do it than creating your own booze to fill your glass, right?That's what the brain trust behind It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia did. Well, not exactly, but sorta.Rob McElhenney, Charlie Day, and Glenn Howerton are the twisted minds behind the insanely funny show (which co-stars Kaitlin Olson and Danny Devito) and they are also the founders of Four Walls Whiskey. The 80-proof Irish American Whiskey blend is smooth with a slight rye finish, making it, in this sipper's opinion, dangerously delicious. It hit shelves in the fall of last year, and is currently available for purchase in 40+ states here in the U.S., plus the in-stadium bar of Wrexham A.F.C., the soccer club that McElhenney co-owns with Ryan Reynolds.



As St. Patrick's Day partiers prepare to hit parade routes and pubs, I spoke with Glenn and Four Walls CEO Casey McGrath about the birth of the booze, how they turned the concept of a ""celebrity brand money grab"" on its head and the surprisingly emotional meaning behind Four Walls' name and mission.Related: Charlie Day Says You Shouldn't Just 'Do What Makes You Happy'What is your expert advice to revelers this St. Patrick's Day?Glenn Howerton: If you're traditionally a Jameson drinker — a shot and a beer type of person — I'd say try it with Four Walls instead. Because we're better.Shots fired! So how did this whole thing come together?Casey McGrath: I worked in traditional spirits marketing for over a decade and during the pandemic, I started to see a great opportunity to build brands from scratch. And I saw that there was a lot of love and white space in the Irish whiskey category, so I gave Glenn a call. We have a lot of mutual friends and I am a massive fan of the show. He told me that they were already playing with the idea of tackling and subverting the idea of celebrity-owned brands with some sort of lager or barroom beer, so we went from there.


Glenn Howerton: I knew Casey for a long time, but I knew him as a creative director for the Kings of Leon. I didn't realize he had so much experience in the spirits market. If I'd known that maybe things would have kicked off a little bit earlier, but I do think things happen when they're supposed to happen. So once we started talking to Casey, I knew right away that the marketing side of this made sense because he got our sense of humor and understood what would feel authentic to us. And I'm a big whiskey drinker, so I got very excited about this idea instead of doing a beer. Once we realized that we could really carve something out by doing an Irish American blend and lean into the Irish American aspect of it, we just started firing on all cylinders.Related: How Eric Church and Raj Alva Distilled Whiskey SuccessHow involved were you, Charlie and Rob all in landing on the flavor?Glenn: There were a lot — a lot — of tastings. That was the best part. We had a master blender that we were working with, so everything we tried was very good. So it came down to personal preference and then testing out our personal preferences with some influential bartenders to make sure that we were on the same page. Because we knew very early on that we wanted our focus to be on the bartenders. This all started as a sort of celebration of the 15th record-breaking season of It's Always Sunny. And real bars and bartenders played such crucial roles in the building of our show that we wanted to do something to celebrate them.


How does making a whiskey brand from scratch compare with making a TV show from scratch? Glenn: It's weird because I'm by no means a whiskey expert, but I do know what I like. And I was not a comedy expert when we started doing Always Sunny by any stretch of the imagination, but I knew what I liked. We knew what we liked. And that's this credo we've always followed: let's make something that we would watch, let's make something that we would drink. And anytime we've stayed authentic to our preferences, it's been successful.In terms of the flavor, what is that preference you were going for? Glenn: We were asking a lot of this whiskey. We wanted it to drink smooth like an Irish whiskey, but have the full body aspects of a rye whiskey so that it could blend in cocktails. And also, importantly, it needed to hit a $30 price point.


Casey: It's a real Swiss Army knife. It's the bartender's utility whiskey. A lot of Irish whiskey is great as a shot, but many bartenders don't use it in cocktails because it doesn't hold up flavor-wise. So we wanted something that would be the best of both worlds.Have you thought of a way to bend the time-space continuum so that your real whiskey can wind up on the shelf of the fictional Paddy's Pub where the show is set?Glenn: We'll have to figure something out. We have leaned into the whole celebrity spirit brand thing. We did an episode with Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, who make Dos Hombres Mezcal, where we were basically making fun of celebrity brands. So exactly how or if we're going to integrate Four Walls into the show, we'll see. But I mean, obviously, it is a great platform to expose fans to it.Casey: A reminder, the name of that episode with Bryan and Aaron is ""Celebrity Booze: The Ultimate Cash Grab.""How did you come up with the name Four Walls?Casey: That's my favorite thing to talk about. It is called Four Walls in reference to the four walls of a bar. This physical space that we can all go to keep our troubles out and hold in our good times.Glenn: Coming out of the pandemic, it was really important for us to celebrate physical spaces in a virtual world. It was time for people to get back and see each other, look each other in the eye, shake hands and give those warm hugs. I really missed that and I don't even know that I realized how much I missed it or how socially awkward I'd become. It's easy for me to get emotional about this because so much time in my formative 20s and 30s was spent in bars getting a beer and a shot and having some of the best times of my life. And that's the feeling we wanted to connect to with this.


Casey: What's funny is that Glenn and the guys are so passionate about this, but the promotion of any product can be exhausting. We're working these guys to the bone, flying them all over to events. And you'll get an exhausted Glenn that you drag kicking and screaming to another city, but then once you get him in the bar, you gotta drag him out! He never wants to leave.Related: Why Ryan Reynolds Says ""You Can't Be Good At Something Unless You're Willing To Be Bad""Were there any runner-up names for Four Walls?Glenn: We thought about just calling it Brown. If you watch the show, you know ""brown"" is very meaningful to the characters. It's what they refer to whiskey as. It's a very Philadelphia thing. But once we came up with the tagline ""The Better Brown!"" we realized we had a perfect marriage of both ideas.


So your Four Walls and Ryan Reynolds's Aviation Gin are offered at the Wrexham stadium. Which sells better?Casey: Well, at the time of this interview we've only been there for three days, so, um,...we're doing better!Glenn: It's a good question. Fair question. We'll get back to you with some numbers.

69,Ever Wonder Why Certain Websites Rank Higher Than Yours? This SEO Expert Reveals The Secret to Dominating Search Results,"Mar 14, 2024",Ludwig Makhyan,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/ever-wonder-why-certain-websites-rank-higher-than-yours/467390,"
Have you ever wondered why some businesses consistently top search engine results? It's often the smart use of SEO, now supercharged with AI, particularly in keyword optimization.As a technical SEO expert with over two decades of experience in website development and digital marketing, I've seen firsthand how AI is revolutionizing the SEO landscape, making it more efficient and targeted.AI in SEO is like a super-sleuth assistant, effortlessly analyzing mountains of data to uncover trends and insights, leading to smarter, more impactful SEO strategies.



Transforming keyword researchGone are the days of manually sifting through keywords. AI transforms this process, delving deep into data to reveal not just popular keywords but also niche phrases and emerging trends. It goes beyond just picking keywords — it's like getting into your audience's heads and really understanding their needs and wants.Making AI work for you in keyword optimizationEver wonder how AI can work wonders for your SEO? It all starts with choosing the right AI tool—think of it as finding a savvy partner in your SEO journey.


Choosing the right toolYou need an AI-driven keyword tool that matches your business's unique needs and brings a set of skills that can truly make a difference. Think of it as finding a tool that speaks your language and understands your goals.Look for a comprehensive data analysis tool. It should dive deep into the sea of data and surface with valuable insights. Consider SEO tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush, which are like the seasoned guides of the SEO world.They can predict trends and provide insights into what your audience is actually searching for. It's not just about having a lot of data; it's about having the right data that can tell you about user intent and future search trends.This way, you're not just shooting arrows in the dark but strategically aiming based on informed predictions.


Understand user intentDiving into the world of user intent is a bit like being a mind reader. It's all about understanding why someone typed a query into a search engine.Is it to buy something? To learn? To find a specific website? Or to have a question answered? AI tools are here to help you crack this code. For example, when you use a tool like MarketMuse or Clearscope, it's like having a conversation with your audience without them saying a word. These tools analyze search queries and give you insights into what your audience really wants from their search.Now, imagine you run an online gardening store. AI might reveal that a significant portion of your audience searches for ""how to care for indoor plants."" This is a clear signal to focus on informational content, perhaps a blog post or a how-to guide, rather than just pushing product pages. Conversely, if you notice a high volume of searches like ""buy indoor plant fertilizer,"" that's a transactional intent where your product pages should take center stage. But here's a twist: not all traffic is beneficial.Suppose your AI tool shows a surge in queries like ""free indoor plants."" This traffic might not be valuable if your goal is to boost sales, as these users are likely looking for giveaways or contests, not to make a purchase. In this scenario, understanding user intent helps you refine your SEO strategy to attract the right kind of traffic — the kind that aligns with your business goals and converts.


Stay agile Embracing AI in your SEO strategy is a bit like surfing. You need to stay agile and ready to ride the waves of change as they come. AI tools are fantastic at providing real-time data, offering a snapshot of what's happening right now. It's like having a weather forecast for your SEO strategy. Just as a surfer would check the weather and wave conditions, using AI tools allows you to monitor current trends, search patterns and changes in user behavior.Let's say you run a fitness website and notice a sudden spike in searches for ""home workout routines"" due to an unexpected event, like a lockdown. This real-time data is your cue to quickly pivot and focus on creating content that matches this emerging interest. Perhaps you could introduce a new blog series or video content around home workouts. But here's where agility really counts: not every trend or surge in searches is worth pursuing.It's about discerning which waves are worth riding. If a trending topic doesn't align with your brand or offers little potential for conversion, it may not be beneficial to chase it. The agility afforded by AI isn't just about quick reactions; it's also about making smart, strategic decisions based on real-time insights.Merge AI insights with your content strategyIncorporating AI insights into your content strategy is like having a seasoned chef in your kitchen — one who knows exactly what your guests crave. It's about blending the science of data with the art of content creation.


AI tools do more than gather data; they offer insights that can shape your content strategy, ensuring it's not only rich with the right keywords but also resonates deeply with your audience. For instance, imagine you're running a travel blog. AI might reveal that your audience is increasingly searching for ""sustainable travel tips."" This insight is a goldmine.It guides you to create content focused on eco-friendly travel, perhaps a series of articles or an in-depth guide on the topic. This targeted approach ensures your content is not just relevant but also highly engaging and likely to attract the right kind of traffic — people genuinely interested in sustainable travel.However, it's important to remember that AI is a tool, not a magic wand. It provides the map, but you need to embark on the journey. While AI can suggest topics and keywords based on trends and user intent, the creativity in how you present this content — the unique voice, the compelling storytelling is up to you. This is where your understanding of your audience's preferences, combined with your brand's unique perspective, comes into play.Related: How Does AI Writing Impact Your SEO? Here's What You Need to Know.


Merging AI insights with your content strategy enables you to create content that's not only optimized for search engines but also genuinely valuable and engaging for your audience. It's about striking that perfect balance between data-driven precision and creative flair.ConclusionIntegrating AI into your SEO strategy, particularly for keyword optimization, isn't just a nice to have; it's becoming essential in a digital world where staying ahead of the curve means understanding and leveraging the latest technologies. By embracing AI, you're not just optimizing your SEO efforts — you're setting your business up for smarter, more successful online engagement.

70,Boomers: The Wealthy Client Group You Can't Ignore — Here's the Best Way to Market to Them.,"Mar 14, 2024",Scott Keffer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/boomers-own-most-of-the-wealth-heres-the-best-way-to/469989,"
In the unending search for the holy grail of marketing, financial advisors are lately tempted by promises of quick and easy client acquisition through digital marketing miracles. From buying digital leads to endless social media posts, content marketing and webinars, the financial industry has embraced the allure of online strategies with hopes of waves of new affluent clients.However, starting with a method is marketing backward. Marketing should always begin with your ideal client. Knowing their mindset is the recipe for success – embracing their desires, mastering their language, and resonating with their values.The ideal clientThe first and foremost consideration is defining the ideal client. Seeking to be everything to everybody positions you as nothing to no one.



My definition is an E.L.K. — Easy. Listen to you. Keep paying you the most — who is successful, serious and salt. Successful financially ($2 million to $25 million), serious about their money and future and salt-of-the-earth (loyal and trustworthy). Most importantly, they are in a position to become a client today and move their money to you now (ages 64-74).That's a Baby Boomer. Boomers own 51 percent of all wealth in the United States, have the most wealth per household, have the most money in retirement funds and have the most money in stock and mutual funds.


Related: The 7-Step Guide To Finding the Right Clients and Avoiding the Ones Who Waste Your TimeThe normal and natural testProspects do what is normal and natural.Think about this: Would an affluent Boomer normally and naturally go online to find a CPA, attorney, heart surgeon or financial advisor? The answer is no. Sure, there are always exceptions. However, in marketing, relying on exceptions is foolhardy and costly. Marketing must be sustainable and scalable to be successful.Many mistakenly assume that the majority of retail purchases are made online. Not true. In 2023, only 15.6% of all U.S. retail sales occurred online, according to Statista. Furthermore, 84% of Boomers prefer visiting a physical store for their shopping needs.


Understanding the mindset of Boomers, who grew up in a world devoid of technology, unveils a picture of their unique set of values and preferences. Growing up with catalog shopping, green stamps, waiting for the mailman, service stations, rotary phones, telephone operators, sending postcards while traveling, adjusting the antenna on the single black-and-white TV, vinyl records, having milk delivered to a box on the front porch and getting news from Walter Cronkite has stamped an indelible set of values and preferences on them.Not surprisingly, Boomers align with traditional values, are most comfortable with conventional communication, and value information from trusted sources.Typically, three kinds of people go online for financial information: 1. Hot tip investors seeking the latest stock ""intel,"" 2. DIYers seeking ""how to"" information, and 3. Price-shopping penny pinchers seeking a deal. None of these are the kind of people who make the best long-term, loyal clients.Related: How You Can Build Long-Lasting Customer Relationships


The ideal marketing mediumDirect mail aligns perfectly with the preferences of Boomers. They trust the tangible.According to the United States Postal Service (USPS), 92% of Boomers check their mail daily, with 91% stating that sorting through mail doesn't stress them. Furthermore, 82% express a greater likelihood of buying from a business that sends them direct mail, considering it more personal than digital communications. These statistics reinforce that Boomers trust direct mail more than any other marketing channel.Even Google and other popular brands rely on direct mail to get businesses to advertise with them. In a 2018 Vox article, they report, ""Yet over the last few years, brands — including hot, digitally savvy, direct-to-consumer ones like Casper, Harry's, Wayfair, Rover, Quip, Away, Handy, and Modcloth — have taken to targeting customers in the mail.""Better yet, mailboxes are less cluttered these days, which means less competition. As advertising spending overall grew 50% (2015-2021), the dollars that went into Direct Mail dropped 17%, per Statista.


Related: 5 Ways to Effectively Market to Baby BoomersHere are five keys to make for direct mail success1. Personalize the mail: Make it unique — Craft your message as if it's a letter written to a friend. Address the dreams, desires, and concerns of a Boomer. Make them feel seen and understood, establishing an immediate connection. Use their name, acknowledge their individuality, and tailor your communication to resonate on a personal level with authenticity and sincerity.2. Invest in presentation: Make it hard to ignore — Design your mailing package to be visually arresting. Invest in quality paper, eye-catching graphics, and a layout that demands attention. A well-presented letter not only reflects professionalism but also intrigues prospects, urging them to want more.3. Appeal to both the heart and the head: Mix emotion with reason – Strike a balance between emotional resonance and logical persuasion. Connect with them emotionally and support your claims with rational arguments, data, and evidence. This harmonious blend creates a persuasive narrative that speaks to both the heart and the head, leaving a lasting impact and setting you apart from the crowd.


4. Include high-value content – Provide information that adds genuine value. Offer statistics, trends, and insights that position you as a source of exclusive knowledge, elevating the perceived value of your message. By sharing relevant and intriguing content, you position yourself as an indispensable resource, fostering trust and credibility.5. Use familiar analogies and metaphors – Communicate complex ideas using relatable analogies and metaphors. Create a bridge between unfamiliar concepts and your prospects' existing knowledge. Analogies serve as mental shortcuts, making it easier for your reader to grasp the essence of your message. By using familiar comparisons, you enhance accessibility.In a world barraged with online noise, the key to success with affluent Boomers lies in delivering messages that are normal, natural, and, above all, trusted by them. Financial advisors can unlock a deep gold mine of affluent Boomers with little competition by embracing direct mail and crafting personalized, engaging marketing.

Their functionality relies on decision trees and predefined rules to determine appropriate responses.In contrast, virtual assistants utilize more sophisticated AI technologies, incorporating natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. This allows them to comprehend context and engage in conversations that mimic natural human interactions. The key distinction lies in the advanced capabilities of virtual assistants, enabling more nuanced and context-aware interactions compared to rule-based chatbots.Chatbots overviewPros:

Virtual assistants often come at a higher price point due to their advanced capabilities and human-like interactions.They may not be as scalable as chatbots, which can simultaneously handle a higher volume of interactions.Building and maintaining virtual assistants can be resource-intensive and require ongoing training and updates.Quality virtual assistant-enabled devices can be expensive, restricting access for some users.Let's be straightforward – there's no definitive choice when deciding between chatbots and virtual assistants for your customer service strategy. The selection depends on your particular needs, budget constraints, and the desired level of personalization. Chatbots shine in terms of efficiency and cost-effectiveness, while virtual assistants bring versatility and more sophisticated interactions.The ultimate decision revolves around your business objectives and the type of customer service you aspire to provide.

73,2 Things You Need to Convince Google You're an Expert In Your Niche And Drive Traffic,"Mar 12, 2024",Jeff Peroutka,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-convince-google-youre-an-expert-in-your-niche/470503,"
When others link to your website, Google wants to learn what value you can provide to users — the very reason someone gave you a backlink. That's where digital public relations (digital PR) comes in.Compared to manual link building, digital PR focuses on teaching a search engine about your expertise, which is reaffirmed by other publications linking to your content.Let's take a deeper look at how search engines like Google have evolved, how digital PR works and why using it together with manual link-building efforts is considered best to keep your website relevant.



Google has grown smartGoogle is traditionally all about links — the more links inserted, the better. However, it has grown into a smart semantic search engine. Instead of simply looking at the links, it tries to understand the context, including the site's information, what it offers and similar details.Google's focus is shifting to value sites that provide helpful content and strong Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) signals. In other words, link quality will matter more than quantity.


For example, websites with limited authority, despite their high traffic, are focusing on establishing topical relevance. They're basically convincing Google that they are experts in a particular topic or niche. And this is one of the defining factors between digital PR and manual link building.Related: Enhance Your Website's Visibility and Dominate Your Competition With These Powerful TechniquesUnderstanding digital PRDigital PR is very much like traditional public relations, except that it's focused on the digital space. It's the use of online channels to manage your brand's reputation and build positive relationships with your target audience.When it comes to search engine optimization (SEO), digital PR helps in:


Attracting visitors to your website.Getting other websites to link back to yours, which improves your website's authority and ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs).There's no single way to perform digital PR outreach. However, a common but effective strategy involves content creation efforts. In other words, you need to create valuable assets, including reports, infographics, white papers, statistics, and other content that is good enough for other publications to link to your work organically.Digital PR makes for quality backlinks but takes timeOrganic backlinks — voluntary links to your content — are considered higher-quality links than those you manually build (either by guest posting or affiliate linking). Digital PR is a powerful tool for acquiring such high-quality backlinks. However, it's a long shot that requires effort and patience to yield good results. Here's why.Building relationshipsYou must demonstrate your brand's value and expertise consistently before your target audience members become willing to recommend or link to your content.Creating valuable contentResearching topics, providing commentary or launching campaigns are not done in one sitting. You need to invest a significant amount of time and resources.Earning organic coverageJournalists get pitched constantly, so your content needs to be truly newsworthy and relevant to their audience to stand out and secure coverage. Sometimes, you must also have a strategic outreach plan to pitch your content to the right journalists and publications.


Related: Why a Good Digital PR Strategy Is So ImportantManual link-building remains an effective SEO strategyWhile digital PR is a great way to boost authority, manual link-building remains effective in maintaining your website's visibility and relevance. The only difference is that you're proactively getting the backlinks to your website rather than letting journalists voluntarily do the linking.Still, given the change in the current landscape, you should focus your link-building efforts on earning juicy links rather than spamming them. Here are a few manual link-building strategies that might still provide good results:Guest postingWrite high-quality articles for other relevant websites in your niche. Then, make sure that you include a link back to your own website within the content.Broken link buildingFind broken links on relevant websites and reach out to the website owners, suggesting your content as a replacement.Help a Reporter Out (HARO) pitching

Manual link-building risks penaltiesManual link building is seen as a method to replicate digital PR link earning (which can take a long time). While it can be faster, it also carries the risk of getting your website penalized when done incorrectly. Here are some cases where this might happen:Unnatural link profileSearch engines like Google analyze link patterns to identify websites engaging in manipulative link building. An example of this is when your website has a sudden surge of links that seem unnatural, including those from low-quality websites, identical anchor texts, or links to private blog networks.Manipulative link-building techniques


Engaging in specific practices can be directly flagged as manipulative and lead to penalties. Examples include link buying, excessive link exchanges and comment spam.A two-pronged approach to link building is the bestTruthfully speaking, search engines tend to rely more on topic relevance than human-driven linking efforts today. In other words, digital PR is becoming the trend — and you should hop on to it, too.However, combining both approaches can help your business build a more effective strategy for building high-quality links. In particular, digital PR will help you get natural and authoritative links from reputable sources. Meanwhile, manual link building allows you to target and control link quality.Digital PR can be resource-intensive, as compared with manual link building. If your team is not yet ready to focus on high-quality content creation, manual link building remains a great avenue to take.

74,6 Reasons Why You Need to Attend Marketing Conferences,"Mar 12, 2024",Ross Kernez,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-importance-of-attending-marketing-conferences/470558,"
Attending a marketing conference could be one of the most profitable investments of your time and money to bolster your brand and increase your marketing know-how. Marketing conferences are the hotspot for learning the latest trends in the marketing industry, developing your self-confidence in the world of marketing and building your network.There are a myriad of marketing conferences worldwide that instruct professionals on how to foster effective marketing techniques and teach them new skill sets that can be the catalyst for business growth. Ultimately, marketing conferences can help business owners, marketing teams, and interested individuals understand how to generate more revenue through marketing. The reasons why you need to attend a marketing conference are endless, but some of the most important are as follows:1. Networking opportunitiesNetworking is one of the most crucial facets of building any business and creating strong partnerships. Bonds created during marketing conferences can lead to new opportunities and new ideas for your marketing campaigns. There are sure to be people who have a similar vision and are looking to find other professionals in the same boat and those who can share their successes and pitfalls. By engaging in the countless networking opportunities that occur during a marketing conference, you will attain new perspectives in marketing and business, all while finding support from a community of people who are on the same path.



It goes without saying that the networking opportunities during a marketing conference are one of the most valuable investments of your time and money. You'll leave feeling confident that you've made connections that will keep you feeling less alone in the world of marketing and more convinced than ever that attaining success isn't out of reach.Related: 5 Tips To Networking at Conferences as an Introvert

Employers send their marketing teams to marketing conferences to keep everyone on top of their game and up to date in the ever-changing industry.

Learning from the mistakes of othersA result of meeting hundreds of other marketing professionals is a shared understanding of some of the pitfalls, mistakes and failures that others, including the experts, have faced. Hearing about the missteps or less-than-desired results others have had is an indirect way to learn how to avoid certain pitfalls in marketing. Attending a marketing conference with an open mind and a vulnerability to share the hardest parts of your marketing efforts is par for the course for those truly wanting to succeed in the business.The upside is that mistakes and problems in marketing don't end at that, there are always solutions.

4. Meet the expertsOne of the most valuable parts of attending a marketing conference is the opportunity to meet international and world-renowned marketing experts. Hearing leaders in the field speak and teach during daily sessions is vital to growing your own marketing expertise. It's not every day that you can hear from and interact through Q&A and other networking opportunities with the individuals who have forged the path for the marketing community. It's a rare chance to meet the leaders in the industry and gain insight from their experiences.Related: Top 10 Marketing Conferences For Entrepreneurs5.

75,Struggling to Find Content Ideas for Your Business? Use This Effective Strategy to Unlock Endless Inspiration.,"Mar 12, 2024",Evgeniya Zaslavskaya,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/use-this-effective-strategy-to-unlock-endless-content-ideas/470451,"
Many clients who approach my PR agency claim they lack topics to cover. I assure them that this is not the issue as every specialist, just as every company, has valuable expertise to share. And one effective strategy to unveil it, which I previously mentioned in an article on pitching stories to journalists, is what I refer to as the ""Rubik's Cube Principle.""The concept is akin to a Rubik's Cube. Much like the cube's various colors, your knowledge and experience can be examined and presented from multiple perspectives tailored to your audience: be it different segments of B2B or B2C clients, investors, business partners or potential employees.Related: How to Never Run Out of Content Ideas Again



Begin with goal-settingBefore delving into creation and applying the Rubik's Cube Principle, it's crucial to establish clear objectives. What outcomes do you seek to achieve through your articles? Here are a few illustrative examples:Inform clients about a new product featureDraw in new users who are currently unaware of your solutionFoster community engagement and loyaltyEnhance brand visibilityEducate the audience to broaden the target marketReinforce the personal brand of the company's founderSeek investment opportunities at a specific stage of developmentAttract top-tier professionals to join the teamDifferentiate your brand from competitorsOnce you've defined your goals, you'll need to maneuver your Rubik's Cube to reveal different facets depending on the objective. For example, if your aim is to build trust and credibility among customers, your content might include case studies with client testimonials. And if you've established the aim of attracting top-tier professionals, consider writing informative articles focusing on your company culture and the keys to effective management.Know your audienceAnother crucial aspect of creating content is understanding its intended audience. Suppose you run a cybersecurity startup that offers business solutions. Providing personal user recommendations on data protection in the AI era helps to attract B2C clients, but not B2B. Use Rubik's Cube again to understand how you can present your content to make it appealing to companies. You may share best practices for preventing data breaches for business, for example.Finding different sides of your expertise helps to attract more media as well. I notice that B2B content often garners attention from niche media. At the same time, topics targeting a wider audience can contribute to a positive brand image as they are often featured in top media outlets with broad reach, such as Forbes, Fortune, TechCrunch or Entrepreneur, to name a few. Finding the right balance is crucial while prioritizing based on your goals, as mentioned earlier.Related: These Tools Guarantee You Never Run Out of the Content Your Audience Craves


Tap into recent events and industry trendsThere's no doubt that finding a fresh angle can be as tough as solving a Rubik's Cube. To make this task easier, it's helpful to stay updated on industry trends and events, such as M&As, funding rounds, innovative product launches, analytical reports, surveys and more.Let's revisit the cybersecurity startup scenario. Cyber defense significance grows annually, accompanied by the emergence of new attack vectors. Just one example: Among business and tech leaders, 52% currently expect GenAI to lead to catastrophic cyber attacks in the next 12 months. So, what's your take on this topic, and how would you advise companies to brace themselves for the impending crisis?Alternatively, consider forecasting the impact of upcoming events on your industry. Take, for instance, the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. If you've created a marketplace for airline tickets and accommodations, you could anticipate market reactions, identify optimal ticket purchase times, offer tips for cost-effective lodging, provide guidance for property owners on renting out apartments and more — all tailored to your target audience's needs.Keep tabs on journalists covering your industry, as well as your competitorsStay abreast of industry discussions by monitoring both journalists' and competitors' coverage of your topic. By observing what they are writing about, you can glean inspiration. Additionally, even seemingly saturated topics can be reframed from a fresh perspective, offering readers a new angle on the Rubik's Cube.


One effective strategy is to set up Google Alerts for timely notifications on the chosen theme. This allows you to stay informed about the latest developments in your field. You may uncover opportunities where journalists haven't fully explored a related subject, or where their perspectives differ from yours — both potential avenues for contributing an expert column.A couple of examples: While journalists may extensively cover the financial sector's embrace of blockchain technology, they might have missed its potential advantages in improving voting systems or managing intellectual property rights, particularly when integrated with AI. Or maybe your competitors have overlooked the applications of digital avatars in personalized healthcare, rather than their more common use in influencer marketing and entertainment.Related: 11 Things To Write About When You Don't Know What to Write AboutUse data-driven storytellingA more sophisticated yet effective approach involves leveraging the data at your disposal. Let's say you are developing an AI solution for the healthcare industry. So, maybe you could ask your clients about the pressing questions they have regarding the implications of GenAI and then mold your findings into newsworthy content. This research has the potential to garner media attention and, at the very least, bolster your brand's market recognition.


Moreover, it may spark inspiration for new topics. For example, your clients' concerns about the ethical use of GenAI in patient care could lead to a research-driven article addressing these issues, which could be picked up by relevant industry media outlets. Still, it's crucial that the use of data is grounded in ethical principles.By the way, tapping into AI to beat so-called writer's block is also a smart move. Research worldwide suggests that about half of marketing and advertising pros are already using AI to brainstorm, making it a worthy tool to ignite fresh ideas.Above all, take actionRecently, I came across a LinkedIn poll that discussed the most effective communication strategy for B2C projects. In my opinion, there isn't a single definitive strategy; otherwise, everyone would adopt it. However, a fundamental rule does exist: Take action. Begin with small steps, like publishing one article, and gradually expand your media coverage.Ideally, strive to produce content consistently within your niche. Public relations resembles sports: While running a marathon may seem daunting at first, consistent training makes it achievable. Similarly, excelling in PR is like crossing a finish line — it demands dedication and perseverance.


It's worth noting that if you struggle to devise compelling content ideas, try to seek guidance from a proficient PR specialist or agency. Sometimes, putting your trust in an expert is the most effective approach.

You work so hard to build up your own name and protect the reputation you have developed. Yet in our super-connected and politically evolving world, everything you post — every comment, photo and status update — could also be used against you. For a CEO, leader or entrepreneur, the task is all the more high-stakes: managing your online persona.This article will explore social media's profound benefits and potential pitfalls for personal brands and reputations like yours. You will learn strategies that can help you harness its power for maximum effect while sidestepping traps that may otherwise cost you your reputation.What is personal brand, and why does it matter?Your brand is that shimmering something of skills, experiences, values, and even your little quirks that make you unique and an increasingly attractive choice in your business.



It is the constant reminder you etch into people's minds about how you need to be perceived and interacted with. Authentic personal branding can make all the difference in the world. It enhances you and increases your solidity, much in the same way that a thick layer of chrome adds to something.Establishing a well-defined personal brand opens the door to valuable new opportunities, as it allows you to attract like-minded people who resonate with your message. It also prepares you to be the trusted authority, building bonds of trust with audiences so tight it would take steel cables to pull them apart.


This means that if one typifies the loud, clear proclaimer who overflows with contagious passion concerning one's purpose, one presents a consistent narrative that will resonate as a tuning fork does with one's people. In summary, this will lead to business growth and career and personal development galore.Related: Reputation Management Starts Before Your First Bad Review — Here's How to Develop a Proactive Crisis PlanThe relationship between an online presence and brand reputationThe connection between your presence on social media and your brand reputation has never been stronger these days. Your presence on social media is a high-definition digital mirror that showcases your brand, values, thoughts, triumphs and spirited interactions for the world to see.Every LinkedIn post, tweet, and digital status update is another brush stroke on the canvas of your portrait, building an unshakeable representation of your radiant essence for others to view. Intentional social media can take your brand to the stratosphere, get your people consistently dialed in, and have you firmly positioned as the thought leader in your space.


In contrast, a poorly managed online presence may easily vanish like a sandcastle in front of an aggressive tide, washing out the foundation of trust that one has built up with hard work.Every mistake, every controversy, every fight, or one inappropriate overshare on the Internet can take a life of its own and go viral, so much so that it might cause unthinkable, possibly irreparable damage to your reputation. You've got to understand that we're in a digital age that casts a stark spotlight. Every move you make prints an indelible record for the world to scrutinize.Here are five ways social media can make your personal brand and reputation authentic.Visibility. Always lead with gravitas. Social media hands you a bullhorn through which you amplify your expertise, insights, and every single win to a global audience who would not have the time to catch up otherwise.Builds good relations. Avoid Ai generated auto responses, use your real voice in comments, candid conversations, and genuine talks builds up loyal brand connections more effectively than any steel rope ever would.One will manage to show oneself as an expert. Your constant authoritative content, unique perspectives, and lively activity within the sphere of industry discussions make you a respected thought leader. Indeed, your credibility and influence are drawing close to that of a gravity well.Brand your reputation. Social media gives you the ability to proactively craft and control your brand message and to act quickly on anything positive or negative that could potentially alter your hard-earned company reputation.Dominate your network. Social networking makes possible easier communication and collaboration with other visionary competitors, industry bigwigs, and potential partners, hence throwing wide open, opportunities for growth, creative synergy, and win-win-win action.Digital amphitheaters, which are equaled by a huge potential to create authentic personal brands and reputations, bring substantial risk. One errant step or poorly executed post can deal catastrophic damage in the twinkle of an eye, unraveling years of patience and painstakingly earned progress more quickly than a Jenga tower kicked by a mule.


Related: How to Balance Between Personal and Professional Social MediaPotentially provocative, offensive or controversial contentWith all shares potentially provocative, offending, or controversial, you may very literally switch off your reputation's light as if it were a light bulb and lose the audience in thousands.Inconsistent inauthenticity. Poor presence and lack of earnestness consistent with the cause breeds dissonance. You either seem less credible, confusing, or just disingenuous, worse.Unengaged Ghosting. Don't play the pretend ""I'm too important to respond"" game. Ignoring followers, comments, or concerns on social media is a better way to lose trust and loyalty than even leaving a half-melted icicle in the heart of summer.Unprofessional Faux-Pas. Trudging through embarrassing online meltdowns, the moronic slinging of insults and abuse at other people's comments, or conducting oneself in an unprofessional manner can damage your reputation faster than a wrecking ball through the drywall.Failure to Address. Burying the head in the sand and bungling controversies, PR crises or negative feedback only fans the flame by providing it with more oxygen. To make things worse, problems get nurtured to create almost insurmountable barriers while trying to rebuild lost public trust.After all, personal branding in social media is a double-edged sword since, on the one hand, it gives great power to multiply your voice, create absolutely valuable connections, and become a leader of thought for the world. On the other hand, even a small slip can cut very painfully deep with grievous wounds to your reputation.You must learn to use these digital tools to become an adept brand leader, influencer, or entrepreneur. Achieving the art of appropriately presenting yourself and getting your community involved to grow it to next level is synonymous with enhancing your reputation.


The same reputation you have labored to secure over the years can be gone in the blink of an eye due to controversy, inconsistency, or simply not being professional. Be aware of these perceptions and still know how to use today's social media power.

79,Don't Leave Money on the Table — How to Find Out If You're Underpricing Your Products (and What to Do About It),"Mar 9, 2024",Itai Sadan,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/are-you-underpricing-your-products-heres-how-to-find-out/468841,"
Do your customers know what your products are worth? That may seem like a bizarre question at first, but in reality, many businesses routinely fail to convey the actual value of their products. Unsurprisingly, this miscommunication is seldom in a business's favor.More than 20 years ago, experts at McKinsey & Company found that between 80% and 90% of mispriced products are priced too low — and that remains true today. That's potential revenue lost right out of the gate, and more than you might think. A 1% increase in price without a change in the volume of products sold equates to an 11.1% increase in operating profits, according to this comprehensive study by Harvard Business Review published in 1992 and still widely cited today.Related: 10 Questions to Ask When Pricing Your Product



Where does value go?Your products and services inherently create a certain amount of value for your customers. We'll call this the ""actual value."" In the ideal world, everything you sell would be priced based on the actual value. However, we don't live in the ideal world. Actual value is monstrously difficult to calculate and can fluctuate per customer.Not all of your customers will be able to see, or frankly even benefit from, the total potential of any given product. Smartwatches, for example, can track hundreds of unique exercises, but if all you do is run, then the value of those additional features would be difficult to see. Marketing has an impact as well. Sticking with the smartwatch example, if you fail to effectively communicate a useful feature — leaving your potential customers unaware — then that can have a negative impact on this ""perceived value.""


Now, your customers may agree that your product produces a certain amount of value for them, but that doesn't mean they're willing to pay for it. Dozens of factors can impact how much a particular customer is willing to pay: urgency, income, brand loyalty, advertising, social impact, etc. Finding this number is tricky, yet highly rewarding. If you can identify the maximum amount your customers are willing to pay, you can maximize your profits while capturing as much value as possible.Many companies are unable to determine exactly how much their customers are willing to pay. What that means is that the price your customers typically expect to pay is instead the ""target price."" This is the value that you and your team hopefully determined is as close to the actual willingness-to-pay value as possible.Finally, if you work in a sales-heavy field you may find additional value being lost to concessions and discounts. In this situation, the final price paid would be known as the ""realized price."" How much value was lost between all of these steps? Many think quite a bit. Bain and Company found after interviewing dozens of CEOs, CMOs and other executives at more than 1,700 companies that roughly 85% of those who responded believed they could be doing a better job making pricing decisions.How can I capture more value?Let's begin by trying to understand how much our customers are actually willing to pay for our products or services. We can do this by surveying our customers, assembling focus groups, experimenting with pricing or even hosting an auction.


If we're not happy with how much our customers are willing to pay, we may need to take a step back and instead focus on their perceived value of your product or service. When we help our customers see more value through activities like branding, outreach and communication we directly increase how much they're willing to pay.Alternatively, we can choose to adopt a different pricing structure entirely. More and more service-based businesses are looking towards metric-based pricing to offer an adaptive structure that better aligns with the perceived value of each unique customer. Some examples of metric-based pricing are usage-based like gym punch passes and cellular minutes, or user-based pricing, which is a popular choice in the SaaS realm. There are great examples of metric-based pricing all around us. Mechanics often charge per hour while bowling alleys frequently charge per game. These metrics work because they're reasonable, predictable and fair.Related: How to Get the Price Your Product or Service DeservesDon't miss out on potential profitLet's look at the math together. Imagine with me for a moment that you own a coffee shop selling lattes for $5 each. These lattes cost you $1 to make, earning you $4 in profit. If you sold 100 lattes, unsurprisingly you would make $400 in profit.


However, unbeknownst to you, your customers are willing to pay $7 for that same latte. That's a more generous $6 in profit, netting you an additional $200 per 100 lattes sold — a 150% increase. In fact, even if you wound up selling fewer lattes — let's say 90 instead of 100, that's still a 135% increase in profits.In short, don't leave any money lying on the table. If your customers are willing to pay more, now is the time to find out.

It became a hub for many college students for studying, creating art, showcasing their talent at open mic night, and meeting new people, especially creatives.""Be'Anka and Jeronica's team laid the foundation for the shop's accessible and inviting feel. Their friendly staff is eager to answer questions and make an effort to ""table tap,"" walking up to every customer to ask how they're doing and offer them water. ""We just try to put in little joyful moments, so [people] have great coffee and a great experience at the same time,"" Be'Anka said.


The owners acknowledge that their departure from the coffee shop's traditional head-down work environment can lead to misunderstanding and sometimes critical feedback. They've had to learn how to respond when critiques come from someone who might not be in their target audience.""Change is hard, right?"" Be'Anka asked. ""So sometimes, it's almost like a culture shock. We've had reviews where people say, 'This is not what a coffee shop is supposed to be.' And we're like, 'Okay, I hear you, but maybe it's just different than what you're used to and we can be a little more open-minded.'""Related: The Owners of This Texas Farmers Market Took a Big Gamble. Here's How It Paid Off Bigger Than They Dreamed.Reviews like these can actually be a useful way to set expectations for future customers about the shop experience. By clearly communicating how your business operates, future patrons will have a better sense of what to expect and can decide if it's a right fit for their needs. In her time running Nirvana Soul, Be'Anka has learned the value of all feedback, both positive and critical, in helping her optimize the customer experience.


Be'Anka also stressed the importance of sharing your feedback in the moment. While Camy loves the environment and food at Nirvana Soul, she mentioned in her 4-star review that the sweet flavors in her drink were overpowering. Critiques like these are easy fixes that Nirvana Soul's baristas are happy to accommodate in the moment.""We'd so much rather [hear in person] than read about it later because now you're out there in the world with a drink that you hate. We could have gotten you something better, and you're already gone,"" Be'Anka said.As a consumer, Camy feels a responsibility to provide thoughtful feedback, always striving to help businesses improve.""I think people get a bit into the realm of people-pleasing,"" she said. ""You want to make people feel good, but you're also sacrificing your own needs as a consumer by not letting a business know if something could be changed. We're in an era of improvement, of growth, and I think it's important to critique every now and again.""


As a business, in addition to being responsive to feedback, creating touchpoints with your customers on social media is an important way to make them feel like a valued part of your community. As Be'Anka builds up Nirvana Soul's social media presence, she makes an effort to reshare posts from customers whenever she can. These expressions of appreciation go a long way with regulars like Camy.Related: This Mom and Pop Ice Cream Shop's Success Comes Down to This Simple Phrase""I think it's really beautiful to exchange that back-and-forth with a business,"" Camy said. ""I come here frequently. You recognize that, you appreciate me as your customer, and I'm dedicated to your business.""Be'Anka also emphasizes the importance of being consistent and active on social media. If you find social media intimidating, start small. It's better to post one simple photo every day than to let the need for a ""perfect"" feed hold you back from posting.


""I just snap pictures of anything. It doesn't matter what it is. It could be a drink, it could be artwork, it could be a scene in the shop. You don't have to say much. You can describe what's in the photo. You can say 'good morning.' It doesn't even matter because tomorrow's another day and you should probably just post the next picture.""Above all, Nirvana Soul is a space for community, a key part of which is representation. During their six years in business, Be'Anka and Jeronica have featured the work of over 65 artists, including female artists and artists of color, with the intention of creating a space where diverse voices are seen and uplifted.While the shop celebrates its role as one of a handful of Black- and woman-owned businesses in San Jose, Be'Anka recognizes that the quality of the Nirvana Soul experience is what shines through to customers at the end of the day.""We know there's going to be people who find us because we're Black-owned,"" Be'Anka said. ""We also know that it's not going to be a one-and-done with them because they're going to come in, love the experience so much, and know that this is a Black-created experience. And then they'll come back and bring more people—because after a certain point, it's just awesome coffee and a great experience.""


In addition to staying true to your mission and vision, Nirvana Soul believes in:Engaging customers during their visit to your business.

With people spending so much time on social media and the internet, consumers see more brands than ever, which means they also have a more finely tuned awareness of aesthetics and brand idententies. In a 2023 survey, market research firm Hanover found that 75% percent of companies have overhauled their visual identities since 2020, and Lucidpress found that 45% of customers ""expect great design across marketing and sales collateral."" In other words, an outdated aesethetic costs you money. At the same time, no company can afford to revamp their design every few years, so it's important to find a look that stands out, and stands the test of time. Here, we talked to six brands on how they found a look that sparkles while conveying their core values.Image Credit: Courtesy of Methodology

84,The Era of Faceless Branding Is Over — Here's Why Modern Brands Fail and Publicity Reigns Supreme in 2024,"Mar 7, 2024",Erica McMillan,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-faceless-brands-fail-and-publicity-reigns-supreme-in/470333,"
In the dynamic landscape of 2024, where brand differentiation is more vital than ever, a stark truth shines through: the era of faceless brands is fading. A brand can no longer hide behind its company logo and expect to thrive.In a world where clients and partners demand transparency and connection, being the face of the brand is paramount. This imperative finds its expression in CEOs, entrepreneurs, and founders stepping into the spotlight as thought leaders, amplifying the brand's essence and values.Related: 90% of Online Businesses Fail in Just 4 Months. You Can Avoid the Same Fate By Using These Strategies.



Turning leaders into thought-leadersIn a crowded landscape where brands compete for attention, it's not enough to merely offer a product or service. Clients and partners want more — they want to know the people behind the brand. They want a name, a face, a person they can trust. CEOs, entrepreneurs, and founders are uniquely positioned to fulfill this need. Their insights, experiences, and expertise breathe life into their brands, transforming them from impersonal entities to relatable entities.Imagine a CEO who writes an article on the future of artificial intelligence in healthcare. This piece becomes a beacon of insight, published in a prestigious outlet. This effect ripples through two dimensions: the brand emerges as an innovator, and the CEO ascends as an industry authority, a thought leader. This level of publicity instantly sets them apart, painting the business as a guiding light in the field.


Related: What Exactly Is Thought Leadership?The influence of media exposureThe days of concealing oneself behind a corporate website are over. In 2024, consumers will be savvy and discerning. They demand authenticity, transparency, and a personal connection with the brands they engage with. The notion that a brand can remain faceless while thriving in this atmosphere has become obsolete.In a world saturated with information, sifting through the noise to find credible sources is a challenge. This is where top-tier media outlets step in as the gatekeepers of credibility. When a CEO, entrepreneur, or founder is featured in such outlets, their words gain an instant aura of authority. The public perception shifts from seeing them as mere business leaders to recognizing them as trusted voices in the industry.Related: 3 Step Process to Get Exposure and Press Coverage for Your Business


Rise above the competition by showcasing expertiseIn an era of information overload, consumers are on a quest for genuine expertise. They are bombarded with choices and are discerning in their selections. This is where thought leadership shines. When a CEO or founder appears on top-tier media outlets, they're instantly separated from the crowd. Their insights are no longer confined to their website or a blog; they're showcased on platforms that command respect and readership.Imagine a founder of an investment portfolio consultation firm interviewed for a feature on Nasdaq to share his insights on navigating wealth strategies. This isn't merely an article; it's a roadmap rooted in experience, shaping the path ahead. By sharing their wisdom in a respected forum, they assume the role of a guide, steering clients and partners toward success. This differentiation isn't just about being seen — it's about being seen as a cut above the rest.Establish authenticityTrust forms the bedrock of fruitful brand-consumer relationships. CEOs, entrepreneurs, and founders stepping into thought leadership roles construct this foundation with every article, interview, or podcast appearance. The insights they share, the challenges they've overcome, and the successes they've achieved contribute to a narrative of authenticity and relatability.Picture a CEO sharing their journey from startup to industry disruptor in a feature on a publication like Entrepreneur Magazine. This transparency not only showcases their accomplishments but also the hurdles they've faced. By sharing both triumphs and tribulations, they're inviting the audience to connect on a human level. This builds trust — a trust that becomes synonymous with the business they lead


Now imagine a founder who shares their personal journey of triumphs and challenges in building a sustainable fashion brand through a feature in Vogue. This isn't merely a business story — it's a tale of perseverance, vision and values. The founder becomes a living testament to the brand's essence, breathing authenticity into its identity. Clients and partners seeking more than just products are drawn to this narrative, forging a bond that transcends transaction.Related: 5 Considerations When Seeking a Celebrity to Endorse Your BrandA roadmap to trustThe pathway to differentiation through publicity and thought leadership isn't a one-time sprint; it's a continuous voyage. As CEOs, entrepreneurs, and founders amplify their insights and experiences, they cement their positions as industry trailblazers. This journey isn't a quest for celebrity status — it's a quest to become a source of expertise, counsel and trust.In a time when consumers wish to engage with individuals they recognize, believe in, and trust, the potential of personal branding cannot be overstated. It isn't confined to logos or catchphrases—it's a reputation, a legacy, a commitment. As we navigate the complexities of branding, let's acknowledge that embracing publicity and thought leadership isn't just about differentiation—it's about paving the way toward lasting trust, credibility, and success.


The power of publicityThe shift from faceless brands to embodied leadership is here to stay. Clients, partners, and consumers seek services, products, and relationships. They desire a story and a reason to believe.In a world where trust is currency, the power of publicity is immeasurable. Differentiation through publicity isn't just about standing out; it's about standing tall—head and shoulders above the competition.

86,This Revenue Hack Can Increase Your Small Business Earnings by up to 30%,"Mar 7, 2024",Adam Povlitz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/expand-your-small-business-income-by-investing-in-this/470329,"
We all know that the rise of the digital age has revolutionized organizations' operations, enabling them to explore new income avenues with minimal investment. This has never been truer for small businesses. For this group, embracing e-commerce platforms and online marketplaces can catapult them into new opportunities. The average revenue increase by investing in marketing for a small business can vary significantly depending on various factors such as the industry, target market, marketing strategies employed, and the effectiveness of the campaigns. However, businesses that invest in strong marketing efforts typically experience an average revenue growth of 30% — some significantly more.Investing more time and resources toward their online presence allows even the smallest businesses to tap into global customer bases that were once out of reach, boosting their revenue potential and keeping operations manageable. One size does not fit all, and strategies depend on your business industry. Here are some to consider.Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now to find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.Service bundlesDeveloping service bundles or packages can be a winning strategy to expand revenue without overextending operations. By combining existing core services with compatible offerings, businesses can provide added value to customers while increasing their revenue streams.



For example, a graphic design agency could bundle branding, website development, and social media management services, offering clients a comprehensive marketing package. This approach attracts new customers and promotes customer loyalty, as clients recognize the convenience and cost-effectiveness of bundled services.Subscription models and strategic partnershipsSubscription-based business models have become more prevalent in recent years, offering steady revenue streams and fostering customer loyalty (think Netflix and Amazon Prime). Small businesses can creatively implement subscription models tailored to their industry to secure recurring income.For instance, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company can offer tiered subscriptions with varying features and benefits, enticing customers to upgrade for additional services. By continually providing added value, brands can maintain a loyal customer base while expanding their revenue opportunities.


Collaborating with strategic partners can be a game-changer for small businesses seeking new revenue streams. By joining forces with like-minded organizations, they can leverage each other's resources, expertise, and customer bases. Partnerships offer a variety of collaborative opportunities, such as co-marketing initiatives, cross-selling promotions, and joint ventures, making them a popular alternative to outright selling (or merging) a business.Related: Want to Become a Franchisee? Run Through This Checklist First.Licensing and franchisingLicensing or franchising can be a viable option to expand revenue streams without spreading operations too thin. This approach allows businesses to generate additional income by granting others the rights to operate under their established brand and proven systems.Franchising provides a low-risk path to expansion, as the franchisees manage their financial and operational responsibilities. This strategy has proven successful in many different industries, from fast food to fitness studios to commercial cleaning.Tailoring strategies to address challengesWhile the principles of forging new revenue streams apply to businesses of all sizes, small businesses, in particular, often face unique challenges. Limited resources, tight budgets, and a smaller market segment necessitate careful planning and creative thinking.These businesses should focus on niche markets, identifying specific unmet customer needs to carve out a competitive edge and attract a loyal customer base.Related: Is Franchising Right For You? Ask Yourself These 9 Questions to Find Out.Five revenue-boosting examples for common business concepts:Consultation Services: A professional services firm, such as a law or accounting firm, can branch out by offering specialized consultation services in niche areas. For instance, a law firm specializing in intellectual property could provide consultation services for startups looking to protect their patents and copyrights.Rental Services: A small retailer can leverage underutilized inventory by offering rental services. For example, a high-end fashion boutique can rent designer dresses for special occasions, creating an additional revenue stream while maximizing the value of their inventory.Customization and Personalization: A small manufacturing company can differentiate itself by offering customized or personalized products. This could include engraving, monogramming, or customizable features that cater to individual customer preferences, allowing them to charge a premium price for customized offerings.Membership Programs: A fitness center or gym can introduce tiered membership programs that offer additional benefits to members. This can include exclusive access to specialized classes, personal training sessions, or discounted rates for affiliated services, generating recurring revenue through membership fees.Value-added Services: A small restaurant can expand its revenue by offering catering services for events and parties. Additionally, they can explore partnering with local businesses to offer bundled services like catering and venue rental, providing a seamless experience for customers and generating additional income streams.Developing additional revenue streams is a key strategy for businesses aiming for sustained growth and relevance in an evolving marketplace. Organizations can unlock new income sources by adopting digital platforms, creating service bundles, implementing subscription models, forming strategic partnerships, or exploring licensing opportunities.For small businesses, it's crucial to prioritize scalability and customer-centric strategies to maintain operational efficiency while pursuing revenue diversification. By pursuing innovative approaches, they can forge new revenue streams and position themselves for long-term success.

87,Big Businesses Take Forever to Pay Their Small Suppliers. These Founders Did Something About It: 'Nobody Had Seen Anything Like This',"Mar 6, 2024",Frances Dodds,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/these-founders-help-small-suppliers-get-paid-quicker-from/470341,"
It should have been a celebratory lunch — the kind where you order french fries and cheesecake, then go home to nap and don't even feel bad about it.Instead, Stacey Abrams and Lara Hodgson were sitting in an Atlanta restaurant, dazed with disappointment, talking in circles, returning again and again to the same confounding question: How did we not know this?It was 2010, and three years earlier, the women had cofounded a company called Nourish, which made grab-and-go baby bottles filled with premeasured, purified water for easy formula mixing. The company had been finding its legs, one wobbly step at a time. Then, Whole Foods placed a huge order of their product.



""It was, like, orders of magnitude bigger than anything we'd done before,"" Hodgson says. They were ecstatic. This is what they should've been celebrating. But then they read the payment terms. ""We discovered that we weren't going to get paid for three to four months. I mean, no small business can handle that.""The women had run headlong into an unspoken rule: the bigger the buyer, the longer they take to pay. And it didn't even matter what the official payment schedule was. ""If your invoice says net 30 or net 60 or net 90 — that's just a suggestion,"" Hodgson says. ""We know now that the average net 30 invoice pays in 54 days. But back then, when we realized all this, I just remember thinking, like, Was I sick one day in business school? Why does no one talk about this?""Related: 10 Small Business Marketing Strategies That Actually WorkThey had more questions, too. Why was this the status quo? Why did no one seem to think it was a big deal? And why — in a country that calls small businesses the backbone of the economy — had no one bothered to create a better solution?Suddenly, they couldn't stop talking about it. They talked with each other, and then with other small business owners, and then with academics and investors. And eventually, they decided to do something about it.Later that year, the duo cofounded NowAccount, a novel business-to-business financing solution that lets small business owners get paid for invoices right away, with low, flat-rate fees, while building up their credit and outsourcing the time-consuming task of tracking down payments. Since its inception in 2010, Now has fast-tracked almost $1 billion in payments for nearly 1,000 businesses, and in the past two years, more than doubled in growth.But getting to this point took a long time: years of asking, and listening, and explaining, and insisting that something could and should be done.""We had to convince people we could solve the problem,"" Abrams says, ""because it sounded like magic.""


Hodgson and Abrams met at a leadership program in Atlanta — but they might not have connected so fast if Abrams hadn't fessed up to her audacious ambition.It was 2004, and they were both enrolled in a tough session: The facilitator had researched attendees ahead of time, and made it his mission to target their insecurities, in order to prompt deeper conversation about biases. Hodgson is an extrovert who loves to talk — so the facilitator didn't let her do that. ""At the end of the weekend, he told me he needed me to know what it felt like to have no voice,"" she says. ""I did not like that.""Abrams is an introvert, so the facilitator treated her the opposite way — constantly pressing her to speak. Eventually, he asked Abrams a direct question: ""What is one great ambition you've never wanted to say out loud?"" She paused, then said she wanted to be president of the United States. Across the room, Hodgson remembers thinking, I always said that as a little girl, and girls don't say that out loud! When they broke for lunch, Hodgson made a beeline for Abrams in the buffet line.Related: 9 Tips To Grow Your Small Business With Social Media MarketingThe women were assigned to the same study group. ""We found that while we had different approaches to problems,"" Abrams says, ""we almost always aligned on solutions."" They became friends, and a couple of years later, founded a consulting company together, making use of Hodgson's business connections and Abrams' knowledge of local tax law. Then they founded Nourish. And that brought them to that bleak lunch in 2010, agonizing over how to get the money for their Whole Foods order. They were searching, once again, for an answer.They'd scrambled to find conventional bridge-funding solutions — a bank loan or invoice factoring — but found the first inaccessible, and the second predatory. Bank loans are hard to get for small business owners without solid credit, or for anyone who doesn't feel comfortable with personal guarantees. Recourse-factoring companies, which buy invoices from small companies, charge variable fees, along with additional accruing fees for late payments (which the small businesses can't predict or control), and often use invasive tactics like collecting money from the business's bank account on a daily or weekly basis. Plus, if a payment falls through, the small business is on the hook for the full payment plus late fees, which leaves a liability on its balance sheet for months.The best option Hodgson and Abrams had found — ""a creative factoring agreement from a community bank"" — also came with personal guarantees. This was uncomfortable for both women. Hodgson had a new baby and worried about losing her house because of the loan, and Abrams had a mortgage and a lot of student debt. Plus, she was financially responsible for her parents and niece.To both women, this situation just felt wrong. They knew they couldn't be the first entrepreneurs to find themselves suddenly ""growing out of business.""""When you encounter a massive problem that's been around forever,"" Abrams says, ""you tend to think, I can't possibly be the first one to see it. So you assume what's happening is your fault, or that the problem would have been solved if it could have been. And you usually stop there. But instead of critiquing ourselves, Lara and I decided to ask: OK, but why hasn't it happened?""


Image Credit: Nicolás OrtegaWhen Abrams and Hodgson began talking about solutions, the first thing they thought of was simple: What if Whole Foods could pay them with a credit card? In this case, Nourish, the seller, would be charged the flat 3.5% transaction fee, and get paid right away. Then Whole Foods, the buyer, would pay down the balance on their own time with interest.But therein lies the dilemma: Whole Foods doesn't want to pay its suppliers right away — and certainly doesn't want to pay interest. And because it's a giant company, it doesn't have to. That's the way the capitalist cookie crumbles. Bigger companies set payment terms, and the smaller companies accept them — until they prove critical enough to negotiate.But what if Hodgson and Abrams created something for small businesses that was like being paid with a credit card?This is the idea that eventually became NowAccount: Small businesses would apply to be Now's clients, and pay an annual membership fee of $750. When clients received an invoice from a new buyer, Now would assess the buyer's risk, and if they approved, the client could start uploading invoices. Now would vet each invoice, then pay the client the full amount almost immediately, minus a flat fee based on the payment terms (ranging incrementally from 3% for a net 15 invoice, to 8% for a net 120 invoice). And Now would be reimbursed when the payment is made.Related: 5 Things Not to Do When You're Running a Small BusinessThis would shrink the payment schedule from a few months to just a few days. In the case of Nourish and Whole Foods, it would have looked something like this: If Whole Foods placed an order of, say, $50,000 worth of goods from Nourish, with 90-day payment terms, Nourish would take that invoice to NowAccount, who would confirm its validity with Whole Foods, and then pay Nourish $50,000 right away (minus the 7% fee for a net 90 invoice). Then Now would be reimbursed in, say, 117 days, or whenever Whole Foods actually paid.For a small business owner, the advantages of this setup are numerous: No added interest for late payments you can't control, no liability on your balance sheet, no unforgiving credit checks or invasive debt collection strategies, and no personal guarantees. Unlike factoring companies, which hold you responsible if a payment falls through, NowAccount absorbs the risk of every invoice it accepts. In this way, Now acts as a kind of insurance for their clients.Hodgson and Abrams knew their concept was groundbreaking.Unfortunately, at first, the people they needed to join them were not convinced. Part of the problem was that the concept didn't lend itself to pithy, 30-second elevator pitches. ""It's complicated to explain,"" Hodgson says. ""And because nobody had seen anything like this, when they heard 'get paid fast,' their brains immediately went to, 'Is it a loan? Is it a payday loan? Is it factoring?'""From the finance side, there was also some confusion about why this was even a problem. What's stopping any small business owner from going down to their local bank to get a loan at a lower annual interest rate, or negotiating better terms with their factoring company or buyer?


What financial institutions often overlook are the countless variable barriers for small business owners. Many are becoming entrepreneurs for the first time, figuring it out as they go, without a lot of financial education or resources.Patricia Wilson is a NowAccount client who worked in technology for 20 years before deciding to start her own consulting business, Online Media Interactive. When she started out, she says, ""Honestly, going after a bank loan didn't even occur to me. I was still trying to feel out what I wanted to do from a business perspective. And with traditional factoring companies, I was very intimidated by the aggressive nature of how they collect the money. I just wanted a way to have consistent income coming in.""Another Now client, Mike Riordan, is the founder of Freeze Sleeve, a cold/hot compression therapy he developed for his daughter, a pre-Olympic gymnast. Riordan had previously run a struggling construction company that tanked his credit, so he couldn't get a bank loan for Freeze Sleeve. And he was put off by the ""loan-shark mentality"" of factoring companies.""I think there's a kind of business amnesia that occurs in the financial sector,"" Abrams says. ""The people making these decisions forgot what it was like to be a small business owner."" Moreover, Hodgson thinks there's a misconception in the finance world that you can take funding solutions for large companies and ""miniaturize"" them. ""I tell people, 'Small businesses are not miniature large businesses. You can't just, like, shrink a solution,'"" she says. ""Think about it: If I'm a small business selling to, say, Walmart, and they're demanding net 90, that means they might actually pay in 120 days. So I'm essentially Walmart's free bank for 90-plus days. My cost of capital is way higher than Walmart's, so efficient economic theory suggests the best solution for Walmart is to borrow money really cheaply, pay me faster, and get a discount. But anyone who's tried that knows a large company will just take the discount and still pay you late.""Related: This Is the Unseen Advantage Your Small Business Might NeedIn fact, Hodgson tried this kind of dynamic discounting with one large retailer when they were running Nourish. She'd offer, say, a 2% discount on a net 30 invoice if they paid her in 10 days. But in the end, she says, the retailer just took the discount and still paid her late.""What am I going to do, sue them?"" she says. ""My legal bill would be way more than the 2%, so it's not worth it. I could threaten not to sell to them again, and they'd be like, 'OK, move over! There's a line of people who would gladly take your shelf space.' When you have an imbalance in power, efficient economic theory just doesn't work.""Dr. Richard Bliss, a professor of finance at Babson College and the national academic director for Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses, confirms this. ""It's the classic 'because they can,'"" he says. ""There's a huge power dynamic, and big companies just take advantage. I often hear stories from small business owners who are so excited they got this big contract, but they lose sight of the fact that they still have to make this positive from a financial standpoint. A lot of them don't have the rudimentary forecasting tools to plug in their new contract, look four months down the road to say, 'Holy smokes, we're gonna run out of money.' By the time they realize the predicament they're in, there are very few options.""Slowly but surely, investors began to hear Hodgson and Abrams' message. First came credit unions, then equity investors, and finally Goldman Sachs. Taking different types of funding presented some tension, Hodgson says, but she thinks it made the business more sustainable. ""Equity investors usually prioritize growth more than profitability, whereas lenders want you to be focused on profitability. So at times, I was like, Oh my gosh, I can't make everybody happy! But in hindsight, I think it forced a kind of discipline.""The thing about discipline is that it doesn't exactly lend itself to meteoric change. It's an act of faith that, eventually, the baby steps will get you somewhere.


""You know when your shoelaces are tied together, and you can't take a step that's longer than the shoelace or you fall on your face?"" Hodgson asks. ""That's the image that comes to mind about starting and scaling NowAccount. We had to go get capital and then get some customers, then we needed more capital and then more customers. And if I tried to do either of those too big, I'd fall on my face. So we just sort of trudged along, little by little.""NowAccount's investors were pulling on one shoelace, and clients were tugging on the other. Small business owners didn't need convincing that there was a problem. But they did need some convincing that these two nice Southern ladies weren't selling them some fanciful money ""magic,"" as Abrams says, ""or worse!""Related: Here's the Secret to Growing Your Small Business, According to Execs at UPS, Airbnb, Mastercard, and Other Big Brands""The first question we'd get from small business owners is, 'Why would you give us this money?'"" Abrams says. ""They were trying to understand: 'If this other financial institution wants to charge me 30% on my entire inventory, or this one wants my DNA swab, or to mortgage my house, why would I trust you?' Entrepreneurs are trained to believe no one is coming to help them, so we were trying to convince people we could untie their shoelaces when they'd gotten used to walking that way"" — restrained, cautious, and slower than they should have to.But once NowAccount started delivering on its promises, they started getting more applications than they could accept. This was partly because they needed more funding, and partly because they needed to mitigate risk. ""We wanted to serve more businesses, because that's why we existed,"" Hodgson says. ""But if we went too far, someone's going to take the dollar and run. So in the early days, it was a lot of learning, like, what are the signs? And analyzing data to tell us if certain industries or company profiles are more prone to risk.""Now learned to spot certain ""behavioral indicators."" For example, if someone has a Gmail account instead of a business email, it's worth a closer look. Maybe it's a fly-by-night operation, or maybe it's a new business that just hasn't set up its website yet. But with each invoice Now processed, its system became more informed. ""Every data point we have about a customer and who their buyer is, and when they pay, that just makes the system incrementally smarter,"" Hodgson says. ""So mistakes happen less and less as we grow.""And this practice of mitigating risk isn't just for Now's benefit. It's also become a crucial service for clients.Riordan, the founder of Freeze Sleeve, says the buyer-vetting that NowAccount does is invaluable. In addition to being able to sell to big companies that are ""horribly slow"" at paying, Riordan says, ""We also use NowAccount almost like our credit check people. Every time somebody wants to come on board, I send them over to Now, and they do their due diligence on the company. One time we had a cryotherapy business that wanted to go national with our products, and they gave us a very substantial order. But Now wouldn't approve them. We were frustrated because it was a big order, so we ended up doing it on our own. Well, guess what? That company went out of business and left us with a big hole.""Meeting with team members Archie Jones and John Hayes in 2015, in an antiques shop next to their office.Image Credit: Courtesy of Stacey AbramsNow was always intended to serve small businesses. But a few years in, something surprising happened. ""We got a call from Coca-Cola's chief procurement officer,"" Hodgson says, ""who was like, 'This seems to be a huge benefit to suppliers. Maybe we could partner to make sure more of them know about it.'""


Coca-Cola had been trying to diversify its supply chain to include more women and people of color, but its payment terms made it impossible for many of these businesses to work with them. ""They're going to take 90 days to pay, and if that's going to kill you, they can't give you the contract,"" Hodgson says.But with Now, Coca-Cola saw an opportunity: If there was a small business they wanted to buy from, but the supplier couldn't afford their payment terms, they'd send them to NowAccount. That way, the small business didn't have to worry about how long it would take to get paid, and Coca-Cola would know they had the capital to deliver. It was a win-win for everyone.Not long after, the city of Atlanta began a push to boost the local economy by connecting Atlanta-based corporations with local small business suppliers. Now was perfectly positioned to partner with the city to make these connections.Then, in 2020, the George Floyd protests happened, and corporations across the country started making public pledges to spend more with minority-owned businesses. At that point, Now realized it was sitting on a goldmine of data.Sure, there are plenty of business databases out there — but only Now has years' worth of invoice data, giving them visibility into which suppliers can deliver at what level.Related: 7 Strategies to Scale Your Small Business and Achieve Sustainable Growth""If you're a procurement person, and you've bought a database of businesses, and you're looking for one with a Latina founder, there are probably hundreds of them,"" Hodgson says. ""How do you pick? And most importantly, how do you know which of those hundreds can do a million-dollar contract versus a $5,000 contract? Because that matters. If I give you a contract that's too big and you don't have the staff to deliver, neither of us win.""What if they created a curated platform that helped big businesses find diverse suppliers capable of meeting their needs? It would be free for the small businesses to join, while the big businesses paid a membership fee. And that's how the next Now product — NowNetwork — was born.When Hodgson and Abrams talk about Now, people often ask: Why is it like this? Why don't these big businesses just pay their suppliers faster?Hodgson likes to tell a story about a conversation she once had with a Fortune 500 CFO. They were talking about NowAccount, and the CFO said, ""You know, this is fascinating, but I could probably just pay my suppliers immediately for cheaper than you can.""


""Well for sure you could,"" Hodgson replied. ""You're a Fortune 500 company and we're a startup. But you won't.""The CFO paused for a moment. ""You're right,"" she said. ""I won't because if I turn around and paid all my suppliers immediately, Wall Street would take me down.""What Hodgson and the CFO were acknowledging is how common it is for corporations to beef up their capital stacks by leaning on ""accounts payable"" — the money owed to suppliers but not yet paid.""Take any public company and look at their financials,"" Hodgson says, ""If you look at their short-term debt, like what they're borrowing from the bank, compared to their accounts payable — what they owe suppliers — their accounts payable are almost always two to three times what they owe the bank. Because there's a smart CFO who knows he can delay payments for free versus borrowing money at some cost greater than zero. If you yanked that away, they'd have to turn to more expensive capital, their net earnings would drop, and Wall Street would kill them.""This notion — that it's common for corporations to deliberately delay payments — is provocative. But each year, the consultancy firm The Hackett Group does an annual analysis of something called Days Payable Outstanding, or DPO. It's an accounting measure that calculates the number of days it takes for a company to pay suppliers. And it sheds light on the pattern.Of the top 1,000 publicly traded U.S. companies, for the decade running up to 2021 (when payment terms started to shorten due to pandemic supply chain pressures), ""DPO was consistently increasing — around 5% year after year — which is significant,"" says Shawn Townsend, a director in Hackett's finance transformation practice. ""On a compounding level, that adds up to a 32% increase [in how long suppliers are waiting to get paid]. And you would assume the same trends are happening to an even greater extent to smaller companies, because it's about leverage.""Townsend says DPO can't distinguish between long payment terms and late payments. But when asked if it's common for corporations to deliberately delay payments, he says, diplomatically, ""It does happen. We hear some companies saying, 'This month, we told the accounts payable people, pay a certain group of suppliers, don't pay the others.' The most critical suppliers are always the first to get paid. And then the other ones, you know, they just stop the payments until the following month. It's very anecdotal, obviously, because nobody's going to admit that.""But Now's data is not anecdotal. They have unprecedented visibility into exactly when the biggest companies in the U.S. say they'll pay, and when they actually do.Related: 5 SEO Tips to Grow Your Small Business""We know what the normal behavior is for certain companies and certain industries,"" Hodgson says. ""I was talking to someone at a major bank and they said, 'Well, we typically pay in X days.' And I said, 'No you don't.' They said, 'Well, that's our policy.' And I said, 'But that's not what you do! I know because I've been watching you pay invoices for over a year.'""


More recently, the Now team has been asking what they can do with all this information. ""Could we partner with someone like Hackett, or start doing our own reports?"" Hodgson wonders. ""This data could be incredibly interesting to investors, because if you're investing in a company, and they are continuously paying very late, there may be a weakness in its business model. Or if you're a small business who wants to sell to the airline industry, and they're saying they pay in 45 days but they really mean 60, that could be the difference between making a payroll and not. It won't change reality, but you can plan for reality. And that's what got Stacey and I into all of this trouble in the first place.""Image Credit: Nicolás OrtegaA lot has happened since that fateful lunch in 2010. Abrams kept working at NowAccount during her tenure in the Georgia House of Representatives, but left the company in 2016 to pursue those two runs for governor. (Or as she says, ""I had this other job I was interested in applying for, but my application was rejected."") After that, she and Hodgson decided that NowAccount and NowNetwork should be separate companies, which act as partners with service agreements. Hodgson will run NowAccount, and Abrams will run NowNetwork.Unlike Hodgson, who's had a long career in business, Abrams admits she never really wanted to be an entrepreneur. ""I liked paychecks,"" she says. ""It was a frightening idea to be solely reliant on my own efforts.""The thing that changed her mind, though, was meeting Hodgson.""We often believe we have to be the leaders,"" she says, ""but having a partner challenges you. It helps you grow, sharpens your mind, gives you a different perspective. Lara and I have always been curious about what the other person knows.""Curiosity, more than anything, is what brought the friends to this place. And it's what will guide them toward whatever's next. ""Curiosity is about more than simply seeking information,"" says Abrams. ""We want to know: Are we asking the right things?""Related: 7 Networking Groups Every Small Business Owner Should Be Involved In

89,How This California Hot Spot Grew From Delivery-Only to Pop-Up Shop to Storefront,"Mar 1, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-miguels-artisan-recipes-grew-from-pop-up-shop-to/470493,"
Everyone always has a seat at the Segura family's dinner table. Miguel and Lisa Segura, owners of Miguel's Artisan Recipes in Clovis, California, have been making homemade Mexican recipes for their friends and neighbors for decades.But when the pandemic hit and both were furloughed from their jobs, they turned their passion into a business. Lisa created a label, and using Miguel's mother's recipes, they began delivering fresh meals to friends and family by car.When word spread, the Seguras were invited to serve their homestyle cuisine at pop-up events with Fresno Street Eats, a food truck and festival venue. The company's owner helped them get set up with a certified kitchen and pop-up tent. The next year, the tent turned into a food truck, which finally gave way to a storefront. In the corner of a neighborhood convenience store, the owners cook meals for catered events and sell their famous dishes and jarred salsas.



Fresh recipes and a tight-knit customer community earned the restaurant the #1 spot on Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat in the Central Valley - North list in 2023. This is how Nathen M., senior community director at Yelp and Elite reviewer, discovered—and came to adore—the Seguras' business.""Their food and jarred salsas are just fantastic and consistently delicious,"" his review reads. ""Their tacos are to die for, but recently I tried their tamales, and it's the perfect ratio of masa to tender pork. My Mexican mother-in-law, who is very, very picky with her tamales, gave these a double thumbs up.""


The restaurant's authenticity is a huge reason why Lisa and Miguel have seen exploding success. Taking advantage of the agricultural community in the Central Valley, they source fresh ingredients every week to honor their family's original recipes, which resonate with nostalgic customers.""Some people actually [say], 'You just took me back 20 years.' That's the biggest compliment in the world to me because you're having my mother's food,"" Miguel said.Though many of Lisa and Miguel's recipes have been in the family for generations, a key component of their success is their flexibility in the kitchen. Starting out with a short menu of staples, the owners have thoughtfully built out their offerings over the last few years as they've received customer feedback. With a background in sales, Miguel understands the importance of really listening to his customers.""I have cooks and chefs that are already in my kitchen now,"" he said. ""All we have to do is find out what food you like.""


""We have high expectations for ourselves, and we want other people to have good experiences when they're eating the food,"" Lisa added. ""So how can I be better? Continuously improving is part of our culture.""Not only are Miguel and Lisa receptive to feedback but they are proactive about making customer connections, eager to share their food with as many people as they can. In and out of their store, the Seguras always ask regulars how they're doing and invite new customers in to sample their salsas.One of the biggest ways they reach customers is through appearances on local TV channel Fox 26, where they visit the Great Day Kitchen and put on cooking demonstrations of their signature dishes. Beyond the screen, Miguel and Lisa are involved with several community projects, speaking at conferences and with nonprofits about their path to entrepreneurial success.""It's not just about us making food, it's about making a difference, giving to other people,"" Lisa said. ""We are all growing together. I feel so blessed to be giving part of myself, our cooking, and our family legacy to the community. I think that Miguel's mom would have said it best: 'Bring everybody to the house. Let them eat.'""


Miguel and Lisa's friendly customer service and community integration is what struck Nathen most about their business.""It's a lot of work to be out and about all the time and running a business, and they do it with grace,"" Nathen said. ""Every time I've met them in person, there's never a look of 'How do we do this?' It's just, 'How are you doing? We're excited to see you. Do you want some food?'""Having worked with both Yelp consumers and small business owners for nine years, Nathen believes these small interactions are the key to community success.""One thing [that] has never changed when it comes to pitching Yelp events is [that] your food will become secondary. If people can see you and identify with you and learn a little bit about you, they are going to fall in love with you, and they will want to support you. And how do they do that? By coming back to your restaurant and eating your delicious food.""


Nathen urges business owners to connect on a human level with customers, even on days when they're not feeling 100% or are dealing with a difficult person.""Don't look at a person who's going to potentially review you as your nemesis,"" he said. ""You don't know what they're walking in from. Maybe the best part of their day is enjoying your sandwich or your taco or your gym class.""Nathen brings this same level of empathy to his interactions as a reviewer. When he has a negative experience, he waits 24 hours before writing a review, pausing to think about the person on the other side of the counter, who may be stressed from trying to make ends meet. When he does provide critical feedback, he makes sure it's constructive and not destructive.""Try to put your best foot forward all the time,"" he said. ""If the consumer and the owner took a beat before immediately assuming something, there'd be a little less anger out there.""


In addition to community building, Miguel's Artisan Recipes believes in:Listening to feedback. Start with a small list of offerings and give yourself room to grow your menu based on what customers want to see.Engaging with customers whenever possible. Build long-term relationships with your customers by getting to know them on a personal level, both inside and outside of your store.Using fresh ingredients and authentic recipes. Invest in the quality of your products, and customer demand will follow.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Miguel, Lisa, and Nathen, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.Available on: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Pandora and Soundcloud.Editorial contributions by Callie Morgan and Kristi Lindahl

90,Traditional Ads Are Annoying — These 4 Megatrends Will Change Marketing in 2024,"Mar 1, 2024",Jaxon Parrott,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-marketing-megatrends-to-know-about-in-2024/469672,"
Every marketing professional today knows the rules of the game are shifting at the breakneck speed of technological innovation, making it harder to focus on the fundamentals that will maximize success.Obviously, there's never one secret sauce that guarantees big wins for marketers this year (or any other). But to my mind, there are four major technological and customer-preference megatrends that promise to build momentum in 2024 and beyond.I believe embracing these accelerating trends as you adapt your organization's marketing strategy will help ensure your budgets are smartly allocated and returns on investment are fully optimized.



1. The ""Authentic Age""Today, when marketers are increasingly required to quantify ROI based on complex data —such as cost-per-click and sales conversion rates—focusing on a ""soft"" concept like authenticity might seem irrelevant.But thinking so would be a mistake, in my opinion.


Consider this: Merriam-Webster's Word of the Year for 2023 was ""authentic."" Explaining why, Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster editor at large, said in an interview with the Associated Press, ""We see in 2023 a kind of crisis of authenticity. We realize that when we question authenticity, we value it even more.""Customer preference for authenticity has only accelerated now. In an information universe of inaccuracies, uncertain sources, and deep fakes, people crave authenticity more than just a year ago.Related: 9 Key Tips for Navigating the Upcoming 2024 Marketing Landscape2. Influencer marketingWith so much content and misinformation floating around, customers are more likely than ever to be influenced and persuaded by a real person than a brand. Influencer marketing has emerged as an essential component of the marketing mix.


The desire for authenticity among customers explains the growth of influencer marketing and creator economy, which is expected to be worth $24 billion by the end of this year. While budgets today receive more scrutiny than ever, 67% of marketers surveyed by CreatorIQ reported increasing their investment in influencer marketing from 2022 to 2023. Among the brands that increased their spending in this direction, only 24% were working with a net new budget.According to the survey, among brands that increased their influencer marketing spend, 76% diverted the funds from other marketing activities. In other words, the majority funded their influencer marketing by redirecting resources from other marketing functions—the most common source of which was paid advertising.And no wonder the power of influencer marketing content, which is more organic, offers a greater possibility of going viral and gaining earned (not paid) media attention among highly relevant target audiences.Related: 4 Tips to Avoid Influencer Marketing Catastrophes


3. Creator-driven B2B newslettersNiche newsletters focusing on specialized areas such as AI, health tech, and finance have become pivotal sources for industry insights. Progressing into 2024, the growing interest in newsletters highlights a collective appetite for content curated by influencers and professionally enriching content.The B2B realm is rich with newsletters designed for an audience that values quality and specialized knowledge. These independent voices offer a refreshing alternative to the conventional narratives found in most major trade publications. They provide insights that feel like exchanging insider information within a community of peers, enriching the professional discourse with diverse perspectives and expert knowledge.Creator-led newsletters, exemplified by Morning Brew or my own company's Presspool Insights, which covers AI marketing tech innovations and best practices, are revolutionizing information consumption habits and attracting a quality audience not seen in traditional ad platforms. The main reason is that the audiences are manually opted-in, engaged, and educated or highly interested in the topic they've subscribed to.Platforms like LinkedIn have emerged as prime venues for B2B content creators, each providing unique advantages. Substack and other new platforms have simplified the newsletter creation process with 'no-code' solutions, empowering creators with ownership over first-party subscriber data — a major benefit as Google begins eliminating third-party cookie tracking data this quarter. I expect this trend to increase rapidly going into 2025 as the barrier of entry gets smaller and smaller.


4. AI-enabled, ROI-optimized campaignsComing full circle, leveraging the power of influencer marketing strategies through today's creator-led newsletter distribution platforms enables the same type of KPI tracking associated with paid search ads like Google and Facebook for the last two decades.At my software platform, Presspool.ai, for example, we track everything from impressions to total clicks, unique clicks and conversions. Everything is tracked and monitored in real-time to ensure full transparency into the data analytics while providing our customer with AI-enabled feedback on how to better optimize messaging for higher and higher ROI in their future newsletter campaigns. This falls right in line with ROI optimization, which I believe will become more and more essential in today's competitive marketing landscape.The bottom line is that traditional advertising and PR have grown over-saturated and, to be blunt, annoying to buyers. People don't trust ads from brands or large corporations as much as they once did. Instead, they trust individuals who have a high level of authenticity and specific knowledge. Referrals from these influencers combined with the best technology for tracking and ROI optimization are the most potent form of customer acquisition, and it's now possible to access platforms that do it all in real-time, at scale.

91,5 Strategies for Dealing with High Employee Turnover,"Mar 1, 2024",Dave Ragosa,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-strategies-to-reduce-employee-turnover/469939,"
Do you sometimes feel like your employees are on a fast-moving conveyor belt out the door, and you're on a sluggish treadmill as you try to hire and train their replacements? You're not imagining things, and you're not alone. Aways an unfortunate fact of business life, employee turnover has only gotten worse – as high as 24% above pre-pandemic levels, according to Gartner, Inc. But you can take steps to minimize it or at least lessen the harm it does.The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), citing a study by the Work Institute, says employee turnover adds up to some $680 billion in training costs and lost productivity. High turnover can also lead to decreased morale among remaining staff, inconsistency in service quality and, ultimately, a negative impact on the bottom line.Even more frustrating, SHRM believes three of four workers who quit could have been retained.



As a restaurant, Ford's Garage is certainly not immune to turnover problems. We employ various strategies to retain employees, including offering competitive wages and benefits, fostering a positive work environment, providing opportunities for advancement and skill development, implementing recognition and reward programs and actively soliciting employee feedback to address concerns and make improvements.Related: How Employee Retention is Impacted by Various Leadership StylesHere's what we've learned about the best ways to manage rising resignation rates and try to reduce them:1. Don't ignore itWhile some turnover is inevitable, excessively high turnover rates indicate underlying issues that must be addressed. Take a look at working conditions, compensation, staffing levels and other factors that may be leading team members to head for the door. You may be unable to fix everything, but ignoring the situation cannot be an option.Related: Here's Why So Many Companies Are Losing Employees Shortly After Onboarding2. Take care of your remaining employeesStaff members left behind will have higher workloads, at least temporarily, and may suffer from stress and low morale. It's crucial to prioritize communication, transparency and support for them. Providing opportunities for recognition, professional development and work-life balance can help mitigate the harmful effects of turnover. And don't forget your managers, especially those at mid-level. If you have a seven-day operation, as most retailers and restaurants do, think about rotating local managers so they can take off one or two weekends a month.


3. Remember, it's not always about the moneyPay and benefits undoubtedly play a significant role in employee resignations, but they're not the sole determinants. While competitive pay and benefits are essential for attracting and retaining talent, good working conditions, such as a positive company culture, opportunities for growth and development, and work-life balance, can compensate for slightly lower compensation in some cases. Bear in mind that while flexible work arrangements can be a valuable retention tool for businesses that can offer them, it's essential to balance flexibility with operational needs and ensure clear communication and accountability to maintain productivity and teamwork.4. Foster a culture of continuous improvementHigh-performing team members leave an even bigger hole than most of their colleagues, so they need special attention to keep them motivated. Are you offering them assignments that excite and challenge them? Does their work align with their career goals? Ask them what keeps them returning and how you can help them achieve their goals. They need to be driven and motivated to see the growth and how they contribute to it so they don't leave.Related: Attract Top Talent: Show Them You Have What They Want5. Stay positiveI'm not saying you should ""look on the bright side"" of losing longtime employees, which can have potentially harmful effects on everyone. However, employee turnover can have some positive outcomes. It's an opportunity for workers to step up and show what they can do, revealing talent you never knew your team had. It can also foster innovation and fresh perspectives. Just be careful how you present this attitude to your team; don't give the impression that you think it's great news.


Making work worthwhileIndividuals seek opportunities that align better with their personal and professional aspirations. However, other factors such as job dissatisfaction, lack of growth opportunities and workplace culture play significant roles, so make sure you address all of the above-mentioned to keep your employees motivated and keep them with your company.

92,The Miley Cyrus Approach To Marketing — Why It's a Radically Different Method For Achieving Brand Impact,"Mar 1, 2024",Sunny Dublick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-miley-cyrus-taught-me-about-marketing/469675,"
Miley Cyrus took home her first Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance this year. Shocked and elated, she took the stage to accept the award from none other than Mariah Carey and shared a very heartfelt speech:""And so there's a story I wanna tell that sums up this moment, and I wasn't gonna tell it, but now Mariah's here. So there was a little boy that all he wanted for his birthday was a butterfly. And so his parents gave him a butterfly net, and he was so excited. He just went outside out in the sun and started swinging and swinging. But with no luck, he sat down on the ground, he finally let go, and he surrendered, and he was okay that he wasn't gonna capture this beautiful butterfly. And right when he did is when the butterfly came and landed right on the tip of his nose. And this song 'Flowers' is my butterfly.""So, what does it have to do with marketing? Everything.



Current marketing theory is centered around amplification: more ads, emails and automation. The idea is that the more times we can reach a customer with our message, the better. Push out social posts, text ads, and Spotify spots, and hit them at every path along the buyer journey until they're worn down enough to buy.I liken this to chasing a customer down the street screaming, ""BUY NOW!"" as they frantically run as far away as possible — only we're doing this through screens, so it feels tolerable. Is it really effective, though? Or are we just casting the widest net possible over and over again, hoping to scoop up more (proverbial) butterflies?


I want to advocate for a different way, one that feels far less cringe-worthy. I want brands to stop chasing down business and start attracting it. What does that look like?Related: 7 Marketing Strategies You Need to SucceedStart with your offering(s)You need to have something that is ultimately an attractive offer to your audience. I ask every client what are the brands they aspire to be like. Apple always comes up. The new iPhone comes out, and there is a line around the block. We all want that kind of brand loyalty, right? The real question is: are we willing to do the work to get there?Apple didn't become a brand giant by creating the same products as the rest of the industry. It pushed category conventions every chance it could get. It constantly innovated and became cool because it was always on the cutting edge of new technology. Buying an Apple product was like a promise that you had the new, shiny toy everyone wanted. Their marketing just lets you know it's available, and frankly, they barely need it.


Apple's customers do most of their marketing for them. Think about what it would be like for your business to have an offer that's so good you know there will be a waiting list. Push yourself out of the thinking that 'this is the way things have to be.' What would it look like if you created something so amazing that you didn't have to force the message to convince people to buy? That is how you become an attractive brand. That's how you get your butterflies.Related: How to Bring Connection, Creativity and Results Together in MarketingKeep it realOne of my biggest takeaways from the Grammy speech was the need for surrender. Accepting the reality of where you are right now. That level of honesty and authenticity is crucial in building a great brand. It's the opposite of giving up; rather, it is realizing you have control over certain things, but a lot is out of our hands as businesses.It's letting go of our vice grip on metrics and being fine with letting life and joy become part of our marketing practice. Marketers have become so trained that everything has to have a way to measure ROI — and while I am not advocating wasting money, I am advocating that we allow wiggle room in our budgets and hearts for authentic brand connection. Not the PR stories, not the influencer partnerships. I mean genuine ways to live out your brand's purpose for your customers and employees.


If you created a business, it wasn't only to make money. I am guessing it was created to help people. Sometimes, we get so far away from where we've been and our purpose that the best thing we can do is surrender. Remind ourselves why we started or why we were so excited to work for a company in the first place. How do we get back to being a great brand?Related: How to Create Authentic Relationships and Build Customer TrustBe a good stewardThink about the brands you admire — do they need to convince you to buy? To chase you down? No. What does the boy with the butterfly do once it lands on his nose? Does he hop right up and start chasing it again? Or does he know he doesn't have to? Will he continue to attract great things because he is a magnet for success? I want to encourage you to be this magnet as well, and how you do that is by being a good steward to your customers.That means protecting their data, their interests, and their privacy. That means treating them with the respect they deserve. So often, we treat customers like numbers on a balance sheet. Just bombarding them with information to get their sale. This is not the way to make a great brand. This is being that pushy car salesman that no one feels comfortable around. When in doubt, all you have to do is put yourself in their shoes. Is this how I would want to hear about a brand like mine? Or does it feel weird? Is there a better way? Let empathy towards your community inspire you to do better and become the magnet of great customers.


One thing I feel passionate about as a marketer is that we have to find a better way. What this industry has become is a never-ending spiral of advertising. In essence, marketing should be about connecting with the people you want to help. We're not connecting by shouting messages at them all day, every day — in short, we're not being great partners with our clients.I hope that I can inspire you to new ways of thinking about marketing in a way that lets you attract all of the businesses you can handle without ever having to chase a thing.

93,7 Ways to Create a Seamless Marketing Campaign Across All Platforms,"Feb 29, 2024",Dmitrii Khasanov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/7-steps-for-crafting-a-seamless-marketing-campaign/469034,"
Investing in digital marketing is no longer a desire but a strategic step that can lead a business to success. According to The Global Strategic Business Report, the digital marketing market is growing at an annual growth rate of 13.9%. So, it's expected to reach a whopping $1.5 trillion by 2030.As a reference, the digital advertising market is projected to reach $680 billion in 2023. Businesses cannot exist without marketing, so companies actively invest in different digital marketing channels.Social media is at the top of the list, offering a variety of platforms to communicate with clients and users. However, dealing with cross-platform content marketing might seem daunting initially, but it doesn't have to be. Many marketers aim to expand their reach across various social media platforms, yet efficiency becomes a concern, especially without a clear approach.



To make your marketing strategy seamless across platforms, it's essential to craft content that aligns with each platform's vibe. This ensures a cohesive experience, steering away from the typical advertising that users tend to avoid. Tailoring your campaign to fit each platform's unique posting requirements not only boosts engagement but also ensures your audience connects with your brand in a genuine way.Related: 5 Ways ChatGPT Will Impact Digital Marketing


What are the advantages of having cross-platform campaigns for a business?Each platform has a unique purpose. Instagram and Twitter focus on awareness, while Facebook excels in conversions through ads. Tailoring goals to each platform enhances your overall strategy. Platforms vary in visual and text-based aspects. A cross-platform strategy ensures your content seamlessly fits each medium, making it relatable and effective.Cross-platform campaigns outshine single-platform efforts. Avoid the 'copy and paste' trap by customizing content for each platform, optimizing engagement and reaching a broader audience. Consistent branding across platforms builds loyalty and trust. A unified brand presence reinforces your identity and boosts the impact of your marketing efforts.Aligning marketing campaigns across platforms may seem like a daunting task that demands significant attention and resources. Indeed, it is. Nevertheless, you can consider the key factors that impact the success of developing a cross-platform digital marketing strategy.1. Set platform-specific goalsBefore diving in, it's crucial to undertake this pivotal step. While you may already have an overarching goal for your campaign, it's imperative to set specific goals for each platform you'll be utilizing. Here are some illustrative examples:


Instagram: Promote engagement and discovery.Pinterest: Drive conversion to the website.LinkedIn: Build B2B-focused marketing campaignsFacebook: Promote engagement and attract leads.Medium: Share expertise and experience.2. Say no to copy-paste (almost)Since platforms have their own quirks, it's crucial to customize content for each one. Yet, you can consider duplicating content for platforms that share similar audience segments. However, copying and pasting the same content across multiple platforms will be the biggest red flag for people potentially interested in interacting with your content.Related: What You Need To Know About Omni-Channel Marketing3.

95,"Navigating the Diverse Marketing Landscape of Black America — How to Foster Authentic Engagement, Loyalty and Respect","Feb 28, 2024",Christine Alexis,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-navigate-the-diverse-marketing-landscape-of-black/470004,"
As the United States commemorates Black History Month, corporate marketers must challenge the oversimplified perception of Black Americans as a monolithic group. The United States comprises a diverse array of Black experiences, encompassing descendants of enslaved Africans, recent immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean and various cultural groups that have flourished over generations.As a Black marketer, I recognize the critical need for brands to connect authentically with the wide range of Black culture, crafting marketing that truly resonates without diminishing our diverse experiences.Related: Celebrating Black History and Culture Is the Right Thing to Do — and Good for Business. Here's How.



The diverse landscape of Black AmericaThe diversity within the Black American demographic is deeply rooted in the complex history of the United States, tracing back to the descendants of enslaved Africans brought to North America through the Transatlantic Slave Trade. This group's history has profoundly shaped the country's cultural, political and social narratives, characterized by resilience, cultural amalgamation and a rich legacy of contributions across various spheres.From this historical backdrop, unique cultural groups such as the Gullah Geechee in the Carolinas and Louisiana Creole have emerged, each with distinct identities shaped by their unique histories and cultural influences. The Gullah Geechee people have preserved their African heritage through language, crafts and community practices. Similarly, the Louisiana Creole community reflects a rich blend of French, African, Spanish and Native American influences, evident in their language, cuisine and music.


Adding to this, the Black American demographic is further diversified by significant immigrant populations from the Caribbean and Africa. Data from the Pew Research Center indicates that the Caribbean is the primary region of origin for Black immigrants, with nearly half (46%) of the foreign-born Black population originating from this area. Jamaica and Haiti are the most significant source countries, comprising 16% and 15% of the Black immigrant population, respectively. These communities, alongside other African immigrants, enrich the American cultural landscape with their diverse cultural backgrounds, adding new layers of complexity and richness to the Black American identity.This intricate blend of Black America presents unparalleled opportunities for targeted engagement. Marketers aiming to authentically engage with the broader Black community must grasp and appreciate these sub-communities' unique heritage, preferences and cultural narratives.The strategic importance of cultural specificityThe buying power of the Black American population is projected to exceed $1.8 trillion in the coming year — surpassing the annual GDPs of nations like Mexico and the Netherlands. Understanding and tapping into this market with respect and authenticity can significantly boost brand loyalty and market share.The demographic landscape of the United States has seen the Black population grow by 30%, to 36.2 million individuals as of 2021, emphasizing the importance of culturally specific marketing strategies. This significant change in demographics is characterized by the fact that roughly one in five Black Americans are immigrants or the children of immigrants.


Related: Unpacking the Black Demographic Shift and Why Marketers Must Re-Examine Their StrategiesCompanies doing it rightGoogle:Through its innovative Google Doodles, Google has spotlighted prominent figures from Haitian and Jamaican history, effectively bringing their stories and achievements to the forefront of the international community. These doodles serve as a gateway for millions worldwide to engage with and learn about the profound impact of Haitian and Jamaican cultures. Further amplifying its commitment, Google's Arts & Culture platform stands as a testament to the company's commitment to cultural preservation and education, offering users curated exhibitions and narratives celebrating Haiti and Jamaica's unique cultural identities (alongside a plethora of other countries).Peloton:


Peloton has played a pivotal role in amplifying diverse voices within the fitness industry, providing a significant platform for instructors like Alex Toussaint to share their unique perspectives and cultural heritage. Toussaint's presence and narrative on Peloton do more than add depth to the brand's instructor lineup; they offer a blueprint for leveraging personal stories and cultural heritage in marketing strategies.This strategy enhances the brand's representation efforts and positions Peloton as a leader in promoting inclusivity and understanding through fitness, demonstrating the profound impact of integrating personal heritage with brand identity in today's digital marketing landscape. By aligning with voices like Toussaint's, Peloton demonstrates how brands can successfully integrate representation into their marketing strategies, turning their platforms into arenas for positive change and community building.Disney:Despite The Princess and the Frog premiering in 2009, Disney has strategically embraced and celebrated Louisiana Creole culture. The film introduced Tiana as the first Black Disney princess and was set against the vibrant backdrop of New Orleans. Disney's promotional efforts skillfully highlighted these cultural elements, appealing to a broad audience while paying homage to the cultural significance of the film's setting and characters. Disney's marketing successfully balanced cultural authenticity with timeless appeal, from merchandise featuring Tiana to collaborations with renowned Louisiana Creole chefs. This long-term commitment has manifested in several significant initiatives that continue to pay cultural and commercial dividends for the brand.


In the fall of 2023, Tiana's Palace opened in Disneyland Resort's New Orleans Square, extending the narrative beyond the screen with a dining experience offering Louisiana Creole cuisine and the vibrant atmosphere depicted in the movie. Additionally, the announcement of ""Tiana's Bayou Adventure,"" slated to open in 2024 as a reimagined ride replacing Splash Mountain, further demonstrates Disney's commitment to celebrating Louisiana Creole culture along with the Louisiana ecosystem, thus enhancing its brand identity as inclusive and diverse.Related: 20 Brands That Are Actually Making Progress on their Commitments to Serving the Black CommunityTo authentically engage with the diversity within the Black community, brands can incorporate culturally specific phrases or expressions into targeted marketing efforts. These strategic integrations, particularly in areas with a significant Jamaican and Haitian community presence, like New York and Florida, deepen connections and showcase respect and appreciation for cultural diversity. By commemorating cultural events and infusing these subtle nuances, brands can significantly enhance engagement. Collaborative initiatives with community leaders and influencers further authenticate these campaigns, while diverse representation in advertising accurately mirrors the community's spectrum of identities, fostering trust and loyalty among customers.In today's marketplace, where authenticity and genuine connection are highly valued, brands must acknowledge and celebrate the diversity within the Black community. Embracing Black Americans' distinct cultures, languages and historical narratives enables brands to foster deeper engagement, loyalty and respect among their audiences. This strategy demands a dedicated effort to grasp and weave these cultural identities into marketing initiatives, ensuring authenticity and a commitment to diversity and inclusion. By doing so, brands enrich their relationships with diverse communities and set a standard for meaningful engagement in the industry.

96,5 Tips for Choosing an SEO Expert to Help Your Website Stand Out and Attract More Customers,"Feb 28, 2024",Nick Zviadadze,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-tips-for-choosing-an-seo-expert-to-boost-your-website/469930,"
A lack of search engine optimization (SEO) leaves many small business websites buried under an avalanche of online content, invisible to potential customers.Simply offering quality products or services isn't enough to make it in today's competitive market. Without a solid SEO strategy, your business will face major growth hurdles, missing out on potential customers and letting competitors take the lead.The good news is, there's a way to change this. The right SEO expert can help your website stand out from the competition and attract potential customers.In this article, I share five crucial tips for navigating the world of SEO professionals and finding the one who can truly make a difference for your business.Related: 10 Questions to Ask When Hiring an SEO Consultant



SEO is as important as everWhen your potential customers search for the products or services you offer online, you want to be at the top of search results. This is where SEO comes in handy.Using the right SEO techniques improves your search engine rankings and drives more visitors to your website. More importantly, it provides the best user experience, helping convert these visitors into customers.A strong SEO strategy builds credibility and trust in your brand. When your website ranks high on search engine result pages (SERPs), it's seen as more authoritative and reliable.However, ranking on your own is often difficult, and most entrepreneurs need help from SEO experts. Keep in mind that the market is flooded with SEO agencies promising sky-high results, but not all deliver. Some use outdated techniques or black-hat tactics that can do more harm than good.


Let's see how you can avoid that:How to choose the right SEO expert for your businessHere are the five SEO tips for small businesses that can help you find the right SEO expert:1. Niche relevanceWhen choosing an SEO expert, you should pick someone with specific experience in your niche. The reason behind this is simple — every industry has unique challenges, audience behaviors and SEO mistakes to avoid.For example, if you're running a SaaS company, you'll be up against different keywords, content strategies and competition than the tech or software world.


An SEO expert with a track record in the SaaS industry will understand your niche's nuances, from the technical jargon to the customer journey of a software buyer. They'll know what has worked in the past for similar companies and will be able to tailor their SEO strategy accordingly.In comparison, ecommerce SEO involves optimizing product pages, managing reviews and understanding how to navigate the complexities of various shopping platforms. An expert with ecommerce experience will understand these specifics and develop a strategy to ensure your products rank well on Google and attract the right customers.The same goes for every other niche out there.2. Proven track recordsA history of delivering solid results across multiple projects is a strong indicator of a skilled SEO expert. Remember, a single success story might be a stroke of luck, but consistent achievements across various campaigns suggest a deep understanding of SEO principles.


In addition to checking their track record, however, you also need to ensure these results are tangible. Some SEO professionals might boast about doubling a website's traffic in a few months, but these numbers can be misleading without context.For example, doubling a website's traffic from 200 to 400 visitors is significantly different than going from 20,000 to 40,000. The latter demonstrates the ability to operate and deliver larger-scale results, which is crucial for businesses aiming for substantial growth.Related: 7 Compelling Reasons Why You Need to Hire An SEO Expert for Your Business3. Clear scope and deliverablesA common issue when hiring SEO experts is presenting a vague work scope. Statements like ""We'll improve your technical SEO"" or ""We'll focus on your on-page SEO"" might sound promising, but they lack specificity.


As a business owner, even if you're unfamiliar with all the technicalities of SEO, you should expect a clear work scope and a detailed timeline from your SEO expert. This can include all the tasks they'll undertake, how they contribute to your overall SEO strategy and when you can expect them to be completed.It's also crucial to understand exactly what SEO services you're getting. For example, here are some questions you could ask:Is keyword research part of the package, and how extensive will it be?How many blog posts or articles are included, and what topics will they cover?How many guest posts from reputable sites can you expect, and over what timeframe?4. Reasonable outputSEO agencies sometimes prioritize the management aspect of their services, such as strategy planning and client communication, instead of actual deliverables like content and backlinks.Remember that content creation and link-building are the biggest needle-movers in the SEO game. So, receiving one blog post a week and a couple of backlinks a month just isn't enough to significantly impact your website's search engine rankings.For SEO efforts to be truly effective, you should expect at least a dozen or more high-quality, SEO content pieces each month. In addition, aim to request five to ten quality backlinks per month.


5. Regular reportingIt's important to know upfront what the agency's reporting structure looks like and how they plan to keep you informed about the developments and results of your SEO strategy. It needs to be clear, understandable and actionable, allowing you to see the return on your investment.Effective reporting should start with baseline metrics like website impressions. An increase in impressions indicates that more potential customers are seeing your website.Another critical metric is the increase in clicks to key pages on your website, as it indicates that content is relevant enough to encourage further engagement.Lastly, any reporting should cover ranking for your target keywords. Improving keyword rankings is a strong indicator of successful SEO, which means your website is becoming more authoritative.


Related: Don't Believe an SEO Expert Who Tells You Any of These 7 LiesPartnering with the right SEO expert is vital for improving your website's visibility and supporting business growth. Remember to seek someone with niche relevance, a proven track record, clear deliverables, reasonable output and regular reporting.Following these five tips ensures a personalized approach, transparent communication and tangible results, setting you up for guaranteed success.

Through the exchange of this so-called ""link juice"" between your site and other authoritative sites, you can enjoy a great many business advantages.Now, this process can be streamlined by incorporating AI in your link-building efforts. Let's explore this in more detail below.The role of AI in SEO and link buildingThose who are in the game already know that link building, until very recently, was a process that entailed long hard hours spent in front of your PC.Typically, link-building specialists had the unenviable task of searching for authoritative sites, studying the competition, looking for appropriate keywords, fixing broken links, doing roundups, sending cold outreach emails and follow-ups, commissioning the writing of guest articles, writing strong pitches for Help a Reporter Out (HARO), creating skyscraper content, designing infographics, publishing their own research and gathering data for publication, and the list goes on.


However, with the advent of AI tools, SEO and link building, which are inextricably linked, have become a streamlined process that can save you a lot of valuable time and resources through the automation of many of the tasks mentioned above.

You can also specify the topic for more tailored suggestions. Here is my prompt: ""Suggest 10 catchy topics for [target website] that have not been covered yet. They must be SEO-related only.""Perplexity AI:After a topic is selected by the editors, I use Perplexity AI to pitch them an outline with the following prompt: ""Suggest a detailed outline for an article I'd like to publish as a guest contributor on [website name] about 'topic.'"" This forms the basis of my outline. Based on my experience, and the best articles on the topic, I can create an outstanding outline in 5-10 minutes.SEMrush:The SEMrush AI Writing Assistant can also help with my SEO and link-building efforts. Through its 75 tools, I really have my pick when it comes to content options. Entering prompts is easy, and the content I need can be generated in mere minutes.Some of its more impressive features relevant to my link-building efforts include: adding keywords, generating multiple ideas from one prompt, choosing creativity levels, adjusting the tone of voice, and many others.

Here, you start by opening a search engine and defining your anchor text and target URL. Type in the site followed by your keyword and then look for relevant articles where your keyword would fit naturally.Once you've identified a relevant article, open it to check for placement opportunities. If the anchor text doesn't exist in the article but the article is niche-relevant and the keyword can add value, suggest an edit. You can also use HARPA to type: ""Suggest a relevant place for my anchor text 'your keyword' in this article [[page]].""


Through these AI tools and techniques for link building, I can proudly share that my own website has reaped the rewards. What started out as a DR of 49 quickly rose to 62 within the space of just one month. The reason behind this? Publishing high-quality content that received numerous strong links naturally.

That's why it's good to look toward the future and see some of the predicted developments and AI advances we can look forward to.So, without further ado, here's what I think we can expect in the future from AI and ML tools in the link-building space:

98,Build Long-Term Customer Loyalty With These 3 Relationship Marketing Strategies,"Feb 27, 2024",Michelena Howl,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/build-long-term-customer-loyalty-with-these-3-strategies/469883,"
The key to building a successful brand is to resonate with customers. That's a challenge for any brand at any time. But in 2024, it will be even more difficult than usual.For starters, the days of buying third-party customer data based on tracking cookies to retarget customers across social media and the internet are ending. Complicating matters is a 2024 political campaign season expected to crowd out most of the available retargeting ad inventory. And finally, social media fatigue is setting in across the board.But when one door closes, another opens. The challenges above merely represent the end of an old era, which means we're at the beginning of a new one … one where brands establish authentic (and thus more powerful) relationships with their customers that build long-term customer loyalty.



The result is a win-win for all. Brands acquire better and more actionable data and insights about what their customers want. Applied correctly, this then means customers can get more relevant, timely and personalized offers through the channels they prefer.And it's all possible by following three simple steps — Find your audience. Get to know them. Make them superfans.Here's a quick overview of each of these steps, supported by the latest data from our recently published Marigold 2024 Global Consumer Trends Index report.Related: How to Create Authentic Relationships and Build Customer Trust1. Find your audienceThe best place to find your audience is to pay attention to those who visit your website. Turning visitors into customers is relationship marketing 101.For too long, brands have relied on tracking cookies to accomplish this. But not only are cookies going away, customers don't like them. However, they do like relevant offers based on their interests and preferences.


Consider the following insights from the Marigold Consumer Trends Index:Indirect tracking tools like third-party cookies are considered ""creepy"" by 61% of customers. Yet, 68% say getting reminder emails about items they left in an online shopping cart is ""cool.""Getting ads from unknown brands based on location is again considered ""creepy"" by 64% of consumers. But 59% are fine receiving messages based on their interests (like hiking, running, etc.)In other words … stalking is creepy. Conversations are cool. So, a far fresher strategy is to make each site visit an opportunity to connect. With on-site forms and interactive experiences, brands can directly collect the information needed to determine the right product-market fit with far greater granularity than just a note about which web page was visited.


By establishing interactive experiences on your site, you can analyze consumer interests, organize them into customer segments, and ultimately deliver personalized offers based on what you know they'll like.2. Get to know themOnce you've converted unknown visitors into established contacts, you can start engaging them with useful and interesting content to get to know them even better. After all, your customers have all the information you need to know. All you have to do is ask. Data acquired this way is called ""zero-party data,"" and it's the most valuable information you can collect.Of course, you must give them a reason to do so first. The vast majority of consumers are willing participants in a value exchange, where they trade personal data about themselves in return for something of value or interest.The ""value"" in the value exchange can take several forms, according to the Marigold Consumer Trends Index. Saving money is a top incentive. A majority of consumers find value in discounts/coupons (91%), loyalty points/rewards (89%), early/exclusive access to offers (83%), a chance to win something (81%), unlocking content (60%) and brand community (55%).


But money isn't the only incentive. Customers have data needs of their own — exclusive content like previews, eBooks, guides and other insights into your niche make the ""cost of entry"" participation in a survey, poll or quiz easy to collect zero-party data.Surveys are one of the top formats for collecting zero-party data. These can take different forms, from new customer surveys to surveys about their experience with the products, thoughts on products they'd want in the future, or even why they stopped buying your products are all useful.Just make sure the survey is executed properly. Our own global study found that 66% of consumers are more likely to complete brand surveys if they are easy to complete, while another 55% pointed to how the survey will be used as a factor (such as informing the development of new products or services).Doing this right is important because once collected, zero-party data allows you to create highly personalized and dynamic content and product recommendations, coupon codes and promotions for your most loyal (and valuable) customers.


Related: 7 Amazing Ways to Build Long-Term Relationships With Your Customers3. Make them superfansRelationship marketing is more than just finding and getting to know your customers. It's about keeping them loyal as well, and there are many ways to accomplish this.To start, talk with your customers using the information you've collected in the steps above. Personalized email and text messages, delivered at the right time with the right actionable information, will make your customers feel heard and appreciated. Both are critical first steps to establishing customer loyalty.According to the Marigold Consumer Trends Index, more than half (51%) of consumers still report frustration over receiving irrelevant content or offers. On the flip side, 85% of consumers say their favorite brand treats them like an individual, and 78% of consumers say they are likely to engage with a personalized offer tailored to their interests.


But unless your email/messaging platform is integrated with your zero-party data collection platform, that might prove difficult. Relationship marketing requires an integrated approach, with clear connections from the first step to the last.Of course, creating personalized messaging with data collected from users requires being sensitive to privacy concerns. Respecting these concerns opens up another opportunity for brands to create customer loyalty and maintain it. According to the Marigold Consumer Trends Index:77% of consumers cite data privacy policies as either important or critically important to maintaining their loyalty, second only to product options/availability, and above customer service and support.Roughly half of consumers do not trust social media platforms with their data, and 68% are actively sharing less data with social platforms over concerns about how that data is used.63% of consumers will pay more to shop with the brands they're loyal to.More than 70% of consumers cite the following as either important or critically important to maintaining their loyalty: customer service/support, offers/promotions, data privacy policies, product/service quality, options and availability.Related: This Digital Media Expert Shares His 6 Pillars of Brand Loyalty That Will Work For Any BusinessRemember, loyalty is earned on multiple fronts — with every customer interaction. In other words, you have to build that loyalty through authentic and personalized communications, respect for customer privacy, and of course, a product that delivers on customers' needs.Like any good relationship, your relationship with customers is not a transaction. It's not a journey from point A to point B that ends with just a sale. It's a circle … an ongoing virtuous circle. Because the result of good marketing is to establish a relationship. And the best relationships never end.

99,Why Startups Should Invest in Public Relations Right Now,"Feb 22, 2024",Hannah Cranston,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-startups-should-not-wait-before-investing-in-pr/469427,"
Entrepreneurs often find themselves at a crossroads, deliberating over the right moment to initiate key strategies. As an agency owner who works with many startups, I'm often asked when the ""right"" time is to engage PR services. Should you wait until you fundraise before investing in PR? Is it crucial to close your round before bringing PR into the picture? Isn't PR for more well-established businesses? The short answer is a resounding no.The temptation to postpone PR activities until the budget is more robust is understandable but also a strategic misstep that could cost valuable opportunities. Initiating a PR plan from the get-go is beneficial and essential for startups looking to stand out in the competitive landscape of fundraising.Related: 5 Secrets Your PR Team Is Not Telling You



Perception is everythingIn the world of fundraising, how investors perceive your startup can make or break your chances of securing the investment you need. Investors are not merely putting their money into a product or service; they're investing in the entirety of your brand, your vision, and the potential they perceive.A strategic PR plan is instrumental in shaping this story. It weaves a compelling narrative around your startup, highlighting its uniqueness and promise, capturing the imagination and confidence of potential backers. This narrative doesn't just reach potential investors; it resonates with them, aligning your vision with their investment goals.


Building credibility before the pitchInvestors are inundated with pitches, each clamoring for attention and funding. Before investors write a check, they look for evidence that your startup is a credible and viable contender in its market. Effective PR showcases your achievements, milestones and the unique aspects of your business, creating a layer of credibility and trust that precedes formal pitch meetings. This pre-built credibility can be a decisive factor in the competitive world of startup fundraising, especially in the current climate.Related: Raising Funding in a Downturn Isn't Impossible — I Did It (and You Can, Too).Creating momentum and visibilityA well-executed PR strategy doesn't just put your startup on the radar of potential investors; it generates buzz and visibility, creating a sense of momentum around your business. Investors are drawn to startups that are promising and perceived as on a trajectory toward success. Building an excited and loyal audience around your business can do just that! It signals to the market and potential investors that your company is on the move, achieving milestones and garnering attention — a powerful psychological lever in the fundraising process.Opening doors to networking opportunitiesOne of the less obvious but equally valuable benefits of PR is its ability to facilitate networking opportunities. PR can open doors to potential investors directly. A strong PR campaign puts your brand in the limelight and can lead to fielding incoming inquiries from interested investors rather than relentlessly pursuing meetings.


This shift from outbound to inbound interest can be a game-changer, allowing you to spend more time refining your pitch and operations and less time in the constant hustle for attention. Effective PR places your brand in the spotlight, attracting not just potential investors but also partners, customers and top talent. These connections are invaluable, providing support, resources, and collaboration opportunities that extend well beyond the initial fundraising phase.Leveraging name-brand recognitionPR is about building and enhancing your startup's brand recognition. In a crowded marketplace, being a recognizable name can significantly influence your fundraising efforts. Investors are drawn to brands that they can trust and believe in—the kind of trust and belief that a strategic PR campaign can help foster. Not to mention, a recognizable brand can attract even more media attention and partnership opportunities, multiplying the effects of your initial PR efforts and laying a strong foundation for future growth.Don't wait to start PRIntegrating a PR plan into your fundraising strategy isn't just about getting your name out there; it's about creating a strong, positive perception of your startup. This perception can influence investor confidence, attract additional interest, and position your startup as a leader in its field. Waiting until after you've secured funding to focus on PR means missing a critical opportunity to shape how investors and the market view your startup. It's an investment that pays dividends.

        Nelson's first massive beanbag took three weeks to make and quickly caught people's attention. 
      


        Nelson sold the first beanbags to fellow college students, then branched out to boat shows, trade shows and more. 
      


        Once Lovesac had about 40 store locations, Nelson appeared on Richard Branson's reality TV show and secured a $1 million investment. 
      


        Growing the company from that point was filled with more twists and turns, but Lovesac continues to see rapid growth today with an estimated $700 million in annual sales.

It's 1995, and I'm 18, sitting on my parents' couch in Salt Lake City, Utah. One morning, I had an idea and thought, Wouldn't it be funny to make a giant beanbag chair — like the size of my entire living room floor? So, I got off the couch, drove down to the fabric store and bought enough fabric for something that massive. Then, I began sewing it together. It took three weeks to fill it up with soft stuff I cut up from around the house — but everywhere I took it, people loved it and begged me to make them one. Eventually, I did. It cost me $25 to register the name, and in October 1998, Lovesac officially began as a company.Related: The Side Hustle She Started in Her Princeton Dorm Room Led to a $510 Million Business: 'Don't Take No for an Answer'What were some of the first steps you took to get that side hustle off the ground?When I started college at the University of Utah, I lived in my parents' basement, which was the perfect place to roll out huge, long rolls of fabric. My buddies and I would make the Sacs in the basement and sell them at our college. We quickly became known as the ""Lovesac guys"" around campus, with even the frats and sororities buying a few Sacs for their houses. From there, we were a fixture at any event we could find — boat shows, home shows, car shows, Oktoberfest — and this is how we grew the company in those earliest days.Were there challenges that came with running the side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those?After two or three years of running Lovesac as a side hustle in college, it was apparent that it would not make any real money in its current form. In fact, it probably cost me money to keep it alive. Sure, we'd make a profit selling the product — but then the van would break. Or the foam shredder would break. Or the state would fine me and my buddies for some workplace violation. The bottom line is: Building a business is hard, and it can take a lot of money to make it to some kind of meaningful critical mass.


As we grew, I was working harder than ever. It was draining, but I couldn't help but give it one last shot at a trade show in Chicago, hoping to get to the next level. One of the biggest retailers in the U.S. placed an order for 12,000 Sacs, not knowing that it was just me and a buddy working out of a rundown building with a wood chipper as a foam shredder.Despite every inefficiency, we completed the order, but then we realized we had no other big customers to sell to. We went to the furniture stores, but they all laughed at us and said it was a stupid idea — so we decided to open our own store. The first Lovesac store opened on November 17, 2001.Image Credit: Courtesy of LovesacRelated: The 'Easy' Side Hustle He Started in College Hit More Than $1 Million in Revenue — and Taught Him 3 Business Lessons He Still Uses TodayWhen did you decide to take the business from side hustle to full-time venture?Our first store changed everything — this is when I pivoted the company to a full-time venture. Consumers were obsessed with Lovesac. They came in, bought Sacs, flopped down and hung out with friends. The product was the best sales pitch we could give. We were doing six figures in just the first few weeks, and I had never seen money like that. We promptly ran off to open the second store in Provo, Utah, then Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Southern California. Growth went ballistic.What were some of the biggest hurdles that came up over the years once you were running the business full-time? How did you overcome those?We had grown to 35-40 locations when I got recruited to be on Richard Branson's reality TV show, The Rebel Billionaire, in 2005. It was a national primetime show on Fox Network, and I won a $1 million investment! Of course, I was $2 million in debt, having built this growing retail chain, but what are you going to do? We took the winnings, paid off some debt and raised more money through venture capital. However, the venture capitalists wanted to bankrupt the company and start over cleanly through Chapter 11 reorganization. I was devastated. We had made it all this way, yet somehow, the only way forward was to begin again.


We moved the company to Stamford, Connecticut, downsized the staff to a skeleton crew and started over with just 12 locations and about 12 employees at our tiny new HQ on the East Coast. It was the right move in the long run. We learned, focused and built the company back up to 30, 40, then 50 locations. Some people might have coasted after that, but I got another wild idea. Ironically, this one happened because of a couch, too.In that first store, we had a couch in the corner to show the Sacs in a living room-type environment. We noticed that customers always asked to buy the couch, but it was too big to sell. So, the idea was, What if we could shrink down this couch the way we shrink down our Sacs? And that's how the concept of Sactionals was born.Related: This College Student Started a Side Hustle So He Didn't Have to Bartend Until 4 am. Now He's Earning $7,000 a Month — and Putting It to Good Use.In 2012, Lovesac was named the fastest-growing furniture company in the U.S. by Furniture Today — what made that rapid growth possible? How has the company approached scaling over the years?Around this time, I recognized that if we were going to really compete, we needed to pivot the business. With this in mind, I changed our focus to becoming a direct-to-consumer furniture brand with Sactionals as the primary driver. I took a risk and invested in local and then national TV advertising for the Sactionals, along with every emerging digital approach. Sactionals quickly became the fastest-selling couch solution in the United States. Lovesac expanded to nearly 80 locations, and then [we] took the company public in 2018 with $100 million in sales.After you go public, the sky's the limit. The company was worth $200-300 million overnight. It felt like a dream; I couldn't believe it. We grew to hundreds of locations by the 2020s. We have thousands of employees, and we've been named the fastest-growing furniture company in the U.S. numerous times. Our sales have multiplied and will likely grow to a billion dollars and beyond. The Sactionals gave us a new future. Their rapid adoption revealed that people love the idea of things being built to last a lifetime and designed to evolve with you throughout your life. We're proving that planned obsolescence was the wrong way to make a brand that lasts. We call this new approach to innovation Designed for Life, and it will inform everything we do from here on out.Image Credit: Courtesy of LovesacWhat is the company's current valuation? How much revenue does it bring in today?


Looking back at the past year, Lovesac's growth and performance results are a testament to the resilience of our brand and disruptive business model that has consistently delivered category outperformance and customer loyalty. Through a challenging year for our category, we've been able to maintain momentum with our commitment to product innovation, compelling marketing and a highly productive omnichannel footprint. These strategies continue to drive consumer demand and further distinguish our unique brand from a crowded market. Looking ahead, we believe that we are poised to continue investing in the future with an accelerated pace of expansion and innovation to further garner customer enthusiasm.Prior to reporting year-end results, Wall Street analysts estimate Lovesac's sales for the fiscal year that just ended to come in at around $700 million, with high single-digit adjusted EBITDA profitability. The company has fluctuated in multiples and market cap valuations over the past four years hovering in the $300-400 million range, peaking at over $1 billion in 2021 when the home category hit all-time highs during the pandemic.Related: The Side Hustle He Saw on YouTube Earned Him a Multi-Year Deal With Sony and Income Streams Generating Tens of ThousandsWhen you look to your company's future, what are you most excited about?At Lovesac, innovation is at the center of our design philosophy as we continue to prioritize developing breakthrough technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the furniture category. Challenging traditional definitions of comfort and home style is what has set the Lovesac brand apart since its inception, and over the past few years, we've been working with a variety of high-end fashion brands in the space to create something truly unique in the market. Anti Social Social Club, Jeremy Scott, alice + olivia and KidSuper are among the brands that have collaborated on covers and accoutrements for our two signature styles. We look forward to creating a blend of fashion-forward design and unparalleled comfort that speaks to the modern consumer.What are some of the biggest lessons you've learned over the course of your entrepreneurial journey?In my new memoir Let Me Save You 25 Years: Mistakes, Miracles, and Lessons from the Lovesac Story, I detail the ups and downs of my 25-year saga building the Lovesac business from its days as a college side hustle to a successful IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange and beyond. If you can learn from my mistakes, however, then perhaps your ambitions, big or small, can be realized in less than the 25-plus years it has taken me to finally learn something and get somewhere with mine.Here are some of the biggest lessons I've learned:


1. Heed what the experts have to say, but on occasion, you need to trust your gut.2. There comes a point before any major change in your career, business or personal life where you can greatly improve your odds for good outcomes by making a bold decision to ditch the safety net and fully commit.3. Play along the way, taking the time you need to keep yourself relaxed and sharp.4. You're no good to anyone as a miserable, uptight workaholic.Related: He Started a Side Hustle in His Dorm Room With 'a Bunch of Ingredients From Amazon and a Crockpot' — Now It's a $56 Million Brand in Walmarts NationwideDo you have any advice for others interested in starting a side hustle or business of their own?The entrepreneurial journey I've faced over the past quarter-century has been full of triumphant victories and humbling defeats, born from sweat, tears and relentless determination. With my new podcast series and memoir, I look forward to creating and fostering a sense of community through these channels and shining a light on real, raw stories from industry trailblazers on the movements they have built to bring valuable insights and knowledge to those that seek it.Growing Lovesac into what it is has taken my entire adult life and is the hardest thing I've ever done. I have so many memories and have built so many lifelong friends throughout this journey that make all the stumbles, roadblocks, sleepless nights and unrelenting stress worth it. My advice for anyone considering starting down the road of being a founder would be this: Get off the couch! Trust your instincts, and just keep going. That life-changing moment could be right around the corner, and the last thing you want to do is turn back just before you arrive.Entrepreneurship is a never-ending pursuit, but the journey is the gift. With an open mind, an honest heart, some ambition, time, help and a little bit of luck, all things are possible.

101,Enhance Your Website's Visibility and Dominate Your Competition With These Powerful Techniques,"Feb 21, 2024",Jeff Peroutka,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/enhance-your-websites-visibility-and-dominate-your/467866,"
Have you ever found that despite putting hours of effort into your content and link-building initiatives, you still need help to rank for your targeted keywords? It may be time to revisit the topic of search intent.Search intent is one of the most important aspects to consider whenever you're trying to optimize your on-page content, carry out effective link-building, or do anything else related to SEO.Let's take a closer look at search intent's role in SEO and how you can use it for more effective link-building strategies.Related: 5 Simple SEO Methods That Produce Major Traffic for Small BusinessesTypes of search intentGoogle has dominated the search market over the years because it's the best at serving its users the content they're looking for. It's essential to ensure the content you publish is not only related to the keywords you're targeting but also offers a highly relevant solution to the problems searchers are facing. To give you a better idea of how this works in an SEO campaign, let's take a look at the four main types of keyword intent:



Informational intentOne of the most commonly-targeted types of keyword intent, informational search intent, covers keywords used by people looking to answer a question or find a particular piece of information.Keywords with informational intent are often keywords starting with ""how,"" ""why,"" ""what,"" etc. For example, the keyword ""how to start a YouTube channel"" will indicate that the user wants to learn about the process involved in starting a YouTube channel and possibly find some supporting advice on optimizing it for success.Navigational IntentNavigational search intent is used by people who want to go from Google to a specific page on a specific site. An example of a keyword with navigational intent would be ""Entrepreneur login,"" which shows that the searcher wants to log in to their Entrepreneur account.Transactional intentTransactional intent covers keywords that show a user intends to convert with a given business. An example of a transactional intent keyword might include ""buy Acer laptop"" or ""Spotify Premium subscription.""


These can be highly competitive, and performing for these kinds of keywords often requires organic and paid advertising.Commercial IntentCommercial intent keywords fall somewhere between informational and transactional intent keywords. They're generally searched by users who want to learn more about a particular product or service but aren't 100% sure they want to commit to a purchase, as they might be with transactional intent keywords.Commercial intent search terms are often used to find reviews or detailed information about a specific product or to compare different purchase options within a certain category. Common commercial intent keywords can include ""iPhone vs Samsung"" or ""best Smart TVs"".Related: 10 Powerful Link-Building Tactics for Boosting Your Website's SEO


Using search intent in link-buildingAligning content on your site with keyword intent is pretty straightforward, but what about when it comes to planning and executing your link building? Here are a few scenarios where you can use search intent to bolster your link-building efforts.Highly-targeted outreachUnderstanding the informational intent behind given keywords can help you target your outreach for link-building more effectively. This can improve the chances that pitched articles will be accepted by your intended referring site and that the content's relevance to your site will make for a more powerful backlink.Let's say, for example, that you're running an e-commerce site specializing in eco-friendly products. If you are looking for linking opportunities relevant to your target audience, you can search for informational-intent keywords such as ""eco-friendly home products"" or ""sustainable living tips"" and then craft a content pitch around these.With the basic framework of the pitch in place, you can look for potential referring blogs with an audience who will exhibit the same searcher intent and pitch them a highly relevant content idea, for example, ""10 Easy Ways to Make Your Lifestyle More Sustainable."" Aligning your outreach with a specific search intent will help the chances of your pitch being accepted and make it easier to include a natural, relevant link to your campaign's target page.


Related: 6 Key Tips to Level Up Your Content Marketing StrategyBuilding linkable assetsKeyword research can give you a great starting point to build highly linkable content, such as written guides, infographics and online tools, which can be tailored to your audience's needs.If, for example, you're offering digital marketing services through your website, you can research informational or commercial intent keywords such as ""improve online traffic"" or ""digital marketing tools.""From there, you can create highly linkable assets tailored to meet your keywords' intent. These can include written content like ultimate guides, valuable infographics, or, if you're feeling more ambitious, an interactive tool that helps solve an issue alluded to in your target keywords.


Once you have a linkable asset that meets the intent of a keyword directly, it will become much easier to craft a compelling pitch aimed at building quality links to your website and assure referring page webmasters that your content will be helpful to their users.Resource page link-buildingResource pages can be a great source of backlinks if you often produce quality, authoritative content that provides specific pieces of information or solutions to specific problems. Researching keyword intent can help you build content tailored to certain resource pages and maximize the chances that you can earn a link from them.If, for example, you're running a website dedicated to financial planning, you can collate a list of financial advice websites that feature resource pages. From there, you can research keywords with informational intent such as ""guide to financial planning"", develop content relevant to this term, and reach out to the resource sites you've listed to offer your content as a valuable resource for them to link to.With content aligned to search intent related to a given resource page, you'll encounter less resistance in your pitches and be able to accumulate links in a shorter space of time.

No one knows everything. There's no need to pretend that we do. A great leader is honest about their limitations and strengths. Accept that you will fail. Being honest and open about failure is not a weakness.A great leader is not defined by having all the answers but by a willingness to grow and learn, a curiosity that leads to finding the required answers. It is about stopping, refueling, and being the best version of yourself.Think about it. Do you want a team that comes to you for the answers? That has no mind of its own? No creativity? We all know the answer to that. Command and control is a thing of the past and won't cut the muster in today's ever-evolving business landscape, not if you want to be a business of tomorrow.

103,How to Make PR Campaigns Customer-Focused Instead of Company-Focused,"Feb 21, 2024",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-make-your-pr-campaigns-customer-focused/468757,"
When I started out as a marketer of both people and places, I'd learn as much as I could about my clients and then create collateral that presented them in their best possible light — relaying how educated and experienced someone was, broadcasting loud and clear how financially successful a business had been, how they dominated their market share.Nowadays, however, the very floor upon which I built my career and my business has been renovated. Nowadays, the public isn't so interested in hearing about what makes a company better than its competitors; their ears and eyes are more attuned to what the company can do to make their own lives better.In other words, instead of a professional culture of ""me, me, me,"" we're now in a culture of ""you, you, you."" Instead of saying, ""Look at how great our internal operations are,"" corporate voices are telling their buying public, ""We see you. We see your needs. You matter. You matter to us."" This has created some interesting developments in how we conduct business.



Related: Secrets Behind the Most Successful PR CampaignsThe age of the customer-centric marketplaceCustomer-centricity is a perspective that focuses on creating a positive experience for the consumer throughout all stages of your interaction with them. It's a mindset, but it's also a business strategy that informs an organization's decision-making by cultivating a deep understanding of customer needs and then designing deliverables to meet those needs.


Though the model is not particularly new, the ways it's being implemented in the marketplace are quite modern and pervasive, infiltrating all that businesses are advised to do. In ads, don't blow your own horn, offer solutions to your market's problems. In website copy, don't tout your own merits, engage with the customer where they are. In sales decks, make it about the audience, not the presenters.Putting the customer at the center of any type of business transaction has become SOP, both for brand reputation purposes and, of course, for earnings potential, with a white paper by Deloitte positing that ""client-centric companies are 60% more profitable compared to companies not focused on the customer.""Related: 4 Reasons Your PR Campaign Isn't Driving Sales — and How to Fix ThemExamples of customer-centric PRHere are a few ways my own business has embraced and leveraged this new normal.


Example #1: A restaurant. Traditionally, dining establishments pretty much always promoted themselves by sharing their menu, featuring photos of their ambiance, and sending invitations for special events. Since all that can easily be found online now, this client has pivoted to offering more immersive culinary experience to would-be diners — bringing the dining to them instead of vice versa. For instance, we're aggressively promoting the award-winning chef of the restaurant on TV and podcast segments, where he openly shares ""secret family recipes"" with viewers. A swanky new food truck can cater events on customers' premises, and private parties are also offered at the customers' chosen location.We also talked them into a punch card: 5 visits get you a free appetizer or dessert the next time you're in. Rewards programs are in — people like to be acknowledged for their repeat patronage and appreciated for their loyalty.Example #2: A cosmetics company. Instead of this year's marketing budget allocated primarily to photo shoots that spotlight the product line in magazines and digital ads, this customer has adopted the idea of turning the spotlight on the customer — one face at a time. Its newest PR campaign starts with an emailed invitation to take an online survey to win a free makeover. The survey is quite individualized, covering skin type, skin tone, daily facial routines, preferred color palette and so on. Based on replies, appointments are set at a local salon the company is partnering with, where the customer receives a complimentary consultation.No unrelatable supermodels promising unattainable results, no expensive glossy brochures, no hard sell of the merchandise. The crux here is truly personalizing the customer experience, which is key with today's savvy and time-pressed consumer.


Example #3: A pet store. Every pet owner needs to buy food and supplies, right regularly? So they either frequent your store or they don't — usually based on convenience of location and pricing. But what if you offered them more than just products to buy? What if you offered them ""A Vet for a Day,"" an event we scheduled on a Saturday from 9 am to 6 pm? The store paid the vet, but the visitors didn't; each got up to 10 minutes with the veterinarian to ask questions, have their pet looked over and seek advice on concerns about their animal.The goodwill this event generated cannot be overstated. Yes, sales increased and brand-new repeat clients were won, but the important thing to note is the absence of a direct sales pitch here. Rather, the essence of this campaign was identifying a customer pain point and offering a means to ease it.Related: How to Meet Customers At Their Pain PointsGuidelines for a customer-focused campaignWhat do all of these projects have in common?


They all started with in-depth market research that zeroed in on learning about each business's customer base. You can't just assume you know what your customers value; you have to conduct surveys, garner direct input, investigate and really listen to what your market is saying on social platforms, and then monitor the outcomes of initiatives.They put people in front of profits. An impactful customer-centric campaign shows that you genuinely care about your customers instead of showcasing your own superiority or excellence. You're allowed to be the best and encouraged to excel, but in today's climate, forming meaningful and lasting bonds is valued more highly than purely transactional relationships.The goal was to improve the customer experience at every point of contact. The more you can make each interaction customer-centric — whether that's a visit to your website, offering a free download or coming into your place of business and encountering something unexpected and delightful — the more you will stand out in the client's memory and thus sway their consumer habits.Closing thoughtsThere's always going to be a time and place for me to herald my clients' considerable qualifications, accomplishments and impacts. People will always want to be assured that they're in good hands and can place trust in reputable establishments.Nevertheless, there's no denying that today's standard of practice is about making an impression on your customers instead of trying to impress them. Give it a shot. Design a customer-focused campaign (or hire a pro to do it for you) and see where it takes you. Chances are, you'll travel farther than you ever have before!

104,5 Vital Influencer Marketing Metrics You Should Know,"Feb 21, 2024",Dmitrii Khasanov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/5-influencer-marketing-metrics-you-should-know/469035,"
Influencer marketing has been characterized as the fastest-growing form of the modern generation of advertising. The Statista report of last year showed that the influencer marketing industry was worth just $1.7 billion in 2016. It hit $16.4 billion in 2022 and is expected to increase by another $5 billion this year. This exponential growth demonstrates the health of the entire industry.However, when it comes to influencer marketing, there are a series of metrics that a business needs to take into account and track on a regular basis. These essential key performance indicators help brands and companies evaluate the effectiveness of digital campaigns so that they can optimize current working approaches and business processes.Influencer marketing metrics are measurable indicators utilized to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of a campaign, as well as the overall success of collaborations between a brand and a blogger. These metrics include such as follower count, likes, comments, shares, click-through rates, and conversion rates.



Related: Why Influencer Marketing Pays Off for Small BusinessesMonitoring these influencer marketing metrics is vital, as it enables brands to assess the return on investment (ROI) from their influencer partnerships. Additionally, it helps in gauging how well the message resonates with the target audience and refining future strategies to achieve maximum reach and engagement. This, in turn, ensures the efficient allocation of resources and contributes to successful campaign outcomes.


1. Return on investment (known as ROI)ROI serves as the fundamental metric to monitor during influencer marketing campaigns. Essentially, ROI is calculated by dividing the revenue or profit generated from an influencer campaign by its cost.Tracking this metric provides insights into which influencers deliver the highest value for your business. If an influencer's fees surpass the returns, it's prudent to reconsider collaboration with them. Employing unique tracking links for each influencer campaign enables you to distinguish influencers contributing to positive ROI from those who are not, facilitating informed decision-making in your marketing strategies.Related: 12 Ways to Actually Get an ROI Using Influencer Marketing2. Influence engagement rate (IER)IER is determined by the ratio between the number of engagements and the number of followers that influencers had at the time they posted your campaign. A higher IER indicates that your message was more engaging for their specific audience.


Leverage IER to identify influencers with similar high engagement rates. This approach allows you to pinpoint influencers whose audiences are particularly responsive to your content, optimizing your strategy for future collaborations.Related: How Many Followers Do You Need To Make Money on Instagram?3. Cost per engagement (CPE)CPE stands as the second crucial influencer marketing metric, gauging the financial investment required for each audience interaction with your content. It calculates the cost associated with likes, comments, and shares, offering insights into the impact of your investment in terms of generating active audience participation.Beyond that, CPE is a valuable tool for evaluating the effectiveness of specific collaborations, content types, or platforms. By measuring return on investment for engagement-driven goals, brands can make informed decisions regarding budget allocation and content strategy adjustments. This data-driven approach enables the optimization of resources for higher engagement rates, improved audience connection, and, ultimately, the cultivation of more meaningful and profitable relationships with the target demographic.


4. Cost per reach (CPR)CPR is a metric that quantifies the financial cost of reaching a single unique user within your target audience. Unlike mere impressions, CPR takes into account the actual potential touchpoints with individual consumers. This metric provides a more refined perspective on the investment required to connect with specific members of your audience, offering valuable insights into the efficiency of your marketing spending in terms of reaching and engaging your desired demographic.5. Audience growth rateThis rate is another pivotal metric to monitor following the publication of an influencer post. Assuming the influencer's brand aligns with the client's, there is a likelihood of spikes in audience growth corresponding to the influencer's post schedules. Tracking these growth rates provides insights into the impact of influencer collaborations on expanding the client's audience and helps measure the effectiveness of these partnerships in driving brand awareness and attracting new followers.In my opinion, those five metrics are the most important as they show a clear picture of the potential outcome of a campaign. However, there are more indicators that businesses must know and consider valuable sources of insights:Brand awareness.Brand sentiments.Website visitors.Brand mentions.The overall level of online reputation.Once your influencer marketing campaign is underway, it's crucial to closely monitor every share, mention, or reply the influencers receive. Each retweet or shared post about your company signifies resonance with the audience.


Keep in mind that influencer marketing is an ongoing process that requires time and nurturing for results to manifest. By tracking the mentioned metrics, you can identify influencers delivering positive ROI and continually refine your approach for improved results over time.

105,10 Expert Insights for the Optimal (and Most Effective) PR Budget in 2024,"Feb 20, 2024",Alexander Storozhuk,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/10-expert-insights-for-the-optimal-and-most-effective-pr/469174,"
As companies vie for attention in a crowded marketplace, a well-executed public relations (PR) strategy can be the key to building brand awareness, enhancing credibility and fostering positive relationships with stakeholders. The age-old question ""How much should a company spend on PR?"" echoes through boardrooms, with organizations seeking a magic formula for budget allocation.However, determining the optimal budget for PR efforts remains a complex decision, influenced by various factors. In this article, we delve into the considerations that businesses should weigh when allocating resources for PR, backed by tips for securing your budget and steps to ensure your spending is strategic and effective.Related: Mastering Public Relations — A Comprehensive Guide to Boosting Your Brand's Reputation



Considerations for PR budget planning1. Holistic approachFraming your budget necessitates a holistic approach, encompassing content, search engine optimization (SEO), social media and influencer marketing. A survey conducted by Gartner stated that 82% of chief marketing officers (CMO) reprioritized investments in digital channels in 2023, showing that recent shifts in the PR landscape underline the importance of adaptation to new trends.2. Alignment with business goalsThe PR budget should align with the overall business goals and objectives. For instance, a company aiming to launch a new product or enter a new market may need a more substantial PR investment compared to a business focused on maintaining its current market position.


3. Industry norms and benchmarksFor effective PR budget planning, companies must be aware of industry standards, with spending typically ranging between 7% to 12% of revenue. However, recent trends indicate a slight reduction in marketing budgets across most industries. Gartner's 2023 CMO Survey reveals a decrease in marketing budgets from 11% of company revenue in 2020 to 9.1% in 2023, reflecting the changing landscape as brands seek cost-saving measures. Notably, self-service models, marketplaces and technology-driven services are gaining prominence in this evolving scenario.Related: How Employee Advocacy Can Help You Overcome the Challenges of Limited PR Budgets4. Content marketing on top of ROIWhen considering investments in content, understanding its direct impact on business revenue becomes imperative. According to a survey by Search Engine Journal, 49% of marketers claimed that search engines like Google are the digital marketing channel that brings the highest return on investment (ROI).Moreover, content marketing ROI goes beyond mere numbers, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative results. Lead generation, customer loyalty and brand awareness should be factored into the calculation, offering a comprehensive perspective on the effectiveness of content efforts.


Understanding the components of PR budget1. Have a multi-channel presenceEnsuring a comprehensive multi-channel presence is pivotal for expanding audience reach and engagement. PR specialists, alongside the marketing team, share the responsibility of staying tuned to dynamic social media platforms that drive engagement and build credibility. A study by Adobe emphasizes the effectiveness of a strong multi-channel strategy, revealing a significant 10% year-over-year (YoY) growth for companies compared to a 2.8% growth with a less integrated approach.Looking ahead to 2024, Twitter and LinkedIn remain essential platforms for PR professionals, extensively used by media professionals seeking pitches or sources. Simultaneously, maintaining an active blog on your website contributes to enhanced SEO and establishes the brand as a thought leader in the industry. Podcasts, now more than just a trend, position companies as authoritative voices in their sectors. The convenience of on-the-go podcast consumption enhances accessibility, and the versatile format allows for extracting key segments, extending impact across various channels like Instagram Reels and TikTok, amplifying reach and resonance.2. Embrace influencer marketingWith a changing media landscape characterized by a decline in traditional journalism and a surge in influencers, integrating influencer strategies into your brand approach is crucial for successful PR outcomes. Influencers bring authenticity to brand endorsements, as their followers often perceive them as trustworthy individuals.Partnering with influencers ensures adaptability to emerging trends and aligns with budget-conscious goals. A survey by Influencer Marketing Hub reveals a noteworthy ROI, with businesses earning an average of $5.20 for every $1 invested in influencer marketing.

Directing resources toward this goal enables PR campaigns to significantly broaden reach and engagement. The costs involved cover a range of expenses, including networking events, booths, invitations, PR packages, meet-ups, collaborative projects, travel expenses and more.4. Harness the power of AIAs more PR tools integrate artificial intelligence (AI) features, it's mandatory to embrace it to boost your daily workflow. Whether it's streamlining the process of refining pitch strategies or analyzing complex data for insights into the performance of PR campaigns, the integration of artificial intelligence can elevate the engagement and effectiveness of any PR campaign. A 2023 study by PRovoke Media shows that 86% of communication professionals around the world between the ages of 35 to 44 believe that AI has a positive impact on their work.5. Leverage ESG and CSR initiativesCompanies that effectively communicate their initiatives in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) often experience an enhancement in their reputation.


Examples of initiatives:Sustainable practices: Reduce carbon emissions and minimize waste.Foster diverse and inclusive workplaces.Community engagement and social responsibility: Engage with communities through volunteering and address community needs through supporting education, healthcare or other social causes.Moreover, ESG and CSR-focused companies are increasingly attractive to investors. According to a report by McKinsey, sustainable investments are growing 2.5 times faster than traditional investments, indicating a shift in investor preferences toward ESG-conscious businesses.Related: ESG For Entrepreneurs: A Path to Business Success6. Apply media monitoring and social listeningExpand your focus beyond press releases by investing in PR analytics tools for comprehensive campaign tracking. Metrics like media mentions, social media engagement and sentiment analysis offer valuable insights into the effectiveness of your PR initiatives.


Robust monitoring tools are crucial for assessing campaign performance and a proactive shield against potential crises. In today's digital age, where news and information spread rapidly, a delayed reaction can significantly worsen a crisis. Effective monitoring tools empower organizations to address issues promptly, develop a crisis communication plan, take control of the narrative and minimize potential reputational damage.ConclusionIn the past, measuring PR impact has been a challenging task, but with recent technological advancements, the process has become more manageable. Starting this process early can streamline measurement and help companies position themselves for more significant budget allocations.When businesses allocate resources effectively, adapt to emerging trends and practice responsible communication, they increase their brand's visibility and make significant contributions to the ever-changing narrative of corporate communication. The journey towards effective PR spending is as important as the destination, representing a commitment to communication excellence in a constantly evolving realm.

108,Overcome Startup Growth Challenges in 2024 By Utilizing This Valuable Resource,"Feb 19, 2024",Julius Černiauskas,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/this-valuable-resource-can-solve-startup-growth-challenges/468932,"
The startup market peaked in 2021. After that, we had a couple of turbulent years. Even the AI boom, which attracted considerable investments, could not kickstart the markets hit by the banking crisis and unfavorable conditions across industries.The beginning of 2024 brings hope that the venture capital (VC) market will stabilize and the funding will start picking up. This is good news for startups, especially in the tech industry, as new opportunities to grow and raise funds arise. However, those windows of opportunity will not be wide enough to fit everyone, and competition will be fierce. Open-source intelligence (OSINT) might become the difference maker for those startups that will excel at utilizing it.Related: Think Like a Spy: How Open Source Intelligence Can Give You a Competitive Advantage



Challenges and opportunities for startupsIn the heyday of tech startups, the general public and investors were captivated by the visionary, relentless, move-fast-break-things type of CEOs, often dubbed ""genius"" in the media. At least for now, those days are over. The tough economic climate and shortage of available funding call for frugal entrepreneurs who can demonstrate the ability to cut spending and achieve sustainable growth at a lower cost.These startup founders and leaders will be met with both challenges and opportunities, and turning the first into the second without always having the funds for it will require creativity.


One opportunity is provided by the recent wave of layoffs in the tech industry that made far more talent available. However, competition among the tech startups will be fierce for everything this year, including the best talent. Additionally, plenty of well-established legacy companies will be more than happy to accommodate outcasts from Google or Meta.Another disruptive factor is that investors are paying more attention to European startups. For American companies, this means even more competitors for funding. On the other hand, entering the U.S. market is never easy. If firms from elsewhere want to reach U.S. audiences, they will have to invest in understanding them and master digital marketing.Furthermore, navigating the ever-evolving regulatory landscape on both sides of the pond will be challenging. The public and legal scrutiny of the IT sector is on the rise. Fintech is especially under the magnifying glass since one of its latest superstars is now, reportedly, trading canned mackerels in jail. On the one hand, regulation brings legitimacy and fair opportunity. On the other hand, having to deal with legal proceedings and their outcomes can severely curtail innovation.Finally, technological innovation is as rapid as ever. Startups can use this to implement better solutions and introduce fascinating new products. However, new developments can also make their products obsolete before they even go live. Additionally, possibly no one implements new solutions into their ""business"" faster than cybercriminals. And who is a better target than a promising new company with little to no money to spare for cybersecurity?


What is open-source intelligence (OSINT), and how can it help?Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is the gathering of information from publicly available sources to produce actionable insights. In other words, everything openly available, from books and archives to what one freely accesses on the internet, can be analyzed to answer intelligence questions. This resource is vast and potent beyond imagination. Furthermore, it is free to take as long as you have a way to extract and use it.Thus, this free resource can potentially reduce many headaches for frugal entrepreneurs. The following examples demonstrate how OSINT can help startups grow in a challenging market.Market research: You can learn a lot about consumers in particular markets by gathering OSINT on ecommerce — for example, which products sell fastest. Additionally, OSINT provides valuable competitive insights in those markets. For example, you can foretell competitors' plans by their job postings for particular specialists and in specific regions.Identifying opportunities in the labor market: Following labor market events through open web sources can also boost your headhunting activities. In this case, automated monitoring is the way to go. It allows learning about layoffs as soon as they are reported or even rumored.Adjusting marketing and pricing strategies: Digital commerce is extremely dynamic. Both customers and competitors might act and react in unexpected ways. OSINT allows you to gather real-time insights and immediately adjust your own practices. For example, you can change your pricing to offer better deals than your competitors.Navigating risks: OSINT helps you follow cyber attack and threat reports and improve your cybersecurity. Additionally, software tools can be used to keep track of international regulations and constantly check for data leaks that might affect you and your clients.Achieving all this without blowing up the costs will allow some startups to stand out when presenting their case to investors.Related: 3 Reasons You Should Spy on Your Competition


How to get OSINT effectively?The internet is the world's greatest resource for information. Gathering OSINT manually from the internet is possible, but it requires time and personnel to spare. Early-stage startups often have neither. Even if they decide to dedicate some labor hours to sift through websites and report on competitor prices or the newest tech developments, the results cannot be very thorough. Often, they will also come too late to be actionable.Thus, the most effective way to get OSINT is automated web data extraction. Known as web scraping, this method utilizes proxies and sophisticated software tools to instantly collect large volumes of publicly available data. Real-time data acquired on a budget is precisely what companies need to survive and thrive in the still quite turbulent and always fast-moving tech startup market.Related: How Web Scraping Brings Freedom to ResearchThe situation with big data today is sometimes compared with the gold rush of the nineteenth century. Gold was there in the public lands for anyone capable of finding and taking it. Another valuable commodity, data, is likewise there in the public domain, giving everyone an equal opportunity to make use of it.


Unlike gold, however, the same piece of information stays right where it is, even if someone extracts it. Yet, time is still of the essence because, unlike gold, data loses its value over time and can become worthless quickly. Thus, the race to get to the resource first and make the most of it is still on every day. The startups that consistently and effectively utilize OSINT will have a strong advantage when competing for growth opportunities in these times of prudent funding.

109,Most Business Partnerships Fail — 5 Hacks to Make Sure Yours Stays Intact,"Feb 19, 2024",Greg Smith,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-hacks-to-make-sure-your-business-partnerships-stay-intact/469144,"
I've been thinking about the alchemy of impactful partnerships a lot lately: We've been lucky to have some amazing partnership wins over the last decade — and plenty of failures, too. Over time, my team and I have gotten better at screening for partnerships that will be a big win for all involved. But as exciting and full of promise as they can be, jumping into any kind of business arrangement is not something to take lightly.Whether it was in forging a long-standing relationship with a big tech brand or carving out a relatively new opportunity with a renowned creator and journalist, I've always believed partnerships should be designed to deliver tangible value for all parties, and their success needs to be predicated on a robust process to ensure the best outcomes.While data shows partnerships are a good idea for creators and entrepreneurs looking to expand their reach, boost revenues and build brand equity, they're only beneficial if they're defined and approached effectively. And the reality is, many of them fail due to mismatched expectations.



For creators and entrepreneurs, the question of when, how and who to partner with will inevitably come up at some point in their journey. Here's what to consider if you're looking to set up a business partnership that beats the odds.Be proactive about exploring your optionsThere are many different types of partnerships you can enter into, but before you do, take the time to consider which would best suit your business — whether it's a traditional brand sponsorship, a reciprocal swap or a more collaborative endeavor.


And if you haven't been approached by a brand, there's no need to wait for them to come to you. Being proactive about identifying and pursuing opportunities can also yield incredible results. Sometimes it boils down to the right conditions happening at the right time.Take Coastal Drone Academy, a creator business that saw the chance to expand its reach when drone operators faced new regulations and certification requirements. They partnered with Best Buy to package their intro course with every drone sold. The creator business benefited from the retailer's extensive customer base and its significant brand association. Meanwhile, Best Buy was able to provide a true value-add to its drone sales.Go in with eyes, mind and heart wide openKnowing exactly what you're getting into is important to your partnership's success. But so is keeping an open mind — and heart. I realize that might sound a bit corny, but partnerships, like any relationship, are built on trust above all else. Here are some helpful ways to approach partnership-building with that in mind:First, aim to understand what your potential partner really needs Most entrepreneurs go into partnership pitches by putting their own desires first. I believe this is backward. For partnerships to work, they need to benefit both parties, and the best way to ensure that is to truly understand what your partner needs. Do your research and avoid making assumptions about others' intentions. You can build trust with a potential partner — and a more creative and powerful partnership idea — by going in with an open mind and by considering all the possibilities. You might even uncover an idea you didn't know was possible.Give more than you get Not every partnership has to be 50/50 — or even weighted in your favor. Of course, at some point, you'll want to ensure your needs are met, but that doesn't necessarily have to happen right away. It can be a good idea to give more than you get in a partnership — at least initially — even if you're only getting 20% of the value. Approaching it with generosity can open the door to trust, which can ultimately pay off in the long run.Get to know all the stakeholdersWhile you might be dealing with a marketing or sales team, be sure to find out about all the players involved as the partnership unfolds. This could include tech support people and developers, and especially senior management or department heads who may have final sign-off. Involving all of them in the early negotiations can help everyone get on the same page about the process and expectations. It also gives you other people to reach out to if something goes wrong or you don't hear back from your primary contact.Understand what you can control (and what you can't)Sharing your business with another party opens you up to the unexpected — and to situations you can't always control. Be realistic about your abilities and expectations, and don't be surprised if the process takes longer than planned or even if they walk away. Simply put: Don't bet your whole business on a single partnership. Plan for the best, but know that it might not work out that way.Bake in measurement and evaluationSo many creators get into partnerships that don't ever deliver. Quantifying your expectations upfront gives you the ability to measure success and to check in regularly on progress. If the needle isn't moving at all, then you can decide how best to act. Better yet, put a clause in your contract that makes partnership reviews automatic and renewals contingent upon hitting certain milestones.Bonus consideration:


Is the risk asymmetrical?Take a hint from Jeff Bezos on how you evaluate risk. Is it asymmetrical — meaning is either the potential return or potential downside risk significantly greater than the other? For example, an amazing potential return with limited losses, if it fails, should be an easier partnership to commit to than one where the downside could be far worse than any potential gain. Sometimes you can mitigate risks in the partnership agreement too, but it starts with understanding both the best and worst-case scenarios. Avoid the natural bias to look only at the upside and ignore the downside.Regardless of how you structure and approach your partnership, the benefits will go beyond the metrics you set for exposure and sales. A collab can become a forcing factor around time and motivation, kicking you into high gear with deadlines and deliverables that might feel less urgent when you're working solo.But keep in mind, while it might be tempting to jump into the first partnership offer that comes your way, I'd caution against it — even if it matches your core business values or content. My biggest advice is to do a gut check before you sign on the dotted line. Or ideally much earlier in the process. Does the partnership feel right to you? Are you inclined to give as much (or more) as you'll receive? Do the benefits outweigh the risks? Depending on the answers to these questions, remember there's no obligation to proceed. Just like choosing a life partner, finding the right business partner can take time. Being rigorous right upfront can be a great way to get your feet wet before jumping into the deep end.
