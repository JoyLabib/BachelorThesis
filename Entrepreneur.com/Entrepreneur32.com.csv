Stefan Gehrig's side hustle was doing well — and that became a dilemma.The Melbourne, Australia-based entrepreneur had started a gym bag brand called Knkg, also known as King Kong Apparel, in 2011. It began as a side hustle that scratched an entrepreneurial itch untouched by his academic day job, then grew into his full-time business. But by 2021, he'd hit a wall: To scale up, he needed resources that he didn't have.Meanwhile, in Miami, investor and former PayPal executive Keith Rabois had just helped found a startup called OpenStore, which acquires Shopify stores with growth potential. Gehrig heard about OpenStore, but wasn't interested in selling Knkg. Then, in 2023, the startup launched another offering called OpenStore Drive, which lets Shopify owners retain ownership while handing off operations to OpenStore. That interested Gehrig a lot more.

Everyone knows the exasperation of unnecessary friction.We've all navigated systems that create maddening ordeals rather than give us simple answers, services, or refunds. We've sat through endless meetings with blabbermouths and ill-defined agendas. We've pulled our hair out over rules, procedures, traditions, and technologies that once made sense, but are now antiquated, pointless, and inefficient. These are all soul-crushing forms of organizational friction that make it difficult to do simple things. And as professors at Stanford's School of Engineering and Graduate School of Business, we spent the last seven years researching the causes and cures for these problems.But one of our biggest discoveries surprised us. It turns out that friction isn't always a problem. In fact, sometimes it can be a solution.

4,Long Work Hours Lead to Burnout — Not Productivity. Learn When to Step Back From Certain Tasks — And When to Step Up,"Apr 3, 2024",Evgeny Kireev,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/know-when-to-take-a-step-back-from-certain-tasks-and/470248,"
As an investor and entrepreneur with a number of business activities, I love what I do, but sometimes I wonder if I'm working too much. Entrepreneurs don't work office hours with guaranteed weekend downtime to relax and recharge with family and friends.Entrepreneurial fatigue is a reality for many of us, even if we don't recognize it or are reluctant to admit it, and being passionate about what you do as an entrepreneur means you never really switch off from work mode. But sometimes less really means more. So why should we learn to let go of the so-called work ""hustle culture,"" and what steps should we take to prevent it? Here are some lessons and strategies I have learned while navigating this harmful lifestyle.Related: How to Disrupt Hustle Culture and Build a Business That Supports Your Wellness



Doing too much gets in the way of your long-term growthA company that tries to do too much by way of products or services usually ends up doing none of them with excellence. Resources are spread too thin, goals become confused, and the results are often mediocre rather than outstanding.This holds true not only at a company level but also as an individual. Culturally, we have standardized the idea that being busy equates to being successful, and a jam-packed daily schedule creates the perception that our work must be important and that our time has great market value.


This emphasis on quantity over quality really has nothing to do with the actual work done or our engagement in it. In fact, the more commitments we have, the less we engage and the more stressed we become, with negative consequences at work and at home. Being busy doesn't mean being productive – truthfully, it can have the opposite effect.Why you need balanceAs entrepreneurs, we often find it difficult to maintain a good work-life balance, dedicating the appropriate time and space to our own emotional and spiritual well-being. Business owners with commitments to investors, clients and teams frequently fear that everything they have set in motion will simply grind to a halt without their constant input.You really can't do everything, and it's essential to learn to let go – hard as it may be. Ask yourself some critical questions and find honest answers about what you can let go, what you can delegate, and who can assist so that you are not overstretched.It's easy to convince yourself that you don't have time for hobbies, rest and self-care when, in fact, the truth is you haven't made them a priority. Do regular exercise, eat well and get adequate quality sleep — these will all reduce stress levels, improve creativity and ultimately benefit your business activities. It's okay to prioritize your health; it's essential for your long-term success.


Set up a routine that prioritizes ""me-time"" as much as other people's needs and to-do lists. Establish boundaries with partners, clients, and teams—let them know, and then stick to those limits without feeling guilty. Remember that experiences bring more happiness than possessions, so set goals of quality time and memorable moments with family and friends alongside your professional goals for your business.While I am passionate about game-changing, industry-disrupting, innovative enterprises, there may be such a thing as too much entrepreneurship. After all, anything in excess becomes a poison, and the startup phenomenon has certainly reached a fever pitch.Related: Hustle Culture Is Dying — And It Should Be. Here's How to Start Working Less.Prioritize important tasks based on their level of urgency and importanceThe hustle and the grind are modern concepts that promise success in return for hard work, long hours, and unwavering determination in a society that is more brutally competitive and intense than ever before. While there may be a million things to do in a new startup, many of them are unnecessary and fundamentally a waste of time.


If you want to win the game as an entrepreneur, you need to focus on the few activities that are truly essential—the ones that actually grow and prosper your business—while finding other solutions for administrative tasks, unnecessary calls and meetings, and ""busywork"" activities.Don't lose sight of your most important assetSurveys have shown that business owners spend, on average, 40% of their working time on activities that don't actually contribute to making their business grow bigger and better. If you want to be an effective entrepreneur, differentiate between spending time on your business and spending time in it. Focus on the former, the strategic work that actually builds your business, and get someone else to do the rest.Many entrepreneurs, particularly first-timers, also make the huge mistake of spending too much time chasing funding. Remember that your business is your customers, not your investors, so don't let fundraising take priority over developing and selling products and building relationships with customers. As an investor myself, I look for people who are good at selling a product or service — not good at selling me a business idea.Do what you do best and do what you love, because excellence in your areas of expertise generates what psychologists call ""achievement motivation"", and this is a predictor of success in business. Focus on what empowers you and avoid what discourages you. Don't listen to everyone — this can be tiring and confusing — but always listen to your customers. They are one of your most valuable business assets, they've experienced what you offer, and they know an aspect of your business that you need to understand as fully as possible.


Your vision is your destination, and strategy is the adaptable route that will get you there. Be flexible and change your strategy as you acquire new information, but keep your vision firm and don't let it be altered by distractions along the way.Silence the noise to achieve successWhile there are huge benefits to being able to work anywhere and anytime, it can also mean we unintentionally end up working everywhere, and all the time with a plate that's so full we risk burnout. Focus is a core factor of success, so focus on what aligns with your goals while learning to say ""no"" to things that aren't critical to achieving those goals.This is not being negative; it's being strategic.

Want to start, fund, and sell a major company? Spencer Rascoff has some advice on that — because he's seen it from all sides.As a founder, he first cofounded the travel-booking site Hotwire, which he sold to Expedia. He then cofounded Zillow, which helped reshape nothing smaller than the real-estate market, and served as its CEO for nearly a decade. Now he's a serial board member, an investor (including as general partner at the venture fund 75 & Sunny), and a continual startup founder — including building social platforms for sharing intel on food (Recon Food, which he started with his teenage daughter) or what's best to binge-watch (Queue), saving creatives from the endless emails they face as they chase down business leads (heyLibby.ai), and simplifying the market for co-owning a second home (Pacaso).Related: How to Tap Into Innovation, the Most Essential Part of Your Entrepreneurial Journey

6,The Truth About Being in Business With Your Spouse — How to Navigate Work and Life Together,"Apr 1, 2024",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-run-a-business-with-your-spouse-and-remain-happily/470498,"
It's a story as old as time. Two people marry. They decide to go into business together because, hey, why not? They're already each other's best friend, trust the other implicitly and presumably share the same professional goals for their future.Given how relatively common marital mergers are, much has already been written on the topic: some call it a science more than an art; some deem it magic, and many married co-owners have shared tips and tidbits about this particular life situation.So I'm not sure I'll have much new to add to the discussion. All I can say is that every married couple is different. So maybe my own personal perspective will be of interest to other romantic partners making a go of a business partnership right here, right now, at this unique point in history: in post-pandemic America at the first-quarter mark of the 21st century, in a largely WFH workplace.



Advantages and disadvantages of a spouse-run businessMy husband and I have learned a lot about balancing (more like juggling) our various roles as parents, romantic partners and business partners as we live atop a mountain together day in and day out in Upstate New York. We share five kids, a mortgage payment, too many college funds than I care to count, even more to-do and task lists, and in-laws flowing in and out of our lives like waves on the beach.Sometimes, it all gets a little overwhelming, and that's when the disadvantages of our arrangement reveal themselves, such as:


Getting on each other's last nerve because we're the only one there to annoy the otherAs a result, undeservedly taking our frustrations out on each other, again because of the proximity factorLetting ""work talk"" creep, even seep, into our after-hours discussions too much and too oftenNot having an outside, objective business partner to bounce ideas off of or counter our arguments when we need counteringNot having separate ""work families"" to hang with during the day, separate from our ""home families"" we return to when the workday is doneThe power struggle that can sometimes arise when one partner dominates a little more than the other in certain areasBoth being dependent on the same source of incomeBut mostly, we've established a nice give-and-take equilibrium that we maintain with fairness and mutual respect. On our good days, the advantages of a spousal business partnership are most apparent, including:We've totally got each other's backs — there's no one we rely on and trust more, and so there's no one to whom we'd rather entrust the fate of our business.Heightened empathy: we share our joys and sorrows together, really share them — not just commiserate with each other over the dinner table — because they happened to both of us.We equally hold responsibility for your wins and losses, which makes for a more equal partnership.It's much easier to coordinate busy schedules and endless family chores when we're splitting them up together in real-time, based on who's more available that day to take care of the home while the other is mired in work.All business finances and decisions are fully transparent and accessible to the other.Every day, all the time, we're working toward the same end goal — we do not have competing interests or priorities.We didn't just wake up one morning and get to this happy place. Over a number of years, we've had to negotiate many points of contention and iron out many wrinkles. Here's what we've come up with as ""5 Rules of the House"" that make our partnership hum and our business thrive.Rule #1: Formally schedule work timeIf you don't erect firm time boundaries, you will never truly get away from the office and into your personal relationship space. Sometimes, you can combine the two, being both a couple spending time together and business partners using that time productively. For example, at least once a week, my husband and I will schedule a 20-minute walk during which we hold hands and enjoy the outdoors, but we also agree to go over work issues.Rule #2: Work in separate spacesThis is really important — you each need your own space to talk freely, organize things the way you want them, play music or insist on silence, remain immovable at the desk for hours or pace the floor nonstop. My husband and I don't just work in separate offices; we work on separate floors! Although I realize not everyone has the square footage for two individual offices, you can devise a configuration of two distinct workstations in separate areas of your overall workspace. In my opinion, you have to. It's the best way to work together, but not in a stifling way.


Rule #3: Plan date nights and date daysYou must have couple time, not just co-partner time. I cannot stress this enough. Before my husband and I agreed to designate time on the calendar just for us, not our business at all, the business was all-consuming and overpowering, threatening to destabilize our union. We were forced to wrestle back control over our daily planners. Don't let things get to that point: set aside time to be a couple from the start.Rule #4: Accept that you will disagree, but do so in privateBecause Mom and Dad are always work partners, even at the soccer game or camping with the family, your children are bound to overhear some of your shop talk. Inevitable as that may be, you must strive mightily not to argue about work in front of the kids. They will feel the tension and sense the discord that has nothing to do with the two of you as a couple and everything to do with you as coworkers. When we need a facilitator or referee, we bring in our business manager to mediate. Do not use your children or other family members as sounding boards for your own sides of an argument.Rule #5: Divide and conquerAs mentioned above, when you're right there with each other all day, it makes it much easier to determine who's more accessible at that moment to go pick up the kids, to run this one to play practice or to pick up tomatoes for tonight's salad. My husband and I don't keep a formal tally sheet, but we have a very good sense of when one of us is picking up more of the slack, and we make a concerted effort to even things out in the long run.We don't resent the other for being able to leave the office when we're stuck on an endless conference call because they're leaving the office to take care of something for our joint life. Everyone wins when we divvy up the duties as housemates and officemates.


Running a business with the person you're closest to in the world isn't for everyone. If you need a lot of alone time, if you're more of a solo act than a team player and if the two of you just jibe better when you spend some time apart each day, I wouldn't advise it.But for couples who are comfortable with each other's work styles, who work in the same industry and bring separate but equally valuable skill sets to the enterprise, it's a wonderful option to go through life together feeling even more connected and conjoined. Not only can you navigate the challenges, but you will — because you're in it together, every single step of the way.

9,The 3 Trusted Advisors Every Business Needs,"Mar 29, 2024",Frederick Royall III,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/3-advisors-every-business-owner-needs/471580,"
Entrepreneurs feel enormous pressure to meet ambitious goals and deliver for their customers, employees, investors and other stakeholders. The good news is that you don't have to go it alone.It's imperative to have a robust and strategically placed network of trusted partners, experts and advisors to lean on as you navigate challenges and reach new milestones. While there are numerous examples of external experts that business owners can benefit from and learn from, three stand out in my experience.1. A bankerBankers are at the center of the business ecosystem and are well-positioned to provide strategic guidance, facilitate connections and suggest comprehensive solutions to help you achieve your goals.



Over time, a banker could help provide:Expertise in capital structures and solutions: Your banker should be your go-to resource for assessing and optimizing your capital structure. They can provide deep knowledge on the types of solutions available to you — from something as simple as a line of credit to more complex offerings around debt and equity and tapping into the public and private markets. As you get up and running, you must establish a plan for managing cash flow and liquidity. They can help. Critically, a banker can also offer guidance on the best financial solutions to meet your operating needs today and achieve your long-term goals in the years to come.Strategic direction and guidance: Beyond traditional financial matters, a banker can provide insight into your overarching business strategy and help with goal setting. This may include reviewing your long-term plan, talking through your product set to determine if there are any gaps, and helping you consider domestic and global expansion.Expert network connections: Stemming from those strategic decisions, bankers can make introductions to essential partners, investors, and other industry experts to help you identify your next ample opportunity. In practice, this vital network can help guide you as you seek advice on more dynamic financial situations like navigating the supply chain, raising capital, entering new markets, structuring a governing board, implementing DEI practices, and so much more.In short, your banker should help you open doors and see around corners. They can help you tackle tough issues and solve pressing challenges and will be there to support you in the moments that matter.


Related: If You Want Your Clients to Truly Value You, You Need to Be Their Trusted Advisor. Here's How.2. An attorneyLike a banker, an attorney can advise your strategy and growth plans through a different but equally important lens. In my experience, in addition to legal counsel, attorneys bring exceptional industry knowledge and sound judgment and challenge you to think critically about your business.An attorney will focus on defining your business structure and can weigh in on the following:Contracts and agreements: Assistance crafting and negotiating documents such as contracts and non-disclosure agreements.Protecting what's yours: This includes protecting your intellectual property through patents, trademark registration and copyright protection.Implementing risk mitigation strategies: Identifying and navigating relevant laws, industry rules and regulations.Providing strategic counsel: Navigating complex legal landscapes, anticipating specific potential challenges and helping to safeguard your interests while promoting the long-term visibility of your business.When choosing an attorney, consider someone who specializes in your industry and the relevant area of law, has experience with your specific legal needs and has guided businesses through various growth stages. If you get it right, your attorney could bring a unique perspective to your company and pose questions you might not have considered.

They have a fiduciary responsibility to ensure the reporting, accounting and controls around your financial statement are reliable, timely and accurate. They can also provide significant value by implementing processes to prepare your business for key milestones.Working closely with the banking team, accountants can help:Simplify statements: An accountant will prepare and review statements to ensure accuracy and provide a clear overview of your business's financial health. They might conduct internal audits to ensure efficient financial processes or external audits for larger enterprises seeking outside funding.Maintain financial compliance: An accountant will work with you to ensure that your financial records are up to date, including tracking income, expenses and other financial transactions.Optimize administrative processes: Your internal accounting team will likely be responsible for all forms of process management, including, but not limited to, financial planning and forecasting, employee benefits, real estate and facilities, and physical and operational security. Engaging an external accountant can provide expertise around these tasks and help streamline processes and workflow.Related: 5 Tips for Finding a Great Advisor for Your Startup


A strong team for the long-termThroughout your entrepreneurial career, you will lean on and learn from many different experts. These three are just the beginning. Be methodical and diligent when searching for your trusted advisors, and don't be afraid to tap your network for referrals, seek out individuals at industry conferences, or reach out to other business owners whom you admire.Each person on your team should play an integral role, and the success of your business depends on your ability to fully trust them and their unique expertise. It takes time to build a team of trusted advisors, but if done right, I'm certain that this investment will pay dividends in the long term.

10,4 Actions Start-Up Founders Need to Take (But Often Overlook) to Protect Their Business,"Mar 29, 2024",Kalon Gutierrez,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/protective-guardrails-start-up-founders-need-to-protect/470694,"
Antitrust can be defined as ""a kind of law or rule that protects fairness and competition in business."" On a company basis, issues concerning antitrust are often brought to the forefront during one-off events, such as a merger, acquisition or public offering. However, violations can also occur over a period of time as a pattern of ongoing behavior.To an early-stage start-up, the subject of antitrust may seem like a far-off topic. The notion of preparing for a legal acquisition or not unfairly infringing upon your competition can appear to be ages away, especially as immediate issues like fundraising, market launch and cash burn take precedence. Survival-related endeavors are naturally prioritized.Yet, the reality is that ignoring antitrust efforts at the start can prove detrimental to growth companies down the road when the stakes are much bigger. And in fact, overlooked antitrust issues often reveal critical gaps in the business plan itself. Future violations have been rooted in decisions that were made (or not made) early on and continued over a period of time. When they do come to the forefront, their preventable consequences can exponentially limit a company's ultimate success.



Related: The Legal Lowdown of Starting a New Business: A Startup Lawyer ExplainsWhile early-stage companies remain capacity-challenged, there are critical and manageable practices that can be undertaken in order to reduce the potential for catastrophic violations down the road. There are four key actions that early-stage founders need to take to address antitrust that both help refine a company's goals and vision while also establishing often overlooked guardrails that protect the business long-term. To illustrate more directly, let's use a case study of an entrepreneur who has built a company that creates and sells ""self-cooking hotdogs"":


Imagine an entrepreneur invented a hot dog that perfectly cooked itself at the precise time the customer wants to eat it. No grill or cooking equipment is required; rather, just one push of the button and three minutes later, it is perfectly cooked. Here are the steps this entrepreneur should consider regarding antitrust:1. Determine your core competitive advantageThis is something that your company can do that very few (or no one else) can easily replicate. For the hot dog entrepreneur, this would be the technology associated with the self-cooking capability, for which the entrepreneur should consider applying for intellectual property (e.g., a patent) before it is in market. Any attempt by an existing hot dog maker to replicate this technology would either prove difficult or could cannibalize their existing ""regular hot dog"" sales.2. Highlight how your competitive advantage helps customersIn antitrust, competitive advantages that result in consumer benefits (e.g., price, convenience, quality) are favored and encouraged by the law. On the other hand, competitive advantages that give a business a leg up over competitors but either do not help or harm consumers are where problems can arise. For our hot dog entrepreneur, the core innovation saves consumers' time, money (on power), and potentially the embarrassment of not knowing how to cook a hot dog. Clearly and consistently articulating these benefits across all aspects of branding can help the entrepreneur on both business/marketing and antitrust fronts.3. Execute a plan to overcome the market leaderOne of the most common pitfalls for startups is that the current leader in their respective space has a reputational or other sustainable advantage that it has built up over time that prevents the entrepreneur from gaining significant traction. For example, customers may be prone to the ""if it isn't broken, don't fix it"" analogy. For our innovative hot dog, a primary constraint may be that the cooking process itself provides enjoyment for customers, or there is a natural skepticism to buying a new product to eat from a company that no one has heard of before. To overcome these barriers, the hot dog entrepreneur may need to do a ""blind taste test"" campaign or perhaps partner with another company that is known to offer products used for BBQing. Over time, once the new product gains more mainstream acceptance, it will be easier to gain market share (and perhaps funding) at a rapid pace.

Determine the social benefit associated with successAs a larger proportion of the consuming public is associated with younger generations, a common success tactic has been to convey that your company is not just out to make a buck but rather to improve a global societal issue. The hot dog entrepreneur may focus on the fact that its innovation will reduce expensive and/or harmful forms of heating energy. Or food products can be donated to needy populations who do not have access to heating mechanisms.A focus on antitrust advances all of these efforts, and when successfully implemented, they provide natural and compelling defenses to future issues. Addressing them early on not only guards against future risk, but also better defines a company's competitive advantage today, thereby positioning it more strongly for both short-term and long-term success. While guised as a risk-averted practice, addressing antitrust can actually prove to be a key determinant to paving the roadmap for successful and lasting company growth.

12,From $0 to $10 Million — Here's How to Build a Winning Prop Trading Team,"Mar 15, 2024",Blake Olson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-build-a-winning-prop-trading-team/470675,"
Some issues in prop trading are the same as those faced in any niche, but some are unique to this constantly evolving segment. When I look at the structure, staff and technology from 12 months ago, my company is almost unrecognizable.Without the right mindset, keeping a handle on growth can be a bit like juggling chainsaws.The pivotal role of technologyTechnology is the lifeblood of the trading industry. By definition, our business only exists online. The rapid evolution of tools and platforms can dramatically alter the landscape overnight. We've seen this firsthand.



Leaders in this sector must exhibit an exceptional degree of technological savvy and an ""anticipatory"" vision to foresee and adapt to these changes. The adoption of new technologies forces a culture of continuous learning and innovation within the team. There is no such thing as the status quo!Team members who are slow to pursue ongoing education, experiment with new tools and dedicate time to strategic thinking don't last long. The desire to adapt is required for growth and competitive advantage.


Related: Earn Through a Recession by Learning Stock Trading StrategiesHarnessing diversityThe global nature of trading today means teams contain a variety of cultural and professional backgrounds. Our current team is spread over five different countries. This diversity, while a tremendous asset, also presents unique leadership challenges.Effective leaders must promote a cohesive team environment where every member feels valued and understood regardless of background and location. Solutions to lessen the ""artificial isolation"" team members from other parts of the world can experience are essential. This involves using technology to facilitate communication across different time zones, fostering an inclusive culture and seeing it as a strength rather than an obstacle.One example is having occasional video conferences that are not business-specific. They allow time for team members to speak freely about their lives, making a connection that business-only video calls don't allow for. You'd be amazed at the personal details that have come out of these calls. Everyone enjoys these moments. (And yes, everyone's camera must be on!)


Invariably, we see innovation and closer collaboration as a welcome result.Balancing the dynamics of contractors and full-time employeesProp trading is no different than every other company out there. Our team faces the ""contractors and full-time employees"" issue. We all know companies that failed to handle this properly and paid dearly.This mix can enrich the team with flexibility and specialized skills. Still, it also requires careful management to ensure everyone is on the same page and working steadily toward the company's goals.During a growth phase, when certain roles expand while others vanish, it's vital to constantly ask the question, ""Is this best handled internally, or will we outgrow this need in 6 months?""


Leaders must integrate these contributors, ensure clear communication and set firm expectations. Verbalizing clear expectations saves a lot of headaches. This issue mirrors the geographic challenge just mentioned. Promoting an environment where contracts feel ""vested"" in the company vision.There's another concept in play here. The principle of ""fire fast, hire slow"". I don't mean this in a purely ruthless sense. But having the readiness to make tough decisions is a spark for growth.Ensure that every member's presence is not just warranted but beneficial for the collective goal. Again, this philosophy is not rooted in a lack of compassion but in a commitment to excellence and the team's long-term success.Upholding integrity as a core valuesThe temptation for quick gains in the prop industry can lead to ethical quandaries with clients and business entities alike. Integrity is non-negotiable.


Bad actors exist in every niche. Unfortunately, prop trading is not immune from this. This makes it even more important for leaders to adhere to the highest ethical standards themselves and to instill these values in their teams.This involves creating a culture where ethical behavior is recognized and rewarded and where team members feel comfortable voicing concerns. Customer service sees different behaviors from clients than the tech team on the back end.As a rule, whenever cash changes hands or profits are on the line, someone will create a way to skirt the rules. By prioritizing integrity, leaders build a team that not only achieves success but also does so respectfully and legally. And in line with the company's long-term vision.Adapting team composition for future challengesThe skill sets and mindsets that contributed to initial successes may not indicate future success. Leaders must be vigilant in assessing the team's capabilities and ready to make adjustments as needed.


This might involve seeking out new talents with specific expertise or redefining roles within the team to better align with strategic goals. The same talent pool that gets a company $0 to $1 million in annual revenue is unlikely to be the one in place from $10 million to $50 million. Spotting ""talent bottlenecks"" is an acquired skill. But it is very necessary.Related: Learn Candlestick Trading: This E-learning Bundle Is $25 This Week OnlyThe art of leading a trading team to successLeading any team to success is an art that requires a blend of strategic foresight, technological proficiency and evolving interpersonal skills.Short version: If I had to pick a trait that pinpoints someone likely to stick with you through growth and challenge, I'd likely go with a desire for continuous learning.


By embracing these principles, leaders can build resilient, adaptable teams capable of sustained growth and even friendship. The journey is demanding, but I've found the rewards of cultivating a high-performing, ethically grounded team immeasurable.

14,Don't Leave Money on the Table — How to Find Out If You're Underpricing Your Products (and What to Do About It),"Mar 9, 2024",Itai Sadan,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/are-you-underpricing-your-products-heres-how-to-find-out/468841,"
Do your customers know what your products are worth? That may seem like a bizarre question at first, but in reality, many businesses routinely fail to convey the actual value of their products. Unsurprisingly, this miscommunication is seldom in a business's favor.More than 20 years ago, experts at McKinsey & Company found that between 80% and 90% of mispriced products are priced too low — and that remains true today. That's potential revenue lost right out of the gate, and more than you might think. A 1% increase in price without a change in the volume of products sold equates to an 11.1% increase in operating profits, according to this comprehensive study by Harvard Business Review published in 1992 and still widely cited today.Related: 10 Questions to Ask When Pricing Your Product



Where does value go?Your products and services inherently create a certain amount of value for your customers. We'll call this the ""actual value."" In the ideal world, everything you sell would be priced based on the actual value. However, we don't live in the ideal world. Actual value is monstrously difficult to calculate and can fluctuate per customer.Not all of your customers will be able to see, or frankly even benefit from, the total potential of any given product. Smartwatches, for example, can track hundreds of unique exercises, but if all you do is run, then the value of those additional features would be difficult to see. Marketing has an impact as well. Sticking with the smartwatch example, if you fail to effectively communicate a useful feature — leaving your potential customers unaware — then that can have a negative impact on this ""perceived value.""


Now, your customers may agree that your product produces a certain amount of value for them, but that doesn't mean they're willing to pay for it. Dozens of factors can impact how much a particular customer is willing to pay: urgency, income, brand loyalty, advertising, social impact, etc. Finding this number is tricky, yet highly rewarding. If you can identify the maximum amount your customers are willing to pay, you can maximize your profits while capturing as much value as possible.Many companies are unable to determine exactly how much their customers are willing to pay. What that means is that the price your customers typically expect to pay is instead the ""target price."" This is the value that you and your team hopefully determined is as close to the actual willingness-to-pay value as possible.Finally, if you work in a sales-heavy field you may find additional value being lost to concessions and discounts. In this situation, the final price paid would be known as the ""realized price."" How much value was lost between all of these steps? Many think quite a bit. Bain and Company found after interviewing dozens of CEOs, CMOs and other executives at more than 1,700 companies that roughly 85% of those who responded believed they could be doing a better job making pricing decisions.How can I capture more value?Let's begin by trying to understand how much our customers are actually willing to pay for our products or services. We can do this by surveying our customers, assembling focus groups, experimenting with pricing or even hosting an auction.


If we're not happy with how much our customers are willing to pay, we may need to take a step back and instead focus on their perceived value of your product or service. When we help our customers see more value through activities like branding, outreach and communication we directly increase how much they're willing to pay.Alternatively, we can choose to adopt a different pricing structure entirely. More and more service-based businesses are looking towards metric-based pricing to offer an adaptive structure that better aligns with the perceived value of each unique customer. Some examples of metric-based pricing are usage-based like gym punch passes and cellular minutes, or user-based pricing, which is a popular choice in the SaaS realm. There are great examples of metric-based pricing all around us. Mechanics often charge per hour while bowling alleys frequently charge per game. These metrics work because they're reasonable, predictable and fair.Related: How to Get the Price Your Product or Service DeservesDon't miss out on potential profitLet's look at the math together. Imagine with me for a moment that you own a coffee shop selling lattes for $5 each. These lattes cost you $1 to make, earning you $4 in profit. If you sold 100 lattes, unsurprisingly you would make $400 in profit.


However, unbeknownst to you, your customers are willing to pay $7 for that same latte. That's a more generous $6 in profit, netting you an additional $200 per 100 lattes sold — a 150% increase. In fact, even if you wound up selling fewer lattes — let's say 90 instead of 100, that's still a 135% increase in profits.In short, don't leave any money lying on the table. If your customers are willing to pay more, now is the time to find out.

With people spending so much time on social media and the internet, consumers see more brands than ever, which means they also have a more finely tuned awareness of aesthetics and brand idententies. In a 2023 survey, market research firm Hanover found that 75% percent of companies have overhauled their visual identities since 2020, and Lucidpress found that 45% of customers ""expect great design across marketing and sales collateral."" In other words, an outdated aesethetic costs you money. At the same time, no company can afford to revamp their design every few years, so it's important to find a look that stands out, and stands the test of time. Here, we talked to six brands on how they found a look that sparkles while conveying their core values.Image Credit: Courtesy of Methodology

16,Do You Have What It Takes To Be An Entrepreneur? These Values and Behaviors Are Your Guide,"Mar 7, 2024",Tom Lewis,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/the-values-that-all-successful-entrepreneurs-should-have/468839,"
Entrepreneurship is getting a lot of love these days and for a good reason. The speed of change is occurring at such a pace that old ways are quickly becoming obsolete, creating new opportunities in every sector for those with ambition, skills, and the necessary personal characteristics for entrepreneurial success.Many people dream of starting their own businesses, but take it from me; it's not easy. It took me eighteen years to prepare so that I could be successful. Individuals who can start large companies (over $50 million per year in sales) are rare, but if you have the drive, you are halfway there. The other half is preparing yourself to succeed.We all know that entrepreneurs need to understand the customer, possess basic business skills and communicate their vision. However, little is said about the basic characteristics that highly correlate with successful entrepreneurs. Much of the popular literature on the subject focuses on teamwork, passion, creativity, and other soft skills. Still, a lot of hard behavioral evidence shows that the most successful entrepreneurs have a predictable pattern of behaviors and values that has little correlation to ""teamwork"" and ""passion.""



There are many behavioral models for successful entrepreneurs. Based on my experience, I have learned that the most important features of a successful entrepreneur are three specific behavioral traits and three motivating values.Related: 5 Qualities Of Successful Entrepreneurs


The behavioral traits needed are that you should be assertive (you are both dominant and persuasive and are driven to solve problems and overcome obstacles), fast-paced (you like a lot of action and change), and persistent (you are resilient, won't quit, and love the grind).The three motivating values are that you should be utilitarian (you value efficiency and return on investment, don't like to waste anything, and are motivated by economics), individualistic (you see yourself as a person who makes things happen, are constantly improving, like to compete and win and are motivated by recognition), and theoretical (you are motivated by knowledge and love to learn new things).Although these traits can correlate to entrepreneurial success, many intangible qualities of the human spirit are not measurable and can make a huge difference. Ultimately, all entrepreneurs have to work hard, initiate, take risks, and be very good at what they do. They will be rewarded directly for the value they bring to their customers — just ask Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg.Entrepreneurship also requires some business skills (like accounting and people management) that take most of us a while to learn. At its core, an entrepreneur is an independent businessperson who must plan, organize, motivate and control.


Entrepreneurs also have to initiate new things and have the drive to overcome all the obstacles in the way — and there are always many obstacles! Then, you have to take personal and financial risks — calculated risks — that will make most people uncomfortable.Before you invest your time in becoming an entrepreneur, I'd also like to explain some realities about entrepreneurship that I have learned and debunk some common myths.You may hear that it is ""all about great ideas,"" but it is really about solving a market problem.You may hear it is ""all about the team"" but mostly about the leader.You may hear that it is ""all about passion,"" but it is really about adding value for customers.You may hear it is ""all about strategy,"" but it is really about execution.You may hear it is ""all about growth,"" but it is really about constant improvement.Related: 15 Weird and Wonderful Side Hustles You Never Knew ExistedBut, there are many advantages to being an entrepreneur. You can be your own boss, make the decisions and set the agenda. You can customize the business around your skills and dreams. You can create jobs and careers for others and improve your community and the world!


On the other hand, there are several disadvantages to being an entrepreneur. You have few days off. It takes a lot of work: at least 60 hours per week, and you can't quit. It's risky — you might go broke. It's not easy. There are a lot of struggles along the way, and it takes a long time to realize the dream.If entrepreneurship still sounds appealing to you, I advise jumping in and getting to work. History has shown that great companies are created by hard work, clear values, and constant improvement, not by one great new idea.

18,Big Businesses Take Forever to Pay Their Small Suppliers. These Founders Did Something About It: 'Nobody Had Seen Anything Like This',"Mar 6, 2024",Frances Dodds,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/these-founders-help-small-suppliers-get-paid-quicker-from/470341,"
It should have been a celebratory lunch — the kind where you order french fries and cheesecake, then go home to nap and don't even feel bad about it.Instead, Stacey Abrams and Lara Hodgson were sitting in an Atlanta restaurant, dazed with disappointment, talking in circles, returning again and again to the same confounding question: How did we not know this?It was 2010, and three years earlier, the women had cofounded a company called Nourish, which made grab-and-go baby bottles filled with premeasured, purified water for easy formula mixing. The company had been finding its legs, one wobbly step at a time. Then, Whole Foods placed a huge order of their product.



""It was, like, orders of magnitude bigger than anything we'd done before,"" Hodgson says. They were ecstatic. This is what they should've been celebrating. But then they read the payment terms. ""We discovered that we weren't going to get paid for three to four months. I mean, no small business can handle that.""The women had run headlong into an unspoken rule: the bigger the buyer, the longer they take to pay. And it didn't even matter what the official payment schedule was. ""If your invoice says net 30 or net 60 or net 90 — that's just a suggestion,"" Hodgson says. ""We know now that the average net 30 invoice pays in 54 days. But back then, when we realized all this, I just remember thinking, like, Was I sick one day in business school? Why does no one talk about this?""Related: 10 Small Business Marketing Strategies That Actually WorkThey had more questions, too. Why was this the status quo? Why did no one seem to think it was a big deal? And why — in a country that calls small businesses the backbone of the economy — had no one bothered to create a better solution?Suddenly, they couldn't stop talking about it. They talked with each other, and then with other small business owners, and then with academics and investors. And eventually, they decided to do something about it.Later that year, the duo cofounded NowAccount, a novel business-to-business financing solution that lets small business owners get paid for invoices right away, with low, flat-rate fees, while building up their credit and outsourcing the time-consuming task of tracking down payments. Since its inception in 2010, Now has fast-tracked almost $1 billion in payments for nearly 1,000 businesses, and in the past two years, more than doubled in growth.But getting to this point took a long time: years of asking, and listening, and explaining, and insisting that something could and should be done.""We had to convince people we could solve the problem,"" Abrams says, ""because it sounded like magic.""


Hodgson and Abrams met at a leadership program in Atlanta — but they might not have connected so fast if Abrams hadn't fessed up to her audacious ambition.It was 2004, and they were both enrolled in a tough session: The facilitator had researched attendees ahead of time, and made it his mission to target their insecurities, in order to prompt deeper conversation about biases. Hodgson is an extrovert who loves to talk — so the facilitator didn't let her do that. ""At the end of the weekend, he told me he needed me to know what it felt like to have no voice,"" she says. ""I did not like that.""Abrams is an introvert, so the facilitator treated her the opposite way — constantly pressing her to speak. Eventually, he asked Abrams a direct question: ""What is one great ambition you've never wanted to say out loud?"" She paused, then said she wanted to be president of the United States. Across the room, Hodgson remembers thinking, I always said that as a little girl, and girls don't say that out loud! When they broke for lunch, Hodgson made a beeline for Abrams in the buffet line.Related: 9 Tips To Grow Your Small Business With Social Media MarketingThe women were assigned to the same study group. ""We found that while we had different approaches to problems,"" Abrams says, ""we almost always aligned on solutions."" They became friends, and a couple of years later, founded a consulting company together, making use of Hodgson's business connections and Abrams' knowledge of local tax law. Then they founded Nourish. And that brought them to that bleak lunch in 2010, agonizing over how to get the money for their Whole Foods order. They were searching, once again, for an answer.They'd scrambled to find conventional bridge-funding solutions — a bank loan or invoice factoring — but found the first inaccessible, and the second predatory. Bank loans are hard to get for small business owners without solid credit, or for anyone who doesn't feel comfortable with personal guarantees. Recourse-factoring companies, which buy invoices from small companies, charge variable fees, along with additional accruing fees for late payments (which the small businesses can't predict or control), and often use invasive tactics like collecting money from the business's bank account on a daily or weekly basis. Plus, if a payment falls through, the small business is on the hook for the full payment plus late fees, which leaves a liability on its balance sheet for months.The best option Hodgson and Abrams had found — ""a creative factoring agreement from a community bank"" — also came with personal guarantees. This was uncomfortable for both women. Hodgson had a new baby and worried about losing her house because of the loan, and Abrams had a mortgage and a lot of student debt. Plus, she was financially responsible for her parents and niece.To both women, this situation just felt wrong. They knew they couldn't be the first entrepreneurs to find themselves suddenly ""growing out of business.""""When you encounter a massive problem that's been around forever,"" Abrams says, ""you tend to think, I can't possibly be the first one to see it. So you assume what's happening is your fault, or that the problem would have been solved if it could have been. And you usually stop there. But instead of critiquing ourselves, Lara and I decided to ask: OK, but why hasn't it happened?""


Image Credit: Nicolás OrtegaWhen Abrams and Hodgson began talking about solutions, the first thing they thought of was simple: What if Whole Foods could pay them with a credit card? In this case, Nourish, the seller, would be charged the flat 3.5% transaction fee, and get paid right away. Then Whole Foods, the buyer, would pay down the balance on their own time with interest.But therein lies the dilemma: Whole Foods doesn't want to pay its suppliers right away — and certainly doesn't want to pay interest. And because it's a giant company, it doesn't have to. That's the way the capitalist cookie crumbles. Bigger companies set payment terms, and the smaller companies accept them — until they prove critical enough to negotiate.But what if Hodgson and Abrams created something for small businesses that was like being paid with a credit card?This is the idea that eventually became NowAccount: Small businesses would apply to be Now's clients, and pay an annual membership fee of $750. When clients received an invoice from a new buyer, Now would assess the buyer's risk, and if they approved, the client could start uploading invoices. Now would vet each invoice, then pay the client the full amount almost immediately, minus a flat fee based on the payment terms (ranging incrementally from 3% for a net 15 invoice, to 8% for a net 120 invoice). And Now would be reimbursed when the payment is made.Related: 5 Things Not to Do When You're Running a Small BusinessThis would shrink the payment schedule from a few months to just a few days. In the case of Nourish and Whole Foods, it would have looked something like this: If Whole Foods placed an order of, say, $50,000 worth of goods from Nourish, with 90-day payment terms, Nourish would take that invoice to NowAccount, who would confirm its validity with Whole Foods, and then pay Nourish $50,000 right away (minus the 7% fee for a net 90 invoice). Then Now would be reimbursed in, say, 117 days, or whenever Whole Foods actually paid.For a small business owner, the advantages of this setup are numerous: No added interest for late payments you can't control, no liability on your balance sheet, no unforgiving credit checks or invasive debt collection strategies, and no personal guarantees. Unlike factoring companies, which hold you responsible if a payment falls through, NowAccount absorbs the risk of every invoice it accepts. In this way, Now acts as a kind of insurance for their clients.Hodgson and Abrams knew their concept was groundbreaking.Unfortunately, at first, the people they needed to join them were not convinced. Part of the problem was that the concept didn't lend itself to pithy, 30-second elevator pitches. ""It's complicated to explain,"" Hodgson says. ""And because nobody had seen anything like this, when they heard 'get paid fast,' their brains immediately went to, 'Is it a loan? Is it a payday loan? Is it factoring?'""From the finance side, there was also some confusion about why this was even a problem. What's stopping any small business owner from going down to their local bank to get a loan at a lower annual interest rate, or negotiating better terms with their factoring company or buyer?


What financial institutions often overlook are the countless variable barriers for small business owners. Many are becoming entrepreneurs for the first time, figuring it out as they go, without a lot of financial education or resources.Patricia Wilson is a NowAccount client who worked in technology for 20 years before deciding to start her own consulting business, Online Media Interactive. When she started out, she says, ""Honestly, going after a bank loan didn't even occur to me. I was still trying to feel out what I wanted to do from a business perspective. And with traditional factoring companies, I was very intimidated by the aggressive nature of how they collect the money. I just wanted a way to have consistent income coming in.""Another Now client, Mike Riordan, is the founder of Freeze Sleeve, a cold/hot compression therapy he developed for his daughter, a pre-Olympic gymnast. Riordan had previously run a struggling construction company that tanked his credit, so he couldn't get a bank loan for Freeze Sleeve. And he was put off by the ""loan-shark mentality"" of factoring companies.""I think there's a kind of business amnesia that occurs in the financial sector,"" Abrams says. ""The people making these decisions forgot what it was like to be a small business owner."" Moreover, Hodgson thinks there's a misconception in the finance world that you can take funding solutions for large companies and ""miniaturize"" them. ""I tell people, 'Small businesses are not miniature large businesses. You can't just, like, shrink a solution,'"" she says. ""Think about it: If I'm a small business selling to, say, Walmart, and they're demanding net 90, that means they might actually pay in 120 days. So I'm essentially Walmart's free bank for 90-plus days. My cost of capital is way higher than Walmart's, so efficient economic theory suggests the best solution for Walmart is to borrow money really cheaply, pay me faster, and get a discount. But anyone who's tried that knows a large company will just take the discount and still pay you late.""Related: This Is the Unseen Advantage Your Small Business Might NeedIn fact, Hodgson tried this kind of dynamic discounting with one large retailer when they were running Nourish. She'd offer, say, a 2% discount on a net 30 invoice if they paid her in 10 days. But in the end, she says, the retailer just took the discount and still paid her late.""What am I going to do, sue them?"" she says. ""My legal bill would be way more than the 2%, so it's not worth it. I could threaten not to sell to them again, and they'd be like, 'OK, move over! There's a line of people who would gladly take your shelf space.' When you have an imbalance in power, efficient economic theory just doesn't work.""Dr. Richard Bliss, a professor of finance at Babson College and the national academic director for Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses, confirms this. ""It's the classic 'because they can,'"" he says. ""There's a huge power dynamic, and big companies just take advantage. I often hear stories from small business owners who are so excited they got this big contract, but they lose sight of the fact that they still have to make this positive from a financial standpoint. A lot of them don't have the rudimentary forecasting tools to plug in their new contract, look four months down the road to say, 'Holy smokes, we're gonna run out of money.' By the time they realize the predicament they're in, there are very few options.""Slowly but surely, investors began to hear Hodgson and Abrams' message. First came credit unions, then equity investors, and finally Goldman Sachs. Taking different types of funding presented some tension, Hodgson says, but she thinks it made the business more sustainable. ""Equity investors usually prioritize growth more than profitability, whereas lenders want you to be focused on profitability. So at times, I was like, Oh my gosh, I can't make everybody happy! But in hindsight, I think it forced a kind of discipline.""The thing about discipline is that it doesn't exactly lend itself to meteoric change. It's an act of faith that, eventually, the baby steps will get you somewhere.


""You know when your shoelaces are tied together, and you can't take a step that's longer than the shoelace or you fall on your face?"" Hodgson asks. ""That's the image that comes to mind about starting and scaling NowAccount. We had to go get capital and then get some customers, then we needed more capital and then more customers. And if I tried to do either of those too big, I'd fall on my face. So we just sort of trudged along, little by little.""NowAccount's investors were pulling on one shoelace, and clients were tugging on the other. Small business owners didn't need convincing that there was a problem. But they did need some convincing that these two nice Southern ladies weren't selling them some fanciful money ""magic,"" as Abrams says, ""or worse!""Related: Here's the Secret to Growing Your Small Business, According to Execs at UPS, Airbnb, Mastercard, and Other Big Brands""The first question we'd get from small business owners is, 'Why would you give us this money?'"" Abrams says. ""They were trying to understand: 'If this other financial institution wants to charge me 30% on my entire inventory, or this one wants my DNA swab, or to mortgage my house, why would I trust you?' Entrepreneurs are trained to believe no one is coming to help them, so we were trying to convince people we could untie their shoelaces when they'd gotten used to walking that way"" — restrained, cautious, and slower than they should have to.But once NowAccount started delivering on its promises, they started getting more applications than they could accept. This was partly because they needed more funding, and partly because they needed to mitigate risk. ""We wanted to serve more businesses, because that's why we existed,"" Hodgson says. ""But if we went too far, someone's going to take the dollar and run. So in the early days, it was a lot of learning, like, what are the signs? And analyzing data to tell us if certain industries or company profiles are more prone to risk.""Now learned to spot certain ""behavioral indicators."" For example, if someone has a Gmail account instead of a business email, it's worth a closer look. Maybe it's a fly-by-night operation, or maybe it's a new business that just hasn't set up its website yet. But with each invoice Now processed, its system became more informed. ""Every data point we have about a customer and who their buyer is, and when they pay, that just makes the system incrementally smarter,"" Hodgson says. ""So mistakes happen less and less as we grow.""And this practice of mitigating risk isn't just for Now's benefit. It's also become a crucial service for clients.Riordan, the founder of Freeze Sleeve, says the buyer-vetting that NowAccount does is invaluable. In addition to being able to sell to big companies that are ""horribly slow"" at paying, Riordan says, ""We also use NowAccount almost like our credit check people. Every time somebody wants to come on board, I send them over to Now, and they do their due diligence on the company. One time we had a cryotherapy business that wanted to go national with our products, and they gave us a very substantial order. But Now wouldn't approve them. We were frustrated because it was a big order, so we ended up doing it on our own. Well, guess what? That company went out of business and left us with a big hole.""Meeting with team members Archie Jones and John Hayes in 2015, in an antiques shop next to their office.Image Credit: Courtesy of Stacey AbramsNow was always intended to serve small businesses. But a few years in, something surprising happened. ""We got a call from Coca-Cola's chief procurement officer,"" Hodgson says, ""who was like, 'This seems to be a huge benefit to suppliers. Maybe we could partner to make sure more of them know about it.'""


Coca-Cola had been trying to diversify its supply chain to include more women and people of color, but its payment terms made it impossible for many of these businesses to work with them. ""They're going to take 90 days to pay, and if that's going to kill you, they can't give you the contract,"" Hodgson says.But with Now, Coca-Cola saw an opportunity: If there was a small business they wanted to buy from, but the supplier couldn't afford their payment terms, they'd send them to NowAccount. That way, the small business didn't have to worry about how long it would take to get paid, and Coca-Cola would know they had the capital to deliver. It was a win-win for everyone.Not long after, the city of Atlanta began a push to boost the local economy by connecting Atlanta-based corporations with local small business suppliers. Now was perfectly positioned to partner with the city to make these connections.Then, in 2020, the George Floyd protests happened, and corporations across the country started making public pledges to spend more with minority-owned businesses. At that point, Now realized it was sitting on a goldmine of data.Sure, there are plenty of business databases out there — but only Now has years' worth of invoice data, giving them visibility into which suppliers can deliver at what level.Related: 7 Strategies to Scale Your Small Business and Achieve Sustainable Growth""If you're a procurement person, and you've bought a database of businesses, and you're looking for one with a Latina founder, there are probably hundreds of them,"" Hodgson says. ""How do you pick? And most importantly, how do you know which of those hundreds can do a million-dollar contract versus a $5,000 contract? Because that matters. If I give you a contract that's too big and you don't have the staff to deliver, neither of us win.""What if they created a curated platform that helped big businesses find diverse suppliers capable of meeting their needs? It would be free for the small businesses to join, while the big businesses paid a membership fee. And that's how the next Now product — NowNetwork — was born.When Hodgson and Abrams talk about Now, people often ask: Why is it like this? Why don't these big businesses just pay their suppliers faster?Hodgson likes to tell a story about a conversation she once had with a Fortune 500 CFO. They were talking about NowAccount, and the CFO said, ""You know, this is fascinating, but I could probably just pay my suppliers immediately for cheaper than you can.""


""Well for sure you could,"" Hodgson replied. ""You're a Fortune 500 company and we're a startup. But you won't.""The CFO paused for a moment. ""You're right,"" she said. ""I won't because if I turn around and paid all my suppliers immediately, Wall Street would take me down.""What Hodgson and the CFO were acknowledging is how common it is for corporations to beef up their capital stacks by leaning on ""accounts payable"" — the money owed to suppliers but not yet paid.""Take any public company and look at their financials,"" Hodgson says, ""If you look at their short-term debt, like what they're borrowing from the bank, compared to their accounts payable — what they owe suppliers — their accounts payable are almost always two to three times what they owe the bank. Because there's a smart CFO who knows he can delay payments for free versus borrowing money at some cost greater than zero. If you yanked that away, they'd have to turn to more expensive capital, their net earnings would drop, and Wall Street would kill them.""This notion — that it's common for corporations to deliberately delay payments — is provocative. But each year, the consultancy firm The Hackett Group does an annual analysis of something called Days Payable Outstanding, or DPO. It's an accounting measure that calculates the number of days it takes for a company to pay suppliers. And it sheds light on the pattern.Of the top 1,000 publicly traded U.S. companies, for the decade running up to 2021 (when payment terms started to shorten due to pandemic supply chain pressures), ""DPO was consistently increasing — around 5% year after year — which is significant,"" says Shawn Townsend, a director in Hackett's finance transformation practice. ""On a compounding level, that adds up to a 32% increase [in how long suppliers are waiting to get paid]. And you would assume the same trends are happening to an even greater extent to smaller companies, because it's about leverage.""Townsend says DPO can't distinguish between long payment terms and late payments. But when asked if it's common for corporations to deliberately delay payments, he says, diplomatically, ""It does happen. We hear some companies saying, 'This month, we told the accounts payable people, pay a certain group of suppliers, don't pay the others.' The most critical suppliers are always the first to get paid. And then the other ones, you know, they just stop the payments until the following month. It's very anecdotal, obviously, because nobody's going to admit that.""But Now's data is not anecdotal. They have unprecedented visibility into exactly when the biggest companies in the U.S. say they'll pay, and when they actually do.Related: 5 SEO Tips to Grow Your Small Business""We know what the normal behavior is for certain companies and certain industries,"" Hodgson says. ""I was talking to someone at a major bank and they said, 'Well, we typically pay in X days.' And I said, 'No you don't.' They said, 'Well, that's our policy.' And I said, 'But that's not what you do! I know because I've been watching you pay invoices for over a year.'""


More recently, the Now team has been asking what they can do with all this information. ""Could we partner with someone like Hackett, or start doing our own reports?"" Hodgson wonders. ""This data could be incredibly interesting to investors, because if you're investing in a company, and they are continuously paying very late, there may be a weakness in its business model. Or if you're a small business who wants to sell to the airline industry, and they're saying they pay in 45 days but they really mean 60, that could be the difference between making a payroll and not. It won't change reality, but you can plan for reality. And that's what got Stacey and I into all of this trouble in the first place.""Image Credit: Nicolás OrtegaA lot has happened since that fateful lunch in 2010. Abrams kept working at NowAccount during her tenure in the Georgia House of Representatives, but left the company in 2016 to pursue those two runs for governor. (Or as she says, ""I had this other job I was interested in applying for, but my application was rejected."") After that, she and Hodgson decided that NowAccount and NowNetwork should be separate companies, which act as partners with service agreements. Hodgson will run NowAccount, and Abrams will run NowNetwork.Unlike Hodgson, who's had a long career in business, Abrams admits she never really wanted to be an entrepreneur. ""I liked paychecks,"" she says. ""It was a frightening idea to be solely reliant on my own efforts.""The thing that changed her mind, though, was meeting Hodgson.""We often believe we have to be the leaders,"" she says, ""but having a partner challenges you. It helps you grow, sharpens your mind, gives you a different perspective. Lara and I have always been curious about what the other person knows.""Curiosity, more than anything, is what brought the friends to this place. And it's what will guide them toward whatever's next. ""Curiosity is about more than simply seeking information,"" says Abrams. ""We want to know: Are we asking the right things?""Related: 7 Networking Groups Every Small Business Owner Should Be Involved In

19,Embrace Change or Miss Out On Money — 5 Trends to Know in Venture Capital This Year,"Mar 5, 2024",Alexander Galitsky,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/5-trends-to-look-out-for-in-venture-capital-this-year/470158,"
There are a lot of words to describe 2023, but ""predictable"" isn't one of them. Factors that range from broader public funding to the surge in AI capabilities have caused tectonic shifts in the venture capital landscape. It's time to explore this new world and draw a map of new challenges and opportunities. These are the trends that will be the most influential in 2024.Related: You Need to Do These 5 Steps If You Want to Survive the Difficult Funding Market1. Quality will trump quantityStart-ups have more funding choices than ever. Venture capitalists must compete with cryptocurrency and crowdfunding when looking for start-up partners. According to recent surveys, only about one in 20 new firms depended on venture capital for their start.



VCs can only bet on a few companies, hoping one will succeed. Instead, VCs must be choosier, limiting themselves to the most innovative companies. There will be greater competition, especially at the pre-seed stage. Some firms that, at an earlier age, might have gone the VC route will go directly to the audience they want to serve.Venture capital investors must show firms why they are the right choice for a partnership. Show a history of good guidance and trust to help them choose you.


You, of course, need to be just as selective with your offers. Since there is more competition, there will likely be fewer opportunities to go around. You need to be sure you are picking the winners. Luckily, the other four trends on the list will help savvy VCs come out on top.2. Public web dataFinding quality companies that need a flush of outside funding can be challenging. The wealth of data now available can help VCs winnow through the stacks. Public web data can be used to build models to predict a product or company's potential. It can track a firm's rising or falling popularity.Data, including social media posts, job postings, satellite imagery, and more, can all contribute to a landscape picture. VCs no longer need to make their best guesses based on traditional assets like press releases and financial statements.Understanding how to gather and translate this data into a narrative and predictions for the future is vital.


3. Automation and new tech adoptionAutomation technology makes new firms more efficient than ever. And consumers are always happy to find solutions that make their lives easier.The result is a boom in service areas like fintech and office technology. Consider the changes during the pandemic shutdowns: people were limited to online baking and remote work or learning. Solutions that people were wary of before are now familiar. This can mean new opportunities that build on those technologies.Related: From Mundane to Magic: The Incredible Benefits of Automation for Small Business Owners4. Think zebras, not unicornsWho wouldn't love to find a unicorn? Everyone is looking for those companies that, with some innovation, can become a billion-dollar business. But that's the problem: everyone's hunting for unicorns. The competition is so steep it can contribute to unicorns being overvalued.


Instead, look for zebras. These companies are worth under a billion, but they show the potential for sustainable income for years. This sustainable nature means you can diversify your strategies and create more income.5. Greater diversificationKeeping profitable will mean looking into new areas globally and in a broader range of companies.The digital world means we are not limited geographically the way we once were. Communication with partners in every corner of the planet is now possible. Instead of being stuck in Silicon Valley, you can work with firms anywhere from São Paulo to Nairobi.Explore different niches. Learn all you can about new industries. By expanding your range of knowledge, you'll increase your ability to identify potential winners. Bonus if you are looking at new firms that have yet to attract the attention of other VCs.


Look at different firm sizes. There is room for unicorns when you find them, but also for zebras. A mix means more opportunities to see the ones that will be a big success.The venture capital sphere has seen significant changes in recent years. There is no reason to expect that 2025 will have any fewer surprises. The landscape is changing, and the successful investors will be the ones who embrace the change and move with it. Putting everything we've learned into play allows us to open our eyes to new possibilities and find new opportunities for success.

20,15 Weird and Wonderful Side Hustles You Never Knew Existed,"Mar 5, 2024",Amanda Breen and Frances Dodds,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/15-weird-and-wonderful-side-hustles-you-never-knew-existed/470122,"
If you've been hearing a lot about side hustles lately, you're not alone. The term has slipped into our common consciousness in recent years—so much so that Merriam-Webster added it to its dictionary in 2022. ""Side-hustle is a word on the move,"" the entry says. ""Although the precise definition of this term is still in a bit of flux, it appears to be centering on 'work performed for income supplementary to one's primary job.'"" ""In a bit of flux"" is right. Having a side hustle means many things to many people. Some rely on the extra cash to pay their bills, others want a fun hobby that makes a little money, and still others want to build an entirely new business or career.A 2023 Bankrate survey found that nearly 2 in 5 of all American adults now have side hustles, and more than half of all Gen Zers and millennials. Among these younger side-hustlers, 1 in 5 Gen Zers and 1 in 4 millennials hope to one day make their side gig their full-time job. Factors like the normalization of remote work and a general sense of economic instability have surely fueled this trend, but one thing is clear: It's not slowing down. As one side-hustler, Justin Cambra, told us: ""In today's world, stability is from multiple sources of income. I'm trying to generate as many revenue streams as possible."" Hopefully, the following ideas will help you do just that.Breed bugs.

21,Outsource or DIY? 6 Signs It's Time for Virtual Assistance for Your Business,"Mar 4, 2024",Murali Nethi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/6-signs-its-time-for-virtual-assistance-for-your-business/470028,"
So you've started your own company from home doing whatever you're passionate about, like making YouTube videos or selling handmade jewelry online. That's awesome! It can be satisfying to build something with your own two hands. But as customers and orders start piling in, you find you don't have enough hours to keep up.That's where outsourcing, or getting help from virtual assistants (VAs), comes in. As cool as it is being a one-person team at first, there comes a time when growth means getting additional support. But how do you know when that time has arrived? Here are a few signs it may be worth outsourcing some tasks rather than trying to do everything solo:1. You're working long hours — but not being efficientWe've all been there — it's midnight, and you've been glued to your laptop for hours doing social media posts, data entry, or customer service. While dedication is great, constant long days aren't sustainable and may lower your productivity. When you find yourself wasting time redoing work because you're overtired, it's a sign your efforts could be better spent focusing on higher-level tasks.



Related: This Is the No. 1 Skill You Must Master to Succeed at Work in 2024, According to a Tech CEO2. Tasks are piling upIf you open your to-do list and it feels never-ending, that's a hint you may need to offload some work. Are invoices, emails, orders, or other administrative things starting to stack up because you don't have time to keep up? Outsourcing mundane yet necessary tasks can help you get back on track.


3. You're spending too much time on low-value workAs business owners, our limited hours are best spent on work that drives growth and revenue, such as product design, marketing strategies, partnership deals, etc. But it's easy to get bogged down doing data entry, social media posting, or customer service replies that don't lever your unique talents. VAs allow you to delegate commodity tasks and focus on the work only you can do.Related: Wasted Employee Time Adds Up: Here's How to Fix It4. You're not able to commit fully to new opportunitiesIf a promising partnership or project comes your way, but you have to turn it down due to being too swamped already, that's an issue. Not taking worthwhile chances can limit your growth. By outsourcing mundane work, you free up precious time and mental bandwidth to seize any opportunities that come your way.5. Your work-life balance is sufferingWhile passion for your business is great, constantly working long hours isn't healthy or sustainable long-term. Are you missing out on family time, friend commitments, or hobbies and interests because you're chained to your laptop? Outsourcing gives back some of your personal life so you don't burn out.

You can't take a vacation without panickingIf taking even a few days off causes you anxiety about falling behind, it's evident you need support. Business owners deserve downtime to rest and unwind so they can stay fresh. VA help means you don't have to work alone.So, in summary — if your time is increasingly spent on low-level, repetitive tasks at the expense of strategic work, it's likely a sign your business needs assistance to thrive. The good news is high-quality, cost-effective virtual help from places worldwide has made outsourcing more accessible than ever for solopreneurs and small businesses alike.But how do you know what exactly to outsource and how to find and manage virtual help? Here are a few guidelines:


Assess Your Workflow and Define Outsourceable Tasks — Take a step back to analyze how you currently spend your days. What repetitive jobs could a VA handle, such as data entry, customer service, and social media posting? Make a list of tangible, clearly outlined tasks that don't require your unique expertise.Consider Costs vs Your Hourly Rate — Calculate how much your own time is worth per hour based on your desired salary. VA labor rates are generally far lower, so determine if outsourcing could save you money in the long run.Research VA Companies and Online Marketplaces — Sites like Upwork, Fiverr, and LinkedIn provide profiles of hundreds of VAs worldwide with different specialties, languages, and rates. Read reviews to find out trustworthy freelancers.Be Ultra-Clear in Your Job Description — Whether you post on a marketplace or directly hire, leave no room for confusion by writing out very precisely what's required, including examples, templates, schedules, and style guidelines, if applicable. Clear communication upfront prevents misunderstandings down the line.Try out Candidates on a Small Scale. First — Before committing to an ongoing role, assign small, contained projects to vet candidates and see their skills, work ethic, and communication in action. Pay for these trials so they're treated as real work.Use Project Management Software — Whether it's Trello, Asana, or your own CRM, digitally tracking tasks helps ensure smooth delegation and collaboration. VAs should check in regularly through these tools rather than loose email threads.Maintain Open Communication — As the boss from afar, be available by phone or video call for any questions from VAs. Praise a job done well so they stay motivated while constructively addressing any issues. Maintaining good communication ensures quality control on their end, too.If you feel your business has outgrown solo DIY efforts and you're ready to bring on supportive help, consider signing up FREE for Hana Retail as your retail POS system today. It could be just what you need to gain back valuable time and focus on high-level growth without the hassle of finding and managing outsourced talent on your own.

22,4 Hard Truths You Must Accept to Become Successful,"Feb 27, 2024",Brian Will,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-hard-truths-you-must-accept-to-become-successful/469676,"
In the intricate tapestry of entrepreneurship, success can depend on an entrepreneur's ability to embrace the tough realities that define their journey. We're exploring the four hard truths that every entrepreneur must confront to thrive in business truly. While these truths might not offer the comfort of easy solutions, they serve as guideposts for growth and making informed decisions to protect their business from the pitfalls of an unpredictable and turbulent market.Join us on this illuminating journey as we delve into the heart of these essential insights, arming business owners with the wisdom to pave the way to lasting success!Related: Leadership Qualities the Most Successful Small Business Owners Share



Truth #1 - Business ideas are uselessAlright, let's be real. We've all heard someone claim ownership of the next big thing, demanding recognition and compensation. But here's the kicker — brilliant business ideas, on their own, aren't worth much. The real magic lies in transforming those ideas into actionable plans and executing them.To be a rockstar entrepreneur, you've got to master the art of turning your wild ideas into tangible and viable products. In the ever-evolving business world, it's not just about having a lightbulb moment; it's about making that lightbulb shine bright through strategic and effective execution.


From brainstorming in your garage to hitting the market with a groundbreaking product, it's not just a journey; it's a rollercoaster of creativity, discipline, resilience, and a whole lot of grit.Truth #2 - If your business fails, it's your faultWhen the ship starts sinking, the captain's gotta take the blame. The success or failure of your business? Yep, it's on you.It's not the economy's fault.It's not your competition's fault.


You have to own up to it, learn from the hiccups, and steer your ship toward smoother waters. So, if failure comes knocking, don't play the blame game. Consider it an opportunity for some serious self-reflection and learning.Mistakes are part of the entrepreneurial learning curve, but the good news is that a lot of your mistakes most likely come from a lack of experience, and all you need is the proper guidance to get you back on the right track. With the right guidance, you'll not just navigate but surf through those challenges, steering your business towards sunnier shores.Related: 3 Ways Owning Your Mistakes Will Make You PowerfulTruth #3 - The rich get richer, and the poor get poorerWhy do the rich get richer? Because they know how to make money.And why do the poor get poorer? Because they don't.It's not luck; it's a wealth of knowledge – pun intended. The key is understanding how to make money work for you, and the bottom line is that if you're not making enough money, it's because you don't know how. If your business isn't hitting the financial sweet spot, it's time to switch gears. It's not just about earning money; it's about adopting the mindset of the wealthy. Seek mentors, cozy up with coaches, join masterminds — basically, surround yourself with the right crowd. The journey to financial success begins with a mindset shift and a commitment to learning the ropes.In the entrepreneurial arena, financial smarts are your secret weapon. It's not just about making money; it's about knowing how to make it dance to your tune. This financial finesse is what sets the wealth accumulators apart from the perpetual strugglers.


Truth #4 - NOBODY beats the market consistentlyIn this digital age, you've probably stumbled upon online personas claiming they can outsmart the market consistently. Newsflash – even the big guns like Goldman Sachs and Citibank face hurdles in consistently beating the market.Be wary of promises that sound too good to be true. If the guy on your Instagram feed really did have a crypto platform that earned 1% a day, he would be a multi-trillionaire taking it easy with an early retirement. He certainly wouldn't be running a get-rich-quick scheme on the internet.Investment decisions are crucial, of course, but your best shot at wealth isn't in stock-picking wizardry; it's in running a killer business.Related: Success Isn't About Making One Big Decision, It's About Making a Million Small Decisions


ConclusionBy accepting and embracing these truths, you can unlock your true potential and chart a course toward lasting achievement in your business. Let the insights shared here serve as a reminder that while the entrepreneurial path may be challenging, it is also profoundly rewarding for those who embrace its realities. Business success is about tackling them head-on with wisdom, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to growth. So, as you buckle up for this entrepreneurial ride, remember – it's not just a journey but an epic adventure towards enduring achievement in the dynamic business world.

23,The Waitlist for This Sushi Spot Numbers in the Hundreds. Here's the Secret Ingredient of Its Success.,"Feb 27, 2024",Shawn P. Walchef,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/inside-sushi-master-jesse-itos-omakase-room/470141,"
There's no fast path to becoming a master — it takes work.As a renowned sushi chef and owner of Royal Sushi & Izakaya in Philadelphia, Jesse Ito carries a legacy of culinary excellence and rich tradition. Jesse embarked on an apprenticeship at the tender age of 14 at his family's Japanese restaurant, before immersing himself in the intricate world of sushi.""You can read books and you can just watch YouTube and learn a lot, but the only way is to learn through a chef working with the product,"" Jesse says to Shawn Walchef of Cali BBQ Media.



In 1979, before Ito was born, his parents opened Fuji in New Jersey just a few years after moving to America.Related: Celebrity Chef Maneet Chauhan Shares Her Best Tip for Aspiring TV Chefs


Shaped by his early years working with his parents at their restaurant Fuji (his mom at the front of the house and his dad making food) Ito's culinary journey began with a hands-on apprenticeship. ""The best way to learn is through apprenticeship,"" he says. ""You have to apprentice and work at places, and work with the product.""Starting as a teenage dishwasher, he was soon thrust into the sushi bar, navigating the challenges of mastering the craft.Ito's father was instrumental in shaping the Japanese food culture in the tri-state area and became known among top chefs as a culinary authority. They sold the restaurant in 2015 to help their son fulfill his dream of opening Royal Sushi & Izakaya.Ito now has the honor of working alongside his dad at his own restaurant. ""He kind of built this foundation. He was part of building the Japanese culture food scene in this tri-state area. So it was big shoes to fill. And having him there is really great,"" says Ito.


Related: 24-Karat Gold Syrup Is Just One Part of This Self-Taught Chef's Empire""Family has always been the #1 driving force for me to show up and execute,"" Jesse Ito wrote in an Instagram post about family and running a business.""It's one thing to fail yourself… that's not impossible to recover from. It's another thing to fail people relying on you. That may sound like a heavy burden, but it's also very empowering and will push you to move mountains.""The Next Generation of OmakaseFrom behind a back curtain at Royal Sushi & Izakaya, Jesse Ito brings a unique vibe to the traditional omakase experience — blending contemporary Japanese aesthetics with modern comfort and fusion of cultures. (Omakase translates to ""I leave it up to you,"" meaning that the customer leaves it up to the chef to select seasonal specialties.)


There are only 8 seats available at a time for the 17-piece, hand-crafted, tasting experience. Hundreds have signed up for the waitlist online.In his omakase room, Ito orchestrates a unique ambiance, deviating from the traditional omakase setting.Drawing inspiration from old-school hip-hop, funk, and artists like David Bowie, Ito sets the stage for a relaxed and enjoyable culinary journey. He intentionally fosters an atmosphere where guests feel at ease, encouraging conversation and camaraderie.Related: How This Chef Navigated a $80,000 Turnaround for His Business


""My omakase room, which has a bit of a different vibe,"" expresses Ito. ""All my guests feel super comfortable talking to each other, talking to other guests, talking to me. It doesn't feel pretentious where you feel so stuffy, where you're like, okay, I can't just let loose and have fun here.""Though he hasn't scaled Royal Sushi & Izakaya or the omakase concept quite yet, he understands that taking the next steps, both internally and externally, is necessary.""I know inevitably that's something I'll have to come to terms with because it's part of the process. It's part of growth.""About Restaurant InfluencersRestaurant Influencers is brought to you by Toast, the powerful restaurant point-of-sale and management system that helps restaurants improve operations, increase sales and create a better guest experience.

24,"As a Black Woman CEO, I Built a Remote Company Not Just to Save Money — But to Mirror My Commitment to Diversity. Here's How.","Feb 23, 2024",Catherine Mandungu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/as-a-black-woman-ceo-i-built-a-remote-company-not-just-to/469043,"
In the tech industry, global diversity is more than a buzzword phrase — it is the engine of innovation and leadership. Launching my startup was a new beginning. It was fueled by my journey as a Black woman entrepreneur. I chose to be a remote operation not just to save money. It was also to craft a work culture that showcases my core values and the complexity of our global community. This decision was less about following trends and more about purposefully nurturing a diverse and connected environment.Diverse teams have an advantage in decision-making, task execution and innovation. This advantage is becoming increasingly logical. Diverse teams outperform groups that are not diverse. Robust data supports this. The benefits of diversity go beyond theory. They boost a team's innovation and finances. In 2023, about 16% of companies had gone fully remote and about 28% had gone hybrid. The importance of remote work and diversity is clearer than ever. These trends show that remote work is possible. They also highlight the key role of diversity in modern business success.Related: How to Build Team Culture in a Remote-Work World



Building a diverse and global teamOur strategy for building a diverse team is rooted in a deep dedication to diversity. It is a guiding principle and a daily practice. We've created a thorough remote onboarding process. It helps new team members join our culture and rhythms. The system has virtual meet-and-greets, in-depth project orientations and ongoing mentorship. It has been pivotal in building a unified team spirit. This spirit is undeterred by the lack of physical closeness.We tackle the challenges of distance. We do this by doing regular virtual team-building exercises. They are designed to build community and improve team dynamics. Twice-a-year in-person meetings at key locations have strengthened our team, as well.


Our global team is from the United Kingdom, France, Bulgaria, the Philippines and India. It brings together a rich mix of perspectives. These enrich our work and foster an environment ripe for innovation. It's a diversity of thought and culture. It doesn't just encourage creative problem-solving — it also bonds us as a team. It shows that distance is no barrier to building a strong, cohesive unit.Harnessing geographical diversityThe diversity of our team is among our most significant assets. We show commitment to being sensitive and inclusive. This is seen in our communication practices and in our scheduling and observance of local traditions. This respect for each team member's heritage enhances our output and experience. It embodies the essence of a globally connected team.We use our geographical diversity to be available to clients around the clock. We offer solutions based on a deep understanding of their unique needs and challenges. Using time zone differences well guarantees our responsiveness. It also brings rich ideas and views to our projects. This sparks innovation and a global approach to problem-solving.Diversity comes in many forms. It ranges from location to culture and language. It helps us handle challenges with many strategies. This boosts our problem-solving abilities a lot. Our ability to view issues from many angles has been key, helping us to secure pivotal clients. It lets us showcase the real benefits and value of our diverse views. This not only reaffirms the importance of cultural diversity, but also highlights it as an important driver of superior business performance.

It sparked unmatched innovation and a deep understanding of global markets. The array of perspectives in our team empowers us. It lets us address challenges with new solutions and creative thinking, improving our problem-solving abilities. Our global footprint provides insights into varied market dynamics. It includes consumer behaviors and business practices. This allows us to craft cutting-edge solutions with global relevance.Empowering transparency and developmentAt the heart of any thriving team is effective project management. By adopting online tools, we achieve transparency in every task and project, ensuring all team members are informed of their roles and responsibilities. This method promotes a culture of accountability and cooperation. Alongside this, we prioritize the continuous professional growth of our team. We provide access to online courses, webinars and virtual workshops. Tailored to our team's expertise. They equip our team to lead in industry innovations and practices. We focus on clarity in operations and on nurturing our team's development. This focus boosts our efficiency and drives our ongoing innovation and progress.Personal growthBuilding a remote team has been transformative. It has offered me substantial personal growth and the freedom to immerse myself in different cultures in Asia and Europe. Enriching my personal life on a day-to-day basis. It has also broadened my leadership in a multicultural setting. Learning from different cultures and business practices has been eye-opening; it's shown me the key role of diversity in success.


This change reflects a wider trend among remote workers. In particular, millennials show more engagement in workplaces that champion inclusivity. They highly value cognitive diversity and see the importance of solving business challenges through teamwork. For this generation, inclusion goes beyond representation. It's about fostering an environment where every voice is heard. All perspectives contribute to better business solutions.Related: Diverse Workplaces Generate 19% More Revenue Than Less Diverse CompetitorsConclusionBuilding a diverse remote team is a journey. It requires continual learning and flexibility. This initiative has many benefits. It will spur innovation, promote inclusivity and expand our global outlook. These benefits are immense. They far outweigh any obstacles we encounter. This approach drives groups to better achievements and creates a more inclusive and interconnected global work environment by embracing diversity in all its forms. This paves the way for a richer and more collaborative future in business and beyond.

CB Insights, a leading research organization that tracks venture capital financings, recently released its report on the state of the venture capital market in 2023 and, most recently, the fourth quarter of 2023.Long story short, it was a terrible year for raising capital. The global market was down 30% year-over-year to its lowest levels in six years. The U.S. market fell to its lowest levels in 10 years, down 21% in the last quarter alone. Gone are the days of ""unicorn"" creation (companies worth more than $1 billion), mega-sized financings, and excessive valuations. And investors can't exit the investments they have already made in an anemic IPO market.It is a pretty bleak picture if you are a startup raising capital today. So, what are you supposed to do to navigate these choppy waters? Buckle up and read on for useful tips based on my experience surviving markets like these.

27,"If You Don't Learn How to Pivot Your Business, You'll Watch It Perish — Here's What a Successful Pivot Looks Like.","Feb 19, 2024",Hilt Tatum IV,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/if-you-dont-learn-how-to-pivot-your-business-youll-watch/469027,"
Netflix, Instagram, Slack. These three companies have one thing in common: Their initial business plan wasn't sustainable, and they became the formidable companies they are today because they chose to pivot in a new direction.Pivoting in startup culture is a strategic business decision to shift course to capitalize on a new need in the market that your product or service can meet with calculated changes. Doing so successfully requires high organizational adaptability and flexibility to achieve long-term success.In a business world that is constantly fluctuating, pulling the plug when things don't go as planned is an easy out. However, successful entrepreneurs and investors who truly understand their markets can see innovative ways to meet new opportunities by tweaking current business models.



Is it time to pivot in your business? Let's see when it makes sense, how to do it well and what it looks like in both success and failure.Related: Knowing When — and How — to Pivot Is Key to Your Business' Survival. Here's What You Need to Do.


Time to make a changeI have lost track of how many businesses I've seen with everything set up for success, only to have the market pull the rug out from under them. Even the most business-savvy and meticulously prepared ventures can be surprised by economic changes.From market shifts to new technological advancements to drastic economic hits, numerous external factors can force companies to consider pivoting their business model. Internal factors such as plummeting performance metrics or shifts in consumer behaviors may indicate it's time to change.The truth is that few successful businesses got to where they are today following the same strategic plan they started with. While always maintaining your core values — what makes your company unique — keeping your organization agile is essential. You should always prepare to make a necessary shift that will keep your company relevant and financially stable.Decision timeRecognizing the need to pivot and deciding to execute are two different things. There are many factors to consider, and several stakeholders will likely need to sign off. That's why conducting extensive market research, data analysis and forecasting is essential before deciding next steps.


Some businesses might be experiencing a rough patch that will even out with a few tweaks and perseverance. For others, a drastic overhaul of their business model may be necessary for survival. There's no instant solution or easy answer. A decision of this magnitude requires due diligence and belief in your team and product.A great example of pivoting based on informed decision-making is Netflix.Initially, it was a mail-order service for DVDs in the early 2000s. Even though it had a corner in the at-home entertainment market, it felt the strain of growing competition. While executives had their eyes on the current industry trends, they also saw an entirely new, untapped market to conquer.In 2007, it launched its streaming platform, where many of the same movies and shows they sent in the mail were now ready to enjoy on demand. They pioneered the streaming revolution and continued to adapt as they began developing new and original content.


Yes, many others eventually followed suit, but the point is that Netflix executives understood the market and their company so intimately they knew when it was time to pivot and executed it in a way that disrupted their industry and kept their company's profits rising.Related: What Tennis, Microsoft and Starting My Own Company Taught Me About the Mind's Role in Achieving SuccessSuccessful implementationThe next phase of the pivot is setting everything in motion. Implementation can be one of the most challenging aspects because your business will likely face scrutiny and backlash from all angles, including the inside.This is the phase where clear, effective communication becomes critical. You will feel resistance from your employees who are uncomfortable with change. Stakeholders who weren't involved in the decision will feel slighted. Industry pundits may think this change is outlandish. Your company's messaging and resolve must be unwavering regardless of who says what.


If you've done the proper research, considered all the options and scenarios and have buy-in from the appropriate parties, no other forces should change your stance unless there's a legitimate threat to your business's future.Communicating this shift from the point of empathy and care while respectfully sharing the need for a pivot and how it will work is essential to keeping the process steady. Pivoting your business is never easy, but planning and implementing the process effectively can be successful.There are no guaranteesNotice how I said it ""can"" be successful. Like your initial business plan, it could still fall flat even if laid out and executed perfectly.The unfortunate part of business is that there's always risk involved. Nothing is ever promised. Yes, pivoting could save your business from failing — or it could lead you down a path that seems promising but is yet another dead end. If that's the case, learn from it. It could mean the end of the line or another detour on the road to your company's true potential. Regardless, don't let a single failure go by without gaining insights for improvement or wisdom for what does and doesn't work.


Failure feels miserable, yes, but it's an incredible teacher. Even if your pivot is successful, that doesn't mean you won't have to stay on your toes, ready to adapt as the market changes again. No business is ever safe. Industries shift. Competition grows fierce.Never stop innovating. Don't get comfortable. Keep your eyes on the path forward, watching for whatever obstacle is next.Change isn't a bad thing. Pivoting isn't a sign of weakness or failure. The leaders who are open to change of direction tend to be most successful. They're the ones who are vigilant and ready to pounce on the next opportunity before anyone else knows it's there.Stay flexible, be ready to adapt and when the time is right, pivot well.

29,Which Franchise Model Is Right for You? Here's How to Choose,"Feb 13, 2024",David Busker,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/which-franchise-model-is-right-for-you-heres-how-to-choose/469033,"
A major decision potential business owners must make when considering a franchise is determining what type of business they should run. There are thousands of brands and concepts, but franchises generally fall under two business models: ""brick-and-mortar"" and ""service-based.""Think about a franchise you know. Any franchise. Possibly one that offers services that you use consistently. Is it a hair salon? A fitness studio? A lawn care company? Maybe a moving service?All of these are franchises, but in terms of a business model, the hair salon and fitness studio fall under one umbrella — location-based businesses with retail storefronts where the customer receives the service at a fixed-base location. Meanwhile, the lawn care company and moving service fall under another umbrella — service-based brands — which do not have a storefront or customer-facing real estate and the service is provided at the customer's location.Here are some of the key differences between brick-and-mortar and service-based businesses, as well as the criteria to build one, so you are more informed when choosing a franchise model.



Related: 7 Essential Questions to Ask Yourself Before Starting a Franchise1. Investment costReal estate is what usually drives franchising investment costs. The more real estate intensive, the greater the investment level. Location-based, brick-and-mortar franchises generally have higher initial investments. Building the retail space can be pricey. Picture a fitness studio — you need equipment, like bikes or pilates machines, but also a high-tech sound system, televisions, changing rooms, showers, etc. Not to mention the flooring, interior architecture (walls, stage, various rooms), trade dress and more.On the other hand, a service-based brand doesn't necessarily require real estate (some may even operate from a home office). Some service-based brands require storage space to house vehicles or equipment that are deployed at the customer's location. Less visible and lower-cost industrial spaces are ideal for these franchises. Typically, these spaces require few leasehold improvements compared to a customer-facing retail space.


So what can you expect the investment costs to be for each of these options for a single unit or territory?Although it isn't definitive (there are always exceptions), common ranges are:Brick-and-mortar: $250,000+Service-based brands: under $300,0002. Ramp-up timeRamp-up time goes hand-in-hand with investment costs. The time it takes to ramp up to a monthly positive cash flow and establish repeat business both indicate important benchmarks for any sustainable business. In terms of speed, service-based brands are more likely to ramp up quickly because of a lower investment cost upfront and lower fixed overhead costs. Let's consider a moving service brand. Once you have the equipment and employees in place, the month-over-month operation costs are more closely linked to revenue growth; thus, these models can often grow to cash flow more quickly.Alternatively, a brick-and-mortar brand (like a salon) will have high upfront investment costs (retail space, individual stations, chairs, mirrors, hair wash/dry stations, etc.) and will likely take time to establish a strong customer base in a particular community. However, they tend to have more repeat business and durable income streams over time.Related: The Rise of Click and Mortar — Why Online Businesses Should Consider Opening a Physical Store3. ScalabilityBrick-and-mortar businesses are typically more scalable. Once you have a single successful franchise, it's easier to manage and build an empire by spreading costs over multiple locations. But remember, due to the costly initial investments, building costs will be similar each time you open a new location.


With a service-based brand, rather than building more physical locations to expand, you can expand your territory and drive more penetration within your territories. While this isn't without additional costs (consider gas money, employees to keep up with demand, more frequent equipment maintenance, etc.), it requires incremental investments since your revenue justifies it and creates economies of scale. By purchasing additional territories in a service-based brand, you scale your revenue and income multiplier without the same proportional increase in capital investment.4. TechnologyOne area that is relatively equal in terms of usefulness and accessibility is technology. In recent years, technology has transformed the franchise world. Specifically, repeatable but necessary tasks have been streamlined and simplified through technology. For brick-and-mortar brands, it's common to see customers scheduling services directly (hair appointments, fitness class bookings, etc.). For service-based brands, customers can book service calls, and employees can perform tasks in real-time to keep business moving, such as ordering parts, creating estimates, etc.5. Location riskLocation is key for brick-and-mortar franchise brands. It's often a balancing act of finding real estate that is within an acceptable price range and in a popular location that creates consistent repeat business. You will be offering services in a fixed location, so the further away you are from the customer, the less likely the customer will travel to your location. For example, a fitness studio needs to be convenient for customers to come to your location three to four times per week. The more frequently a customer would ideally like to visit your franchise, the higher density is needed for the same market radius.For a service-based brand, location is not as important for overall success. Since you or your employees will be traveling to the customer's location, there is no site selection risk, and you are free to penetrate deeper and deeper into a market. However, it is worth noting that if you do expand to multiple territories, you may want to consider renting additional warehouse or storage space to optimize efficiency.Related: Start Your Own Business or Buy a Franchise: Which Is Right For You?6. Recession resistanceLastly, one factor to consider lies in the recession resistance of your franchise. Brick-and-mortar brands often offer more discretionary services. These are everyday services, to be sure — hair care, nail salon, etc. — but they are not always considered everyday essential services. On the other hand, service-based brands often are essential everyday services that must be performed despite fluctuating market trends — think HVAC, plumbing, yard care or restoration.


At the end of the day, there is no one-size-fits-all franchise for every potential franchisee. But by understanding the basics of these umbrella categories, you can start to consider which business model type matches most closely with your business goals.

30,5 Phrases That Kill Your Chances of Receiving Funding,"Feb 13, 2024",Liam Gill,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-phrases-never-to-use-when-asking-for-money/469088,"
I've had the luxury of hearing thousands of startup pitches. This has provided me with a unique opportunity to spot pitching methods that work regardless of market conditions but also those that consistently fail no matter the stage of the company, experience of the founders or market conditions.A significant misconception for founders when fundraising is the belief that they must ""convince"" a VC to invest. The truth is that most VCs decide whether they are interested just minutes into a pitch when they hear the problem, solution, team and traction. After this, every action you take as a founder, every word you say, is simply an opportunity to give that investor a reason NOT to invest.With this in mind, let's look at some phrases that consistently give investors a reason not to invest and kill founders' chances of fundraising.



1. ""We can sell this company within five years.""Building a startup from an idea to a successful company is hard. It takes extreme dedication and hard work. While many founders believe that explaining to investors how they might be able to return their capital (and promising a short timeframe for that return) can be enticing, the truth is that when dealing with venture capitalists, they want to see your commitment to building your business to $1B+. When you start talking about selling the company in the short term, it demonstrates that:You are not 100% focused on the growth of the business.You are more interested in the money than the problem the company solves.The best startups have founders who deeply care about the problems they solve for their customers and not people who are simply trying to get rich.Claiming that you can sell a company in the short term is a major red flag for investors.Related: Should You Pitch Your Startup to Early-Stage Investors?2. ""We don't have any competition.""When an investor hears that you don't have any competition, they immediately become concerned. Nowadays, there is no business idea you can come up with that someone has not thought of before. So, if there is no competition, you must have an incredible reason. Often, unless there is a recent technological innovation or legal change, there is no reason why you won't have some competition.Many founders make the mistake of claiming there is no competition because they think about competition not as other solutions to the problem they are solving but as other companies offering the exact product/service. For example, when AirBnb pitched, they included Craigslist as a competitor. While Craigslist isn't in the business of allowing people to stay in strangers' homes instead of a hotel, the site can connect with others and arrange to stay with someone in a foreign city. Therefore, it is a viable solution to the problem AirBnb was solving and is a competitor. Thinking of competition in this manner will help you find the right competitors to list in your pitch deck.


Finally, reframing how you think of the competitors' slide in your deck is essential. Founders often believe that a lack of competitors is a good sign to investors; aside from raising concerns that you don't fully understand your market, having no competitors can signal to investors that there is no demand for your product. If nobody else is even trying to make money in your market, maybe there isn't a market to begin with. This slide is your chance to show that (i) there are competitors and (ii) how you are better.3. ""We need you to sign an NDA.""Venture Capitalists will not sign an NDA. As an investor, I can confidently say that the conversation ends when a founder asks for an NDA. Investors are hearing thousands of ideas a year and picking the top 5-10; no investor will sign an NDA that risks them being unable to work with dozens or hundreds of companies to hear your pitch.From the founder's perspective, you shouldn't be worried about sharing your ideas unless you have patent or IP considerations. The reality is that companies succeed based on their execution, not ideas. If you have a great idea, you should also believe that you are uniquely positioned to execute the concept in a manner nobody else can. If that isn't the case, you are unlikely to succeed anyway.Related: This Is How Overfunding Can Kill Your Startup


4. ""We just need money""Investors hate supporting companies that aren't already on a path towards success. When pitching your company, you should never talk about your company as a parked car waiting for gas (money) to get going. You should always pitch your company as a car racing toward the finish line; you could go much faster with more gas.Any indication that your company does not already have positive momentum and is relying on a capital injection to get moving drastically increases the risk associated with the business and ends most VC conversations.5. ""I don't need a cofounder,"" or ""We just met a few months ago.""Especially at the pre-seed stage, your team is your most investable asset. Anyone can copy your idea. Investors are looking for a team they believe can execute the idea. If you dismiss their concerns about the size of your team by arguing that you can do it alone or show that your team hasn't worked together long, you create doubts about your ability to execute. If there are deficiencies in your team, don't try to brush them off; instead, focus on how you will remedy them through strategic hires to ensure your company's success.Founders breaking up or giving up is the number one cause of startup failures. While this may seem like a trivial question to you. For investors, the long-term commitment and potential of the founding team are the primary considerations in any pre-seed or seed-stage investment.

33,4 Launch Strategies for Startup Success and Longevity,"Jan 29, 2024",Jessica Wong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-launch-strategies-for-startup-success-and-longevity/468612,"
The startup scene across the United States is expanding at almost unprecedented rates. Data from the Economic Innovation Group (EIG) shows that the country's business startup rate in 2021 was the highest since the Great Recession. This statistic alone illustrates two facts: founders are confident in the opportunities in the U.S. economy, and the startup marketplace is growing more crowded in almost every industry.As a result, founders are turning to more innovative approaches to ensure their product launches stand out from the crowd, becoming both memorable and financially successful.The United States has traditionally been a hotbed for startup activity. With a culture that embraces entrepreneurship and values business growth, the country has traditionally welcomed new ideas and innovation.



However, having a great idea is no longer enough to succeed. With nearly half a million new businesses being created every year, it can be hard for founders to cut through the noise to get the attention of investors and potential early customers and launch their first product. Some of the most successful recent launches have seen business owners turn to innovative and unconventional tactics to help them stand out in their marketplace.Although common challenges vary depending on which industry a startup is in, some apply to almost any startup. Most have to work with limited resources regarding manpower and finances. New companies also need to overcome lower brand recognition levels than their more established counterparts, making it harder to stand out.


Product launches can be divided into three phases: pre-launch, launch, and post-launch. Applying an innovative approach can be beneficial at either of these stages, and it will depend on your industry to determine when it is most beneficial to think and act out of the box.Related: 3 Things Your Business Idea Must Have To Succeed — as Proven By Famous Harvard Business School Startups1. Develop a compelling pre-launch strategyThink of a music festival: for hours and sometimes days, lesser-known bands are taking the stage, building up to the main event, the headliner. As these bands play, the crowd's excitement grows, and they are ready to cheer as loud as they can for the main artist. The previous bands have helped to create a buzz around what is coming next.The same process happens when your startup is getting ready to launch a new product. In the pre-launch phase, your team is looking to build excitement and anticipation that turns into endorsement and sales once your product is ready. Teaser campaigns can work well to build excitement, or your team could leverage your social media channels to build a community around the upcoming product. Just like the crowds at the festival, engaging with the community will help build buzz.


Stock trading app Robinhood is a great example of a successful pre-launch strategy. Well before the app was launched, the founders attracted over a million users. They used a compelling proposition — $0 commission on trades — and a referral marketing strategy to build buzz. Signing up was simple, and any new user had the right to invite others. The more people a user invited, the higher they moved up in the queue to gain access to the app. By the time the product launched, a community of traders was waiting to use it.2. Leverage influencers and partnershipsWorking with influencers and celebrities and building partnerships with complementary brands can be powerful tools during the pre-launch and launch phases. The influencer's notoriety and their community can become multipliers for marketing messages, and they may also be among your first customers.Direct-to-consumer beauty company Glossier has been using a novel approach to influencer marketing for its product launches. Rather than working with established influencers, the company sends products to people who engage a lot with its online content or have bought a high volume of products. These ambassadors then share their thoughts and help spread the word about new products.Related: 5 Things You Should Know Before Collaborating With An Influencer


3. Create unconventional launch eventsLaunch events offer startups another excellent opportunity to connect with their audiences. While the classic, opening-night-style event may work for brick-and-mortar startups, tech businesses can still utilize this strategy to lift the proverbial curtain on a product.Virtual tours and other experiences work well for launch events, especially if they allow the audience to interact with the product. Consider using the pre-launch phase to deliver clues about the product, allowing your audience to build a connection. The launch then becomes the final step that reveals the product and perhaps offers free access to those who have consistently engaged during the pre-launch phase.4. Leverage customer engagement and feedbackIt is too easy to pour all your energy into the launch and pre-launch phase but forget about post-launch engagement. Doing that would mean your company is missing out on one of its biggest opportunities.The post-launch phase is when you turn first-time customers into advocates. This is the perfect time to ask for feedback and show your customers you care by resolving problems quickly. It is also important to keep an open mind toward product iterations and adjustments during this phase. No matter how much time your team spent developing your product, it is almost impossible to foresee every potential issue.

34,"With Over $120 Million in Sales, Dude Wipes Is No Joke. Here's How the Company's Chief Executive Dude Keeps Things Fun and Profitable.","Jan 29, 2024",William Salvi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/inside-dude-wipes-120-million-success-story/468871,"
CEOs carry a lot of weight. They manage businesses, people, expectations of stakeholders, and so much more. What makes these people tick and what does it take to be successful in this role? That's what I'm on a mission to find out with The CEO Series. I'm heading to the workplaces of inspiring business leaders to learn their personal stories and gain insights into their methods for getting the best out of their employees and themselves.Related: Avoid These 3 Key Mistakes for Team Success in 2024On this episode, I visited Sean Riley, CEO of Dude Wipes. It's a really fun brand that has outrageous marketing, but they are no joke. They're projecting to do over $120 million in sales, and they are disrupting the entire toilet paper industry. Here are some key takeaways from that conversation. Watch the video above to hear everything Sean had to say about the dynamic growth of the powerhouse company.



On stepping into the role of a CEO""Well, the first thing I did was change my title. I call myself the Chief Executive Dude because that's more fun and that's more who I am. And that's what Dude Wipes is supposed to be. Just because you're a CEO doesn't mean you can't be yourself.""The surprising truth you learn as a CEO""You have to kind of transition to doing less and being there more for people in a supportive way. You have to learn to let things go when you become a CEO, which maybe people don't realize. They think, 'Oh, the CEO does it all the stuff. Things keep piling up on their desk and they've got to do this, this and that.' But that's not what you want to do as the CEO. You want to have great people around you and have them grow and inspire them to do well. Think of Phil Jackson's journey. You're not taking the last shot on the court anymore. You're not the star player. You're stepping off the court trying to be the Zen Master. You're trying to make sure that all of the things in all of the different parts of your business work well together.""


Origin story""Our origin story is a fun and authentic one that I think a lot of people can relate to. It was me and my buddies sitting around, wanting to come up with a great business idea. And I put these baby wipes in the apartment and everyone started getting hooked on them. They were so much better than toilet paper and we started to wonder Why doesn't something like this exist? From there it was all about figuring out how to build a brand that represented who we were at the time. Guys sitting on a couch, eating burritos, drinking beers, Googling everything. making phone calls. Who can make these wipes? How do I incorporate a company? It was just about knocking out one thing after another.""On the key to success""We made $150,000 our first year, which kind of blew our minds. But it was the emotional reactions we saw from people very early on that gave us more confidence than probably the revenue. When Dude Wipes got into people's hands, they laughed or they passed them to other people. Making people laugh, and getting them talking was a high that kept pushing us. That belief that this will connect with people is everything. You have to believe day one this will be big. If you don't, you won't make it to some of these breakout moments like when we got on Shark Tank. We saw that customers liked it, so we believed we could do all these insane things and disrupt a huge toilet paper industry.""Hear more from Sean about running a company with a truly unique culture in the above video.

36,How to Drive Success in 2024 — 3 Leadership Lessons from the Founder of International Business,"Jan 23, 2024",Greg Waisman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-leadership-lessons-from-the-founder-of-international/468147,"
Now that the market has waived goodbye to 2023, many companies find themselves at a crucial point for reflection and strategic planning for 2024. The year proved to be a rollercoaster ride, as the aftermath of the uncertainties of 2022 continued to resonate throughout 2023 and was further compounded by new factors.Over 240,000 people lost their jobs in mass layoffs in the tech industry. Founders and business owners were urged to slim down their businesses and adapt to the complexities of a rapidly changing market landscape. Now that this period has come to an end, entrepreneurs need to evaluate the lessons learned and identify key insights that they will carry into this year to fortify their strategies.As a business owner in my own right, I felt like sharing some of my own experiences and the biggest lessons that last year left me with.



1. Placing emphasis on revenue over turnoverIn the context of the challenges and shifts witnessed throughout 2023, the emphasis on business revenues over turnover rates has gained paramount importance. Companies operating in the fintech and financial industry had to recognize that sustainable revenue streams came to carry much greater importance.Focusing on revenues is important because it sheds light on your venture's financial health and viability, both in the immediate and the long term. And 2023, marked by many economic uncertainties, highlighted the need for businesses to adopt a more pragmatic approach to keep themselves afloat.


Relying solely on turnover rates might lead to short-term gains, but the sustainability of your revenue generation is crucial if your venture weathers unforeseen challenges. Adaptability and strategic planning are always key factors for businesses. Throughout the last year, in particular, fintech companies came to learn the importance of building a solid financial foundation.2. Building up your team into the best it can possibly beThere is nothing more important to any business than the team that runs it, especially when the market is going through uncertain times. The ability to gather the best people to enable your company to grow and achieve results is the only thing that can ensure your success.To raise a personal example: back in 2021-2022, our company hired employees in large groups, but now we've narrowed down the selection processes to find the best possible candidates. We don't approach this as a routine but ensure that we know exactly what kind of work a person will do in our company and whether they can fit into our collective.As a result of this shift in approach, we managed to become much more efficient and considerably improved the comfort elements for people in the company. Our workers now have a much better understanding of what contributions they make to the company's success, leading to greater focus and motivation. These experiences helped us all become closer to each other.


3. Maintaining proper flow of information and inclusive planningAnother big thing that I've learned to consider is the importance of keeping everyone on the team updated on what the company is doing and the overall direction in which we are moving. Every week, we hold meetups where my fellow founders and I share our successes with employees, analyze mistakes and failures and hold discussions to figure out ways to move forward.Our company closed 2023 with a new product strategy for the next 2-3 years, which we have already presented and discussed as a unified team. We realized that some of the things our company had focused on last year weren't important, so we made adjustments. We developed a better understanding of what products we need, as well as how to build interactions with our clients and partners.These changes enabled us to successfully overcome the market turmoil and maintain growth and profitability throughout the past year. Now, we enter 2024 with the whole team clearly understanding what comes next for our company.New year, new challenges: Face them without fearRunning a business is a hard and complicated endeavor, and it is virtually inevitable that you will stumble and run into hurdles. This is not something to be ashamed of. The ability to note your mistakes and learn from them is critically important for the founders of any business. A principle that holds particular significance as we step into 2024, a year that will no doubt be rife with new challenges to overcome.


Only by knowing its strengths and weaknesses can a company grow and succeed. Your team, your partners, your investors – everyone who looks at you as a founder evaluates first and foremost how you pull your company through challenges and ensure its prolonged health.If you have experience from several failures, this is also one more potential source of strength that you can use for the prosperity of your company.

The world moves fast. Thomas Tull wants founders to move faster.That's why, when he invests in a startup, he gives them this advice: ""Prepare for velocity."" In other words, make sure you're ready to grow quickly and pivot at a moment's notice.Tull has taken that advice himself. His career has run on fast growth — from when he ran a chain of laundromats after college, to later founding the film studio Legendary Entertainment (which made massive hits including The Dark Knight trilogy and The Hangover series). That work, along with finding success as a tech and VC investor, made him a billionaire. After leaving Legendary in 2017, he continued his investing career — starting Tulco, and supporting Pinterest, FIGS, and Oculus Rift — as well as the United States Innovative Technology Fund, which invests in companies like Sandbox AQ. He's also part-owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New York Yankees.

38,Feel Like an Imposter? Practice These 5 Habits to Beat Your Imposter Syndrome,"Jan 16, 2024",Jason Zickerman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-effective-ways-to-beat-imposter-syndrome/467815,"
Picture this. You are a successful business owner with a thriving company and many stark, raving fans. You have got a great team. Your books are in order. You are on a massive growth trajectory, and you can draw substantial income from the business. It sounds like a pretty great spot to be in. But now imagine that even with all the prosperity and success coming your way, you feel like a complete and utter fraud deep down inside.It is called Imposter Syndrome. The term was coined in 1978 by psychologists Pauline Clance and Suzanne Imes in their research paper titled ""The Impostor Phenomenon in High Achieving Women: Dynamics and Therapeutic Intervention."" Clance and Imes described the experience as the pattern of feeling like a fraud. Or the self-perception that one's accomplishments are the result of luck rather than one's own abilities, most often despite evidence.Imposter syndrome is surprisingly common among high-level professionals and entrepreneurs. According to a recent NerdWallet survey, a whopping 78% of business leaders reported they have personally experienced imposter syndrome in the workplace, resulting in 59% of them considering resigning from their positions, even after finding substantial success in their roles. Perhaps not surprisingly, the prevalence of imposter syndrome tends to skew higher in high-stress, competitive environments. It also appears to affect women almost twice as often as men, possibly due to common struggles balancing work and family obligations.



On the surface, it hardly makes sense that even when backed by evidence, facts and irrefutable competence, many business owners are still inclined to chalk up their successes to luck, chance, or some inexplicable twist of fate.While nobody can claim to understand the exact cause of imposter syndrome, studies suggest a combination of issues are likely at play. Perfectionism, fear of failure, and hypersensitivity to criticism most likely lead to the list of contributing factors; however, the phenomenon is far more complex.


But really, the biggest takeaway here is that many business owners feel pretty lousy about themselves and the value they add to their organizations. And that's just sad.Related: 4 Ways I Overcame Impostor Syndrome as an EntrepreneurAlmost everyone experiences self-doubtYou might feel you are successful in business, but your lack of formal education is holding you back. Or perhaps you believe your family ties and elite education gave you an unfair advantage. Or you are not getting your hands dirty enough and instead letting others carry most of the weight.It is natural to feel insecure and experience self-doubt from time to time. It's when those negative thoughts become pervasive that you have a problem. Recognizing your imposter mentality as faulty is the first giant step to greater self-acceptance and less stress. The act of peeling back the layers of your ""stinking thinking"" can elicit greater self-awareness and a more objective view of your credentials and the value you bring to your leadership role.


While self-reflection isn't always easy, it truly is the number one antidote for imposter syndrome. But there is so much more you can do to quiet your inner imposter.Related: Every Entrepreneur Has Imposter Syndrome. Here's Why We Need to Talk About It.Five effective ways to combat imposter syndromeAs mentioned, imposter syndrome can be a complex and multifaceted diagnosis. I have personally known business owners and executives who have admitted to feelings of fraud. While I am by no means a doctor, in my capacity as a friend or colleague, I have attempted to rationalize with these people and systematically quantify their expertise, knowledge and credentials. Yet that pit in the bottom of their stomachs generally remained intact. No doubt, feeling like an imposter can be a scary, invasive, and debilitating mindset, and sufferers should always consider seeking professional therapy or other appropriate support.But there are also some effective strategies to help silence your inner Doubting Thomas that mostly boil down to self-awareness, self-compassion, and a good dose of objectivity.Identify negative self-talk: The narrator inside your head can be ruthless. Do your best to intentionally redirect that voice to one of compassion, objectivity and self-respect. Focus on your strengths and past successes rather than obsessing over your perceived shortcomings.Recognize personal achievements: Acknowledge that regardless of how critical you are of yourself, you have indeed experienced tremendous personal sacrifice and amassed at least a modicum of success along the way. Celebrate your accomplishments and perhaps keep a running scoreboard of all those wins.Request feedback: Again, your head can be a noisy and unreliable narrator. To gain objectivity, initiate conversations with key players like your leadership team, colleagues or trusted employees. These discussions don't need to be positioned as analyses of your leadership capabilities; instead, ask open-ended questions during project debriefs or all-hands meetings on how you can best support your team. Then listen.Set realistic goals: Having lofty goals as a business leader is terrific – but these benchmarks need to be attainable. Yes, dream big, but don't thwart yourself by setting unrealistic objectives. Make sure your goals are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound), then break them down into manageable tasks. Every step forward for you is a step back for your imposter.Understand perfection Is impossible: There isn't a project in the history of the industrial world that was completed without a bump or two along the way. Falling short from time to time on your leadership journey is a given, and expecting perfection is both unrealistic and self-defeating. Failure is an essential component of the learning process. So remove judgment and leverage mistakes to your advantage.

39,"4 Things MMA Taught Me About Work, Life and Running a Company","Jan 10, 2024",Alidar Utemuratov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-things-mma-taught-me-about-work-life-and-running-a/467379,"
There is no place for doubt when sizing up a fierce opponent across the octagon in Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). In my experience as a recreational fighter and a supporter of some of Kazakhstan's best MMA athletes, I have learned that the fighter's focus is singular as it narrows into the moment. Nothing else exists. If I have prepared well, I will know my opponent's style and angles of attack — and be ready to impose my will on the contest. To be clear, I am not making an analogy that business is like combat. Instead, my passion for martial arts has been a crucible for forging a mindset that helped me as a tech company CEO.Regardless of its image, MMA is not just about people hurting each other. In fact, the roots of the fighting disciplines are self-defense, mental wellness and competition. Crucially, it also offers a method for training the mind as well as the body. This is why we have opened gyms for kids and youth and offered the opportunity to learn MMA, along with gaining substantial soft skills. We are giving kids and youth the tools to succeed in life and work and keep learning martial arts by staying humble and disciplined.There is so much we can all learn from the dedication and focus that MMA athletes use to meet their goals. So, here are the areas where I have applied those lessons to the competitive arena of the business world.

When fighting a new opponent, it's critical to watch films of their fights, learn all about their training methods, and try to get inside their head to understand how they think. When an opponent strikes, it happens at lightning speed. Mindset affects tactics and temperament, so understanding an opponent's tendencies can help predict those moves in advance.


Across sports, NBA players are given scouting reports on their direct opponents. NFL athletes spend a third of their training analyzing films of previous games. It is a similar concept in business. After founding my tech investment company in 2013, our team spent the next seven years investing in dozens of smaller companies, researching and learning from our competitors, potential clients, and partners.Our determination to understand their strategic moves, goals and mindset yielded vital intelligence about how to shape our business and who to bring along to make us stronger. We have since combined our tech into one ecosystem, providing solutions across fintech, education, enterprise, and media. In other words, doing due diligence sets us up for success.Related: Mark Zuckerberg Speaks Out Following ACL Surgery, Injury During MMA Fight Practice2. Find your balance when in motionResearch can provide intel on whether an opponent is offensive or defensive, but one will not know how they will shape up until the contest begins. Once inside the octagon, the skill of perceiving the moment allows us to know instantly whether they are masters of their domain. Then, you have to adapt to their tactical approach.


Whether the fight is won or lost in a single strike or the result of sustained pressure, being highly responsive at the moment is the key to victory. Think of the business person who goes into a meeting with a potential client, having thoroughly backgrounded themselves yet being confronted with a different response than the one they had expected — sometimes forcing them to change their proposal or strategy on the spot. However, this is still better than being unprepared and getting even worse results.In business and martial arts, we need to think not only on our feet but also when we are down, pressured, and pivotal as evolving tactics and market disruption change the game. My MMA hobby has taught me that balance is not static but a constant state of adjustment to maintain our center. This form of fluidity allows us to remain stable in the face of a moving opponent. But despite all this, one other opponent will put our ability to stay balanced to the ultimate test: Defeat.3. Get your ass kicked (and then get back up)Nobody goes through life undefeated in training sessions. We all have areas in which we excel and others that have bested us. I have been in training situations where I was so fatigued I could not hold up my hands anymore, but knew that if I did not move, I would be taken down. However, even in defeat, we must get up the next day, analyze where we went wrong, and strengthen ourselves for a new battle. Studies show that athletes have higher levels of confidence, emotional control, determination, and ""mental toughness."" For these warriors, one loss does not mean they cannot try again. In fact, the results of rematches are often reversed because of the learning opportunity defeat provides.Mental toughness is forged in the fire, and fighters get their asses kicked in training so they can avoid that fate in real life. To thrive in the business arena, we must also condition ourselves for life's knocks and learn from our trials. Then, the measure of our resilience will be our willingness to respond to adversity with renewed determination.

There's only safety on the sidelinesIt is not the critic on the sidelines who counts, Theodore Roosevelt said, but the one who gets in the arena, ""whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood."" My experience in recreational MMA has had a major impact on me, concentrated my mindset, and allowed me to help at-risk youth. It has taught me that if we have trained well, done our research, and practiced adaptability under stress, we set ourselves up for success in business and life. The true fighters may not go undefeated but will never lack the courage to stay in the arena not just for themselves but to have a positive impact on other people's lives.

Successful businesses grow. Is yours ready?When these good things happen, it often requires money to convert opportunity into reality. A busy dentist hires new technicians and buys new equipment, or perhaps rents or buys new office space. A bicycle retailer might buy more bicycles to have in the shop or carry a wider range of helmets. A successful restaurant owner may decide to enter a complementary business, such as catering.Related: 3 Strategies for Getting Into Lending Shape



Where does the money come from?When you've decided to take your next step, you need to find the right place to secure your funding. Obvious choices include banks or credit unions. However, they can be difficult to qualify for without strong personal credit and a solid track record. Some banks offer loans backed by the Small Business Administration (SBA). If you're large enough, you may find yourself seeking a venture capital firm. Less-traditional options include online peer-to-peer lending platforms, microfinance institutions, accelerators and incubators; and angel investors may want a share of the business in exchange for their capital.17 things to organize before asking for fundingGood looks and shiny shoes aren't going to be enough to convince somebody to hand you money. No matter where you look, the money will come with strings. To provide a clear financial overview of your business, assemble and organize these 17 things:


Provide a loan proposal. This will describe how much money you need, what you'll do with it and how you intend to repay it. Also, provide a backup plan in case this doesn't work; lenders want their money back. List your business and personal assets. Where to get it: You build this yourself. Lenders and internet research can probably help you with structure.Balance sheet. Your bookkeeping will provide the data you need to provide this list of assets, liabilities and owner's equity in the business. If you've never put one together, here's a template you can use.Profit and loss statement. Any lender is going to qualify you based on how much money you're making. Your bookkeeping and past tax statements contain all the data you need, such as receipts for rent, supplies, marketing costs and more.Cash flow statement. Lenders will want to know whether you can cover your expenses and where you'll get that money. At its simplest, this is cash that comes in less cash that goes out. All those receipts and other records — for resale items purchased, payments to suppliers and more — will be in your bookkeeping records.Business and personal income tax returns. Based on your bookkeeping and receipts, these give potential lenders official verification of what's on your application. If yours is a smaller business, the lender may want your personal guarantee. The personal return supports that.Business and personal bank statements. The lender will want both of these for the same reason it wants your tax returns.Driver's license photo. Not just identity proof, it's proof of residency and enables the lender to cross-check other information.Commercial leases. Any leases you've signed for property or equipment will be required. You should have these in your files.Business licenses. Most businesses are required to be licensed by the state and municipalities in which they operate. Scan, photocopy or photograph.Articles of incorporation. If you're incorporated, these would have been required and should be in your files. Scan, photocopy or photograph.Proof of collateral. This could include property title, vehicle title, bank statements and inventory.Business plan. You should have written this when you started your business, and it should be in your records. This describes your financial projections, analysis of the market and your marketing and sales strategy for achieving your goals.Financial projections. Newer businesses may wish to calculate these as a separate document. It will include any information in your balance sheet and profit and loss statement. Explain your planned expenses and their relevance. Include a breakeven analysis and the assumptions for the numbers you're providing.Debt schedule. Every loan, line of credit, lease, bond and other liability you have should be in your bookkeeping records and contribute to your cash flow. They include loan agreements, promissory notes and proof of payment (receipts and bank statements).Legal contracts and agreements. If you don't have your copy, your lawyer or the other party in the contract should.Resumé. From your files, this will confirm your expertise in your business.Succession plan. This document would delineate the steps that will be taken should you be unable to continue in your role: Will the business continue, and, if so, who will run it?Related: Are You Ready to Pitch Investors for Funding?Getting your stuff togetherYour potential lender may want physical copies of your information, in which case you'll have to gather these items and bring them with you for them to photocopy or scan. They may have an online application that enables you to upload these documents as PDFs, word-processing or text files, spreadsheet files, scans or more.As you gather these items, scanning or creating digital copies in a computer folder may be the simplest option. Back all of these up (if you aren't already) with a program like Apple Time Machine or Windows File History, or use an external hard drive, thumb drive or cloud drive (such as Dropbox or Google Drive). You may also find it helpful to have your tax accountant or lawyer keep these on file at their office.One option that covers a lot of bases is a Document Management System (DMS). These capture receipts and more to generate financial reports. They can capture other non-financial data (such as a business plan or copies of your licenses or contracts).

If your records are well-organized to start with, you can just grab them and convert them to the format the lender requests. If they aren't, get started. Either way, good records make good financing and future success possible.

In today's dynamic retail landscape, attracting and maintaining foot traffic is a critical element for the success of any brick-and-mortar store. The challenge is not only about increasing the number of visitors but also about ensuring that these visitors convert into loyal customers.As consumers seek to shop across multiple channels, physical stores must find innovative ways to captivate audiences and create memorable in-store experiences. This article explores key strategies to boost retail foot traffic, drawing inspiration from a valuable source of insights.Related: Why Brick and Mortar Is Here to Stay



The power of visual merchandisingAn attractive storefront can draw potential customers inside your retail establishment. Utilizing captivating window displays and strategically positioned merchandise can pique the curiosity of passersby and entice them to explore your store further. Moreover, frequently updating displays can keep your store looking fresh and engaging.The potential of in-store eventsCreating a sense of community and belonging is a potent tool to bolster foot traffic. Hosting in-store events can achieve this goal effectively. From workshops and product demonstrations to launch parties and local artist showcases, numerous ways exist to bring people into your store and foster a sense of connection. Such events not only increase foot traffic on the day but also generate buzz and word-of-mouth marketing in the community.

There is significance in engaging with customers by offering personalized experiences. Implementing a robust customer relationship management system (CRM) can help retailers gather insights about their customers' preferences and shopping habits. Armed with this data, stores can provide personalized recommendations, discounts, and incentives that entice customers to return.Creating an omnichannel shopping experienceIn the digital age, the line between online and offline shopping is blurring. Integrating online and offline channels can be retailers' game-changers. A seamless omni-channel shopping experience allows customers to browse online, make in-store purchases, or even order online for in-store pickup. By offering multiple touchpoints, retailers can cater to the preferences of a diverse customer base and ensure they can shop in a way that suits them best.Amplifying social media presenceSocial media has become an indispensable tool for retailers to engage with their audience and drive foot traffic. Retailers can leverage platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and X (formerly Twitter) to showcase their products, share customer testimonials, and announce special promotions. Engaging content and customer interactions can build a loyal online following that translates into increased in-store visits.


Embracing loyalty programsLoyalty programs are a tried-and-tested method to boost foot traffic and keep customers returning for more. By offering rewards, discounts, or exclusive access to events, retailers can incentivize repeat visits and build a loyal customer base. These programs also allow retailers to collect valuable data on customer behavior, helping tailor offerings to individual preferences.Related: 5 Proven Customer Loyalty Programs That Pay Actually OffPerfecting store layout and customer flowThe layout and flow of a retail store play a pivotal role in shaping the customer experience. A well-thought-out layout can encourage customers to explore different sections of the store and discover new products.

Regularly evaluating and optimizing the store layout can lead to increased foot traffic and higher sales.Staying in tune with trendsRetail is an ever-evolving industry, and staying ahead of trends is essential for sustained success. Retailers should stay informed about industry trends, technology advancements and consumer preferences. By adapting to changing market dynamics and embracing innovation, retailers can position themselves as leaders in their niche and attract a discerning customer base.


The success of a physical retail store hinges on its ability to attract and retain foot traffic. By implementing the tactics discussed, retailers can employ a range of strategies to achieve this objective. From the visual appeal of the storefront to the integration of online and offline channels and from engaging in-store events to personalized customer experiences, each of these strategies contributes to a holistic approach to increasing retail foot traffic.As the retail landscape evolves, adaptability and innovation will be the keys to thriving in this competitive environment. By consistently implementing these strategies and keeping a finger on the pulse of changing consumer preferences, retailers can ensure that their stores remain vibrant, relevant, and enticing to a growing base of loyal customers.

46,How to Know If You're Ready to Leave Your 9-5 and Go All In on Your Side Hustle,"Nov 20, 2023",Jason Miller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/are-you-ready-to-ditch-your-9-5-for-your-side-hustle/464131,"
Ask yourself, why do you need to quit your 9-5 to go full-time into your side hustle? How will quitting help you and what is your motivation to do so? In the U.S., 28% of people state that becoming their own boss is their top motivator to go all into their side hustle.Maybe you have another reason for wanting to leave your job for entrepreneurship. You could want to make more money or spend more time working on your own business. If you think you're ready to leave your 9-5, ask yourself these three important questions honestly.Related: 44 Side Hustle Ideas to Make Extra Money in 2023



Do I have a proven business model that's been tested?Nearly 50% of businesses fail within their first five years of operation. This isn't to discourage you and in fact, can be used as motivation instead. Knowing this and learning from other businesses can help you minimize risks and figure out what your competition will be like.Making about two-thirds of your full-time job's salary for about a year at your side hustle is a good place to start on deciding if you're profitable enough to quit your job. You should also be using the money from your job to put money aside for emergencies. Running out of cash is one of the top reasons businesses fail so by having a cash cushion you'll be able to give your side hustle the time and attention it deserves to succeed. Everyone's expenses are different, but for me, I would want at least 6 to 12 months of savings.


If it's one thing I've learned, owning a business affects you mentally, emotionally and physically. And on the days that don't go as planned, you're going to have to stay strong and positive. By becoming bogged down with a few bad weeks here and there, your productivity will slide and you'll lose your motivation. That's why I preach business is less about motivation and more about consistency. Anyone can be motivated for a short period of time. But putting in constant effort even on the hard days, will separate the side hustlers from the full-time business owners.Do I have support?It's important to remember starting a business isn't just hard on you as an entrepreneur, but it's going to be challenging for your whole family. At least at the beginning, you may have less time and energy to spend with your spouse or kids and you'll need your spouse's support to do that and to get through business challenges. If you're spending more time on your business, your spouse may need to do more work at home or even have to work more hours to offset the financial responsibilities temporarily. Have you thought about how else quitting your job would affect your family? How would you deal with things like healthcare and benefits or daycare?Getting support from people who've been in your shoes can make all the difference on your entrepreneurial journey. Whether you're in a course and leaning on your teacher and peers for advice or other business owners in your industry, it's important to be open to feedback and to handle criticism with an open mind. When I was younger and didn't want to ask for help, I quickly learned how leaning on others for support was so important, especially when starting.Related: Can You Turn Your Side Hustle into a Business? Consider These 3 Things.


What's my backup plan?This one is controversial and can be a hard pill to swallow because many entrepreneurs see it as allowing yourself the option to fail or quit. But I think it's important to be realistic especially when you have other people counting on you to be the provider. That's one reason I always suggest not to burn bridges with former employers.Tell senior management about your plans first so they don't receive the news from one of your peers. Give your full two weeks' notice, or whatever your contract states. If you're in a management role, you may want to give more notice and let the company decide what they would prefer. Continue to show up and do your work to the best of your capability. Now isn't the time to slack. It not only says a lot about your character if you continue to show up with integrity, but it also ensures you're not putting extra pressure on your team. And avoid gossip and avoid speaking badly about the company or any employees. Doing this will also help keep your leave on a positive and friendly note.There are no real rules to follow when you're ready to go full-time into your side hustle because we're all different and so are our situations. I'm just giving you guidelines so you can start asking yourself the important questions to know if you're ready to leave your job. But if you think you're ready and you have a proven business model that's been consistently bringing in cash, have the right support, and have a backup plan, you're on your way to successfully quit your job and go all into your side hustle.

48,Learn the One Method Wealthy Franchisees Use to Improve Themselves and Their Business,"Nov 17, 2023",Scott Greenberg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/wealthy-franchisees-use-this-method-to-assess-operations/465292,"
Top franchisees are constantly looking for ways to enhance their business, which includes setting newer and higher goals. They relentlessly look to raise the bar. There's always more your business can accomplish. Sales and profit are only the start. Try improving your online reviews, boosting your team's skills, improving employee retention, or doing more for the community. Maybe the business has already met your personal needs— in that case, you can use it to help others. Remember, this isn't just out of altruism. It's also about preventing backward movement. Stay ambitious to ensure you stay engaged. We've already discussed the importance of inner reflection to ensure you're thinking productively. Wealthy franchisees also take time regularly to assess, adjust, and optimize their operations. There's an easy, well-established process to do this: a SWOT analysis.Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now and take this quiz to find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.Conducting a SWOT AnalysisOne of the most useful tools often overlooked by small business owners is a SWOT analysis. ""SWOT"" stands for ""strengths,"" ""weaknesses,"" ""opportunities,"" and ""threats."" This is a basic strategic planning method many companies use regularly to assess where the business stands and what their next steps should be. You can conduct the analysis alone or with a group.Start by reviewing your goals, then begin the brainstorming process. Determining your strengths and weaknesses requires looking inside your business, while defining your opportunities and threats requires you to look outward.



This is a basic strategic planning method many companies use regularly to assess where the business stands and what their next steps should be.Make a list of all four. If you're doing this as a group exercise, I recommend recording your lists on a flip chart or a whiteboard so everyone can see them. Under ""Strengths,"" you might list things like your credit line, your skill set, or your strong relationship with your franchisor. You could also add something about your employees, such as their team culture. In the ""Weaknesses"" column, you might list a shortage of cash, your fear, or any dysfunction within your team.You're basically brainstorming four lists to assess the current state of your business. Don't forget to include your mindset and other human factors. Some would argue that feelings of fear, impatience, or mistrust aren't weaknesses, but essential survival tools. That's for you to decide.


If these things are leading to measurable improvements in your business, then include them under ""Strengths."" But if they're distorting your perspective or hindering operations, they belong in the second column.Your combined analysis should culminate in a final list of action items. You want to leave with things to do. A great way to generate this final list is by answering three more questions, in light of your brainstorming. To achieve your goals, ask yourself:What must we CONTINUE doing?What must we START doing?What must we STOP doing?A SWOT analysis is only one of many ways to evaluate your business. There are other approaches. Figure out what works for you. But whatever you choose, do it regularly. Ask lots of questions about your business, and decide what action you need to take. Repeat the same process a month later, because some of the answers will change, and those changes will point you to places where you can improve your business.There are certain parts of the business franchisees sometimes neglect. Each of these areas needs constant attention if you want to get wealthy. While reading the sections below, consider where you could use some improvement.Related: Start Your Own Business or Buy a Franchise: Which Is Right For You?


MarketingOperationally, marketing may be the area where franchisees differ the most. Some are aggressive, actively advertising and going out into the community. Others just run an occasional ad and wait. Many franchisees neglect marketing because they think it's enough to pay into their franchisor's advertising fund and resent being told to spend even more. ""What are you doing with my marketing dollars?"" they complain. ""Why don't we have more TV commercials?"" Or they see the national ads but don't experience a resulting increase in business activity in their market.Marketing at a national level is not the same thing as marketing in your neighborhood. Your franchisor can create large-scale brand awareness, attract customers to the brand, and facilitate a few of the six to eight touches needed to influence consumers to buy. But they can't drive customers to your storefront, build relationships in your community, or target their message to your specific demographic. All that's on you. You and your franchisor are marketing partners. They do their part, and you do yours.Marketing at a national level is not the same thing as marketing in your neighborhood.Don't think for a second that a national advertising contribution will be enough. It's tempting to cut your marketing budget when sales are down, especially when you don't see an immediate response to your efforts. Your desk may be stacked with bills for payroll, supplies, and utilities. Why not skip advertising for a few months and save a few bucks? But ceasing marketing when sales are down is like a farmer trying to save money by not planting crops. It may solve your immediate needs, but you'll have trouble down the line. You are a farmer growing a customer base. You must plant seeds and consistently nurture them, even when they don't sprout immediately. That requires foresight, patience, and faith. And, of course, it requires money. Don't think of marketing as an expense; it's an investment. It's the only way to keep your doors open. No one has ever saved their business by decreasing their exposure in the marketplace. So how much should you invest?Wealthy franchisees don't wait for customers or rely on their franchisor to supply them. They're out in the community, reminding people they exist. They advertise. They promote. They pull customers in. They don't stand at the shoreline waiting for the fish to bite, they jump in the water and grab them.Related: Franchise vs. Independent Business? 12 Experts Weigh the Options


The NumbersThe only way to evaluate the state of your business is to look at the numbers. Activity isn't solvency, and sales aren't profits. You must look at everything, including sales and expenses, the reduction or increase in debt, and sales trends. Numbers tell the truth, and accounting software and good data entry habits make accessing your numbers easy. I'm shocked by how many franchisees ignore this.Increasing sales but decreasing profit is not a success; neither is providing mediocre service to customers because you're so swamped with business. Your goal as a business owner is not to be busy or to maximize sales. Your goal is to maximize profit, and the only way to do this is to look at the numbers all the time. Your numbers will show you trends and help you identify problems and opportunities.Cost ControlYour franchisor may require you to purchase from specific vendors. Hopefully they've negotiated good pricing. You probably have control over some expenses, and those need to be watched and periodically reviewed. The cost of goods can quietly gobble up more and more profit without you noticing.Cheap is not always best. Quality and reliability also matter. So does anything that saves you time. Still, you need to be conscious of how much you're spending. High pricing isn't the only way your expenses increase. There's also waste, which means you must buy more. A lot of franchisees will look at their invoices but won't track how their goods are being used. Even when employees aren't negligent with your supplies, they can still be overly generous with them. I can't tell you how many times I've been given straws or coffee refills I really didn't want. Someone's paying for that stuff.High pricing isn't the only way your expenses increase. There's also waste, which means you must buy more.For example, when I ran my Edible Arrangements franchises, we carefully tracked how many melon balls we could extract from a cantaloupe. We counted how many strawberries went into an arrangement. We monitored the consistency of our melted dipping chocolate. It wasn't just about saving pennies it was also about engaging employees in a profit mindset. We were already training them to increase sales, we also wanted them to help control costs.


It requires constant oversight. Watch where your money goes. Talk to other franchisees about what they're spending and which suppliers they're using. Go over your P&L and look at every expense. Your franchisor should be able to recommend benchmarks to help you determine what percentage of sales should be going into every item. Remember, pennies matter. Profit is in the details.Related: How to Find a Good Franchise LawyerEmployeesIf you give employees 100 percent of the pay you promised, they should give you 100 percent of their effort, right? That sounds fair, but it's not realistic. Compensation isn't motivation. Employees need something more. As their manager, you must work continuously to keep them engaged — that's management's primary function. That means providing encouragement and feedback, as well as giving reminders, reviews, praise, and reprimands on a regular basis.Struggling franchisees often feel burdened by this: ""Why can't my people just do their jobs?"" But wealthy franchisees understand that motivating employees is their job. People need to be led. Good employees must be pushed to greatness, and great employees must be kept that way. Neither will happen without consistent, ongoing management. The time you put into your employees is an investment that pays off. You'll spend less time motivating yours than struggling franchisees spend ""dealing"" with theirs. Never think of your employees as a burden. They're your greatest asset. They can serve and sell and do all the other work that needs doing, but only if they're regularly reengaged in the business. That's on you. They don't need much, but what they do need matters. Never take them for granted. If they're worth keeping around, other employers will happily steal them away from you. Trust me—I'm one of them.Physical Condition of the BusinessCapital improvements are painful. It's not like marketing, where you feel your investment will increase traffic. Remodeling and repairs require a major cash outlay with no immediate ROI.Or do they?I can't say that was my experience when I remodeled my first store. I was given similar statistics, but I was suspicious. My feelings were borne out in the end: The remodel didn't lead to a measurable jump in revenue. But as a consumer, I'm turned off by tired-looking stores. When the paint starts chipping and the signage looks faded, I lose interest in shopping there. And when something new and shiny opens in the neighborhood, I'm more likely to try it out.As a consumer, I'm turned off by tired-looking stores. When the paint starts chipping and the signage looks faded, I lose interest in shopping.Sometimes franchisees must do things that aren't about increasing sales, but protecting them. A business that loses its luster will also lose customers. Keeping your location looking clean and new is an important way to maintain what you have achieved. The appearance of your business sends a message to customers and employees about your standards. Keep it impeccably clean, up-to-date, and irresistibly attractive.Related: How Small Wins Can Be Massive MotivatorsOperationsWhen you do something long enough to become a habit, you stop thinking about how you're doing it. There are thousands of things you do reflexively every day, and many of them are opportunities to improve. Most of them are little things that might not even look like they need to be fixed unless someone points it out. For example, I'm right-handed. At Edible Arrangements, I used to cut fruit wedges by hand and place them on a tray to my left. I did this for three years before a new employee (who had a fresh perspective) pointed out that if I put the tray on my right side, I wouldn't have to stretch across my body with my right hand to reach it every time. It was obvious, but it had never occurred to me.Some people love to say, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Like hell. Don't wait for things to break, employees to get bored, or a more efficient competitor to pass you up. Keep getting better at what you do, and never stop tinkering with your operations.Related: Become a Franchise Owner in 5 Easy StepsPersonal developmentIt's interesting that so many people stop trying to improve themselves. You are the biggest factor impacting your business, so you need to stay sharp. Getting too busy to be your best can easily lead you to being your worst. Carve out a portion of your day for your own development. Read books, listen to podcasts, or watch TED Talks.For learning things specifically related to your business, go to your franchise convention. It's not just about getting new ideas—it's also about recharging your batteries. You need an infusion of fresh energy to fight off your own entropy. It's also important to connect with colleagues and strengthen those relationships. Wealthy franchisees always go to conventions. If you want to be among them, be among them.Impassioned franchisees are excited to do these things I've described. Others are totally over it. That's OK, too, but you need to respond accordingly. If you're burned out, sell the business. The fresh energy your franchise needs might be a new owner. You should be an asset to the business, not a liability. Guard your business with love, ambition, and a little paranoia. If you keep taking care of it, it's a lot more likely to keep taking care of you.

Two days after I made the decision to become an Edible Arrangement franchisee, the papers arrived via FedEx. I read through every page, pretending to understand what I was agreeing to. Every signature further committed me. And boy, there were a lot of signatures. There was a franchise agreement, a loan agreement, a lease, a construction contract, and, of course, an endless supply of checks to write. All this before I could make a single sale.Selecting my location was especially scary. Los Angeles is filled with overpriced strip malls and glamorous retail spaces that make turning a profit seem incomprehensible. Can that Chipotle really be selling enough burritos to pay that much rent? Everyone kept telling me a good location would yield higher sales. But at these rates, I'd have to sell a boatload of fruit to keep rent at the standard benchmark of 10 percent of revenue. That's the reality of doing business in a high-end territory. In the highest-profile markets, some of the big brands actually run retail outlets at a loss just to keep a presence there. This practice jacks up rents into the stratosphere.

After weeks of scouring the streets in my territory, I saw a ""For Lease"" sign go up in a closed Cingular Wireless store on the first floor of an office building on Beverly Boulevard. An hour later, as I waited outside for a walkthrough, I contemplated the pros and cons. There was tons of vehicular traffic, but not a lot of foot traffic. There was great street exposure, but limited parking. There was a lot of square footage, but the layout was awkward. It was available, but it wasn't ideal.In the end, corporate approved the location and I made an offer. The longer I negotiated, the more invested in the location I felt. I wanted the search to be over. My eagerness didn't serve me well—I probably could have gotten some better terms and additional free rent—but ultimately I got a lease, and that felt good.The buildout was hell. I brought out a contractor from Boston who'd built many Edible Arrangements stores but was new to Los Angeles. We needed inspections and permits for plumbing, electrical, building and safety, and health. Multiple times one inspector would contradict the directives laid out by the previous inspector. Subcontractors wouldn't show up. The IT company had DSL-related issues I couldn't solve with the phone company. I'd already found employees who were eager to start work, but continuous construction delays pushed back our opening farther and farther, so half the people I'd hired moved on to other jobs. My contractor made promises and then made excuses. When the Edible Arrangements field trainer flew in from Connecticut for our grand opening, he arrived at a store that was weeks away from being ready.


Meanwhile, my sparkling new delivery van parked safely in the building's garage was hit by a car during the night. It had yet to make one delivery and it already had a dent in the side, right below our logo. After many extra weeks and thousands of extra dollars, we finally completed construction. The health inspector signed off and the lights came on. We were open! The phone started to ring. Curious passersby (see, there was some foot traffic!) came in for samples and took brochures. Some even placed orders. I had income!The reality of being a business ownerOn day two, three employees didn't show up. The only one who bothered to call in said the job just wasn't for her. Later that day I bought the remaining staff pizza and pretended I knew what I was doing. Thank heavens for the corporate trainer. The scariest time was the next week after the trainer had left. We were on our own, stumbling our way through taking, making, and delivering orders. I panicked every time the phone rang, wondering if I'd be able to answer questions and input the order into our sophisticated point-of-sale system.My father came to visit during this week and invited me to lunch. It was the first time I had left the store during business hours, and my investment was now in the hands of my 19-year-old employees. We had sandwiches at a diner just across the street. I sat facing the front window and kept looking over my dad's shoulder to make sure the store wasn't on fire. It reminded me of the first time we left our son with a babysitter. But I knew I would have to get used to this feeling—I had to leave soon for some out-of-town speeches.Related: Here Are 4 Big Franchising Trends You Should Know About.Each day we got better. We made our mistakes, figured stuff out, and learned what we were doing. Soon we had answers to most of the questions customers asked us. More employees left and new ones came. Before too long, we settled into a routine. Orders continued to roll in. During the first month, I paid every bill on time. Two months in, the bills were paid again, and sales were up over the first month. I'd done it. I'd built a growing business. And it was exhilarating.Reflection: Questions to Ask Yourself 


When do you feel in over your head?How do you respond when things don't go as planned?Can you set aside enough money to manage unexpected expenses?How prepared are you to trust others to run your business?Enjoying the RideMy best customers were my in-laws. They ordered fruit baskets for every possible occasion. I told my employees to give them discounts and eventually to refuse payment from them altogether. That's when they stopped ordering—they wanted to support me, not mooch off me. Friends ordered, too; some wanted to support me, while many others wanted to get discounts. It's amazing how many dinner parties you get invited to when you own a fruit arrangement business. That's OK. It felt great to be a big-shot business owner, what my grandmother would have called in Yiddish, a ""big macher."" A speaking colleague came in to meet me for lunch. I was wearing a long-sleeve Edible Arrangements polo and matching baseball cap, and she said, ""Oh, you look so cute in your uniform!"" She was just condescending enough to embarrass me.Every day was a new experience. We turned new customers into repeat customers. We signed up corporate accounts. We made many arrangements to be used as props in TV shows. I personally delivered five arrangements backstage to The Price Is Right to be used in the ""Showcase Showdown."" We played a role in countless dinner parties, thank-yous, and marriage proposals. We joined the Chamber of Commerce and our local chapter of Business Network International. We ranked second out of almost 100 Edible Arrangements locations in California. Then we got to number one. We also won the ""Best Customer Service"" award out of 1,000 Edible Arrangements franchises worldwide. I wasn't in it for recognition, but I admit it felt great.Related: Discover 5 Top Retail Franchise Opportunities to Invest InI would leave town to speak. When I got back, there was more money in the checking account than when I'd left. That was awesome. The highs were high, but the lows were low. We had problems. Twice there were break-ins during the night. Several times our delivery drivers got into fender benders. Our insurance company settled with a lady who ""fell"" in our lobby. A home delivery grocer contracted with us to provide them with fruit salads and then stopped paying us. I took them to small claims court but lost because my manager had accidentally disposed of the pickup receipts, leaving me with insufficient proof of delivery.For a while, managing employees was particularly tough. I'm not one of those people who complains about ""kids these days"" or how entitled Millennials are. Every generation has all-stars and flakes. But it seemed like we always had issues with staff. My phone would ring at all hours with questions, problems, and requests. Employees would show up late or stop showing up altogether. Some would work, but not as fast as we needed them to. One male employee offered a female coworker a heart-shaped piece of pineapple from an arrangement, and she complained it was a sexual advance. I fired our first delivery driver for racking up $150 worth of personal calls on the company cell phone. I let another employee go for calling ahead when running late and asking coworkers to punch in for her. Twice I gave second chances to employees who succumbed to drug addiction, and both relapsed. I put a lot into figuring out how to build a great team, and over time my staff went from being my greatest headache to my greatest asset. By the time I sold the business, most of them had been with me for years. Leaving them was the hardest part of my exit.Reflection: Questions to Ask Yourself


How do you see your role in the community?What accomplishments are you chasing?How will you react when problems arise?How prepared are you to manage employee issues?Exit StrategyGetting into Edible Arrangements had been a great choice, but after ten years, I'd had enough. My speaking business was doing really well. Thanks to my firsthand franchising experience, I started booking a lot of keynotes for other franchise systems. Splitting my time wasn't good for either business. It had been a good ride, but it was time to get out. But exiting wasn't easy.First, I had to find a way to put the word out without alarming my employees. I hated being secretive, but I needed the operation to remain stable. Then I had to find interested buyers. It helps when the business is turning a profit, but buyers and sellers don't typically see things eye to eye. I took lunches, kicked numbers around, and tried not to feel insulted by the lowballers. At one point I had five different interested parties. Then it was four, then three. By the time I sat down with the only buyer left, I was much more eager to get out than I could let on. The negotiation dragged on for a few months. Both of us moved at a deliberately slow pace, each trying to keep the other interested while making him sweat. Don't get me wrong—our conversations stayed pleasant and respectful. But we were only human. Finally, we reached an agreement. Papers were signed, hands were shaken, and tears were shed. My ten-year odyssey as a franchisee was a wild, stressful, and character-building journey. And now it was over. I had built, operated, and sold a successful franchise operation and lived to tell the tale. Last week a friend of mine had surgery. I ordered an Edible Arrangement for her from her local store and paid full price.Reflection: Questions to Ask YourselfWhat's your exit plan?Do you know what your business is actually worth?Can you be patient enough to make a good deal?How will it feel to leave?

53,My Company Hears Hundreds of Pitches Every Year — Here's What Investors Are Actually Looking For.,"Oct 30, 2023",Emil Savov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-things-investors-are-actually-looking-for-in-financial/463239,"
If you're an entrepreneur who's looking for investment, you already know that you need more than a good business idea — you need a strong pitch that includes solid financial forecasts.This is vitally important when seeking out the right investor as it shows them that you understand the fundamentals of your business. It also helps investors understand other key points, such as the attractiveness of your business model; the amount of capital required to meet milestones; and the valuation of the company to be applied to the current financing round.But figuring out what to include in these forecasts can be tricky. At MaRS IAF, we see hundreds of pitches every year. This is what we want founders to know.Related: 6 Important Factors Venture Capitalists Consider Before InvestingInclude the right numbersThe most important thing in a financial forecast is an income statement that spells out your revenue, cost of goods sold and expenses. Cash flow projections are also key: Most startups are not profitable at first, so it's important for investors to understand what kind of runway the companies are forecasting and whether they have the funding to continue operating until they achieve their goals. Include quarterly, and if necessary, monthly projections for various scenarios, as well as your plan if things go awry.



Many founders present what's called the base case, which tends to look at the most plausible scenario when it comes to their cash flow. But we'll often ask, what is your worst case in terms of what could go wrong? For example, what would happen if your revenue gets delayed by six months or a year? When would you run out of cash? That's not just important information to have, it's also a good reference point for us to see how founders evaluate and plan for risk. Often the difference between success and failure is in the execution, so we want to know how they'll handle it when things don't go to plan.Learn the economics of your industry sector — and don't give overblown projectionsDifferent types of industries have different margins and cost profiles, which founders must be aware of if they're going to generate accurate and reasonable financial projections. For example, software and SAAS companies could have gross margins of up to 90% because their cost of goods sold is very low. On the hardware side, it's closer to 50% because of manufacturing costs. The traditional automotive industry has typical net income profit margins between 3% and 5%.To fund all their R&D and other expenses, they need huge revenue volumes and the associated economies of scale. If a founder is projecting profit that doesn't mirror the reality of their industry, it will ruin their credibility because it'll indicate they haven't done their homework or don't understand their business, which can make an investor wonder whether they can trust any of the company's projections.Related: Here's What's Brewing in the Minds of Startup Investors


Have a plan — but be adaptable, tooFounders come up with scenarios based on any number of assumptions that differ from their base case — including the timing of revenue, margins and expenses — so we don't expect them to have a scenario for every single parameter. But be prepared, because potential investors may ask for more financial analysis.It's also a good idea to include your contingency plans in your financial projections. So, if things go in a negative direction, what changes will you make to ensure your survival? That could look like hiring people on a contract basis rather than bringing them on full-time or planning to cut core staff. But many entrepreneurs will save this as a last resort because cutting too deep can lead to a vicious circle where you cannot deliver on promises that you've made to customers. Oftentimes, part-time employees have other sources of income and it's less painful to disengage with those than with full-time employees. It may also make sense to hire a part-time or fractional CFO instead of bringing on a high-priced full-timer right away.Use a model that makes sense for the stage of your businessIn the first and second years of operations, companies have a reasonably good idea of what they need to do to meet their milestones and what resources they need to get there. For example, if they need to develop a new feature, they can likely estimate how many engineers and how much time to dedicate to the project.Similarly, it should be fairly easy to calculate how much that would cost and how much revenue they need to generate in order to fund that. That's how you build an income statement using ""bottom-up"" projections. But any further out, it becomes difficult to estimate exactly how many engineers the company will have and how much revenue it'll generate. At that point, it's time to switch to ""top-down"" models, which use typical industry margins, cost structure and revenue per employee to generate a projected income statement.


Related: Everything You Need to Know to Pitch an InvestorHow to choose the right investorNot every startup gets to choose their investors — sometimes, it's whoever will give you money. But, ideally, founders should look for investors who have some important characteristics, and domain expertise is a big one. That's their track record of investing in that industry, which means they will more easily understand the business case and the value proposition.It's also wise to seek out a firm that can add value after the investment. Look for firms that can provide the resources, skills and networks to validate their ideas and bring products and services to market. I like to call this the ""virtuous circle"" of venture capital. If a venture capital firm has a good reputation, chances are the companies it invests in will attract better opportunities and therefore see better outcomes. Contacts in the industry are also important because that means your investor can support you in the long run by helping open doors with potential customers and partners, which will help the startup become more successful.Founders should also do their research to find out what companies the VC may have already invested in. If they've already begun a relationship with a direct competitor, that can present another challenge.


The bottom lineThere are a lot of details to line up and work through, so make sure you are fully prepared to talk confidently — and honestly — about your business plan. If you want to attract an investor who is committed to your company's growth, you need to first invest the time to ensure your numbers add up.

54,5 Ways to Be Generous While Still Being a Frugal Business Owner,"Oct 27, 2023",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-save-money-while-running-a-business/463932,"
Businesses of all sizes can benefit from cutting costs. But if they are not carefully considered, they can prove disastrous. After all, to grow, companies must increase sales, not cut costs. When essential business systems are denied capital in order to cut expenses, stagnant growth or negative cash flow can result.At the same time, if you don't spend money on a critical business system, you might end up with unintended consequences. In reality, many entrepreneurs are being cheap when they think they're being frugal. The problem is that being cheap leads to problems, while being frugal leads to efficiency.As a frugal business owner, you might wonder how to appear generous without spending a fortune. Remember, you've got to make sure your business is profitable. It's still okay to be generous despite that.

55,How to List Personnel and Materials in Your Business Plan,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-list-personel-and-materials-in-your-business-plan/462341,"
Manufacturers combine labor and materials to produce products. Any problems with these critical inputs spell trouble for your business and its backers. Business plan readers look for solid systems to ensure that personnel and materials are appropriately abundant.For this reason, your plan should show that you have adequate, reliable sources of supply for the materials you need to build your products. If you are working with suppliers in other parts of the world, show that they are reliable and that you have established a system to make such international production run smoothly. A global marketplace means more opportunities to find the materials or products you need and new markets for sales. This can be impressive to your readers.Related: The Main Objectives of a Business PlanHowever, you need to define and provide the details of how your business will benefit from being a part of the global marketplace. Even if you are not planning to actively pursue global partnerships, buy from vendors around the globe, or market to customers in other countries, you must address the possibility of international sales if you are selling via your website.



Estimate your needs for materials and describe the agreements with suppliers, including the length and terms you have arranged to fulfill those needs. You may also give the backgrounds of your major suppliers and show that you have backup sources available should problems develop.Related: What Equipment and Facilities to Include in Your Business PlanYou'll first need to estimate the number and type of people you will require to run your plan. Startups can do this by looking at competitors' plants or by relying on the founders' prior experience at other companies. Existing firms can extrapolate what they'll need to expand from current operations.Next, show that you can reasonably expect to be able to hire what you need. Look at local labor pools, unemployment rates, and wage levels using information from chambers of commerce or similar entities. If you plan to import sizable numbers of workers, check out housing availability and build an expense for moving costs into your budget.

56,How to Make a Cash Flow Statement,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-make-a-cash-flow-statement/462315,"
The cash flow statement monitors the flow of cash over a period of time (a year, a quarter, a month) and shows you how much cash you have on hand at the moment.The cash flow statement, also called the statement of changes in financial position, probes and analyzes changes that have occurred on the balance sheet. It's different from the income statement, which describes sales and profits but doesn't necessarily tell you where your cash came from or how it's being used.Related: How to Write an Income Statement for Your Business PlanA cash flow statement consists of two parts. One follows the flow of cash into and out of the company. The other shows how the funds were spent. The two parts are called, respectively, sources of funds and uses of funds. At the bottom is, naturally, the bottom line, called net changes in cash position. It shows whether you improved your cash position and by how much during the period.



You Can Be Profitable and Cash Poor at the Same TimeNoah Parsons writes in 5 Tips for More Accurate and Useful Cash Flow Forecasts: ""Remember, profits aren't the same as cash. Profitable companies can run out of cash, and they frequently do because of poor cash flow planning. Here's a very quick explanation of why this occurs:When your business makes a sale to a customer, but that customer takes 30 or even 60 days to pay their bill, the amount of the sale does show up on the Profit and Loss Statement (also called a P&L or income statement), potentially increasing your profits. But that cash doesn't show up in your bank account until the customer actually pays you. So, your business could make a lot of sales and be profitable, but at the same time be low on cash because customers haven't actually paid for their products or services yet.""Related: How to Make Realistic Financial ForecastsSources of FundsSources of funds usually has two main sections in it. The first shows cash from sales or other operations. In the cash flow statement, this figure represents all the money you collected from accounts during this period. It may include all the sales you booked during the period, plus some collections on sales that actually closed earlier.


Related: 4 Crucial Signs That Your Small Business Needs FundingThe other category of sources of funds includes interest income, if any, plus the proceeds from any loans, line of credit drawdowns, or capital received from investors during the period. Again, these figures represent money actually received during the period. If you arranged for a $100,000 line of credit but only used $10,000 during this period, your sources of funds would show $10,000.Uses of FundsThe sources of funds section often has only a few entries, although some cash statements break out sources of funds by businesses and product lines. But even simple statements show several uses of funds. A cash flow statement will normally show uses such as cost of goods sold; sales, general, and administrative expense (SG&A); and any equipment purchases, interest payments, payments on principal amounts of loans, and dividends or draws taken by the owners.Related: 80% of Businesses Fail Due To a Lack of Cash. Here are 4 Reasons Why Cash Flow Forecasting Is So ImportantNet Change in CashFew things feel better for a startup businessperson than having plenty of cash in the bank. And few things offer a better picture of what's going on with cash on hand than the net change in cash line on your business plan. Net change in cash equals the difference between total funds in and total funds out. If you bring in $1 million and send out $900,000, your net change in cash is $100,000. Ideally, you want this number to be positive and, if possible, showing an upward trend.The Problem With Too Much CashIs it possible to have too much cash? In fact, it is. If your cash is simply sitting in a bank account, it may be drawing little or no interest. In a typical inflationary environment, it will often lose purchasing power from one day to the next. If you have large amounts of cash and nothing to do with it, consider reinvesting in your company—or perhaps another.Related: How to Use Your Business Plan to Track Performance


Other Financial InformationIf you're seeking investors for your company, you'll probably need to provide quite a bit more financial information than what is in the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. For instance, a personal finance statement may be needed if you're guaranteeing loans yourself. Applying business data to other ratios and formulas will yield important information on what your profit margin is and what level of sales it will take for you to reach profitability. Still other figures, such as the various ratios, will help predict whether you'll be able to pay your bills for long. These bits of information are helpful to you as well as to investors, it should be noted. Understanding and, if possible, mastering them will help you run your business more smoothly.Related: How to Use Financial Ratios to Understand the Health of Your Business

Understanding your customers' needs, preferences, and pain points allows you to tailor your products or services to meet their expectations. But many entrepreneurs overlook or undervalue this essential step.""When starting a business, getting to know your customers is one of the most important things you need to do,"" says Noah Parsons, COO of Palo Alto Software. ""If you don't understand your customer, you don't know how you can help solve their problems. You don't know what kind of marketing messages and advertising will work. You don't know if your product or service is actually something your customers will spend money on.""Related: 5 Must-Answer Questions to Succeed Targeting Your Customer BaseThe basic questions you'll try to answer about your customers include:Who are they? Describe them in terms of age, occupation, income, lifestyle, educational attainment, etc.Also include some information on their psychographics, which classify customers according to their activities, interests, and opinions. Although an imperfect science, a psychographic analysis of your marketplace can yield essential marketing insights.What do they buy now? Describe their buying habits relating to your product or service, including how much they buy, their favored suppliers, the most popular features, and the predominant price points.Why do they buy? This is the tricky one, attempting as it does to delve into consumers' heads. Answers will depend on the product and its uses. Cookware buyers may buy the products that offer the most effective nonstick surfaces, or those that give the most pans in a package for a given amount of money, or those that come in the most decorative colors.

You've made strategic hires, filling critical positions in the company that will lead you to success. Now, it's time to consider going outside your office walls for insights and guidance in finance, operations, marketing, legal matters, or any other industry-specific knowledge. This expertise can be crucial in navigating the challenges that await you.Related: Forming a Board of AdvisorsBoard of Directors A board of directors gives you access to expertise, provided you choose them wisely. Technically, the officers of a corporation report to the board of directors, who bear the ultimate responsibility for the proper management of the company. Most boards will have financial, marketing, and organizational experts. Such a board lends great credibility to a company. Board members can provide more than oversight and sounding board skills; they also provide a wealth of contacts and referrals.Related: Need Guidance at Your Startup? Create an Advisory Board Keeping These 3 Things in Mind.



Board of Advisors A board of advisors is a less formal entity. You can have the same kind of people on an advisory board, but you don't report to them, and they don't have the same power as a board of directors. Beware of creating a rubber-stamp board. You need the variety and breadth of experience and skills a board (of directors or advisors) brings to the table. Running a business is hard enough without adding an echo chamber. Your board should be able to challenge your thinking, help you solve knotty problems, and even change management if necessary.Your board members and their reasons for being included should be a brief part of your longer business plan, not the mini-plan. .Outside Professionals Some of the most important people who'll do work for you won't work for you. Your attorney, accountant, and insurance broker are all crucial members of your team. A good professional in one of these slots can go a long way toward helping you succeed. The same may be true, to a lesser extent, for real estate brokers, management consultants, benefits consultants, computer consultants, trainers, and both creative and IT help.Your business plan should reassure readers that your bases are covered in these critical professional positions. Readers don't necessarily want to see an attorney on staff. It's okay that you merely state that you retain the services of an attorney in private practice on an as-needed basis. Often, it's more prudent to show that you are not spending money on full-timers you don't need.

59,How to Identify Market Trends in Your Business Plan,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/how-to-identify-market-trends-in-your-business-plan/459655,"
Timing in business is everything.And the best time to address a trend is before it is even beginning and certainly before it is widely recognized. If you can prepare a business that satisfies a soon-to-be popular need, you can generate growth that is practically off the scale. (This is, by the way, the combination that venture capitalists favor most.) The problem, of course, is spotting the trends first and acting quickly before others jump in line ahead of you.Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape Communications, had the good fortune to develop software for browsing the web just as the internet, which had been around for twenty years, was coming to widespread popular attention. The timing of his move made him hundreds of millions of dollars, but some browser developers who came later fell by the wayside.Related: Your Guide to Gaining a Competitive Edge and Succeeding as an Entrepreneur Over the Next 5 Years



How to Identify TrendsWhat is a trend? Loosely defined, it is a series of occurrences that indicates a pattern. You can use a couple of techniques to identify trends and present your identifications in your plan. Some trend analysts look at past events (usually trends themselves) and project them forward. For example, trend analysts in recent years have looked at the huge numbers of baby boomers, people born in the years between 1946 and 1964. They then projected forward to see that these baby boomers would be retiring in the near future and saw a defined market for that segment of the population.Another good way to forecast trends is by test marketing. You try to sell something in a single store and see how it does before you roll it out in your whole chain. The key to this technique is trying it in a well-selected test market that closely resembles the market you'll try to sell to later.Related: Profit From Current FadsFocus groups and surveys try to catch hold of trends by asking people what's hot. You can ask open-ended questions: What type of apps or new mobile phone features would you like to see? Or show them product samples and see how they react. This is also tricky because you are dealing with a small group of, you hope, representative people and extrapolating to a larger group. If your group isn't representative, your results may be misleading.


Related: 5 Must-Haves for Entrepreneurs and Their Startups to be SuccessfulSome other ways you can try to nail a trend in advance: Talk to salespeople who are in touch with customer needs, quiz executives whose jobs are to watch the big picture, read a wide variety of periodicals and try to spot connections, or hire think tanks of experts to brainstorm over what the future might hold.In most of these trend-forecasting techniques, statistics play a big role. Mathematicians assign numerical values to variables such as loyalty to existing brands, then build a model that can indicate invisible trends to intuitive analysis. Providing some statistics in the trends section of your plan can make it more convincing.Related: How to Identify and Research Your Competition

A manufacturer will likely need all sorts of equipment, such as cars, trucks, computers, telecom systems, and machinery of every description for bending metal, milling wood, forming plastic, or otherwise making a product out of raw materials. A lot of this equipment is expensive and hard to move or sell once purchased.Moreover, manufacturers often require a facility to house this equipment and operate the business.Related: How to List Personel and Materials in Your Business PlanNaturally, investors are very interested in your plans for purchasing equipment and facilities. But this part of your plan doesn't have to be long—just be sure it's complete.



Make a list of every sizable piece of equipment you anticipate needing. Include a description of its features, its functions, and, of course, its cost. In addition, list all facilities you plan on buying or leasing.Be ready to defend the need to own the more expensive items. Bankers and other investors are loath to plunk down money for capital equipment that can be resold only for far less than its purchase price. Also, consider leasing what you need if you are starting out. Once you show that you are responsible for paying your bills and sales look good, you can apply for a small business loan or a line of credit with greater success.Related: How to Write an Operations Plan for ManufacturersFacilitiesUnless you're a globe-trotting consultant whose office is his suitcase, your plan will need to describe the facilities in which your business will be housed. Even home-based business owners now describe their home offices as the trend continues to snowball, thanks largely to mobile communications.


Land and buildings are often the largest capital items on any company's balance sheet. So it makes sense to go into detail about what you have and what you need. Decide first how much space you require in square feet. Don't forget to include room for expansion if you anticipate growth. Now consider the location. You may need to be close to a labor force and materials suppliers. Transportation needs, such as proximity to rail, interstate highways, or airports, can also be important. Next, ask whether there is any specific layout that you need.Related: What Technology to Include In Your Business PlanDraw up a floor plan to see if your factory floor can fit into the space you have in mind. Manufacturers today do most of their ordering and communications online, so you need to ensure that your location has excellent connectivity.To determine the cost of facilities, you'll first have to decide whether you will lease or buy space and what your rent or mortgage payments will be for the chosen option. Don't forget to include brokerage fees, moving costs, and the cost of any leasehold improvements you'll need. Finally, take a look at operating costs. Utilities, including phone, electric, gas, water, and trash pickup are concerns; also consider such costs as your computer connections, possibly satellite connections, maintenance, and general upkeep.Related: Bursting at the Seams?

You should also consider your need to acquire or protect such valuable operations assets as proprietary processes and patented technologies.

Let's face it, every new and successful enterprise is the result of someone with an idea. People aren't going to finance you without knowing your idea. Sometimes the idea is so powerful that it generates a tremendous response right off the bat. This is unusual, but it does happen—it's when the reader stops you and says, ""You don't have to tell me anymore; I'm sold."" More often, you'll need to explain why your idea has merit and how it can solve a common problem by making things easier, faster, or cheaper for the prospective customer(s).Related: How to Write a Business Plan Executive Summary That Sells Your IdeaBusiness ideas that no one has ever thought of are rare. So are new inventions. But new spins on old ideas are plentiful. Some of these are game changers, while others simply give consumers something new that solves a problem or makes some aspect of life easier. Then there are ideas that fall into the ""same old, same old"" category. No matter how brilliantly crafted, written, and presented your business plan is, it will be difficult to win your investors, and later customers, with an old idea that does not have a new twist. Therefore, you want to wow them first with your idea! If they're not interested, no matter what your financials are, they won't help.How Much Cash Do You Need?If you are using your plan as a financing proposal, and you probably are, put this information right up front. Are you seeking a loan, convertible debt, or equity investment? What terms, both in interest and length of loan, are you requesting? If equity, what is the probable exit strategy—and when will the exit strategy be executed?



Some readers will stop right here. That's fine. Other readers will appreciate your frankness. Being coy about amounts and terms will only harm your venture.Related: How to Craft a Business Plan That Will Turn Investors' HeadsHow Will You Use the Cash?Provide a short explanation of how you'll use any financing you seek. Tell the investor why you need the money. Nobody wants to lend you money if they don't know exactly why you need it. It's not necessary to get into much detail here—just make it clear that you need it for x, y, and z. You don't have to justify every penny and wind up feeling obligated to ask for a loan of $23,558.36 because that's the exact price of everything you need. You should also let the reader know how the investment will help the company grow and/or increase its profits. Why else would you be seeking funding? The best use of somebody else's money is to buy or build something that will make more money, both for you and for that person.Related: Executive Summary


Understand the Goals of FinanciersIn your executive summary, consider the following:Friends and family want to get their money back someday but are not very interested in timing and returns.Bankers look for free cash flow to pay back the principal and interest of their loans. They also look closely at management experience and marketing. They may ask for collateral. By law they have to be conservative, that is, risk-averse, so they are not great candidates for risky financing.Angel investors look for moderate rates of return, usually above the prime rate, plus some capital appreciation. They sometimes want to be involved at a hands-on level.Venture capitalists seek annual compound rates of return in the area of 35 to 50 percent per annum. They seldom want to go longer than three to five years to cash out. They always want to know what the exit strategy is.Related: How to Create a Business Plan Investors Will LoveYou may have special considerations to address in any given plan, depending on its target. For instance, you may know or suspect that one of the conditions of getting a loan from your parents is that you employ your black-sheep cousin. Be sure your summary of management has a slot—Director of Ephemera might work—for that unworthy individual.Don't forget yourself: It's a rare company that doesn't have any investment from the entrepreneur or entrepreneurs who started it.Who Will Own What?When a business starts generating profits and plowing them back into the firm, value can build rapidly. Even if you aren't in an industry likely to purchase buildings or patent valuable technology, the business derives value from the fact that it can generate profits into the future.Because your business is valuable, spell out who owns what. If you have many equity investors coupled with a pile of creditors, this can get pretty complicated.For the summary section of your plan, a basic description such as ""Ownership of the company will be divided so that each of the four original partners owns 25 percent"" will suffice. If you have to negotiate details of exactly what any equity investors will get, there's time to do that later. For now, you just want to give people an idea of how the ownership will be divided.


Related: Why You Shouldn't Send Your Business Plan to InvestorsIt's Not All About MoneyNo matter if you're sharing your plan with an investor, customer, or team member, your plan needs to show that you're passionate, dedicated, and that you actually care about your business and the plan. You can also discuss the mistakes that you've learned from, list the problems that you're hoping to solve, describe your values, and establish what makes you stand out from the competition.By explaining why you care about your business, you create an emotional connection with your readers so that they'll support you, your team, and your organization.Related: Turn Your Business Plan Into Money!Bonus Business Plan PointersAssessing your own strengths and weaknesses is a lot harder than assessing others' good and bad points, right? So when it comes time to select your best features, it's also time to solicit feedback from others. Ask people whose opinions you trust, such as colleagues, associates, and peers, whether your assessment of your idea is off-base or on target.""The executive summary provides quick access to critical information from your more detailed business plan. It is essential for informing anyone outside of your business. Many people—including investors and bankers—will only read your summary. Others will use it to decide if they should read the rest. For you, it is a snapshot of your business to reference when planning or revising your strategy. Now if you're writing a business plan solely for internal use you may not need an executive summary. However, some internal plans—such as an annual operations plan or a strategic plan—benefit from having a summary. It takes some effort to do a good summary, so if you don't have a business use in mind, don't do it."" — from ""How to Write an Executive Summary"" by Tim BerryRelated: The Main Objectives of a Business Plan

62,Use This Worksheet to Write a Product Description That Sells,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/use-this-worksheet-to-write-a-product-description-that-sells/459641,"
Every business has something to sell, and the product section is where you tell readers what it is you're selling. (For simplicity's sake, the term ""product"" is used to refer to both products and services unless otherwise indicated.) This is clearly a very important section of your plan. Even if you have assembled a brilliant managerial team, or have strong financial underpinnings, unless you have something to sell or at least plans to develop something new, you don't really have a business at all. Business is about providing people with something they need. Your business should solve a problem, make life easier, expedite a process, or even simply entertain, but you need to be selling something to have a business.Although many businesses are founded to develop new, never-before-seen products, they're still built around a product, even though it may not exist at the moment. And even for these development-stage enterprises, it's just as important to describe the planned-for product and make a presentation that illustrates what people can expect.Related: How to Craft a Business Plan That Will Turn Investors' HeadsWhat Is Your Product or Service?It's easy to talk eloquently about a product you believe in. Some highly marketing-oriented businesses, in fact, are built as much on the ability to wax rhapsodic about a product as they are on the ability to buy or source compelling products to begin with. Think of J. Peterman, the catalog operation that became famous—and highly successful—by selling prosaic products with the help of romantic, overblown advertising copy, prior to going bankrupt in 1999.



It's important in your plan to be able to build a convincing case for the product or service upon which your business will be built. The product description section is where you do that.Related: How to Write a Business PlanProduct Description WorksheetFeatures describe the make, shape, form, or appearance of a product, the characteristics that you use to describe products. These features convey benefits to the customer. Benefits (perceived benefits) are the emotional or other end results that your product or service provides that customer, the satisfaction or fulfillment of needs that a customer receives from your products or services. In the famous phrase, ""My factories make cosmetics, we sell hope,"" cosmetics are the products, hope is the benefit.Here are a few sample product descriptions:Street Beat is a new type of portable electronic rhythm machine used to create musical backgrounds for street dances, fairs, concerts, picnics, sporting events, and other outdoor productions. The product is less costly than a live rhythm section and offers better sound quality than competing systems. Its combination of features will appeal to sports promoters, fair organizers, and charitable and youth organizations.Troubleshooting Times is the only monthly magazine for the nation's 6,000 owners of electronics repair shops. It provides timely news of industry trends, service product reviews, and consumer product service tips written in a language service shop owners can understand. HOBO, the Home Business Organization, provides business consulting services to entrepreneurs who work out of their homes. The group connects home business owners with experts who have extensive experience counseling home business owners in management, finance, marketing, and lifestyle issues. Unlike entrepreneurial peer groups, which charge members for attending sessions whether or not they receive useful advice, HOBO will guarantee its services, asking home business owners to pay only if they derive solid benefit from the service.Related: How to Define Your Product and Set Your PricesA business plan product description has to be less image-conscious than an advertising brochure but more appealing than a simple spec sheet. You don't want to give the appearance of trying to dazzle readers with a glitzy product sales pitch filled with a lot of hype. On the other hand, you want to give them a sampling of how you are going to position and promote the product.And remember, a business plan product description is not only concerned with consumer appeal. Issues of manufacturability are of paramount concern to plan readers, who may have seen any number of plans describing exciting products that, in the end, proved impossible to design and build economically.


If your product or service has special features that will make it easy to build and distribute, say so. For instance, the portable rhythm machine maker should point out in the business plan that the devices will be constructed using new special-purpose integrated circuits derived from military applications, which will vastly increase durability and quality while reducing costs.Related: The Basics of Writing a Business PlanPlan Pointer: Get CreativeNo ideas to differentiate your product? Steal someone else's. That is, combine your product with another to create something new. Dry cleaners do this when they offer coupons for the neighborhood pizza parlor—which gives out cleaning coupons with each pie. It's called cooperative marketing.

63,Customers and Investors Don't Want Products. They Want Solutions.,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/customers-dont-want-products-they-want-solutions/459649,"
To convert buyers and investors, sharing product knowledge is important, but you need more. Sure, you have to know the products and services you sell in detail. But product knowledge alone is useless, and that is where many marketing plans run afoul of the first law of marketing: Put the Customer First. Customers don't buy products or services. They buy solutions to problems, relief from an itch, satisfaction of a felt need. In short, they buy benefits.Benefits Are Not FeaturesFeatures are characteristics of products or services that are independent of the buyer's perceptions. A tractor lawn mower may have a 3 hp gas motor, be green with a natty yellow design, have a warranty good for two years, and cost $1,695, payable in twelve easy monthly installments. Those are all features.The benefits to the buyer include confidence (3 hp is plenty powerful for a suburban lawn and will carry its owner in comfort up and down gentle slopes), prestige (John Deere knows how to make its buyers feel good), and convenience and economy (price and terms). Benefits perceived will differ from one customer to the next—another buyer might buy the same lawn mower because his son-in-law is the dealer, or because his neighbor says it's a great machine, or just because it caught his eye.Related: Use This Worksheet to Write a Product Description That SellsThe key point is that benefits are dependent on the perceptions of the market, whereas features are dependent on the product or service.The perceptions of the market are determined only by research. Armchair research does not count. If you know your market and study your demographics, you will know what your customers perceive to be of value. Then and only then can you safely match your products or services to their demands. You get to know what your markets want by asking them, by knowing them, by researching their buying behaviors. Some of this is almost subliminal—but what sets the big winners apart is that they take the extra time to do this research.Cover Your BehindTo a typical consumer who's purchased her share of shoddy products from uncooperative manufacturers, it's encouraging to hear about a multimillion-dollar settlement of a consumer's claim against some manufacturer. It provides proof that the high and mighty can be humbled and that some poor schmuck can be struck by lightning and receive a big fat check.Related: How to Define Your Product and Set Your Prices



To manufacturers and distributors of products, however, the picture looks entirely different. Liability lawsuits have changed the landscape of a number of industries, from toy manufacturers to children's furniture retailers. If you visit public swimming pools these days, for instance, you don't see the diving boards that used to grace the deep ends of almost all such recreational facilities. The reason is that fear of lawsuits from injured divers, along with the allied increase in liability insurance premiums, have made these boards no longer financially feasible.If you're going to come out with a diving board or offer diving board maintenance services, you need to be prepared for this legal issue. Dealing with it may be as simple as merely including a statement to the effect that you foresee no significant liability issues arising from your sale of this product or service. If there is a liability issue, real or apparent, acknowledge it and describe how you will deal with it in your plan. For instance, you may want to take note of the fact that, like all marketers of children's bedroom furniture, you attach warning labels and disclaimers to all your products and also carry a liability insurance policy. In fact, warning labels may seem ridiculous, but in a litigation-crazed society, you will actually see labels such as the one on a portable stroller that read, ""Please remove child before folding."" Really? Funny as it may sound, let it be known that you will take all necessary steps to protect your business, your products, and yourself from litigation.Related: 9 Sales and Marketing Tips for StartupsYou must have an attorney's advice on almost anything you plan to market. A layman's opinion on whether a product is more or less likely to generate lawsuits is not worth including in a plan.On the subject of liability, here is a good place to deal with the question of whether you are already being sued for a product's perceived failings and, if so, how you plan to deal with it. If you can't find an answer, you may wind up like private aircraft manufacturers, many of which were forced out of the business by increases in lawsuits following crashes.It's often difficult to get an attorney to commit himself on paper about the prospects for winning or losing a lawsuit. Many times, plans handle this with a sentence saying something along the lines of, ""Our legal counsel advises us the plaintiff's claims are without merit.""Related: I Watch Great Teams Make These Business-Destroying Mistakes All The Time.

64,What Is Your Unique Selling Proposition? Use This Worksheet to Find Your Greatest Strength.,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/use-this-worksheet-to-find-your-unique-selling-proposition/459642,"
Unique selling proposition is a term for whatever it is that makes you different from and better than the competition in the eyes of your customers. It's why they buy from you instead of from someone else.What Makes It Worthwhile?A product description is more than a mere listing of product features. You have to highlight your product's most compelling characteristics, such as low cost or uniquely high quality, that will make it stand out in the marketplace and attract buyers willing to pay your price. Even the simplest product has a number of unique potential selling strengths.Many of the common unique selling strengths are seemingly contradictory. How can both mass popularity and exclusive distribution be strengths? The explanation is that it depends on your market and what its buyers want.Related: Testing Your Values, Living Your Brand



Features. If your product is faster, bigger, or smaller, or comes in more colors, sizes, and configurations than others on the market, you have a powerful selling strength. In fact, if you can't offer some combination of features that sets you apart, you'll have difficulty writing a convincing plan.Price. Everybody wants to pay less for a product. If you can position yourself as the low-cost provider (and make money at these rock-bottom prices), you have a powerful selling advantage. Conversely, high-priced products may appeal to many markets for their better quality and high-end value. People with discerning tastes want quality and do not buy based solely on price points, so saving money is not always the issue. Price is also dependent on other issues such as service. People will pay more for good customer service.Time Savings. People buy products to help them expedite a process. If yours is faster and can help your customers get out of the office and on their way home more quickly, they want it. Today, everyone is looking to save time, so products and services that help people do that are valuable.Ease of Transport. The mobile world has taken over. People are using their mobile phones to go online as much if not more than their laptops. How mobile is your product? Today's consumers like to take things with them—they want apps and gadgets that are portable.


Related: How to Define Your Product and Set Your PricesAvailability. Typically, the more easily accessible your products are the better it is for business. In most cases, you want to have products and services that people can get quickly. Today, thanks to the internet, you no longer need brick-and-mortar locations in many communities. Scarcity, however, can also generate a higher demand, so you may have a marketing plan to release products at intervals and let the demand—and the desire—build. Scarcity doesn't mean that you will be running out anytime soon. For service providers, availability means a good location or locations that are easy to get to.Cutting Edge/New. If you have something to offer that is not on the market, this is a major selling point or competitive edge. Get out there and patent it, market it, and sell it before someone comes along and steals your thunder. You can also utilize technology to build upon products or services you already provide, such as an app.Training and Support. These are components of service that have become increasingly important, particularly for high-technology products. For many sophisticated software products and electronic devices, a seller who can't provide tech support to buyers will have no chance of success.Related: Use This Worksheet to Write a Product Description That SellsFinancing. Whether you ""tote the note"" and guarantee credit to anyone, offer innovative leasing, do buybacks, or have other financing alternatives, you'll find that giving people different, more convenient ways to pay can lend your product a convincing strength.Customer Service. Excellent service is perhaps the most important thing you can add to any product or service today. In a world where word travels fast through social media, you want to provide top-notch customer service. The shoe giant Zappos has built its reputation by providing excellent customer service. Make this a top priority.


Reputation. Why do people pay $10,000 for a Rolex? The Rolex reputation is the reason. At its most extreme, reputation can literally keep you in business, as is the case with many companies, such as IBM and Walmart, whose well-developed reputations have tided them over in hard times.Knowledge. Your knowledge and the means you have of imparting that to customers is an important part of your total offering. Retailers of auto parts, home improvement supplies, and all sorts of other goods have found that simply having knowledgeable salespeople who know how to replace the water pump in a '95 Chevy will lure customers in and encourage them to buy.Experience. ""We've been there. We've done thousands of installations like yours, and there's no doubt we can make this one work as well."" Nothing could be more soothing to a skeptical sales prospect than to learn that the seller has vast experience at what he's doing. If you have ample experience, make it part of your selling proposition.Fast Delivery. Nobody wants to wait for anything anymore. If you can offer overnight shipping, on-site service, or 24/7 availability, it can turn an otherwise unremarkable product or service into a very attractive one.Related: How to Effectively Promote Your Business to Customers and InvestorsEndorsements. There's a reason Peyton Manning makes millions of dollars a year from endorsements. People want to relate to Peyton and share his aura, if only obliquely.Other Factors. There are many wild cards unique to particular products, or perhaps simply little used in particular industries, with which you can make your product stand out. For instance, consider a service agreement guarantee. When consumers know they can get a product repaired under a service guarantee or return a faulty product for a refund, they're often more likely to buy it over otherwise superior competitors offering less powerful warranties.


Unique Selling Proposition WorksheetWhen you've explained the selling propositions associated with your product in each of these categories, give each one a score from one to ten based on your evaluation of how convincing a case you can make for that being a unique selling proposition. The one or two strengths with the highest scores will be your candidates for inclusion in your business plan product description.Common Plan PitfallDon't count on getting your product into a major retailer on its own merits. The glut of tens of thousands of new products introduced annually, combined with the existing plethora of more than 30,000 products stocked by a typical supermarket, puts retailers in the driver's seat. They demand—and get from almost all new product makers—slotting fees, which are simply payments for the right to be on store shelves. The same goes for big online retailers like Amazon.Related: Who Is Your Customer? 4 Questions to Ask.

65,How to Write a Business Plan Executive Summary That Sells Your Idea,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-write-an-executive-summary-that-sells-your-idea/459521,"
The first part of your plan that anybody will see, after the title page and table of contents, is the executive summary. This could be considered an expanded table of contents (in prose form) because it's more than an introduction to the rest of the plan. It's supposed to be a brief look at the key elements of the whole plan—and it's critical.Executive Summaries Sell IdeasThe actual executive summary should be only a page or two. In it you may include your mission and vision statements, a brief sketch of your plans and goals, a quick look at your company and its organization, an outline of your strategy, and highlights of your financial status and needs. If you've ever read a CliffsNotes version of a classic novel, you get the idea. Your executive summary is the CliffsNotes of your business plan.Related: Executive SummaryLabor over your summary. Polish it. Refine it. Ask friends and colleagues to take a look at it, and then take their suggestions to heart. If your plan isn't getting the response that you want when you put it to work, suspect a flaw in the summary. If you get a chance to look at another plan that was used to raise a pile of cash, give special scrutiny to the executive summary.



The summary is the most important part of your whole plan. Even if a plan is relatively short, it's difficult for most people to keep that much information in their minds at once. It's much easier to get your arms around the amount of information—just one or two pages—in an executive summary. Your plan is going to be judged on what you include in the summary and on how well you present it.A good rule of thumb for writing an effective and efficient business plan is to avoid repeating information. Brief is better and clearer, and needless repetition may annoy some readers and confuse others. Take extra care when writing your summary. You'll be glad you did.Related: How to Craft a Business Plan That Will Turn Investors' HeadsUltimately, you want the executive summary to be as strong as possible because it is also the first thing people read in your plan, and we all know the power of a strong first impression. This is where you want to wow people and make them think. This is like the coming attractions, or trailers, at the movie theater. You want that trailer to be enticing and bring the audience members back to see the film. Likewise, you want your readers to want to read your plan.


Your Business Plan's Elevator PitchAs Tim Berry writes in his article How to Write an Executive Summary: ""The executive summary is like an elevator pitch. You're selling someone on reading your full plan while quickly summarizing the key points. Readers will expect it to cover certain areas of your business—such as the product, market, and financial highlights, at the very least. While you need to include what's necessary, you should also highlight areas that you believe will spark the reader's interest. Remember, you're telling the brief but convincing story of your business with this summary. Just be sure that you're able to back it up with the right details with the rest of your business plan.""Related: How to Write a Business PlanWhen Should You Write Your Executive Summary?Because the executive summary comes first in your plan, you may think you should write it first as well. Actually, you should write it last, after you've spent considerable time mulling over every other part of your plan. Only then will you truly be able to produce a summary of all that is there. Returning to the CliffsNotes analogy, it's impossible to summarize a book until the book is written.Purposes of the Executive SummaryThe executive summary has to perform a host of jobs. First and foremost, it should grab the reader's attention. It has to briefly hit the high points of your plan. It should point readers to questions requiring detailed responses to the full-length sections of your plan where they can get answers. It should ease the task of anybody whose job it is to read it, and it should make that task enjoyable by presenting an interesting and compelling account of your company.The first question any investor has is, ""How much?"" followed closely by, ""When will I recoup my investment?"" Perceived risk and exit strategies are supportive information, and these in turn are supported by the quality of the management team and the proposed strategies.Related: Why You Shouldn't Send Your Business Plan to InvestorsIt doesn't much matter whether you are presenting the plan to a family member, friend, banker, or sophisticated investors such as investment bankers or venture capitalists. They all need the same information. Concealing the amount and terms will only lessen your chances of successful financing.


How Long Should an Executive Summary Be?Five minutes. This is how long an average reader will spend with your plan. If you can't convey the basics of your business in that time, your plan is in trouble. So make sure your summary, at least, can be read in that time and that it's as comprehensive as possible within that constraint. If you are using a deck, limit yourself to one slide and one minute of comments.Related: How to Create a Business Plan Investors Will LovePoints to Include in an Executive SummaryA suggested format for an executive summary:The business idea and why it is necessary. What problem does it solve?How much will it cost, and how much financing are you seeking?What will the return be to the investor? Over what length of time?What is the perceived risk level?Where does your idea fit into the marketplace?What is the management team?What are the product and competitive strategies?What is your marketing plan?What is your exit strategy?If you can address each of these in two or three sentences, you will have a twenty to twenty-seven-sentence executive summary.Company DescriptionIf your company is complex, you'll need a separate section inside the plan with a heading like ""Company Description"" to describe its many product lines, locations, services, or whatever else it is that makes it a little too complicated to deal with quickly. In any event, you provide a brief description, no longer than a few sentences, of your company in the executive summary. And for many firms, this is an adequate basic description of their company. Here are some one- or two-sentence (mock) company descriptions:John's Handball Hut is the Hamish Valley's leading purveyor of handball equipment and clothing.


Boxes Boxes Boxes Inc. will provide the people of the metropolitan area with a comprehensive source for packing materials, containers, and other supplies for the do-it-yourself move.Salem Segway Witch Tours offers tourists the only Segway tours of the infamous home of the seventeenth-century witch trials.Related: Turn Your Business Plan Into Money!Optional InformationThe following items are not a necessity in your business plan: mission statement and corporate vision. If you have honed either down to a clear and concise sentence, by all means, use it in your plan.Mission StatementA mission statement is a sentence or two describing the company's function, market, competitive advantages, and business goals and philosophies.Many mission statements communicate what your business is about and should include a description of what makes you different from everybody else in your field. Mission statements have a place in a plan: They help investors and other interested parties get a grip on what makes your company special. A mission statement should be clearly written.

A small software company whose mission statement included the goal of ""putting Microsoft out of business"" would be looked upon as foolishly naive.In a vision statement, however, just those sorts of grandiose, galactic-scale images are perfectly appropriate. When you ""vision""—to borrow the management consultant's trick of turning nouns into verbs—you imagine the loftiest heights you could scale, not the next step or several steps on the ladder.Does a vision statement even have a place in a business plan? You could argue that it doesn't, especially because many include personal components such as ""to love every minute of my work and always feel I'm doing my best."" But many investors deeply respect visionary entrepreneurs. So, if you feel you have a compelling vision, there's no reason not to share it in your plan.Related: 6 Tips for Making a Winning Business Presentation


Extract the EssenceThe key to the executive summary is to pick out the best aspects of every part of your plan. In other words, you want to extract the essence. Instead of describing everyone in your company, talk only about your key managers. Instead of talking about all your products, mention only the major ones or discuss only product lines instead of individual products. It's a highlight reel, so to speak.Article Tools and Summarizing the SummaryWithin the overall outline of the business plan, the executive summary will follow the title page. The summary should tell the reader what you are planning to do. All too often, the business owner's desires are buried and lost when the reader scrolls through. Clearly state what you are planning to do (your ideas) and what you are seeking in the summary.The statement should be kept short and businesslike, ideally no more than half a page. It could be longer, depending on how complicated the use of funds may be, but the summary of a business plan, like the summary of a loan application, is generally no more than one page. Within that space you'll need to provide a synopsis of the entire business plan. Key elements that should be included are:Financial requirements. Clearly states the capital needed to start or expand the business. Detail how the capital will be used and the equity, if any, that will be provided for funding. If the loan for initial capital will be based on security instead of equity within the company, you should also specify the source of collateral.Related: The One-Paragraph Start-Up PlanBusiness concept. Describes the business, its product(s), and the market it will serve. It should point out just exactly what will be sold, to whom, and why the business will hold a competitive advantage.Financial features. Highlights the important financial points of the business including sales, profits, cash flows, and return on investment. Current business position. Furnishes relevant information about the company, its legal form of operation, when it was formed, the principal owners, and key personnel.


Major achievements. Details any developments within the company that are essential to the success of the business. Major achievements include items like patents, prototypes, location of a facility, any crucial contracts that need to be in place for product development, or results from any test marketing that has been conducted.When writing your statement of purpose, don't waste words. If the executive summary is eight pages, nobody's going to read it because it will be very clear that the business, no matter what its merits, won't be a good investment because the principals are indecisive and don't really know what they want. Make it easy for the reader to realize at first glance both your needs and capabilities.Related: The Main Objectives of a Business Plan

66,How to Determine the Barriers to Entry for Your Business,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/deteriming-the-barriers-to-entry-for-your-business/459663,"
If you want to become a semiconductor manufacturer, you'll need a billion-dollar factory or two. If you want to have a TV network, you'll need programming and cable carriage in the major markets. These problems are called barriers to entry, and they exist to some extent in all industries.Related: How to Evaluate Your Startup Like a VCThe barriers may be monetary, technological, distribution, or market-related, or they may simply be a matter of ownership of prime real estate. (This last is frequently cited as the real competitive advantage of McDonald's. ""Whenever you see a good site, you find out McDonald's already owns it,"" groused one fast-food competitor.)An important part of your business plan is identifying the barriers to entry and how you plan to overcome them. If your business is in automobile manufacturing, you can be assured new competitors are likely to be slow in springing up, thanks to the high overhead cost. But if you're opening up a nail salon, which does not have a considerable overhead, you have more opportunity to get into the game. But there will also be more competitors.



Related: 5 Essential Elements of Your Industry Trends PlanThink twice before deciding barriers to entry are high for all potential competitors. For instance, you need billions of dollars to start a semiconductor company—but not if you contract out fabrication of the silicon chips to a manufacturer. Several years back, many semiconductor startups did exactly that, providing serious competition for rivals who assumed the barrier was too high to allow many new entries.Related: Entering Into a Saturated Market? You Can Still Succeed!Also, be alert for innovative competitors when writing the section of your plan in which you analyze barriers to entry. Some markets are also more saturated than others, and today, some are dominated by the McDonald's of their industry. For example, it's hard to open a bookstore today with Amazon changing how people buy books. In that industry, you must be creative and explore entry into specialty books, mystery books, or another niche within the larger market. Exploring entry points in the marketplace carefully will save you from a disastrous error and will certainly demonstrate to investors that you've thought your plan through and are not jumping to conclusions.

Everything in business is relative. The numbers for your profits, sales, and net worth need to be compared with other components of your business for them to make sense. For instance, a $1 million net profit sounds great. But what if it took sales of $500 million to achieve those profits? That would be a modest performance indeed.To help understand the relative significance of your financial numbers, analysts use financial ratios. These ratios compare various elements of your financial reports to see if the relationships between the numbers make sense based on prior experience in your industry.Related: Financial Ratios Are How You Know If What You're Doing Is WorkingSome of the common ratios and other calculations analysts perform include your company's break-even point, current ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, return on investment, and return on equity. You may not need to calculate all of these. Depending on your industry, you may also find it useful to calculate various others, such as inventory turnover, a useful figure for many manufacturers and retailers. But ratios are highly useful tools for managing, and most are quick and easy to figure out. Becoming familiar with them and presenting the relevant ones in your plan will help you manage your company better and convince investors you are on the right track.



Quick TipThere are four kinds of financial ratios: liquidity ratios like the current ratio, asset management ratios like the sales/receivable cycle, debt management ratios like the debt-to-equity ratio, and profitability ratios like return on investment.Break-Even PointOne of the most important calculations you can make is figuring your break-even point. This is the point at which revenue equals costs. Another way to figure it is to say it's the level of sales you need to get to for gross margin or gross profit to cover all your fixed expenses. Knowing your break-even point is important because when your sales are over this point, they begin to produce profits. When your sales are under this point, you're still losing money. This information is handy for all kinds of things, from deciding how to price your product or service to figuring whether a new marketing campaign is worth the investment.Related: How to Write an Income Statement for Your Business PlanThe process of figuring your break-even point is called break-even analysis. It may sound complicated, and if you were to watch an accountant figure your break-even point, it would seem like a lot of mumbo-jumbo. Accountants calculate figures with all sorts of arcane-sounding labels, such as variable cost percentage and semi-fixed expenses. These numbers may be strictly accurate, but given all the uncertainty there is with projecting your break-even point, there's some question as to whether extra accuracy is worth all that much.


There is, however, a quicker if somewhat dirtier method of figuring break-even. It is described in the below worksheet. Although this approach may not be up to accounting school standards, it is highly useful for entrepreneurs, and more importantly, it can be done quickly, easily, and frequently as conditions change.Related: Tips and Strategies for Using the Balance Sheet as Your Franchise ScorecardOnce you get comfortable with working break-even figures in a simple fashion, you can get more complicated. You may want to figure break-even points for individual products and services. Or you may apply break-even analysis to help you decide whether an advertising campaign is likely to pay any dividends. Perform break-even analyses regularly and often, especially as circumstances change. Hiring more people, changing your product mix, or becoming more efficient all change your break-even point.Break Even WorksheetTo determine your break-even point, start by collecting these two pieces of information:1. Fixed costs. These are inflexible expenses you'll have to make independently of sales volume. Add up your rent, insurance, administrative expenses, interest, office supply costs, maintenance fees, and so on to get this number. Put your fixed costs here: ______________________.2. Average gross profit margin. This will be the average estimated gross profit margin, expressed as a percentage, that you generate from sales of your products and services. Put your average gross profit margin here: ______________________.Now divide the costs by profit margin, and you have your break-even point. Here's the formula:Fixed costs / Profit Margin = Break-even pointIf, for instance, your fixed costs were $10,000 a month and your average gross profit margin was 60 percent, the formula would look like this:$10,000 / .6 = $16,667So in this case, your break-even point is $16,667. When sales are running at $16,667 a month, your gross profits are covering expenses. Fill your own numbers into the following template to figure your break-even point:$________________/________________= $________________Related: How to Calculate Your Net Worth and Grow Your WealthCurrent RatioThe current ratio is an important measure of your company's short-term liquidity. It's probably the first ratio anyone looking at your business will compute because it shows the likelihood that you'll be able to make it through the next twelve months.


Figuring your current ratio is simple. You divide current assets by current liabilities. Current assets consist of cash, receivables, inventory, and other assets likely to be sold for cash in a year. Current liabilities consist of bills that will have to be paid before 12 months pass, including short-term notes, trade accounts payable, and the portion of long-term debt due in a year or less. Here's the formula:Current assets / Current ratio = Current liabilitiesFor example, say you have $50,000 in current assets and $20,000 in current liabilities. Your current ratio would be:$50,000 / 2.5 = $20,000The current ratio is expressed as a ratio: 2.5 to 1, or 2.5:1. That's an acceptable current ratio for many businesses. Anything less than 2:1 is likely to raise questions.Related: How to Make Realistic Financial ForecastsQuick RatioThis ratio has the best name—it's also called the acid-test ratio. The quick ratio is a more conservative version of the current ratio. It works the same way but leaves out inventory and any other current assets that may be a little harder to turn into cash. You'll normally get a lower number with this one than with the current ratio—1:1 is acceptable in many industries.


Sales/Receivables RatioThis ratio shows how long it takes you to get the money owed you. It's also called the average collection period and receivables cycle, among other names. Like most of these ratios, there are various ways of calculating your sales/receivables cycle, but the simplest is to divide your average accounts receivable by your annual sales figure and multiply it by 360, which is considered to be the number of days in the year for many business purposes. Like this:Receivables x 360 = SalesIf your one-person consulting business had an average of $10,000 in outstanding receivables and was doing about $120,000 a year in sales, here's how you'd calculate your receivables cycle:$10,000 x 12 = $120,000 1/12x360=30If you divide one by twelve on a calculator, you'll get .08333, which gives you the same answer, accounting for rounding. Either way, your average collection period is thirty days. This will tell you how long, on average, you'll have to wait to get the check after sending out your invoice. Receivables will vary by customer, of course. You should also check the receivables cycle number against the terms under which you sell. If you sell on thirty-day terms and your average collection period is forty days, there may be a problem that you need to attend to, such as customer dissatisfaction, poor industry conditions, or simply lax collection efforts on your part.Related: The Facts About Financial ProjectionsInventory TurnoverRetailers and manufacturers need to hold inventory, but they don't want to hold any more than they have to because interest, taxes, obsolescence, and other costs eat up profits relentlessly. To find out how good they are at turning inventory into sales, they look at inventory turnovers.


The inventory-turnover ratio takes the cost of goods sold (better known by the acronym COGS) and divides it by inventory. The COGS figure is a total for a set period, usually a year. The inventory is also an average for the year; it represents what that inventory costs you to obtain, whether by building it or by buying it.Average COGS / Average inventory = Inventory turnoverAn example:$500,000 / 4 = $125,000In this example, the company turns over inventory four times a year. You can divide that number into 360 to find out how many days it takes you to turn over inventory. In this case, it would be every ninety days.It's hard to say what is considered to be a good inventory-turnover figure. A low figure suggests you may have too much money sitting around in the form of inventory. You may have slow-moving inventory that should be marked down and sold. A high number for inventory turnover is generally better.Related: How to Measure Franchise Success With Your Income Statement


Debt-to-Equity RatioThis ratio is one that investors will scrutinize carefully. It shows how heavily in debt you are compared with your total assets. It's figured by dividing total debt, both long- and short-term liabilities, by total assets.Total debt / Debt-to-equity ratio = Total assetsHere's a sample calculation:$50,000 / 1:2 = $100,000You want this number to be low to impress investors, especially lenders. A debt-to-equity ratio of 1:2 would be comforting for most lenders. One way to raise your debt-to-equity ratio is by investing more of your own cash in the venture.Related: ROI Isn't Everything — Don't Overlook These 6 'Immeasurable' Metrics That Define Business SuccessProfit on SalesProfit on sales, abbreviated as POS, is your ground-level profitability indicator. Take your net profit before taxes figure and divide it by sales.Profit / Sales = Profit on SalesFor example, if your restaurant earned $100,000 last year on sales of$750,000, this is how your POS calculation would look:$100,000 / $750,000 = 0.133Is 0.133 good? That depends. Like most of these ratios, a good number in one industry may be lousy in another. You need to compare POS figures for other restaurants to see how you did.Return on EquityReturn on equity, often abbreviated as ROE, shows you how much you're getting out of the company as its owner. You figure it by dividing net profit from your income statement by the owner's equity figure—the net worth figure if you're the only owner—from your balance sheet.Net profit / Net worth = Return on equityRelated: Eight (Non-Traditional) Strategic Accounting Secrets To Profitable Restaurants In 2023Return on InvestmentYour investors are interested in the return on investment, or ROI, that your company generates.

Double-entry accounting dates at least from 1340, and the first book on accounting, by a monk named Luca Pacioli, was published in 1494.Surprisingly, a medieval accountant would feel quite comfortable with much of what goes on today in an accounting department. But accountants haven't been sitting back and relaxing during the intervening centuries. They've thought up all kinds of ways to measure the health and wealth of businesses (and businesspeople).Related: How to Use Your Business Plan to Track Performance


There are more ratios, analyses, and calculations than you can shake a green eyeshade at. And wary investors are prone to using a wide variety of those tests to make sure they're not investing in something that went out of style around the time Columbus set sail. So, although accounting may not be your favorite subject, it's a good idea to learn what you can. Otherwise, you're likely to be seen as not much more advanced than a fifteenth-century monk.Buzzword: LiquidityLiquidity measures your company's ability to convert its noncash assets, such as inventory and accounts receivable, into cash.

Companies that make things have certain characteristics that set them apart from others, including retailers and service firms. They take raw materials and labor and transform them into sellable products. Although they may also distribute the products and sell directly to customers (thus involving the retail and service aspects of operations), most manufacturers concentrate on the production end and farm out the retail and service to other firms.Process PointsThe lead actor in manufacturing is the process of production. Product development, marketing, and distribution play essential roles, but the production process sets manufacturers apart from all other enterprises. And the better your production process, the better a manufacturer you will be. It's the star that leads to your company's success.Related: How to Write an Operations Plan for Retail and Sales BusinessesA manufacturing production process consists of several components. One step is usually fabrication, or the making of products from raw materials. There is also assembly of components, testing, and inspection of finished goods.



Manufacturing processes can become highly detailed, as is the case with the many parts found in mobile technology. If you're an operations-minded entrepreneur, you may revel in these details. But control your enthusiasm for such details when writing a business plan.

69,How to Make Realistic Financial Forecasts,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-make-realistic-financial-forecasts/462336,"
Business plans and financing proposals are based on projections. Past financial data can only support your projections. However, financial projections in your business plan express in common financial terms and formats how you expect the immediate future to play out the scenarios you created in the body of the plan. You can forecast financial statements such as balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements to project where you'll be at some point in the future.Forecasts are necessities for startups, which have no past history to report on. Existing businesses find them useful for planning purposes. Forecasts help firms foresee trouble, such as a cash flow shortfall, that is likely to occur several months down the road, as well as give them benchmarks to which they can compare actual performance.Related: The Facts About Financial ProjectionsIt's always advisable to be somewhat conservative in your forecasts.



Forecasts Aren't ForeverNoah Parsons writes in How to Better Manage Your Business by Creating a Live Forecast: ""You need to revisit and update your forecasts. If your budget and forecasts from the beginning of the fiscal year are static and unchanging, it's hard to see how the changes you're planning on making will impact your business financially. It's also hard to communicate the changes you're planning to make to the rest of your team.Related: How to Write an Income Statement for Your Business PlanStatic budgets don't adjust to new situations and in fact, they become more and more outdated as the year goes on. What may have been small variances at the beginning of the year can become larger and larger as actual results naturally differ.Once a budget is stale and outdated, it's easy to ignore because it doesn't reflect the current situation your business is in. And especially during a crisis, when things can fluctuate rapidly, you don't want budgets and forecasts that you just ignore. Having them up to date can mean the difference between survival and growth, or mismanagement and dwindling performance.""

No sales, no business. It's that simple. Even if you're in a long-range development project that won't produce a marketable product for years, you have to be able to look ahead and figure out how much you'll be able to sell before you can do any planning that makes sense.Now that the pressure's on, making a sales projection and the associated income projection may look a little tricky. So let's do it step-by-step.Related: 80% of Businesses Fail Due To a Lack of Cash. Here are 4 Reasons Why Cash Flow Forecasting Is So ImportantFirst pick a period for which you want to make a projection. You should start with a projection for the first year. To do so, you want to come up with some baseline figures. If you're an existing business, look at last year's sales and the sales of prior years. What's the trend? You may then be able to simply project out the 10 percent annual sales increase that you've averaged the past three years for the next three years.If you're a startup and don't have any prior years' figures to look at, look for statistics about other businesses within your industry. The most important question to ask is: What has been the experience of similar companies? If you know that car dealers across the nation have averaged 12 percent annual sales gains, that's a good starting point for figuring your company's projections.You'll also need to do your due diligence to get an idea of how much volume you can expect and what factors will have a positive or negative impact upon your ability to sell.


Related: My Company Hears Hundreds of Pitches Every Year — Here's What Investors Are Actually Looking For.For example, how many people can your restaurant expect to serve in a given day? Statistics of other restaurants may be hard to find, so you may have to do some research by simply watching customers enter and leave a similar type of restaurant for a couple of days during the breakfast, lunch, and dinner hours. Once you get a feel for how many people it is drawing on average, you can begin to estimate how many you may draw. Take into consideration your location vs. its location and the fact that it has regular customers who are familiar with the menu.Statistics you can look at include how many people are within a few miles and what percentage meet your demographics. For example, a family- friendly restaurant wants to know how many families are living nearby, while a fine-dining establishment wants to get statistics on how many people with a higher income are living within a few miles of the establishment.Related: How to Use Your Business Plan to Track PerformanceFor retailers, the difficult part is determining how much market share you can expect. You need to factor in the need for your product in a given community, which can range from local neighborhoods to worldwide if you are selling on the web. Volume will be the toughest thing to estimate. Try to remain conservative in your estimates, knowing that you may not be selling a lot of products or services right off the bat.Forecasting expenses is your next step, and it's much easier. You can often take your prior year's cost of goods sold, adjust it either up or down based on trends in costs, and go with that. The same goes for rent, wages, and other expenses. Even startups can often find good numbers on which to forecast expenses because they can just go to the suppliers they plan to deal with and ask for current price quotes plus anticipated price increases.Related: How a Failed Forecast Can Inform Future Planning


Quick TipWhen making forecasts, it's useful to change dollar amounts into percentages. So if you figure sales will rise 20 percent next year, you'll enter 120 percent on the top line of the projection. Using percentages helps highlight overly optimistic sales projections and suggests areas, especially in costs, for improvement.Projected Balance SheetBalance sheets can also be projected into the future, and the projections can serve as targets to aim for or benchmarks to compare against actual results. Balance sheets are affected by sales, too. If your accounts receivables go up or inventory increases, your balance sheet reflects this. And, of course, increases in cash show up on the balance sheet. So it's important to look ahead to see how your balance sheet will appear given your sales forecast.Related: How Startups Should Formulate Financial ProjectionsWhen you sit down to prepare a projected balance sheet, it will be helpful to take a look at past years' balance sheets and figure out the relationship of certain assets and liabilities that vary according to sales. These include cash, receivables, inventory, payables, and tax liabilities.If you have any operating history, you can calculate the average percentages of sales for each of these figures for the past few years and use that for your balance sheet projection. You can simply take last year's figures if you don't think they'll change that much. Or you can adjust the percentage to fit some special knowledge you have about the coming year— you're changing your credit terms, for instance, so you expect receivables to shrink, or you're taking out a loan for an expensive new piece of equipment. Firms without operating history can look at one of the books describing industry norms referred to earlier to get guidance about what's typical for their type of company.Related: Master Business Finance With This Expert-Led ClassCash Flow Pro FormaBusinesses are very sensitive to cash. Even if your operation is profitable and you have plenty of capital assets, you can go broke if you run out of cash and can't pay your taxes, wages, rent, utilities, and other essentials. Similarly, a strong flow of cash covers up a multitude of other sins, including a short-term lack of profitability. A cash flow pro forma (or cash budget) is your attempt to spot future cash shortfalls in time to take action.


A cash budget differs from a cash flow statement in that it's generally broken down into periods of less than a year. This is especially true during startup, when the company is sensitive to cash shortages and management is still fine-tuning its controls. Startups, highly seasonal businesses, and others whose sales may fluctuate widely should do monthly cash flow projections for a year ahead, or even two. Any business would do well to project quarterly cash flow for three years ahead.Related: Maximize Profitability with Data-Driven ForecastsThe added detail makes monthly cash flow forecasts somewhat more complicated than figuring annual cash flow because revenues and expenses should be recorded when cash actually changes hands. Sales and cost of goods sold should be allotted to the months in which they can be expected to actually occur. Other variable expenses can be allocated as percentages of sales for the month. Expenses paid other than monthly, such as insurance and estimated taxes, are recorded when they occur.As with the balance sheet projection, one way to project cash flow is to figure out what percentage of sales historically occurs in each month. Then you can use your overall sales forecast for the year to generate monthly estimates. If you don't have prior history, you'll need to produce estimates of such things as profit margins, expenses, and financing activities using your best guesses of how things will turn out.Related: 4 Crucial Signs That Your Small Business Needs FundingThe cash flow pro forma also takes into account sources of cash other than sales, such as proceeds from loans and investments by owners.Cash Flow Pro Forma Is the Most Important Financial StatementIf you have only one financial statement to manage your business by—and to use in your business plan—let it be the cash flow pro forma. Only the cash flow pro forma can tell you how much capital you will need in a startup (add the startup costs, project the cash flow, then make the cash flow positive by providing capital in the indicated amount). Only the cash flow pro forma will tell you when you will need to borrow money— and how much you will need to borrow. Only the cash flow pro forma will tell you when it is time to pull the plug and bail out before you create negative value in your business.


Used as a budget, your cash flow pro forma will keep you from making spontaneous purchases, help evaluate the cost (in cash flow) of growth, hiring new people, adding facilities or equipment, or taking on more debt.No business can prosper without a cash flow pro forma.Related: How to Use Financial Ratios to Understand the Health of Your BusinessFinding Free Cash Flow AppsThey say there's an app for everything. You can now find cash flow projection templates in popular business applications. They may not be highly sophisticated, but they do provide the templates for several key spreadsheets. Google Docs, Intuit's QuickBooks, Pulse, and PlanGuru are among the places to look for cash flow templates. They can make setting it all up a lot easier.Positive Cash Flow = SurvivalSome key points about cash flow:Cash flow buys time (if necessary), builds assets and profits, and keeps suppliers, bankers, creditors, and investors smiling. Without positive cash flow, survival becomes questionable. Negative or feebly positive cash flow is painful, and unless corrected will either kill a business or damage it so seriously that it never lives up to its potential. Although short periods of negative cash flow occur in almost every business, cash flows have to be positive at least on an annual basis. Some farmers do very well indeed with cash flows that are strongly negative for eleven months of the year. So do some manufacturers (especially in the garment trade). The key is that they know what their cash flow patterns are—and take steps to finance the negative periods, offsetting that cost against the occasional strong positive cash influx from operations.Related: How to Tap Your Inner Business Futurist


Unfortunately, the smaller and more thinly capitalized the company, the less able it is to survive extended negative cash flows. This is one reason why so many startups fail. The business idea may be terrific, but sales always come much more slowly than expected while cash goes out twice as fast. And the initial investment is rarely enough to tide the business along until cash flow turns and stays positive.How can a small business attain positive cash flow? Discipline. A cash flow budget is an unbeatable tool if followed carefully. If there is to be just one financial statement, make sure it's the cash flow pro forma. It acts at once as a cash flow budget and as a benchmark for sales.Some people have trouble differentiating the cash flow pro forma from the projected P&L. The concept ""profit"" is so pervasive that it poses a barrier to understanding that positive cash flow does not equal profit (or vice versa). The example of a profitable growing company with negative cash flow succumbing to illiquidity and tumbling into Chapter 11 bankruptcy is commonly cited to disprove the identity. If the sales don't turn to cash soon enough, the company goes broke. Revenues are up, receivables are up, expenses are up, even profits are up. Yet the company runs out of cash, can't pay its bills, and becomes another cash flow victim.Related: The Main Objectives of a Business PlanAnother conceptual problem is equating P&L losses with negative cash flow. A loss on the P&L can reflect a negative cash flow, but it doesn't have to. For example, publishing companies enjoy some accounting foibles such as deferred income (which suppresses sales by deferring revenues to a later period). The cash comes in December, but because the revenue is not earned until the following year, the company can show a nice loss for tax purposes, while enjoying strongly positive cash flow.Some ways to understand cash flow (as distinct from P&L categories) include:Students are adept at managing skinny cash flows. They postpone bill paying, share space to lower costs, use secondhand books whenever possible (if they have to pay the bill, that is), minimize food costs, and so forth. Few of them think of this as cash flow management, but it is—and of a very high order. If they want a ticket to a concert or ball game, they find a way to scrape up the cash. Very few companies are as carefully managed.Emphasize timing. Timing is everything for cash flow—the transfers of cash, even the dates that bills fall due or when discounts can or cannot be taken. Although timing is always important in business, it is especially important in managing cash flow. A P&L can stand a bit of looseness—it doesn't matter whether a bill is received January 31 or February 10. That ten days can make a big difference in cash flow if the bill falls due before you have the cash in hand to pay it.Compare cash flow to a checking account. Cash is deposited (cash inflow). Checks are written (cash outflow). The aim is to always have some cash on hand (positive cash flow).The cash flow pro forma is the most important single financial statement in the business plan. Every business needs an annotated cash flow pro forma (by month for the first year, by quarter thereafter) reflecting its business idea.

The aim of EVA is to find out whether you're doing better with the money you have than you could by, say, investing in U.S. Treasury bills.EVA has been pioneered by consulting firm Stern Stewart, which has counseled hundreds of companies on how to apply EVA. And experts say that entrepreneurs in particular already understand EVA on a gut level. In any event, the basic concept is fairly simple—you measure EVA by taking net operating earnings before taxes and subtracting a reasonable cost of capital, say 12 percent.In practice, however, it's complicated. Stern Stewart has identified more than 160 adjustments a company may potentially need to make to accounting procedures before EVA can be effectively implemented.

70,6 Steps to Getting Your Business Plan In Front of Investors,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/6-steps-to-getting-your-business-plan-seen/463001,"
Once you've prepared your business plan for presentation and you're ready to pitch it, there are six steps that can help get it seen by the right people.Obtain leads and referrals. Find the names, addresses, emails, social media profiles and phone numbers of investors you wish to target. Ask people you know for referrals. Network as much as possible.Research your target. Learn as much as possible about how much money people have to invest, the industries they're interested in, and other requirements. Search venture capital directories, news articles, websites, and similar sources.Make your pitch. First, send an introductory email to your target, letting them know you have a plan you would like to send. If you do not hear from him within a short time, send a follow-up email in a week and try once more about two weeks later. If this doesn't get a response, look elsewhere.Try to meet people in person. Even though we are living in a text, email, and video call age, you should still try to meet your recipient face-to-face, especially if you are seeking any type of funding. It's tough to get such a commitment through a few texts or by email. Zoom or Skype may work, but meeting in person for a major financial commitment is best. Nonetheless, if they want to keep all communication electronic, follow their lead.Plan for objections. Although you may think you've answered everything in your plan, you haven't. Prepare a list of possible objections—potential competitors, hard-to-buttress assumptions, and the like—that your investor may raise. Then, prepare cogent answers. Have friends, coworkers, and your team play devil's advocate and hit you with tough questions — then formulate your answers.Get a commitment. You won't get an investment unless you ask for it. When all objections have been answered, be ready to offer one last concession—""If I give your representative a board seat, can we do this today?""—and go for the close.Related: 12 Surefire Tips for the Perfect Investor Pitch

71,How to Write a Letter of Introduction,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-write-a-letter-of-introduction/462991,"
Your business plan is done, and it's time to send it out. What's the next step? A letter of introduction should be emailed (or mailed) to whomever you would like to read it. In the current business world, sending unsolicited, unanticipated business plans with a mere cover letter will typically not get your plan read. Not only are most people too busy to read whatever comes across their desk or lands in their inbox, but they also do not want to be sued someday for stealing your ideas, even if they never read your plan.Your letter of introduction is your way of asking them if they would be interested in reading your business plan. In the letter, you explain why you have selected them and what you have to offer in a brief, compelling manner.Related: What To Put on the Cover Page of a Business PlanYou should also explain generally what you're looking for—an investor, a loan, a long-term supplier relationship, or something else. Often, this will be obvious from the circumstances. The introductory letter provides a valuable forum to explain why you're contacting this person.



Include ReferralsIf you've received a personal referral, you'll want to include who gave you the referral early on, probably in the first sentence following the salutation. When emailing the individual, you might even put the referral in the subject line. Never underestimate the power of a personal referral from a friend, colleague, or acquaintance. It may not land you an investor, but it gets your foot in the door.Some investors (VCs or even angels) request plans on their websites. Read the website and make sure you follow its guidelines. For example, if it says to send a plan of no more than 20 pages, do not send a 42-page plan.Related: Why You Shouldn't Send Your Business Plan to InvestorsMake a Personal Connection, But Don't Force ItIn a world of ""who you know"" and networking, many of the people you will be sending to are referred by others. In some cases, you may even have some personal connection to the person other than a referral. For instance, perhaps you once met this individual while networking. Perhaps you even worked together at a company or organization.


A shared interest, such as a hobby, is of less value, but it may be worth mentioning if your shared interest is unusual or marked by a close degree of identification among those who share it. For instance, it may not mean much to point out that you, like the reader, are a fan of professional basketball. It may sound like you are grasping at straws to make a connection. However, this might be worth mentioning if you have competed as crew members on long-distance ocean-racing sailboats. In any case, the cover letter, not the plan, is the place to bring up this personal connection.Related: An Angel Investor Will Never Open Your Pitch Deck Until You do This!State the TermsFinally, the letter of introduction may detail the terms under which you are presenting your plan. You may, for instance, say that you are not submitting the plan to any other investor. You may explicitly point out that you currently seek financing from several sources, including this one. If there is a deadline for responding to your plan, if you wish to stress that the plan is confidential and must be returned to you, or if you would like to ask the recipient to pass it on to someone else who may be interested, this is the place to do so. Somewhere between sending the introductory letter and sending the plan—if the person agrees to see it—is where you can email a nondisclosure agreement if you plan to include one.Related: 6 Steps to Getting Your Business Plan SeenThe letter of introduction gives you a chance to provide updated, expanded, or other vital information that isn't in your plan.

72,How to Format Your Business Plan,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-format-your-business-plan/462997,"
Formatting your plan is easy in Microsoft Office or other business software. The key is that everything has its own section, is easy to read, and does not look cluttered. You also want to check that you can read the plan on various mobile devices, so test it by checking it out on your iPhone or any other device available.Related: Crafting a Simple Business PlanHere's a checklist of layout do's and don'tsKeep colors to a minimum and look at photos to see how they appear on other devices and operating systems. Remember: white space on a page is not your enemy.Use 1.5 or double spacing.Keep the background white and use black type.Convert the document into a PDF file, with Adobe Acrobat, and keep the file in one document.Include a table of contents, and make sure to check that what you have in there shows up on the specified pages.Try to align headings so they do not start at the bottom of a page. You can use tabs for addendums or a separate document for the additional materials, such as an appendix.Make sure any graphics are clear and do not take too long to load.Related: 6 Tips for Making a Winning Business Presentation



Include Hard CopiesEven in the digital age, you may still be asked for a hard copy, so be ready to send one. Use good-quality white paper, then bind pages together permanently into a booklet. Any copy shop or printer can do such a binding for you, or you may purchase a do-it-yourself binding kit at an office supply store. Cover your plan with a clear plastic binder so that the cover page shows, or print your cover page information on a heavy piece of paper to serve as a cover for the binder.Permanent binding helps plan readers keep all your plan pages together and makes it easier to read. It's important to keep these reasons for permanent binding in mind—it's a decision that improves the functionality of the plan, not its looks. Spending a lot of money creating a beautiful, perfectly bound plan is not a wise investment. Plan readers are interested in information, not entertainment.Related: What to Include and Not Include in a Successful Business PlanThe same goes for choosing the paper and typeface you'll use in your plan. Pick a white paper, or at most perhaps gray, cream, or some shade of off-white, but leave the colored paper to flyers from the pizza place down the street. To make a businesslike impression, use businesslike stationery.

Whatever business you are in, technology most likely plays a key role. Retailers place their orders faster and more accurately using computers and track their inventory, while other business owners make international deals thanks to computers and communication technology.Related: Business Plan TipsOther key technology that fits into your operations, such as that of a medical equipment manufacturer, should be included in the business plan. Explain how this technology is significant to your business and how it can separate you from your competitors.Related: How to Write an Operations Plan for Retail and Sales BusinessesHow much detail should you include about the technology you employ? We're living in a highly technical environment. That means you should explain some of the key technology that comes into play during your operations—in lay terms. You need to go into greater detail only if your business relies heavily on technology, sells technology, or utilizes some unique technology that is uncommon in your industry.A Note of CautionStay up on technology, but also be careful. There are numerous ways unscrupulous folks can tap into intellectual property, such as recorded music or films. It is harder than ever to catch those who pirate—or steal—such protected properties. But if you are caught, you can get in real trouble. So be careful not to inadvertently use other people's music, images, and so on. Conversely, protect intellectual properties, and if you see your original material showing up elsewhere, contact an attorney.Related: What Equipment and Facilities to Include in Your Business Plan

Once your business plan is out in the world, there is a chance you may not get a response right away—or at all. But that shouldn't stop you.Gently inquireIf there is a problem with your plan, you want to know about it. For example, say the projected return to investors is so low that nobody takes you seriously. Now's the time to find out, not after you've presented it unsuccessfully dozens of times.So gently probe, asking questions focusing on your plan to determine whether you've made a mistake or just hit an unreceptive audience. If you identify a failure, fix it before submitting your plan to another party.Related: 6 Steps to Getting Your Business Plan Seen



Also, be ready to compromise. Perhaps they will give you 50 percent of what you seek in funding until they see some results. Consider the offer. You can always go for more funding elsewhere or scale down the size of your endeavor for the time being.Get a referralEven a total refusal to consider your plan is helpful if the person suggests another place where you might be successful. You should always ask for a referral from anyone who turns your proposal down. It can't hurt— you've already been nixed. And a referral from a knowledgeable, respected investor can carry a lot of weight when you use it as an introduction (even if they are just trying to get rid of you).Related: Why You Shouldn't Send Your Business Plan to InvestorsVenture investing is very much a network-driven business. Venture capitalists are always asking for referrals and are usually willing to give them. Often, they know someone else who might be interested. The same goes for angel investors.


Don't burn bridgesIf an investor doesn't respond to your plan, brushes you off, or even rudely tells you to get lost, your response should still be unfailingly courteous and professional. It could cost you plenty if you let your frustration, disappointment, hurt feelings, and anger show. That investor may be having a bad day and change her mind tomorrow. They may recall your name and how you behaved so well under pressure and mention it to a more open-minded associate the next week. Or perhaps next year, when you're promoting a more exciting concept, they'll be willing to back the improved idea.Related: How to Assess the Potential of Your Business IdeaNone of these scenarios is certain or even probable in any individual instance. But considering the aggregate potential to help or hurt you that all the people you'll present your plan to will possess, any of these scenarios are pretty likely. And they're only possible if you keep the door open for the future.

Never forget that information grows money.Thanks to the internet, market research for business planning purposes has become much easier and less time-consuming. For example, by logging on to the U.S. Census Bureau website (www.census.gov), you can learn everything you need about population trends in your market, which helps you determine market share—a key piece of information in any business plan. Using your site or email, you can set up an online focus group to get a handle on what prospective customers want from a product or service like yours, how they'd use it, where they'd like to buy it, and how often they'd purchase it.This kind of information will help you establish pricing, distribution, and promotional strategies.Related: The Best Research Tools for Entrepreneurs



You can garner a wealth of valuable information via the web on your competitors—and on businesses similar to yours operating in other markets. Visit these companies' websites to see what their product/service lines are, what their unique selling propositions are, who their target markets are and what media are used to reach them, what their prices are, and where and how their product is distributed. If their websites have a section called ""News"" or ""Upcoming Events,"" you can learn about their plans for future marketing efforts and determine how they'll affect your business.Related: Here's the Secret to Growing Your Small Business, According to Execs at UPS, Airbnb, Mastercard, and Other Big BrandsTrade Associations: Key Source of Targeted InformationTrade associations are an excellent source of specific trade and industry information. Suppose you are an artisan specializing in concrete countertops and related items. Is there a trade association? Sure, see The Concrete Network's newsletter for specialized information.Because there are more than 22,000 trade associations in the United States, you will be hard-pressed not to find one that will include your business. Most have periodicals—magazines or newsletters—whose editors are eager to justify their positions by providing the membership with up-to-date information of all kinds. You can call the editor directly (they like to hear from members) or send him an email with your particular questions.


Related: How to Develop a Great Business WebsiteTrade associations often sponsor trade shows, which can help you get information on suppliers, industry trends, consultants, and even seminars directly related to your business. The people you meet and the informal exchange of knowledge that results provide the greatest value: production tips, problem solutions, contacts, and ideas.Customer DataIf your business is already established, use your website and social media presence to solicit valuable feedback from your customers. Stay in touch with them to foster customer loyalty. After a sale is made, ask them whether they're satisfied or if more service is needed. Let them know about upcoming events and specials. Ask them what changes, if any, they'd like to see made in your product or service and how it's delivered.Related: How to Develop a Great Business WebsiteKeep in mind the 80-20 principle in business, which says that 80 percent of your business comes from repeat customers and 20 percent from new customers. Too many businesses spend an inordinate amount of money trying to lure new customers when their repeat customers and the friends, neighbors, colleagues, and family members of those regular customers are the backbone of most successful businesses.Use the web and email to get the information you need about vendors and suppliers.

76,How to Hire the Right Business Plan Consultant,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-hire-the-right-business-plan-consultant/462352,"
Businesspeople tend to fall into two camps when it comes to consultants. Some believe strongly in the utility and value of hiring outside experts to bring new perspectives and broad knowledge to challenging tasks. Others feel consultants are overpaid yes-men brought in only to endorse plans already decided upon or to take the heat for unpopular but necessary decisions.Related: Find an Entrepreneur-verified expert to help you write your planWho's right? Both are, depending on the consultant you hire and your purpose for hiring one. Most consultants are legitimate experts in specific or general business areas. And most consultants can be hired to help with all or part of the process of writing a business plan.Related: The Benefits and Risks of Writing a Business Plan



The downside is you have to spend a lot of time on communication before and during the process of working with a consultant. Be sure you have fully explained, and the consultant fully understands, the nature of your business, your concept and strategy, your financial needs, and other matters such as control, future plans, and so on. Refer to these important issues throughout the process—you don't want to pay for a beautifully done plan that fits somebody else's business, not yours. And when the work is done, debrief the consultant to find out if there's anything you can learn that wasn't included in the plan.Hire PowerIf you decide to hire a consultant to help you prepare your plan, take care that you select the right person. Here are the guidelines:Get referrals. Ask colleagues, acquaintances, and professionals such as bankers, accountants, and lawyers for the names of business plan consultants they recommend. A good referral goes a long way to easing concerns you may have. Few consultants advertise anyway, so referrals may be your only choice.Look for a fit. Find a consultant who is an expert in helping businesses like yours. Ideally, the consultant should have lots of experience with companies of similar size and age in similar industries. Avoid general business experts or those who lack experience in your field.Check references. Get the names of at least three clients the consultant has helped to write plans. Call the former clients and ask about the consultant's performance. Was the consultant's final fee in line with the original estimate? Was the plan completed on time? Did it serve the intended purpose?Get it in writing. Have a legal contract for the consultant's services. It should discuss in detail the fee, when it will be paid, and under what circumstances. And make sure you get a detailed, written description of what the consultant must do to earn the fee. Whether it's an hourly rate or a flat fee isn't as important as each party knowing exactly what's expected.Related: The Benefits and Risks of Writing a Business PlanThe Lowdown on ConsultantsA good consultant should provide the following:


They should lay out expectations. In any working relationship, you need to know exactly what is expected of whom you are hiring.The consultant should only make promises they can keep. Hold them to their word. Business is about making and keeping promises.All plans should be made in advance and make promises that were inherently discussed beforehand. Without a concrete plan a consultant can ""wing it,"" leaving you without any way to look at milestones and keep tabs on her progress.A consultant should provide regular, specific updates. You need to set up a schedule and a means of regular communication. You want to know—specifically— what she is doing, and this means regular ongoing communication, which is an integral part of a healthy business relationship.They should not have a personal agenda. If the consultant is not acting in the best interest of your company, then they are not doing the job ethically. Make sure anyone you're hiring is working for your needs, not theirs.Related: 12 Reasons You Need a Business PlanWhat Does It All Mean?In the end, consultants can only help you know what it is you're looking to accomplish with your business. Business plan competitions can give you a leg up on the competition, but you will then need to use that edge wisely by putting your award-winning plan into the right hands. SCORE and other organizations can benefit you in the business planning process, if you are ready to listen, learn, and ask questions.Remember, though, there is no magic formula for success. Your business plan should lay down the foundation from which you will do everything you can to build and sustain a successful business. It should tell the story of your business going forward and help you think hard about every aspect of your business. It should help you make the key decisions as you proceed. It should also keep you thinking about all of the possibilities.Related: How to Write a Business PlanWriting a business plan is not easy, but neither is starting and running a successful business. Many new businesses (as well as older ones) fail every year. Some have no concrete plan, others have drifted from the plan, and many have lost the motivation to grow and change to keep pace with the changing marketplace. Complacency stops many businesses from taking the next steps.A business plan means what you want it to mean. It can be a way of guiding you through the process, a means of getting investors, a way of finding advisors, a document to help lure new talent, or all of the above. It is not something that you finish and forget to look at, but instead something you can go back to, just as you would do with a blueprint of a house or a building as you plan to add on a new room or rewire the facility.Of course, the business plan is worthwhile only if you are honest in what you put on paper, meaning being honest to yourself. If you are writing down an idealized version of what you'd like to see without including well-researched facts and forecasts that are based on due diligence, then your business plan will simply lead you to disappointment. Therefore, as you write the plan, stop and look at it periodically to make sure you are being realistic and have other people you know and trust read it to confirm that you are being forthright and not overly optimistic.

You need to think of what you want and whether your plan's findings suggest you'll get it. For instance, is your objective to gain freedom from control by other people? If your plan shows that you'll have to take on several equity partners, each of whom will desire a chunk of ownership, you may need to come up with a business that does not require intensive capital needs.Perhaps you want a company that will let you do your work and get home at a reasonable hour, even a business you can run from home. There are so many options when it comes to starting a business, including the size, location, and, of course, the reason for existence. You will be able to determine all of these and so many more aspects of business with the help of your business plan. It forces you to think through all of the areas that form the main concept to the smallest details. This way you don't find yourself remembering at the last minute that your website is still not developed or that you still have most of your inventory in a warehouse and no way to ship it.Related: How To Access The Potential Of Your Business IdeaClarify Your Future OutlookIt may seem odd to say that a business plan can't predict the future. What are all those projections and forecasts for if they are not attempts to predict the future? The fact is, no projection or forecast is really a hard-and-fast prediction of the future. Not even the French seer Nostradamus could tell you for sure how your business will be doing in five years. The best you can do is have a plan in which you logically and systematically attempt to show what will happen if a particular scenario occurs. That scenario has been determined by your research and analysis to be the most likely one of the many that may occur. But it's still just a probability, not a guarantee.



You can, however, use your research, sales forecasts, market trends, and competitive analysis to make well-thought-out predictions of how you see your business developing if you are able to follow a specified course. To some extent, you can create your future rather than simply trying to predict it by the decisions you make. For example, you may not have a multimillion-dollar business in ten years if you are trying to start and run a small family business. Your decision on growth would therefore factor into your predictions and the outcome.Related: Create A Business Plan Investors Will LoveFind FundingThere are all kinds of reasons why a venture capitalist, banker, or other investor may refuse to fund your company. It may be that there's no money to give out at the moment. It may be that the investor just backed a company very similar to your own and now wants something different. Perhaps the investor has just promised to back her brother-in-law's firm or is merely having a bad day and saying no to everything that crosses her desk. The point is that the quality of your plan may have little or nothing to do with your prospects of getting funded by a particular investor.But what about the investment community as a whole? Surely if you show a well-prepared plan to a lot of people, someone will be willing to back you, right? Again, not necessarily. Communities, as well as people, are subject to fads, and your idea may be yesterday's fad. Conversely, it may be too far ahead of its time. It also may be an idea that comes about in a shaky economy or a saturated market. Timing is sometimes a factor that is out of your control.


Related: How To Use Your Business PlanThe same is true of the availability of funds. At times, banks everywhere seem to clamp down on lending, refusing to back even clearly superior borrowers. In many countries, there is no network of venture capitalists to back fledgling companies.Open NegotiationsA business plan cannot guarantee that you will raise all the money you need at any given time, especially during the startup phase. Even if you are successful in finding an investor, the odds are good that you won't get quite what you asked for. There may be a big difference in what you have to give up, such as majority ownership or control, to get the funds. Or you may be able to make minor adjustments if you cannot snare as large a chunk of cash as you want.Related: What To Include And Not To Include In A Business PlanIn a sense, a business plan used for seeking funding is part of a negotiation taking place between you and your prospective financial backers. The part of the plan where you describe your financial needs can be considered your opening bid in this negotiation. The other information it contains, from market research to management bios, can be considered supporting arguments. If you look at it that way, a business plan is an excellent opening bid. It's definite, comprehensive, and clear.But it's still just a bid, and you know what happens to bids in negotiations. They get whittled away, the terms get changed, and, sometimes, the whole negotiation breaks down under the force of an ultimatum from one of the parties involved. Does this mean you should ask for a good deal more money than you actually need in your plan? Actually, that may not be the best strategy either. Investors who see a lot of plans are going to notice if you're asking for way too much money. Such a move stands a good chance of alienating those who might otherwise be enthusiastic backers of your plan. It's probably a better idea to ask for a little more than you think you can live with, plus slightly better terms than you really expect.Related: How To Craft A Business Plan to Turn Investor's Heads


Identify Strengths and WeaknessesA professional financier such as a bank loan officer or a venture capitalist will see literally hundreds of business plans in the course of a year. After this has gone on for several years, and the financier has backed some percentage of those plans and seen how events have turned out, he or she becomes very good at weeding out plans with inconsistencies or overblown projections and zeroing in on weaknesses, including some you'd probably rather not see highlighted.If you've seen Shark Tank, you'll understand how shrewd those individuals with the dollars can be. In short, most financiers are expert plan analyzers. You have little chance of fooling one of them with an overly optimistic or even downright dishonest plan. That doesn't mean you shouldn't make the best case you honestly can for your business. But the key word is ""honestly.""Related: How to Find FundingYou certainly shouldn't play down your strengths in a plan, but don't try to hide your weaknesses either. Intelligent, experienced financiers will see them anyway. Let's say you propose to open a small health food store at an address a block away from a Whole Foods. An investor who knows this fact but doesn't see any mention of it in your plan may suspect you've lost your senses—and who could blame her?Now think about the effect if your plan notes the existence of that big grocery store. That gives you a chance to differentiate yourself explicitly, pointing out that you'll be dealing only in locally produced foods—which the superstore doesn't carry but many of its customers may want. Suddenly that high-volume operator becomes a helpful traffic builder, not a dangerous competitor.Related: The Ultimate Business Plan BookSo, recognize and deal appropriately with the weaknesses in your plan rather than sweeping them under the rug. If you do it right, this troubleshooting can become one of the strongest parts of the whole plan.

78,The Basics of Writing a Business Plan,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/the-basics-of-writing-a-business-plan/459308,"
Writing a business plan is like the architectural plan for a home or a brick-and-mortar building. You need to know what materials you need, how you're going to construct the building, and when you need to build each piece of the building. You start by building the foundation because your business can't stand up without it.What is a business plan?A business plan is a written description of the future of your business. It is a document that tells the story of what you plan to do and how you plan to do it. If you jot down a paragraph on the back of an envelope describing your business strategy, you've written a plan, or at least the germ of a plan.Business plans are inherently strategic. You start here, today, with certain resources and abilities. You want to get to a ""there,"" a point in the future (usually three to five years out) at which time your business will have a different set of resources and abilities as well as greater profitability and more assets. Your plan shows how you will get from here to there. In essence, it is a road map from where you are now to where you want to be later on.Related: Starting A Business-Step-By-Step Planning Templates



Building your business plan brick-by-brickIf you've done any research about business plans online or through an agency like the Small Business Administration (SBA), you've probably heard about some generally accepted conventions about what a business plan should include and how it should be presented. In sum, a plan should cover all the important matters that will contribute to making your business a success, including:Your basic business concept. This is where you discuss the industry, your business structure, your particular product or service, and how you plan to make your business a success. To use the analogy of building a brick-and-mortar building, this is the concrete you use for your foundation.Your strategy and the specific actions you plan to take to implement it. What goals do you have for your business? When and how will you reach your goals? After all, you need to know how you plan to construct your building.Your products and services and their competitive advantages. Here is your chance to dazzle the readers with good, solid information about your products or services and why customers will want to purchase your products and services and not those of your competitors. Your products and services are the materials you'll use for the building.The markets you'll pursue. Now you have to lay out your marketing plan. Who will your customers be? What is your demographic audience? How will you attract and retain enough customers to make a profit? What methods will you use to capture your audience? What sets your business apart from the competition? How are you going to get people to come to your building and spend money?The background of your management team and key employees. Having information about key personnel is an important but often misrepresented portion of a business plan. It's not a long and detailed biography of each person involved but an accurate account of what they have done and what they bring to the table for this specific business opportunity. Readers will want to know who will construct your building and if they're qualified builders.Your financing needs. These will be based on your projected financial statements and provide a model of how your ideas about the company, its markets, and its strategies will play out. With a building, you need to know the costs of your materials and how you will adapt to changing conditions, including pricing and construction delays due to weather.As you write your business plan, stick to facts instead of feelings, projections instead of hopes, and realistic expectations of profit instead of unrealistic dreams of wealth. You want to show readers that your building will last for years. And facts—checkable, demonstrable facts—will invest your plan with the most important component of all: credibility.Related: How To Write A Business PlanHow Long Should Your Plan Be?A useful business plan can be any length, from a one-page summary to more than 100 pages for an especially detailed plan describing a complex enterprise. A typical business plan runs fifteen to twenty-five pages. Mini plans of five to ten pages are the popular concise models that may stand on their own for smaller businesses. Larger businesses, seeking major funding, will often have mini plans, but the full business plan will be waiting in the wings. It's advantageous to run long when creating your plan and then narrow it down for presentation purposes.


Related: What To Include and What Not To Include In Your Business PlanThe size of the plan will also depend on the nature of your business and your reason for writing the plan. If you have a simple concept, you can express it in very few words. On the other hand, if you are proposing a new kind of business or even a new industry, it may require quite a bit of explanation to get the message across. If you are writing a plan for a division of a large organization, you may be given a set format and prescribed length.The purpose of your plan also determines its length. If you are looking for millions of dollars in seed capital to start a risky venture, you will usually (although not always) have to do a lot of explaining and convincing. If you already have relationships with potential investors, they may simply want a mini plan. If you are just going to use your plan for internal purposes to manage an ongoing business, a much more abbreviated version may suffice.Related: When Is The Best Time To Write Your Business PlanIf you want to start small with an effective way to get your ideas down, you can follow the guidance of LivePlan, a business planning and management software, on writing your one-page plan for your business.Many business plan presentations are made with PowerPoint decks, using ten to twelve slides to tell your story. This is a great starting point, but you should have at least a mini plan available, especially if you seek millions of dollars.When Should You Write Your Business Plan?The fact that you're reading this article means you suspect it's about time to write a business plan. Odds are you are at or near one of the many occasions when a business plan will prove useful.


A business plan is a good way to explore the feasibility of a new business without actually having to start it and run it. A good plan can help you see serious flaws in your business concept. You may uncover tough competition when researching the market section, or you may find that your financial projections simply aren't realistic.Any venture that faces major changes (and that means almost all businesses) needs a business plan. If the demographics of your market are rapidly changing, strong new competitive products challenge your profitability, you expect your business to grow or shrink dramatically, or the economic climate is improving or slipping rapidly, you'll need a business plan. This will allow you to make changes accordingly.If you are contemplating buying or selling a business, your business plan can provide you with a handy tool to establish a value—and to support that value if challenged.You will need a business plan if you are seeking financing. Your business plan is the backbone of your financing proposal. Bankers, venture capitalists, and other financiers rarely provide money without seeing a plan. Less sophisticated investors or friends and family may not require a business plan, but they deserve one. Even if you're funding the business with your own savings, you owe it to yourself to plan how you'll expend the resources you're committing.Related: Why You Need To Write A Business PlanBusiness Plan Buzzword: Competitive advantage makes you different from, and better than, your competition. Lower prices, higher quality, and better name recognition are examples of competitive advantages. By studying your competition, you can devise your own competitive advantage by providing something (or several things) that your competition does not offer.Cocktail Napkin Business PlanBusiness plans don't have to be complicated, lengthy documents. They just have to capture the essence of what the business will do and why it will be a success.The business plan for one of the most successful startups ever began with a triangle scrawled on a cocktail napkin. The year was 1971, and Herb Kelleher and Rollin King were formulating their idea for an airline serving Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio. The triangle connecting the cities was their route map—and the basis of the business plan for Southwest Airlines.The two entrepreneurs soon expressed their vision for Southwest Airlines more fully in a full-fledged business plan and raised millions in initial capital to get off the ground. Eventually, they went public. Along the way, the airline expanded beyond the three cities to include other Texas destinations, and now it serves over 100 destinations in 42 states plus Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico, with over 4,000 flights daily and revenues of $15.8 billion in 2021. Southwest specializes in low-cost, no-frills, high-frequency service, which, if you add some lines to the original triangle, is the same strategy mapped out on that cocktail napkin.Related: How To Write Your Business Plan

The only person who doesn't need a business plan is the one who's not going into business. You don't need a plan to start a hobby or something you do on the side for fun. But anybody beginning or extending a venture that will consume significant resources of money, energy, or time and that is expected to return a profit should take the time to draft some kind of plan.Who Needs a Business Plan?StartupsThe classic business plan writer is an entrepreneur seeking funds to help start a new venture. Many great companies had their starts in the form of a plan that was used to convince investors to put up the capital necessary to get them underway.However, it's a mistake to think that only startups need business plans. Companies and managers find plans useful at all stages of their existence, whether they're seeking financing or trying to figure out how to invest a surplus.



Established Firms Seeking HelpMany business plans are written by and for companies that are long past the startup stage but also well short of large-corporation status. These middle-stage enterprises may draft plans to help them find funding for growth just as the startups do, although the amounts they seek may be larger and the investors more willing because the company already has a track record. They may feel the need for a written plan to help manage an already rapidly growing business. A business plan may be seen as a valuable tool to convey the mission and prospects of the business to customers, suppliers, or other interested parties.Just as the initial plan maps how to get from one leg of the journey to the next, an updated plan for additional funding adds another leg of your journey. It's not unlike traveling from the United States to Paris and then deciding to visit London or Barcelona or both along the way. You would then need to add to, or update, your plans. A business plan can, therefore, address the next stage in the life process of a business.Related: How To Write A Business Plan


12 Reasons You Need a Business PlanBusiness plans could be considered cheap insurance. Just as many people don't buy fire insurance on their homes and rely on good fortune to protect their investments, many successful business owners do not rely on written business plans but trust their own instincts. However, your business plan is more than insurance. It reflects your ideas, intuitions, instincts, and insights about your business and its future—and provides the cheap insurance of testing them out before you are committed to a course of action. There are so many reasons to create a business plan, and chances are that more than one of the following will apply to your business.1. A plan helps you set specific objectives for managers.Good management requires setting specific objectives and then tracking and following up. As your business grows, you want to organize, plan, and communicate your business priorities better to your team and to you. Writing a plan gets everything clear in your head before you talk about it with your team.2. You can share your strategy, priorities, and plans with your spouse or partner.People in your personal life intersect with your business life, so shouldn't they know what's supposed to be happening?3. Use the plan to explain your displacement.A short definition of displacement is, ""Whatever you do is something else you don't do."" Your plan will explain why you're doing what you've decided to do in your business.4. A plan helps you figure out whether or not to rent or buy new space.Do your growth prospects and plans justify taking on an increased fixed cost of new space?Related: Do You Need To Write A Business Plan5. You can explain your strategy for hiring new people.How will new people help your business grow and prosper? What exactly are they going to do?


6. A plan helps you decide whether or not to bring on new assets.How many new assets do you need, and will you buy or lease them? Use your business plan to help decide what's going to happen in the long term and how long important purchases, such as computer equipment, will last in your plan.7. Share your plan with your team.Explain the business objectives in your plan with your leadership team, employees, and new hires. What's more, make selected portions of your plan part of your new employee training.8. Share parts of your plan with new allies to bring them aboard.Use your plan to set targets for new alliances with complementary businesses and also disclose selected portions of your plan with those businesses as you negotiate an alliance.9. Use your plan when you deal with professionals.Share selected parts of your plan with your attorneys and accountants, as well as consultants if necessary.10. Have all the information in your plan when you're ready to sell.Sell your business when it's time to put it on the market so you can help buyers understand what you have, what it's worth, and why they want it. Related: How To Build A Business Plan


11. A plan helps you set the valuation of the business.Valuation means how much your business is worth, and it applies to formal transactions related to divorce, inheritance, estate planning, and tax issues. Usually, that takes a business plan as well as a professional with experience. The plan tells the valuation expert what your business is doing, when it's doing (or will do) certain things, why those things are being done, how much that work will cost, and the benefits that work will produce.12. You can use information in the plan when you need cash.Seek investment for a business no matter what stage of growth the business finds itself in. Investors need to see a business plan before they decide whether or not to invest. They'll expect the plan to cover all the main points.Bonus: The Benefits for YouIf you and/or someone on your team are still skeptical about the benefits of a business plan and how it will benefit you personally, consider some advantages that can help in your day-to-day management:Your educated guesses will be better. Use your plan to refine your educated guesses about things like potential markets, sales drivers, lead processing, and business processes. Priorities will make more sense. Aside from the strategy, there are also priorities for other factors of your business including growth, management, and financial health. Use your plan to set a foundation for these, then you can revise them as the business evolves.You'll understand interdependencies. Use a plan to keep track of what needs to happen and in what order. For example, if you have to time a product release to dovetail with your marketing efforts, your business plan can be invaluable in keeping you organized and on track.You'll be better at delegating. The business plan must make clear who is responsible for what. Every important task should have one person in charge.Managing team members and tracking results will be easy. The plan is a great format for putting responsibilities and expectations in writing. Then during team member reviews, you can look to your plan to spot the differences between expectations and results so that you can make course corrections.


You can better plan and manage cash flow. A cash flow plan within your overall business plan helps you and your leadership team make better-educated guesses about sales, costs, expenses, assets you need to buy, and debts you have to pay.Related: How To Craft A Business Plan That Will Turn Investors' HeadsBusiness Planning RisksThere are risks associated with writing a business plan. That's right: While one of the main purposes of a business plan is to help you avoid risk, the act of creating one does create a few risks as well. These risks include:The possible disclosure of confidential material. Although most of the people who see your plan will respect its confidentiality, a few may (either deliberately or by mistake) disclose proprietary information. For this reason, you may want to have a nondisclosure agreement, or NDA, signed before sending it to others.Leading yourself astray. You may believe too strongly in the many forecasts and projects in your business plan.Related: The Basics Of Writing A Business PlanRuining your reputation . . . or worse. If you purposely fill the plan with overly optimistic prognostication, exaggeration, or even falsehoods, you will do yourself a disservice. Some plans prepared for the purpose of seeking funds may run afoul of securities laws if they appear to be serving as prospectuses unblessed by the regulators.


Spending too much effort planning. You then may not have enough energy or time to actually run your business. Some call it ""analysis paralysis."" It's a syndrome that occurs when you spend so much time planning that you never do anything. For a lot of business people, this is a nonissue—they detest planning so much that there's no chance at all they'd forgo actually doing business and merely plan it.Business planning can take on a life of its own. It's possible to spend so much time planning a startup that you miss your window of opportunity or to schedule such frequent updates of a plan for an established business that it becomes difficult to administer its other details. Big corporations have large staffs, which can be devoted to year-round planning. As a small business owner, you have to be more selective.Your planning may be approaching the paralysis stage if you find yourself soothing your nerves about starting a business by delaying the startup date so you can plan more. If you notice yourself putting off crucial meetings so you can dig up more information for a plan update, suspect that planning has become overly important.Related: What To Include And Not Include In A Business PlanDiluting the effectiveness of your plan. If you put too much detail into your plan, you run the risk of overburdening anybody who reads it with irrelevant, obscuring details. A plan isn't supposed to be a potboiler, but it should tell a story—the story of your business.Therefore, it should be as easy as possible to read. That means keeping technical jargon under control and making it readable in one sitting.Explain any terms that may be unfamiliar to a reader who's not an expert on your industry. And never make the mistake of trying to overawe a reader with your expertise. There's a good chance someone reading your plan will know more than you do. If you come across as an overblown pretender, you can bet your plan will get short shrift.


It's easy to believe that a longer, more detailed plan is always better than a short, concise one. But financiers and others to whom you may send your plan are busy people. They do not have time to plow through an inches-thick plan and may be put off by its imposing appearance. Better to keep it to a couple of dozen pages and stick to the truly important material.Expediting your plan. While some insist on endless planning, others try to speed up the process. In an effort to get a plan written quickly to show a potential investor, you may find yourself cutting corners or leaving out vital information. You don't want to take forever to prepare a business plan but using some of the business plan software programs can make it so easy that you find yourself letting the programs do more of the work. Remember, the tools are there to guide you and not the other way around. Give yourself enough time to make sure that:Each section says what you want it to say.All of your numbers add up and make sense.You have answers to anything readers could possibly ask you.

80,How to Use Your Business Plan Most Effectively,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-use-your-business-plan/459402,"
Your business plan can be used for several things, from monitoring your company's progress toward goals to enticing key employees to join your firm. Deciding how you intend to use yours is an essential part of preparing to write it. Here are questions to ask yourself during the planning process.Using Your Plan to Help Raise MoneyIf your goal is to raise money, you'll have to focus very carefully on the plan's executive summary, management, marketing, and financial aspects. In addition, you'll need to have a focused vision of how your company will make money. If you're looking for a bank loan, you'll need to stress your ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service loans. Equity investors, especially venture capitalists, must be shown how they can cash out of your company and develop an acceptable return rate.Related: How To Create A Business Plan Investors Will LoveUsing Your Plan to Attract Talented EmployeesEmphasize such things as stock options and other aspects of compensation, as well as location, work environment, corporate culture, and opportunities for growth and advancement. If you're a high-tech startup, top employees are likely to ask to see your plans for attracting venture capital and later selling out to a bigger firm or going public so they can realize the value of their stock options.



Using Your Plan to Show You're a Worthy CustomerA solid business plan may convince a supplier of some precious commodity to favor you over your rivals. It may also help you to arrange supplier credit—one of the most useful forms of financing for a small business. In this plan, you may want to stress your blue-ribbon customer list and spotless record of repaying trade debts.Related: How To Craft A Business Plan That Will Turn Investors HeadsUsing Your Plan to Show You're a Dependable SupplierYou'll want to emphasize your staying power, innovation, and special capabilities. In this plan, unlike the supplier-targeted one, you may want to play down relationships with other big customers, especially if they are foes of the one you're wooing.Using Your Plan For Internal PurposesIf you're keeping your plan in-house, you'll want to build in many milestones, benchmarks, and other tools for measuring and comparing your future performance against the plan. Such things may be of little interest to a banker evaluating your loanworthiness. Still, they could make all the difference between a helpful plan and one that's no good for monitoring corporate performance.


These distinctions are not merely academic. A plan that's well suited for internal purposes would probably be entirely wrong for taking to a potential Fortune 500 customer. Actually, the marketplace of business plan consumers is even more finely segmented than that. A plan for a bank, for instance, wouldn't accomplish much by including a strategy for selling the company to a large conglomerate several years down the road, whereas a venture capitalist would look for your exit strategy very early on.Related: The Main Objectives Of A Business PlanConsider all this and keep it in mind as you plan. You'll have to decide what to include or leave out and what to stress or play down. Setting some direction about how you intend to use your plan will make those later decisions faster and more accurate.Because many entrepreneurs utilize business plans for various purposes, you'll want to have several versions available. By carefully editing and rewriting certain sections with your audience in mind, you can have plans ready for different occasions. The plan for raising funding will likely be more extensive and detailed than the plan for attracting new employees, who may not want to read as much but will want some answers to the question, Why should I work at your company? While the business plan is the sum of various sections, how you massage and edit those sections can help you utilize it for various purposes.Consider that once you've created a good business plan, you should use it in many ways, including self-motivation and guidance as you make business decisions and undergo changes.Get the Right Software Once you've determined the purpose of your plan (and considered to whom you will send it), you'll want to take a practical approach and consider some of the software tools of the trade.While you remain in the driver's seat, writing the plan and doing all the heavy thinking, your business plan software can handle research, organization, calculations, and more. Of course, you don't have to use specific business plan software to write your plan. Microsoft Office or any similar software on which you can write each section of your plan can serve your purpose. You can even use Excel, Google Sheets, or other spreadsheet software to handle the financial pages.


Related: How To Write A Business PlanHowever, if you want the guidance of a software program, look for one that meets your computer capabilities, has tech support readily available, and is highly rated. You should also ask other business owners, perhaps in your local chamber of commerce, which ones they used and what they have to say about the software.At Capterra software, you'll find product comparisons, including research tools provided, printing and publishing, support, and more.

'Where should I invest my marketing to grow?' and 'What happens if I have a bad month?'""Related: When Is The Best Time To Write Your Business PlanThe functionality of the software and how much instruction is provided are key to making an informed decision.

However, some walk you more directly while others walk you in a circle before getting you to where you want to go.

Before we dive into the different types of funding, keep these quick tips in mind to help you win the funding you are searching for:Spend extra time working on the executive summary. Because bankers and professional investors receive so many business plans, they sometimes go right to the executive summary for an overall view of what your plan is all about. If you can't seize their interest in your executive summary, go back to the drawing board and try again.Make sure your business plan is complete. You would be surprised at how many business plans are submitted with important data missing. You need to double- and triple-check to make sure all of the important components are included. Even when using business plan software, people skip sections or decide an area is not important. Leave nothing to chance. A well-written and complete business plan gives you a higher chance of success and better odds of getting the financing you are seeking.Related: First Time Crowd Funding? Here's What You Need To Know.



Be able to back up anything you have on paper if asked for more details. While the business plan should have all the answers, investors, bankers, and venture capitalists are shrewd and ask questions that may not be answered in the plan. Be ready to answer anything they can possibly throw at you. Expect the unexpected and prepare for it.Direct Funding SourcesWhen you're looking for money, it may seem that investors are scarce. But the real problem may be that you're not looking in enough places for potential financiers. You may find investors as close as your immediate family and as far away as professional venture capitalists on the other side of the world.Investors come in many shapes and sizes, as well as with various needs and intentions. Odds are you can find someone to help you with your financing needs if you cast your net wide enough.Related: Family Business: The Pros and Cons of Getting Funding From Family.


Direct funding sources invest directly in your business. These include funds from individuals, banks, government agencies, and various levels of professional investors. Indirect funding sources provide trade credit and financing mechanisms such as extended terms on purchases. These are important sources of working capital, but they do not put funds directly into your business.Your Own ResourcesYour own resources, savings, investments, and other valuable assets are the beginning of your financing efforts. One reason to write a business plan is to provide reassurance that you are making a sensible investment. Note that you will be investing serious nonfinancial assets in your business: your time, effort, hopes, and reputation.As for your own financial assets, make sure the money is not earmarked for tuition or part of your necessary family spending, such as your mortgage, rent, and the like. If you're in debt, it is also advisable to get out from under before starting a business. But you can start writing your business plan while getting your financial affairs in order.Related: An Entrepreneur Guide To Finding Various Funding OptionsEven though hopefully you will be investing assets from investors, you should be prepared to invest some of your own money in your business venture. Rule of thumb says if you want other people to invest in you, then you also have to invest in yourself.Why should other people take a gamble on your business if you won't?Friends and FamilyThe most likely source of financing is the group of people closest to you. Spouses, parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and in-laws, as well as friends and colleagues, have reasons to help you that arm's-length financiers lack. For that reason, they may back you when no one else will.


One seldom-noticed aspect of asking family and friends to invest in your venture is that other investors (especially bankers and venture capitalists) often ask if you have approached friends and family to raise initial capital. If you say you haven't, they'll then ask why not. If your deal is so appealing, why wouldn't you let your friends in on the ground floor? If you say yes, but they couldn't come through for you, at least the banker or VC will know you tried.Related: 4 Ways To Finance Your BusinessWillingness to take a risk doesn't make friends and family foolish investors. Money from family and friends has backed many very successful business ventures. Here are a few:Albertson's Inc. Cofounder Joe Albertson borrowed $7,500 from his aunt to make his $12,500 contribution to the partnership that began the grocery store that grew to have sales of more than $2 billion a year.Pizza Hut Inc. Cofounders Frank and Dan Carney borrowed $600 from an insurance fund left by their late father to start the pizza chain.Eckerd Corporation. Jack Eckerd raised $150,000 from family members to purchase three failing Florida drugstores, the cornerstone of a company whose sales would one day top $9 billion a year.Friends and family may not be able to raise millions of dollars, but they can provide long-term financing for highly speculative endeavors that more mainstream financiers wouldn't touch.


Related: 8 Ways To Fund Your Start-UpEven Families Need a PlanIf you're financing your venture with family money, you may think all you need is a smile and a polite request to raise what you need. In the short term, that may work and produce the funds you need to start out. But over the long term, even family-financed enterprises will benefit from having a business plan.Such a plan shows family members who are putting up the money what they can expect for their contribution. And it helps keep the entrepreneur— you—mindful of responsibilities to the family members who backed you and on track to fulfill your obligations.Related: The Money Raising Marathon: Preparing To Pitch InvestorsPros and Cons of Family FundingOn the positive side, family and friends will let you know if your idea appeals to them. Typically, they will also give you the time and a less stressful environment in which to present your plan. Family members may be more readily available to lend a helping hand when you need one and may be there to take over the business down the road.The flip side is that you are closer to your family and friends. Losing the money of someone close to you can create a lot of tension between you and your family or friends. Family members and friends may also want to get more involved and try to oversee aspects of the business or push you to make changes that other investors would not. They may even expect to be on your management team, which would not be the case with a bank.Related: Crowd Funding, Personal Credit, and The Bank Of Mom And Dad


In order to make investor agreements work with friends and family, you need to spell out everything clearly and make sure you can separate your business from your personal relationships. This is not necessarily as easy as it sounds. You need to go into any such deals playing some defense and making it clear that people may lose their investments. Provide plenty of warning, and, if they insist on being part of your business, make sure there are boundaries set out in advance that everyone can agree upon.Potential Pitfalls of Friends and Family FundingFamily members offer tempting capital sources. But emotions can interfere with judgment when dealing with relatives and can lead to hurt feelings as well as possible lawsuits and other entanglements. Minimize the risk of such misunderstandings by fully documenting terms, possible interest rates, and other details for loans and equity investments from family.If you do not document the terms of such loans in writing, the IRS can either treat the loan as permanent capital or impose a stiff interest rate on the loan. Neither of these options is desirable.Related: The Best Source Of Funding You'll Ever FindCrowdfundingA rather recent entry into the world of procuring funds for projects is crowdfunding. This is a means of gathering funds from a diverse group of investors using Internet technology.The idea is broad based with some investors on crowdfunding sites getting rewards for investing money while others become investors with a stake in the business. As a result, some of these sites are, like PBS, seeking support from generous people with a passion for a type of business or short-term project or for a cause behind that business or project. Other sites are looking for investors in more full-blown long-term business ventures.Related: You Can't Get VC Funding For Your Start-Up - Now What?


Statista, a leading provider of market and consumer data, reported that the overall industry raised more than $13.6 billion in 2021, and is forecast to more than double to nearly $29 billion in 2028.Adam Chapnick, former head of Indiegogo, notes that an abbreviated business plan works best for most crowdfunding sites. ""Make a big fat business plan—then throw it away,"" says Chapnick, adding that it is important to go through the process of creating a business plan and then necessary to simplify it and make it quick to convey for crowdfunding.MicroVentures starts off with a snapshot questionnaire to which you can attach a business plan if you so choose, but it's not required. Like Indiegogo, it would also look for the abridged version of your longer plan.There are more crowdfunding services coming of age, with new parameters and guidelines, many of which meet specific niche groups. Rules are changing, in part because of federal and SEC regulations and in part because the crowdfunding services are seeing new ways of doing business. For example, Kickstarter, the early trendsetter in this industry, which has raised over $300 million for over 1,800 projects, will give the new business venture the money that has been raised only if the total amount requested has been reached. Therefore, if you request $10,000 to start a business, and you raise only $7,500 from interested parties, you get nothing. Other services, though, would give you the $7,500. Kickstarter is also more selective about what projects end up on its website, looking for more ""trendy"" ideas to keep the company in the limelight.Related: Angels, VC's, Or The Crowd - Who Should Fund?By reviewing the various crowdfunding websites, you can determine which one might be best for your efforts. Look at what the investors will get in return. This can be anything from a gift, not unlike pledging money to PBS; a return on the investment with interest; or, on equity investment crowdfunding websites, a share in the business.Also, keep in mind that many people invest in crowdfunding ventures with their hearts and/or emotions. It is a daring means of investing, but one that drives many crowdfunding investors to put money into something in which they personally believe, such as an environmentally sound business. Of course, there are downsides to crowdfunding, such as putting an idea out there that can be easily stolen or having backers that offer money only while not giving you either the network you need, good business advice, or second rounds of funding. There is also a lot of time spent on marketing to raise your funds. In addition, the SEC is closely watching this new investment opportunity, so you need to be abreast of the latest rules governing crowdfunding.


While Kickstarter and Indiegogo are more frequently used for creative projects, business owners have found success with AngelList.com, MicroVentures.com, or CircleUp.com. But there are so many more that you can find by searching online for ""crowdfunding for business.""

82,The Top 4 Types of Business Plans,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/the-top-4-types-of-business-plans/459374,"
When it comes to writing a business plan, one style does not fit all.Different industries require different plans. A retailer isn't much like a manufacturer, and a professional services firm isn't much like a fast-food restaurant. Each requires certain critical components for success—components that may be irrelevant or even completely absent in the operations of another type of firm.For example, inventory is a key concern for both retailers and manufacturers. Look at Walmart, one of the great all-time success stories in retail. Expert, innovative management of inventory is an integral part of its success. Any business plan that purported to describe the important elements of these businesses would have had to devote considerable space to telling how the managers planned to manage inventory.Related: The Basics Of Writing A Business Plan



Contrast that with a professional services firm, such as a management consultant. A consultant has no inventory whatsoever. Their offerings consist entirely of the management analysis and advice they can provide. They don't have to pay now for goods to be sold later or lay out cash to store products for eventual sale. The management consultant's business plan, therefore, wouldn't have a section on inventory or its management, control, and reduction.This is one obvious example of the differences among plans for different industries. Sometimes, even companies in more closely related industries have significantly different business plans. For instance, the business plan for a fine French restaurant might need a section detailing how the management intends to attract and retain a distinguished chef. At a restaurant catering to the downtown lunchtime crowd, you might devote much plan space to the critical concern of location and quick turnaround of diners with very little about the chef.Related: The Benefits and Risks of Writing A Business PlanYou want your plan to present yourself and your business in the best, most accurate light. That's true no matter what you intend to use your plan for, whether it's destined for presentation at a venture capital conference or will never leave your office or be seen outside internal strategy sessions.


When you select clothing for a momentous occasion, odds are you try to pick items that will play up your best features. Think about your plan the same way. You want to reveal any positives your business may have and ensure they receive due consideration.Related: The Main Objective Of A Business PlanBusiness plans can be divided roughly into four distinct types: Mini-plans, presentation plans or decks, working plans, and what-if plans. Each plan requires different amounts of labor, not always with proportionately different results. A more elaborate plan is not guaranteed to be superior to an abbreviated one. Success depends on various factors and whether the right plan is used in the right setting. For example, a new hire may not want to read the same elaborate version that might be important to a potential investor.The Mini-PlanThe mini-plan is preferred by many recipients because they can read it or download it quickly to read later on their iPhone or tablet. You include most of the same ingredients that you would in a longer plan, but you cut to the highlights while telling the same story. For a small business venture, it's typically all that you need. For a more complex business, you may need a longer version.Related: How To Write A Business PlanThe Presentation PlanCreated with PowerPoint or a similar platform, this is how most plans are presented. And while today's plan is shorter than back in the day, it's not necessarily easier to present. Many people lose sleep over an upcoming presentation, especially one that can play a vital role in the future of your business. However, presenting your plan as a deck can be very powerful. Readers of a plan can't always capture your passion for the business, nor can they ask questions when you finish. In 20 minutes, you can cover all the key points and tell your story from concept and mission statement through financial forecasts.Related: How To Craft A Business Plan That Will Turn Investor Heads


Remember to keep your graphics uncluttered and to make comments to accentuate your ideas rather than simply reading what is in front of your audience. While a presentation plan is concise, don't be fooled. It takes plenty of planning. The pertinent questions—Who? What? Where? Why? When? and How?—need to be answered.The Working PlanA working plan is a tool to be used to operate your business. It is long on detail but cshort on presentation. As with a mini-plan, you probably can afford a somewhat higher degree of candor and informality when preparing a working plan.Related: 6 Tips For Making A Winning Business PresentationIn a presentation plan, you might describe a rival as ""competing primarily on a price basis."" But in a working plan, your comment about the same competitor might be, ""When is Jones ever going to stop this insane price-cutting?""A plan intended strictly for internal use may also omit some elements that you need not explain to yourself. Likewise, you probably don't need to include an appendix with resumes of key executives. Product photos are also unnecessary. Internal policy considerations may guide the decision about including or excluding certain information in a working plan. Many entrepreneurs are sensitive about employees knowing the precise salary the owner takes home from the business.Related: 12 Reasons You Need A Business PlanTo the extent such information can be left out of a working plan without compromising its utility, you can feel free to protect your privacy. This document is like an old pair of khakis you wear to the office on Saturdays or that one ancient delivery truck that never seems to break down. It's there to be used, not admired.


The What-If PlanWhen you face unusual circumstances, you need a variant on the working plan. For example, prepare a contingency plan when you are seeking bank financing. A contingency plan is a plan based on the worst-case scenario that you can imagine your business surviving—loss of market share, heavy price competition, defection of a key member of your management team. A contingency plan can soothe the fears of a banker or investor by demonstrating that you have indeed considered more than a rosy scenario.Related: How To Hire The Right Business Plan ConsultantYour business may be considering an acquisition, in which case a pro forma business plan (some call this a what-if plan) can help you understand what the acquisition is worth and how it might affect your core business. What if you raise prices, invest in staff training, and reduce duplicative efforts? Such what-if planning doesn't have to be as formal as a presentation plan. Perhaps you want to mull over the chances of a major expansion. A what-if plan can help you spot the increased needs for space, equipment, personnel, and other variables so you can make good decisions.What sets these kinds of plans apart from the working and presentation plans is that they don't necessarily describe how you will run the business. They are essentially more like an addendum to your actual business plan. If you decide to acquire that competitor or grow dramatically, you will want to incorporate some of the thinking already invested in these special purpose plans into your primary business plan.Related: Do You Need To Write A Formal Business PlanIf you are looking for extra guidance with an industry-specific business plan, you can visit Bplans.com to access over 500 free real-world business plan examples from a wide variety of industries to guide you through writing your own plan.

Using a deck for your business plan is a quick, to-the-point means of providing your best-selling points while still providing the necessary details. The question is: How do you best organize and minimize the breadth of a business plan in a PowerPoint presentation?Follow the 10–20–30 rule—ten slides, 20 minutes, and a minimum of a 30-point font. Here's how it works:What Is the 10–20–30 Rule?1. Your first slide is your title slide, providing the name of the business, your name and title, and contact information— plus a slogan if you have one. If you can, use one succinct sentence to describe what your business does.2. The next slide should introduce a problem that persists and is relatable to your target market. You want the audience to relate to the problem or understand how it affects others. Use can cite statistics to help support your claims, but narrow them down to one or two.



Related: 6 Tips For Making A Winning Business Presentation3. The third slide should get to your solution. In simple terms, briefly describe how your business has figured out how to alleviate the problem. Make sure the audience understands that you have a unique approach. You might also add a few words to support your overall value proposition.4. Explain how you will make money. What are your revenue sources? Who are your customers? What is your pricing structure? Then, describe briefly about how you expect to profit.5. This is the slide where you present more detail on your operating plan. How does it all work? Is it self-service? Kiosks? Personal service? Give the reader a short version of how the business operates. Provide a summary, from buying the goods to marketing them to sales and shipping. You can include a little technology, but remember to keep it in layman's terms. This is where you may need a second visual slide to show how it all works.


6. Present your marketing plan in a few short words. After all, if you want to create dynamic advertising and promotional campaigns, what better way to start than briefly explaining how you plan to market the business? Share a few specifics rather than saying ""on the internet"" or ""on TV."" Let your listeners know you have a marketing plan and can keep it within a reasonable budget.7. Mention your key competitors—but be nice. Explain what gives you the competitive edge.Related: Vusi Thembkwayo's 7 Rules Of Pitching8. This is where you introduce your team, with a few very brief highlights (one line) of each member's background related to the business. Remember, people invest in other people.9. Financials. This slide should show a clear projection with a three- to five-year forecast. Explain the method you used to arrive at your numbers.10. Lastly, show them where your business is at present. What have you done thus far, and how are you looking to move forward sooner rather than later? Offer a positive call to action based on what you have accomplished and what you will accomplish in the future.Should you stop at 10 slides? It depends. There are many ways to go about putting together your deck. If you need to go to twelve slides, do so, but try not to go longer.

Not everyone is deeply embedded in your industry.Don't read your slides word for word. Your audience can read what's on the screen. Instead, highlight something easy for them to digest and use your comments to provide a little deeper explanation. This way, you present more information, some printed and some verbally.Take a breath. There's no need to rush. Remember to breath between slides so you don't start motoring along.Do not focus on technology. Technology is interesting in small doses, but too much can take the focus off of the human element of your business.Don't overload slides. You've heard the term TMI? The same goes for business decks. People can only read and digest so much.Less is more. Don't pack too much into a PowerPoint presentation. You want to avoid the dreaded ""PowerPoint Poisoning"" effect, in which and overload of information casts a spell on your audience or puts them to sleep.Related: Crafting A Simple Business PlanHow to Write a Business Growth PlanWe highly recommend growth planning to get the most from your business plan. It's an ongoing business planning process that combines the simplicity of the mini plan (or one-page plan) with the continuing use and focus of the working plan.It just takes four simple steps:Create a plan Quickly size up the potential of your idea, validate that it can be a real business, and set goals to make it work.Build your forecast Develop an expense budget and financial projections to understand better where your business is now and where it is headed.Review the results Compare your forecast against your actual sales and expenses each month to stay accountable and uncover new ideas.Refine your strategy Adjust your business plan and forecast based on your learnings.Related: A Few Pointers On The Worst Way To Write A Pitch DeckRemember, the goal of growth planning isn't just to produce documents that you use once and shelve it. Instead, it helps you build a healthier company that will outlast all the business failure statistics. It's faster than traditional business planning. You can complete an initial one-page plan that covers all of the necessary details about your business in just thirty minutes. You can revise your plan and strategy in minutes instead of hours. This means that your plan stays up-to-date and useful for identifying potential problems and opportunities. It's concise. Because growth planning requires you to document your ideas with limited text, your ideas are distilled to their essence.

84,How to Write the Management Team Section to Your Business Plan,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-write-the-management-team-section-to-your-business/459467,"
One crucial aspect of any business plan is the management team slide, which outlines the key employees in the organization. Here are some things to keep in mind when putting together your all-star lineup.Put Yourself FirstDon't be modest. If you're the head of the business, you should feature yourself first. After all, you are the entrepreneur behind the business venture, and you will have to put your neck on the line, answer the hard questions, and take the criticism— as well as the praise and acclaim, should there be some.If you want to impress people with your management team, it's essential to let your readers know who is at the helm and who is selecting the management team. Explain your background, including your vision, your credentials, and why you chose the management team you did.A business follows the lead of the founder, and as such, you need to briefly explain what is expected of this management team and the role you see it, as a group, playing in the future of this business.



Related: Does Your Team Have the Right Stuff to Attract Venture Capital?Highlight These CharacteristicsIdentifying your managers is about presenting what they bring to the table. You can provide this by describing them in terms of the following characteristics:Education Impressive educational credentials among company managers provide strong reasons for an investor or other plan reader to feel good about your company. Use your judgment in deciding what educational background to include and how to emphasize it. If you're starting a fine restaurant, for example, and your chef graduated at the top of her class from the Culinary Institute of America, play that front and center. If you're starting a courier service and your partner has an anthropology degree from a little-known school, mention it, but don't make a big deal out of it.Employment Prior work experience in a related field is something many investors look for. If you've spent ten years in management in the retail men's apparel business before opening a tuxedo outlet, an investor can feel confident that you know what you're doing. Likewise, you'll want to explain your team members' key, appropriate positions. Describe any relevant jobs in terms of job title, years of experience, names of employers, and so on. But remember, this isn't a resume. You can feel free to skim over or omit any irrelevant experience. You do not have to provide exact dates of employment.


Related: How to Craft a Business Plan That Will Turn Investors' HeadsSkills A title is one thing, but what you learn while holding it is another. In addition to pointing out that you were a district sales manager for a stereo equipment wholesaler, you should describe your responsibilities and the skills you honed while fulfilling them. Again, list your management team's skills that pertain to this business. A great cook may have incredible accounting skills, but that doesn't matter in the new restaurant's kitchen.Each time you mention skills that you or a management team member has spent years acquiring at another company, it will be another reason for an investor to believe you can do it at your own company.Accomplishments Dust off your plaques and trot out your calculator for this one. If you or one of your team members has been awarded patents, achieved record sales gains, or once opened an unbelievable number of new stores in the space of a year, now's the time to talk about it. Don't brag. Just be factual and remember to quantify. If, for example, you have twelve patents, your sales manager had five years of thirty percent annual sales gains, and you oversaw the grand openings of forty-two stores in eleven months, this is the stuff investors and others reading your business plan will want to see. Investors are looking to back impressive winners, and quantifiable results speak strongly to businesspeople of all stripes.Personal information Investors want to know with whom they're dealing in terms of the personal side. Personal information on each member of your management team may include age, city of residence, notable charitable or community activities, and, last but not least, personal motivation for joining the company. Investors like to see vigorous, committed, and involved people in the companies they back. Mentioning one or two of the relevant personal details of your key managers may help investors feel they know what they're getting into, especially in today's increasingly transparent business climate.Related: How to Evaluate Your Startup Like a VCWho to Include in Your PlanShould you mention everyone in your organization down to shop foremen or stop with the people on your executive committee? The answer is probably neither. Instead, think about your managers in terms of the crucial functions of your business.


In deciding the scope of the management section of your plan, consider the following business functions, and make sure you've explained who will handle those that are important to your enterprise:AccountingAdvertisingDistributionFinanceHuman ResourcesLegalTrainingMarketingOperationsProductionPurchasingSalesTechnical OperationsRelated: How To Build a Team of Outside Experts for Your BusinessWhat Does Each Person Do?There's more to a job than a title. A director in one organization is a high and mighty individual, whereas a director is practically nobody in another company. Many industries have unique job titles, such as managing editor, creative director, and junior accountant level II, with no counterparts in other industries.In a longer plan, when you give your management team's background and describe their titles, don't stop there. Go on and tell the reader exactly what each management team member will be expected to do in the company. This may be especially important in a startup, where not every position is filled. If the CFO will handle your marketing work until you get further down the road, let readers know this upfront. You certainly can't expect them to figure that out on their own.In a shorter business plan, or mini-plan, choose those people most vital to your business. If you are opening a martial arts studio, the instructors, or lead instructors, are significant, as is the software developer in a new software company. While you have room to describe these people in more detail in a longer plan, in the shorter miniplans, use one defining sentence for your top five people.Related: 6 Tips for Making a Winning Business PresentationFuture HiresIf you do have significant holes in your management team, you'll want to describe your plans for filling them. You may say, for example, ""Marketing duties are being handled temporarily by the vice president for finance. Once sales have reached the $500,000 per month level, approximately six months after startup, a dedicated vice president of marketing will be retained to fulfill that function.""


In some cases, particularly if you're in a really shaky startup and need solid talent, you may have to describe in some detail your plans for luring a hotshot industry expert to your fledgling enterprise. Then, briefly describe your ideal candidate. For a mini-plan, you may write, ""We plan to hire a marketing VP who excels in reaching our 20–29 target market.""Related: Vusi Thembekwayo's 7 Rules of Pitching

Close your eyes. Imagine that it's five years from now. Where do you want to be? What will the business look like? Will you be running a business that hasn't increased significantly in size? Will you command a rapidly growing empire? Will you have already cashed out and be relaxing on a beach somewhere, enjoying your hard-won gains?Now is a good time to free-associate — let your mind roam, exploring every avenue you want your business to go down. Try writing a personal essay on your business goals. It could take the form of a letter written to yourself from five years in the future describing all you have accomplished and how it came about.Related: Defining Your Business GoalsAs you read over your words, you may make a few surprising discoveries. Maybe you don't want to own a large, fast-growing enterprise but would be content with a stable small business. Even if you don't learn anything new, getting a firm handle on your goals and objectives is a big help in deciding how you plan your business.



Business goals may differ from those you set for yourself, such as more vacation time or weight loss objectives. Business goals are typically long-term calculated plans that you are working toward. They may encompass one or several shorter objectives and can be measured along the way, often by setting up milestones. Goals should be realistic and include a time frame.Related: The Main Objectives Of A Business PlanThe same goes for your business objectives. In business, objectives are specific results you seek to achieve within a specific time. They are usually short-term and are easily measurable. Minimizing expenses, increasing revenue, and rolling out a new product are examples of objectives. They can also help you meet long-term goals.12 Questions to Ask YourselfIf you're having trouble deciding your goals and objectives, here are some questions to ask yourself.


How determined am I to see this venture succeed?Am I willing to invest my own money and work long hours for no pay, sacrificing personal time and lifestyle for years?What will happen to me if this venture doesn't work?If it does succeed, how many employees will this company eventually have?What will be its annual sales in a year? Five years?What will be its market share in that time frame?Will it be a niche market or sell a broad spectrum of goods and services?What are the plans for geographic expansion? Local? National? Global?Will I be a hands-on manager, or will I delegate a large proportion of tasks to others?If I delegate, what sorts of tasks will I share? Sales? Technical? Others?How comfortable am I taking direction from others? Could I work with partners or investors who demand company management input?Will this venture remain independent and privately owned, or will it eventually be acquired or go public?Related: When Is The Best Time To Write Your Business PlanYour plan may look beautiful, but without a solid understanding of your intentions in business, it is likely to lack coherence and, ultimately, prove ineffective. Let's say in one section you describe a mushrooming enterprise on a fast-growth track, then elsewhere endorse a slow and steady expansion strategy. Any business plan reader worth his or her salt is going to be bothered by inconsistencies like these. They suggest that you haven't thought through your intentions. Avoid inconsistency by deciding in advance what your goals and objectives will be and sticking with them.Related: Look Ahead To These 4 Business Plan Milestones

So you've looked over different types of business plans. Which one is best for you? Odds are that you'll need more than one variety. If you want to get maximum impact from your plan, you'll need to tailor it to address the particular needs of each potential audience. Here are some tips to make your presentation stand out from the pack.Target Your AudienceThe potential readers of a business plan are varied, ranging from bankers and venture capitalists to employees. Although this is a diverse group, it is also a finite one. Each type of reader does have certain typical interests. If you know these interests up front, you can consider them when preparing a plan for that particular audience.Active venture capitalists see hundreds of plans in a year. Most plans probably receive no more than a glance from a given venture capitalist before being rejected; others get just a cursory inspection. Even if your plan excites initial interest, it may receive only a few minutes of attention. When courting these harried investors, it's essential that you make the right impression fast.Related: 4 Business Plan Strategies For Attracting Investors



Be ConciseThe key is to emphasize a compelling, succinct summary and explanation of the primary business concept and not stint on the details about the impressive backgrounds of your management team. That said, make it concise and to the point. Remember, time is of the essence to venture capitalists and other investors. Bankers tend to be more formal than venture capitalists and more concerned with financial strength than with exciting concepts and impressive resumes. For these readers, you'll want to give extra attention to balance sheets and cash flow statements. Ensure they're fully detailed and come with notes to explain any anomalies or possible points of confusion.Angel investors may not insist on seeing a plan at all, but your responsibilities as a businessperson require you to show them one anyway. For such an informal investor, prepare a less formal plan. Rather than going for impressive bulk, seek brevity. An angel investor used to playing her hunches might be put off by an imposing plan rather than impressed with your thoroughness. If you were thinking about becoming a partner in a firm, you'd no doubt be very concerned with the responsibilities you would have, the authority you would carry, and the ownership you would receive in the enterprise.Naturally, anyone who is considering partnering with you is going to have similar concerns. So ensure that any plan presented to a potential partner deals comprehensively with the ownership structure and clearly spells out matters of control and accountability.Related: Why You Shouldn't Send Your Business Plan To Investors


Customers looking at your business plan probably do so because they are contemplating building a long-term relationship with you. They will certainly be more concerned about your relationships with your other customers and, possibly, suppliers than most of your readers. So deal with these sections of your plan in greater depth, but you can be more concise in other areas. Customers rarely read a company's business plan, so you'll probably have your mini-plan available for these occasions.Suppliers have many of the same concerns as customers, except they're in the other direction on the supply chain. They'll want, above all, to make sure you can pay your bills, so be sure to include adequate cash flow forecasts and other financial reports. Suppliers, who naturally would like their customers to order more and more, are likely to be quite interested in your growth.If you can show you're growing a lot, you may be in a better position to negotiate terms with your suppliers. Like customers, most suppliers do not take the time to read lengthy business plans, so again, focus on the shorter version for such purposes. Strategic allies usually come to you for something specific—technology,distribution, complementary customer sets, etc. So, any plan you show to a potential ally will stress this aspect of your operation. Sometimes potential strategic partners may also be potential competitors, so you may want to present your plan in stages, saving sensitive information such as financials and marketing strategies for later in the process when trust has been established.Related: How To Use Your Business PlanManagers in your company use the plan primarily to remind themselves of objectives, keep strategies clear, and monitor company performance and market conditions. You'll want to stress such things as corporate mission and vision statements and analyses of current industry and economic factors. The most important part of a plan intended for management consumption is probably in the financials. You'll want to take special care to make it easy for managers to compare sales revenue, profitability, and other key financial measures against planned performance.There's one caution to the plan-customization exercise. Limit your alterations from one plan to another. Don't show one set of numbers to a banker you're trying to borrow money from and another to a partner you're trying to lure on board. It's one thing to stress one aspect of your operation over another for presentation purposes and entirely another to distort the truth.


Proofread Your PlanJust as fine dining locales offer finer sensory experiences than coffee shops or fast-food eateries, your presentation will differ from a working plan. A working plan should be free from major errors, but a presentation plan must be proofread carefully several times by several people so that it is definitely free of grammatical errors or typos. You also may find inconsistencies in a working plan that you need to address as you move forward with your business planning. These must not exist in a plan ready for presentation.Related: How To Craft A Business Plan That Will Turn Investors HeadsInclude investmentsIf you are already invested in the stock market, bonds, or even more directly in other businesses, you should let this be clearly known in your business plan. This provides readers with:an understanding that you are somewhat versed in matters of investing your level of risk tolerance based on your investmentsyour plans for growth, or ability to raise capital depending on your choices of investmentsInvesting indicates that you are planning ahead and looking to make profits through long-term growth, dividends, and other income-producing investment vehicles. Personal and business investments are essential to readers as they paint a picture of how you will handle financing.Related: How To Create A Business Plan Investors Will LoveConsider a Modular PlanInstead of writing a whole new plan for each audience, construct a modular plan with interchangeable sections. Pull out the resume section for internal use, for example, and plug it back in for presentation to an investor. A modular, mix-and-match plan saves time and effort while preserving flexibility. Many people do this with resumes: They have sections that they include or take out depending on the job for which they are applying.It's also essential that a presentation plan be accurate. A mistake here could be construed as a misrepresentation by an unsympathetic outsider. At best, it will make you look less than careful. If the plan's summary describes a need for $40,000 in financing, but the cash flow projection shows $50,000 in financing during the first year, you might think, ""Oops! Forgot to update that summary to show the new numbers."" The investor you're asking to pony up the cash, however, is unlikely to be so charitable.

Consider the impact visuals have in marketing, where studies show that people are much more likely to remember any presentation or advertisement with visuals than those without.""Not only does our brain process visual information so much more effectively than text, but visuals are also simply more persuasive, says Noah Parsons, a Silicon Valley product development veteran. ""A 3M-sponsored study found that presenters who use visual aids are 43 percent more effective in getting people to do what they want.""Related: The Main Objectives Of A Business PlanHe continues, ""Imagine that you're trying to get funding for your business and that your presentation could be more effective if it presents data visually instead of with text.

87,How to Fund Your Business With an SBA Loan,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/funding-your-business-with-an-sba-loan/459439,"
Sometimes the government really does want to help. The Small Business Administration (SBA) is devoted to helping small business people get started and run successful businesses. One of its most valuable offerings is a set of financial assistance programs that aim to help you raise the money you need to get started and keep going.General Small Business LoansThe most popular of several SBA loan programs is the 7(a) General Small Business Loans. The maximum loan amount is $5 million, but as of 2020, the average loan was $567,599. Loans guaranteed by the SBA are assessed a guaranty fee. This fee is based on the loan's maturity and the dollar amount guaranteed, not the total loan amount. The lender initially pays the guaranty fee, and it has the option to pass that expense on to the borrower at closing. The funds to reimburse the lender can be included in the overall loan proceeds.The SBA website provides a very comprehensive overview of all its loan programs and provides answers to many typical questions. Along with standard business loans, you'll find disaster loans, microloan programs, and real estate and equipment loans.Related: Will New SBA Programs Get Big Banks Lending?



Loan GuaranteesThe SBA can also provide some guarantees. The 7(a) loans, for example, are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, which guarantees a lender will get back most—but not all—of the money lent out, even if the borrower can't pay. A typical loan guarantee covers 80 percent of the loan. You will find it easier to borrow money and usually get a lower finance rate if you can get an SBA guarantee.Related:While the SBA sometimes lends money directly to small businesses, most of its financing help is in the form of loan guarantees. To avail yourself of these programs, you need to meet the SBA's definition of a small business and put up pretty much all the business's assets as collateral. Most banks handle SBA-backed loans and can tell you more about the programs. It's easier to learn by going to the SBA.gov website and reviewing its loans. You can also visit one of the SBA district offices.Related: Choosing A Business Loan Type


Small Business Investment Company ProgramThe SBA has a program that bridges the capital gap between loans (direct or guaranteed) and equity investments, which are the most difficult to find. Most banks are unwilling to offer very long-term loans (sometimes called ""quasi-capital""), and most venture capital firms are unwilling to invest under $3 million in businesses that are unlikely to go public or be acquired for a fancy multiple within three to five years. Enter the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC).Related: The Stimulus Cash Is Gone... Now What?Congress created the SBIC program in 1958 to fill the gap between the availability of venture capital and the needs of small businesses in startup and growth situations. SBICs, licensed and regulated by the SBA, are privately owned and managed investment firms that use their own capital plus funds borrowed at favorable rates with an SBA guarantee to make venture capital investments in small businesses.Virtually all SBICs are profit-motivated businesses. They provide equity capital, long-term loans, debt equity investments, and management assistance to qualifying small businesses. Their incentive is the chance to share in the success of the small business as it grows and prospers.Related: The Current State Of Business Lending And 5 Trends To WatchTwo Types of SBICsThere are two types of SBICs: regular SBICs and specialized SBICs, also known as 301(d) SBICs. Specialized SBICs invest in small businesses owned by entrepreneurs who are socially or economically disadvantaged, mainly members of minority groups.The program makes funding available to all types of manufacturing and service industries. Many investment companies seek out small businesses with new products or services because of the strong growth potential of such firms. Some SBICs specialize in the field in which their management has special knowledge or competency. Most, however, consider a wide variety of investment opportunities.

88,How to Make Your Business Plan Attractive to Prospective Partners,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/how-to-make-your-business-plan-attractive-to-prospective/459458,"
A good business plan can help you attract what are considered good people, from managers and other employees to vendors, suppliers, and partners. It gives people the idea that you have a well-thought-out plan of action, so they have more confidence that you have credibility and feel they are not jumping on board what may soon be a sinking ship. It can also give up-and-comers the idea that you offer training and advancement.Of course, ""good people"" is a very subjective term. A person with a great resume, treated poorly by management, is no longer very motivated and likely not to be a ""good person."" Conversely, a ""bad person,"" based on what you have on paper, may be an excellent hire with some training, trust, and fair treatment.Related: 12 Reasons You Need a Business PlanRegardless, what you offer as an entrepreneur will determine whom you will attract. In any economy, good or bad, people want to be treated with respect and are more likely to become part of your team if they see advancement and a corporate culture they can embrace. Therefore, just like dating, you need to present yourself and your business in a way that will give others a positive impression.



What Prospective Partners WantBusiness partners are like any other investor, and it would be a rare one who would come on board without some kind of plan. Partners want to know your basic business concept, the market, and your strategy for attacking it; who else is on your team; your financial performance, strengths, and needs are; and what's in it for them. Luckily, these are precisely the same questions a business plan is designed to address, so you're likely to please even a demanding prospective partner by simply showing him or her a well-prepared plan.Related: How to Create a Business Plan Investors Will LoveThe one difference is a plan probably won't contain the details of a partnership agreement. You'll need one of these to spell out the conditions of your partnership, no matter how well you and your prospective partner know, understand, and trust one another. Have an attorney familiar with partnerships help draft the paperwork so you are on the same page from the start and know exactly what is expected of each partner.Related: How to Craft a Business Plan That Will Turn Investors' Heads

89,How to Fund Your Business With Bonds and Indirect Funding Sources,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/fund-your-business-with-bonds-and-indirect-funding-sources/459445,"
There are two kinds of debt financing: straight loans and bonds. Bonds give you a way to borrow from a number of people without having to do separate deals with each of them. If you need to borrow $500,000, for instance, you can issue 500 bonds in $1,000 denominations. Then you can sell those bonds to anyone who'll buy them, including family, friends, venture capitalists, and other investors subject to stringent legal constraints.Related: How To Fund Your Business Using Banks and Credit UnionsCorporations use a bewildering variety of bonds for financing, but the most common type simply calls for you to pay a stated amount of interest on the face amount for a certain period. After that time, usually five years, you pay back the face amount to the buyer.Bonds give you the great advantage of being able to set the interest rate and terms and amount you're trying to raise instead of having to take whatever a lender offers. The problem with bonds is that they are regulated similarly to public stock offerings. So, although they're widely used by big companies, very few small companies issue them.



Related: Bootstrapping Is Not Just For Start-UpsThere is an exception to this general rule. Some states pool together long-term loans in state-guaranteed industrial bonds for industrial (read: job-creating) businesses. This has the advantage of lowering the issuing costs for the companies involved while providing the patient quasi-capital they need to succeed. Check with your state's economic development department.Indirect Funding SourcesDirect funding sources put money into your business. Indirect funding sources postpone taking money out of the business, thus conserving working capital. Trade credit is far and away the most important indirect source of funding.Trade Credit


You don't need a loan application, permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission, or even a note from your mother to take advantage of one of the most useful and popular forms of financing around. Trade credit, the credit extended to you by suppliers who let you buy now and pay later, can make a substantial difference to your cash flow.Related: 21 Ways To Quickly Fund Your Business GrowthYou can measure the amount of trade credit you have outstanding by simply adding up all your accounts payable, or the amount outstanding of bills on your desk. Any time you take delivery of materials, equipment, or other valuables without paying cash on the spot, you're using trade credit.For many businesses, trade credit is an essential form of financing. For instance, the owner of a clothing store who receives a shipment of bathing suits in April may not have to pay for them until June. By that time, she can hope to have sold enough of the suits to pay for the shipment. Without the trade credit, she'd have to look to a bank or another source for financing.Related: Choosing A Business Loan TypeFactoringFactoring is the flip side of trade credit. It's what happens when a supplier sells its accounts receivables to a financial specialist, called a factor. The factor immediately pays the amount of the receivables, less a discount, and receives the payments when they arrive from customers. Factoring is an important form of finance in many industries.

90,How to Fund Your Business With Venture Capital,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-fund-your-business-with-venture-capital/459466,"
Venture capitalists represent the most glamorous and appealing form of financing to many entrepreneurs. They are known for backing high-risk companies in the early stages, and a lot of the best-known entrepreneurial success stories owe their early financing to venture capitalists.When many entrepreneurs write a business plan, obtaining venture capital backing is what they have in mind. That's understandable. Venture capitalists are associated with business success. They can provide large sums of money, valuable advice, priceless contacts, and considerable prestige by their mere presence. Just the fact that you've obtained venture capital backing means your business has, in their eyes at least, considerable potential for rapid and profitable growth.Related: Everything You Need To Know About Attracting Venture CapitalistsVenture capitalists both lend to and make equity investments in young companies. The loans are often expensive, carrying rates of up to 20 percent. They sometimes also provide what may seem like very cheap capital. That means you don't have to pay out hard-to-get cash in the form of interest and principal installments. Instead, you give a portion of your or other owners' interest in the company in exchange for the VC's backing.



When Venture Capital Is an OptionVenture capital is most often used to finance companies that are young without being babies and that are established without being mature. But it can also help struggling firms as well as those that are on the edge of breaking into the big time.The following are the major types and sources of capital, along with distinguishing characteristics of each:Seed money. Seed money is the initial capital required to transform a business from an idea into an enterprise. Venture capitalists are not as likely to provide seed money as some other, less tough-minded financing sources, such as family investors. However, venture capitalists will back seedlings if the idea is strong enough and the prospects promising enough. If they see something new and exciting (usually an aspect of technology) and foresee rapid growth (and a strong potential for high earnings), they may jump in and back a fledgling startup. It's a long shot, but it does happen.VCs, however, are less likely to provide equity capital to a seed-money-stage entrepreneur than they are to provide debt financing. This may come in the form of a straight loan, usually some kind of subordinated debt. It may also involve a purchase of bonds issued by the company. Frequently these will be convertible bonds that can be exchanged for shares of stock. Venture capitalists may also purchase shares of preferred stock in a startup. Holders of preferred shares receive dividends before common stockholders and also get paid before other shareholders if the company is dissolved.


Related: The Truth About Venture Capitalist FundingSeed money is usually a relatively small amount of cash, up to $250,000 or so, that is used to prove a business concept has merit. It may be earmarked for producing working prototypes, doing market research, or otherwise testing the waters before committing to a full-scale endeavor.Startup capital. Startup capital is financing used to get a business with a proven idea up and running. For example, a manufacturer might use startup capital to get production underway, set up marketing, and create some actual sales. This amount may reach $1 million.Venture capitalists are frequently enthusiastic financiers of startups because they carry less risk than companies at the seed money stage but still offer the prospect of the high return on investment that VCs require.Later-round financing. Venture capitalists may also come in on some later rounds of financing. First-stage financing is usually used to set up full-scale production and market development. Second-stage financing is used to expand the operations of an already up-and-running enterprise, often through financing receivables, adding production capacity, or boosting marketing. Mezzanine financing, an even later stage, may be required for a major expansion of profitable and robust enterprises. Bridge financing is often the last stage before a company goes public. It may be used to sustain a growing company during the often lengthy process of preparing and completing a public offering of stock.Related: The Best Source Of Funding You'll Ever FindVenture capitalists even invest in companies that are in trouble. These turnaround investments can be riskier than startups and, therefore, even more expensive to the entrepreneurs involved.


Venture capital isn't for everybody, but it provides a very important financing option for some young firms. When writing a business plan to raise money, you may want to consider venture capitalists and their unique needs.What Venture Capitalists WantWhile venture capitalists come in many forms, they have similar goals. They want their money back, and they want it back with a lot of interest and capital growth.VCs typically invest in companies that they foresee being sold either to the public or to larger firms within the next several years. As part owners of the firm, they'll get their rewards when such sales go through. Of course, if there's no sale or if the company goes bankrupt, they don't even get their initial money back.Related: What Is Entrepreneur Capital VS Venture Capital VCs aren't quite the plungers they may seem. They're willing to assume risk, but they want to minimize it as much as possible. Therefore, they typically look for certain features in companies they are going to invest in. Those include:Rapid sales growthA proprietary new technology or dominant position in an emerging marketA sound management teamThe potential to be acquired by a larger company or be taken public in a stock offering within three to five yearsHigh rates of return on their investmentRates of ReturnLike most financiers, venture capitalists want the return of any funds they lend or use to purchase equity interest in companies. But VCs have some very special requirements regarding the terms they want and, especially, the rates of return they demand.Related: Why You Need To Think Twice About Venture Capital


Venture capitalists require that their investments have the likelihood of generating very high rates of return. A 30 percent to 50 percent annual rate of return is a benchmark many venture capitalists seek. That means if a venture capitalist invested $1 million in your firm and expected to sell out in three years with a 35 percent annual gain, he or she would have to be able to sell the stake for approximately $2.5 million.These are high rates of return compared with the 2.5 percent or so usually offered by ten-year U.S. Treasury notes and the nearly 10 percent historical return of the U.S. stock market. Venture capitalists justify their desires for such high rates of return by the fact that their investments are high-risk.Related: The Rise Of Alternative Venture CapitalMost venture-backed companies, in fact, are not successful and generate losses for their investors. Venture capitalists hedge their bets by taking a portfolio approach: If one in ten of their investments takes off and six do OK, then the three that stumble or fail will be a minor nuisance rather than an economic cold bath.Cashing-Out OptionsOne key concern of venture capitalists is a way to cash out their investment. This is typically done through a sale of all or part of the company, either to a larger firm through an acquisition or to the public through an initial stock offering.In effect, this need for cashing-out options means that if your company isn't seen as a likely candidate for a buyout or an initial public offering (IPO) in the next five years or so, VCs aren't going to be interested.Related: Why Raising Capital Is A 4-Step Process


Being AcquiredA common way for venture capitalists to cash out is for the company to be acquired, usually by a larger firm. An acquisition can occur through a merger or using a payment of cash, stock, debt, or some combination.Mergers and acquisitions don't have to meet the strict regulatory requirements of public stock offerings, so they can be completed much more quickly, easily, and cheaply than an IPO. Buyers will want to see audited financials, but you—or the financiers who may wind up controlling your company—can literally strike a deal to sell the company over lunch or a game of golf. About the only roadblocks that could be thrown up would be if you couldn't finalize the terms of the deal, if it turned out that your company wasn't what it seemed, or, rarely if the buyout resulted in a monopoly that generated resistance from regulators.Related: 8 Key Factors VCs Consider When Evaluating Start-UpsVenture capitalists assessing your firm's acquisition chances will look for characteristics like proprietary technology, distribution systems, or product lines that other companies might want to possess. They also like to see larger, preferably acquisition-minded, firms in your industry. For instance, Microsoft, the world's largest software firm, frequently acquires small personal computer software firms with talented personnel or unique technology. Venture capitalists looking at funding a software company are almost certain to include an assessment of whether Microsoft might be interested in buying out the company someday.Going Public: Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)Some fantastic fortunes have been created recently by venture-funded startups that went public. Initial public offerings of their stock have made numerous millionaires seemingly overnight. For example, when Twitter made its initial public offering for $26 in November 2013, the stock took off, gaining as much as 93 percent within a day and creating 1,600 millionaires. Wow! IPOs have made many millions for the venture investors who provided early-stage financing.Related: Should You Accept Or Reject VC FundingThe 2012 passage of the Jumpstart Our Small Business Startups (JOBS) Act allows for confidential filing of IPO-related documents. This has made it easier for small business owners who do not want their numbers getting out to the public too soon. There was often concern about investors getting too much preliminary information that could influence their decision to commit to the company. Confidentiality has increased the number of IPO filings in the small business community.


Nonetheless, an IPO takes a lot of time. You'll need to add outside directors to your board, clean up the terms of any sweetheart deals with managers, family, or board members, and have a major accounting firm audit your operations for several years before going public. If you need money today, in other words, an IPO isn't going to provide it.An IPO is also probably the most expensive way to raise money in terms of the amount you have to lay out up front. The bills for accountants, lawyers, printing, and miscellaneous fees for even a modest IPO will easily reach six figures. For this reason, IPOs are best used to raise amounts at least equal to millions of dollars in equity capital. Venture capitalists consider all these requirements when assessing an investment's potential for going public. Remember that the number of new businesses that go public is quite small.Related: 3 Alternatives To Start-Up Venture Capital FundingThe Truth About IPOsMany entrepreneurs dream of going public. But IPOs are not for every firm. The ideal IPO candidate has a record of rapidly growing sales and earnings and operates in a high-profile industry. Some have a lot of one and not much of the other. Low earnings but lots of interest characterize many biotech and internet-related IPOs. These tech companies are usually the ones that generate the huge IPOs and instant millionaires we read about.Potential Pitfall of VC FundingMany VCs insist on placing one or more directors on the boards of companies they finance. And these directors are rarely there just to observe. They take an active role in running the company.VCs also are reluctant to provide financing without obtaining an interest in the companies they back, sometimes a very significant and controlling interest. This can make them just as influential as if they had a majority of the directors on the board, or more so.Buzzword: Rate of ReturnRate of return is the income or profit earned by an investor on capital invested in a company. It is usually expressed as an annual percentage.

To build awareness and increase revenue, you need to master the four Ps of marketing: product, price, place, and promotion. Here we will discuss the all-important category of ""place.""PlacePlace refers to channels of distribution, or the means you will use to put your product where people can buy it. This can be very simple: Retailers and many service businesses (restaurants, personal services, business services) rely primarily on location. For manufacturers, conventional distribution systems have three steps: producer, wholesaler, and retailer. You may occupy or sell to members of any one of these steps. Some companies with vertically integrated distribution, such as Apple, occupy all the steps themselves. Others, like franchisors, are parts of systems that orchestrate the activities among all channels. Still others, such as independent retailers, operate in one channel only.Related: How to Define Your Product and Set Your PricesLocation ConsiderationsFor retailers, the big place question involves real estate. Location commonly determines success or failure for many retailers. That doesn't necessarily mean the same location will work for all retailers. A low-rent but high-traffic space near low-income housing may be a poor choice for a retailer stocking those Armani suits but will work fine for a fast-food restaurant or convenience store. Your location decision needs to be tied to your market, your product, and your price.



Two of the most common tools for picking location are census data and traffic surveys. Retailers relying on walk-in traffic want to get a location that has a lot of people walking or driving past. You can usually get traffic data from local economic development agencies or by simply sitting down with a clipboard and pencil and counting people or cars yourself. Census data describing the number, income levels, and other information about households in the nearby neighborhoods can be obtained from the same sources. An animal clinic, for example, wants to locate in an area with a lot of pet-owning households. This is the type of information you can get from census surveys. The census website, census.gov, is a great place to start searching for data. You can also learn a lot about marketing research by going to the Insights Association.Related: How to Effectively Promote Your Business to Customers and InvestorsSite SensitivityManufacturers require certain basic conditions for their sites, but retailers and some service firms are exquisitely sensitive to a wide variety of location factors. In some cases, a few feet can make the difference between a location that is viable and one that is not.Site selection plans for retailers should include traffic data, demographics of nearby populations, estimated sales per square foot, rental rates, and other important economic indicators. Service firms such as restaurants will want many of the same things. Service firms such as pest control services and bookkeeping businesses will want to provide information about local income levels, housing, and business activity.


Related: How to Write an Operations Plan for Retail and Sales BusinessesStore design also must be addressed. Retailing can be as much about entertaining shoppers as it is about displaying goods. So store design becomes very important, especially for high-fashion retailers or well-knowntech companies such as Apple. Floor plans are probably not enough here. Retailers may want to include photos or illustrations of striking displays, in-store boutiques, and the like.Related: I Watch Great Teams Make These Business-Destroying Mistakes All The Time. Here's Where They're Going Wrong (And How To Fix It).Then there is the internet and e-commerce, where physical location gives way to driving traffic to the site. This is where you need a Facebook page, Twitter handle, YouTube channel, Instagram for photos, and so forth. Social media is where e-tailers can make themselves known but only by using the accepted methods of the genre. Social media marketing is a different animal, and that means getting to know your prospective customers online without being sales-hungry or pushy. The hard sales push turns off the social media crowd. It is more about engaging effectively and building community.To get started, however, you need a Facebook page that draws attention and a presence on social media, which can take time to build. Followers on social media serve two very important purposes:They can become regular customers if you keep providing them with products they like to buy.They can spread the word to their social media followers. Word-of- mouth marketing is huge and cost-free to you once you've set the wheels in motion.The power of the internet is such that it can reach millions of people without your having to pay to reach them. It is light-years ahead of direct mailing, which can work in smaller business circles but does not make sense at a national or global level.

It all ties together.Related: How to Determine How Much Real Estate Your Business NeedsYour website is also influenced by what type of business you are running. For a brick-and-mortar business, it can be an adjunct means of marketing you and your goods.For a business selling through its locations and on the internet, it is a means of taking local shopping worldwide. Many e-tailers have found that they may carry items that do marginally well in their local stores but have an audience thousands of miles away. That's the beauty of the internet. Of course, this means factoring such shipping into your operations.


Related: How to Determine How Much Real Estate Your Business NeedsFor businesses that are strictly web-driven, you'll need to show how the site works and all that is set up behind the site for taking orders, shipping them, and handling customer service, which is important for all businesses today, but especially so for online businesses where buyers cannot walk in and return an item face-to-face.Along with the reasoning behind your site, you'll also want to have a website designed to suit your type of business and demographics. Therefore, a high-end jeweler and a kid-friendly fast-food restaurant will look quite different from one another on the web.You'll also want to keep it simple. Try not to overwhelm the viewers. Some white space isn't a bad thing. It's also important that you have a consistent message (for all marketing). If you're the high-end jeweler, then everything should have the same high-end appeal, photos, and wording. If you're the kid-friendly fast-food place, then everything should be about families and kids. Be consistent.Related: How to Build an Online Presence With Social MediaOne of the best ways to determine what you want, whether you end up using site-building software or hire someone to build your site, is to look at other sites and write down what you like.Many companies devote great time and effort to their web and social media presence. They look at the statistics provided and plan carefully how and when to post their messages.


The more your business is dependent on the internet, the more you will discuss it in your plan of operations. But you should definitely include it in your marketing plans. A business today without any mention of using the internet is suspicious.Related: 4 Steps to Creating Buzz on a Shoestring Budget20 Keys to Having an Excellent Website That Enhances Your Marketing PlanUpdate it regularly—nobody wants old news or information.Use content that interests your visitors—make it about them, not all about you.Avoid too many bells and whistles that slow down the site.Make it navigation-friendly—people who get lost will leave.Make it interactive with polls and surveys.Provide an ""about us"" page so visitors (including current customers) know who you are.Use colors that don't glare or make it hard to read.Check out how the pages look on various computers and mobile devices.Double-check to make sure all links work.Maintain control—even if someone else designs it, learn how to make your own changes.Link only to businesses you know are reliable.Keep it original—you can borrow ideas but don't use content from other sources, at least not without the permission of the other site owner or manager.Include a blog—if you don't write very well, hire a blogger.Use visuals—photos are worth thousands of words.Link to your social media sites—Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Pinterest, and so on. You don't need to be on all of them—look at their demographics.Make it clear how people can find you if you have a brick-and-mortar location(s).Make it clear how they can pay you—and make sure the process is simple—if you are selling on the internet.Include a site map.Use keywords in the site for SEO purposes to be found by search.Have easy-to-find contact information on every page.Related: What You Need to Know Before Finalizing the Price of your ProductDistribution ConcernsThere are three main issues in deciding on a placement strategy: coverage, control, and cost. Cost, it goes almost without saying, is an important part of any business decision, including distribution concerns. The other two issues, however, are unique to distribution and are trickier.Coverage refers to the need to cover a large or a small market. If you're selling laundry soap, you may feel the need to offer it to virtually every household in America. This will steer you toward a conventional distribution scheme running from your soap factory to a group of wholesalers serving particular regions or industries, to retailers such as grocery stores, and finally to the consumer. It can also be accomplished by selling online, saving you the need for numerous warehouses.Related: Use This Worksheet to Write a Product Description That SellsWhat if you are reaching out to only a small group, such as chief information officers of Fortune 500 companies? In this case, the conventional, rather lengthy distribution scheme is clearly inappropriate. You're likely to do better by selling directly to the CIOs through a company sales staff, sales reps, or perhaps an agreement with another company that already has sales access to the CIOs. In both these cases, coverage has a lot of say in the design of your distribution system.


Control is important for many products. Ever see any Armani suits at Target? The reason you haven't is that Armani works hard to control its distribution, keeping the costly apparel in high-end stores where its lofty prices can be sustained. Armani's need for control means that it deals only with distributors who sell to designer boutiques. Many manufacturers want similar control for reasons of pricing, after-sale service, image, and so forth. If you need control over your distribution, it will powerfully influence placement decisions.Related: 5 Must-Answer Questions to Succeed Targeting Your Customer BaseThe distribution scheme is of critical importance to manufacturers. Say you make a mass-market consumer good such as a toy. Whether you plan effectively to get your product onto shelves in the major grocery, drug, and discount store chains may make all the difference between success and failure.If you're selling an informational product to a narrow market, such as political consulting services to candidates for elected office, physical distribution is of less importance. However, for just about all companies, an effective placement strategy is a big determinant of success.

92,How to Identify and Research Your Competition,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-conduct-competitive-analysis-in-a-business-plan/459651,"
Successful entrepreneurs are renowned for intuitively feeling a market's pulse, project trends before anyone else detects them, and identifying needs that even customers are unaware of. After you are famous, perhaps you can claim a similar psychic connection to the market. But for now, you'll need to reinforce your claims to market insight by presenting solid research in your plan.Market research aims to understand the reasons consumers will buy your product. It studies consumer behavior, specifically how cultural, societal, and personal factors influence that behavior. For instance, market research aiming to understand consumers who buy in-line skates might study the cultural importance of fitness, the societal acceptability of marketing directed toward children and teens, and the effect of personal influences such as age, occupation, and lifestyle in directing a skate purchase.Related: 4 Effective Ways To Accomplish This Missing Step That Most Entrepreneurs OverlookMarket research is often split into two varieties: primary and secondary. Primary research studies customers directly, whereas secondary research studies information others have gathered about customers. Primary research might be telephone interviews or online polls with randomly selected target group members. You can also study your own sales records to gather primary research. Secondary research might come from reports on other organizations' websites or blogs about the industry.



Conducting market research provides answers to those unknown elements. It will greatly reduce risk as you start your business. It will help you understand your competitive position and the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors. And it will improve your marketing and sales process.""Related: You Need Consumer Insights To Ensure The Success Of Your Business. Here Are Five Ways To Find Them.Questions to Ask About Your IndustryTo start preparing your industry analysis and outlook, dig up the following facts about your field:What is your total industry-wide sales volume? In dollars? In units?What are the trends in sales volume within your industry?Who are the major players and your key competitors? What are they like?What does it take to compete? What are the barriers to entry?What technological trends affect your industry?What are the main modes of marketing?How does government regulation affect the industry?In what ways are changing consumer tastes affecting your industry?What are recent demographic trends affecting the industry?How sensitive is the industry to seasons and economic cycles?What are key financial measures in your industry (average profit margins, sales commissions, etc.)?Related: 5 Essential Elements of Your Industry Trends Plan


How to Find Similar CompaniesFind a close match when looking at comparable businesses (and their data). For comparative purposes, consider:Companies of relative size.Companies serving the same geographic area could be global if you plan to be a web-based business.Companies with a similar ownership structure. If you are two partners, look for businesses run by a couple of partners rather than an advisory board of twelve.Relatively new companies. While you can learn from long-standing businesses, they may be successful today because of their twenty-five-year business history and reputation.You will want to use the data you have gathered to determine how much business you could do and to figure out how you will fit into and adapt to the marketplace.Related: How to Make Your Business Stand OutHow To Do Original ResearchOne limitation of in-house market information is that it may not include exactly what you're looking for. For instance, if you'd like to consider offering consumers financing for their purchases, it's hard to tell how they'd like it since you don't already offer it.You can get around this limitation by conducting original research—interviewing customers who enter your store, for example, or counting cars that pass the intersection where you plan to open a new location—and combining it with existing data. Follow these steps to spending your market research dollars wisely:Determine what you need to know about your market. The more focused the research, the more valuable it will be.Prioritize the results of the first step. You can't research everything, so concentrate on the information that will give you the best (or quickest) payback.Review less expensive research alternatives. Small Business Development Centers and the Small Business Administration can help you develop customer surveys. Your trade association will have good secondary research. Be creative.Estimate the cost of performing the research yourself. Keep in mind that with the internet you should not have to spend a ton of money. If you're considering hiring a consultant or a researcher, remember this is your dream, these are your goals, and this is your business.Don't pay for what you don't need.Related: The One Simple Task That Will Help Your Startup Succeed

93,When to Update Your Business Plan,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/9-signs-its-time-to-update-your-business-plan/459459,"
When's the best time to update your business plan? How about always.Writing a business plan is one of those skills that improve with practice. The first one or two times you create a plan, you may feel a little unsure of yourself and even less certain that what you're doing has value.If you go on to start several ventures during your career, you'll naturally write several business plans, and each one will be better than the last. It's likely also that with better planning skills will come improved business skills, boosting the odds that each successive company you start will do better than the previous one.But there's no reason that only serial entrepreneurs should benefit from regular business planning sessions. If you start just one company or never start a company at all, you should be constantly honing your business planning skills by updating your business plan.



Related: 6 Reasons to Update Your Business PlanUpdating a plan usually is easier than starting from scratch. Instead of trying to figure out what your basic business concept is, you only have to decide whether it's changing. You'll usually be able to reuse the financial formulas, spreadsheets, management biographies, and other more or less evergreen contents of your plan.Nine Reasons You Should Update Your PlanWhen's the best time to update a plan? Here are nine instances you might want to give it a tweak.A new financial period is about to begin. You may update your plan annually, quarterly, or even monthly if your industry changes quickly.You need financing. Lenders and other financiers need an updated plan to make financing decisions.Your customers' needs and desires have changed. Talk to your customers often to find out what they're buying, if your solutions still meet their needs, and if you can provide new solutions.Significant markets change. Shifting client tastes, consolidation trends among customers, and altered regulatory climates can trigger a need for plan updates.New or stronger competitors are looking to your customers for their growth.Your firm develops a new product, technology, service, or skill. If your business has changed a lot since you wrote your plan, it's time for an update.You have had a change in management. New managers should get fresh information.Your company has crossed a threshold, such as moving out of your home office, reaching $1 million in sales, or employing 100 people.Your old plan doesn't seem to reflect reality anymore. Maybe you did a poor job last time. Maybe things have just changed faster than you expected. But if your plan seems irrelevant, redo it.Related: When Is the Best Time to Write Your Business Plan?


Don't RushSome entrepreneurs may be more prone to rushing into making changes to their business plan when things aren't working out. One important thing to remember: Take your time.""Don't feel like it's a requirement to update your plan. You should only refine your plan if your strategy either isn't working or things are going much better than you had originally planned, says Noah Parsons COO of Palo Alto Software. ""If you're meeting your expectations, staying the course might be the best bet.""Related: Business Plan Updating ChecklistTake the time to challenge some of the core assumptions of your prior plan to see if they still hold up. Have profit margins been higher than you expected? Then, plan to make the most of any extra cash you generate. Is your new retail store unit not performing as well as you expected? Now's the time to figure out why. Has competition for your new product arisen sooner than you guessed? Look at other products to see if they are more vulnerable than you think.In large corporations with strict planning routines requiring annual, semiannual, and quarterly plans and plan updates, managers spend at least part of their time working on or considering a new plan or plan update. All that information flowing up to senior managers in the form of plans helps keep the brass informed. It helps those in the trenches, too. It's a fact that everybody is judged by past performance. The best way to ensure that a year from now you'll be looking back on your performance with satisfaction and pride is to plan now and often.Related: The Benefits and Risks of Writing a Business PlanBe ConservativeWhile you don't want to fail, there is a point when rewriting a business plan that you have to admit the possibility of failure. It's only natural to create a plan that will describe a roaring success. But you have to be careful not to present an overly optimistic view, especially of such elements as sales, costs, and profit margins.


It's tempting to noodle around with the numbers until you produce the desired result. And if you make only minor changes here and there, it may seem all right. What difference does it make? Say you increase your projected market share by 1 percent here, reduce expected costs by 2 percent, and lower your estimated required startup capital by a few percentage points.Related: 12 Reasons You Need a Business PlanSome similarly small changes, in sum, can make a big difference in the bottom line of your plan and turn what otherwise looks like a loser into a projected winner. But don't be seduced. You may ask for investments from friends and family you care about and put your life savings into the enterprise. The feelings of arm's-length investors may not be so important, but if you mislead them in your plan, you may open yourself up to accusations of misrepresentation.Looking at things in your plan through rose-colored glasses may even doom your business to failure if it causes you to seek insufficient startup capital, underprice your product or service, or expect unrealistically rapid growth. Temper your enthusiasm. If your plan indicates that the business idea isn't sound, by all means, look for errors. But don't make the mistake of skewing your plan to fit an idea that isn't sound.Related: The Ultimate Guide to Writing a Business Plan

This story originally appeared on Readwrite.comYour business might be everything you could ever want it to be, but that doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement. We should all be striving for success in everything we do. Exploring enhancement opportunities with the latest technology and AI makes sense. Not every business owner will know the most effective ways to use tech to their advantage, so it doesn't hurt to perform research.How to Enhance Your Business With AIAutomated Employee ScreeningMany HR processes can be time-intensive. This can be frustrating if your job involves hiring new employees quickly to fill employee shortages. Your business may not have time to browse hundreds of applications and interview dozens of potential employees.



Related: How to Use AI and Automation to Boost Your Business GoalsThat's where recruitment AI or automated employee screening comes in. Some AI programs can perform initial assessments of potential employees on your behalf to determine their suitability. Once the AI has done its job, you can make your hiring decision from a much smaller pool of potential applicants to save time.


Social Media Management ToolsMost business owners know how effective social media can be for enhancing a business. Yet, they can find these platforms overwhelming when there are so many to join. Fortunately, many social media management tools are designed to help companies streamline this critical task. You no longer need to create posts on each platform. Instead, you can schedule them and monitor the results within one piece of innovative software.Accounting SoftwareAccounting is a crucial operation within businesses. Accounting processes show you where you're growing your revenue, whether customers pay their bills on time, and if you're making profits or losses.However, it can be complex and time-intensive. As a result, many businesses outsource accounting to professionals at a significant cost. AI in accounting could be a game-changer. AI accounting software can analyze financial data, predict trends, calculate financial health, and identify patterns to help you make budgeting decisions.Manufacturing RobotsWorker shortages are affecting many industries, manufacturing included. While you might think you just have to wait until skilled workers come along, that might not be the case. Many technology companies are working on robotic systems to supplement human workforces.


They can work with and around humans, adjust their behaviors to suit workflow speeds and tackle tasks you might otherwise need to hire humans for. It's important to note that these robots aren't designed to replace humans. Instead, they are being marketed as 'cobots' or collaborative robots who work independently in a shared space with humans. In most situations, they are coded to perform single tasks.Related: These 5 Companies Have Added Robots to Their WorkforceAs a result, they can free up human employees for more complex and skilled tasks. While expensive to implement in some industries, manufacturing robots might save your business money in the long run.Enhancing your business with AI and technology won't happen overnight, but it can happen with effort and time. Don't be afraid to try new processes and technologies in your business, even if you're unsure if they'll work for you. You might then be in a strong position to see your business thrive.

Delivering a good pitch for your business is as much about conveying emotion as conveying information. The saying ""They don't care what you know until they know that you care"" is good advice to follow. A pitch doesn't need to be long, and your audience will appreciate it if you keep the pitch as brief as possible. In the updated second edition of our best-selling book Write Your Business Plan, Eric Butow, CEO of online marketing ROI improvement firm Butow Communications Group, explains how you can put together a pitch in ten minutes that's broken down into one topic every minute.Order Write Your Own Business Plan Now and Get 1 Month of Free Access to Business Planning Software Liveplan PremiumEasy step-by-step business plan generatorBuilt-in financial calculators500+ sample plans and templates10-Minute Pitch PlannerMinute 1: Personal introduction. Let the audience know that you personally care about the people and the problem you are trying to solve.Minute 2: State the problem. People with this problem have emotions invested. They may be struggling, irritated, angry, and/ or disenfranchised. Keep human emotions real. Break down the problem into its component parts accompanied by a diagram.Minute 3: Present the solution. Show excitement and passion for your business's solution. Walk the audience not only through how the solution works but also through the great benefits of the solution.Minute 4: Show your business model. Now is the time to tell the audience how you will make money. Explain how you are going to charge people for the solution you are offering.Minute 5: Talk about your competition. Do not talk about how you're better than the competition. Instead, focus on how you're different. Your attitude toward the competition gives the audience a peek into your business soul. Are you dutifully respectful of their presence and power or are you arrogant enough to think your little startup will have no problem beating them? Err on the side of humility.Minute 6: Talk about your market and how you'll sell to them. Get excited as you talk about how many potential customers are out there and how you're going to get them. Take the audience through the market data, your chosen point of entry, and your sales and marketing strategy.Minute 7: Tell the audience about how much money you'll make. Talk about how selling to your market shows the unit economics of a single customer (price), and the size of the market shows how many potential deals are out there (quantity). Armed with this information, you can describe how revenue builds over timeMinute 8: Introduce your team. It's important to introduce your team in the context of the business so the audience understands why it is what it is. If you introduce the team up front, you will have to circle back to describe their roles later, which wastes time.Minute 9: Prove your business has traction. You need to show results to get investors and customers to buy in. So, answer important questions such as: What has the team accomplished? Does the company have revenue? Are the customers happy?Minute 10: Ask for the buy-in. You need to spend the last minute asking for people to buy into your business and your vision, no matter if that's asking investors for money or asking someone to work for you. In this last minute, paint a clear picture of what you need from the audience and what investing with you will look like.Write Your Own Business Plan is available now at Entrepreneur Bookstore | Barnes & Noble | AmazonBonus tipUse as many charts, tables, and other graphic elements as it takes to get your point across.

You think you have a great business idea, but is it really? Eric Butow, CEO of online marketing ROI improvement firm Butow Communications Group, has teamed up with Entrepreneur Media to update the second edition of our best-selling book Write Your Business Plan to help you along every step of the startup process: from vetting an idea to finding funding to building a team.In the following excerpt, Butow explains how to look at your idea from multiple angles, to see the strengths you should lean into, and find the faults you should fix before walking into an investor meeting.Before seeking investors, you need to know exactly what you are seeking and where that money will be spent. Not unlike justifying expenses when sending your taxes to the IRS, you need to justify the amounts you are asking for and be specific. Investors are not simply writing out checks with no idea of where the money will be spent. Sure, you can ask for a little more than you need in hopes that the negotiating brings you down to the amount you truly need for funding . . . or something reasonably close. It's also important to maintain your credibility because you will probably need additional funding as your company grows. Therefore, if you squander the money your investors have provided, you can be pretty sure you won't get a round two when you need additional funding. Having justification for what you put in your plan is essential for winning over someone reading it. Random ideas get random results. Wellthought-out, justified ideas get serious consideration.

97,3 Valuable Business Lessons from Harvard's Unabomber College Reunion Controversy,"Oct 2, 2023",Jon B. Becker,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-valuable-business-lessons-from-the-unabombers-college/458950,"
Written by Jon B. Becker and Jonathan C. BeckerIn 2012, the Harvard Alumni Office mailed out fifty-year class reunion notices to the Class of 1962 for Harvard University and the Radcliff School. In these notices, they included a questionnaire inviting alums to share what they have accomplished since graduation and to update their class on their current occupation and the awards they have received. The responses to these questionnaires were then published in the alum book.Among the many distinguished alums who responded was perhaps the most famous or, more accurately, most infamous graduate of Harvard, Theodore Kaczynski (aka The Unabomber). Kaczynski was a convicted domestic terrorist responsible for the deaths of three people and injury of twenty-three others in a bombing spree that began in 1978 and lasted almost two decades.



In his response to the alumni office, Mr. Kaczynski listed his current occupation as ""Prisoner,"" included his infamous Manifesto as a ""publication,"" and under awards listed his ""eight life sentences, issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, 1998.""The alumni association then published these responses in the ""Harvard and Radcliffe Classes of 1962 -- Fiftieth Anniversary Report."" The reaction from families of Kaczynski's victims, other Harvard alums and the media was, of course, swift and well publicized.


Although this error was met with a mix of laughter and dismay, the negative publicity Harvard received was very real and very embarrassing. Sadly, it was also totally avoidable if Harvard had just paid a bit more attention.This, of course, makes it a great cautionary tale for business leaders teaching three truths of business risk mitigation: 1) all risks are asymmetrically negative, 2) near misses must always trigger reassessment, and 3) complacency is usually the root cause of error.Related: 7 Ways to Recover After a Reputation Crisis1. Risk is always asymmetrically negativeEvents that have the potential to harm an organization are almost always asymmetrically negative. In other words, while they may contribute little to no positive impact on the organization if they go well, they will have a disproportionately negative impact if they go poorly.


For example, airlines fly tens of thousands of safe flights daily. Taken on their own, none of these flights help a given airline to build its reputation. Even collectively, they are, at best, mildly positive to neutral in their contribution to the airline's brand. After all, we expect airlines to be safe, so a safe flight is not newsworthy.By contrast, crashes are extraordinary. As such, even a single crash can attract much attention and destroy the airline's reputation.The same is true in the Unabomber's case. Harvard has tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of alumni. Almost all these alumni do not affect their reputation. A few highly successful (e.g., Barack Obama, John F. Kennedy, Natalie Portman, Neil deGrasse Tyson, etc.) may have a very slight positive effect.However, the association with a single graduate who engages in terrible behavior, which then becomes associated with the school (In this case, serial murder by bombing and terrorism) is extremely negative for the school's reputation.


Related: 4 Strategies Entrepreneurs Must Follow to Mitigate the Risk of Failure2. Near misses are a cautionary tale to reassess preventionIt is essential for risk prevention that any near miss is treated as though the event occurred. The difference between a near miss and a catastrophe is often just luck. As a result, a near miss should be viewed as an opportunity to learn the lessons of a disaster without suffering the losses. For example, two airplanes that almost collide, no matter the reason, are always viewed by the FAA as a near-fatal collision and investigated to prevent an actual fatality in the future. Yet, too often, close calls are just brushed off as ""we got lucky there,"" and no further action is taken. A near miss simply must drive the same type of self-assessment process that the actual accident would have driven, or it will eventually be followed by disaster.In the case of the Unabomber, Harvard had already had several prior indications that he was damaging their brand. These included a book arguing that his experiences at Harvard may have been the root of his evil, numerous articles and book chapters discussing Kaczynski's time at Harvard and, of course, the news media constantly drawing the association between him and Harvard during his trial and sentencing.None of these painted Harvard in a positive light. All of these should have provoked a risk assessment on the part of Harvard and a very clear distancing between themselves and Kaczynski, not the least of which should have included them purging him from their mailing and invitation lists. Yet, it would appear that this didn't happen, which created yet another chance for him to damage their brand, which he certainly seized upon.


3. Complacency is the real enemyThe most common cause of preventable risk is complacency. When one conducts root cause analysis on catastrophic events, they almost always find that those in a position to prevent the event failed to do so because they had grown complacent to the threats posed.This is rooted in two things: positive results bias and asymmetry of risk for positive and negative events. First, virtually every time before the accident, the thing that caused it went perfectly and was uneventful. This positive results bias causes those tasked with handling it to be lulled into believing that the risk of a negative outcome is near zero and, therefore, not a danger.Additionally, because the impact of each single event has no apparent effect on the brand, its potential downside to the organization begins to get underestimated. Since the perceived danger of a failure is seen as unlikely, and the potential risk is underestimated, it becomes easy for those who are facing the risk to become complacent about the risks posed and relax their vigilance and safety procedures. This, of course, actually increases the risk of an adverse event.While there is no way to know precisely what the level of complacency was at Harvard, one thing is clear: there were undoubtedly many people who could have prevented this from occurring and didn't. After all, someone changed his address to the Supermax Prison, someone received his response, someone copied that response into the Alumni Report, and someone proofread that report. What is clear is that none of these people caught this problem, which should have mandated action.


Related: Complacency Kills Your Business. Here's How to Fight It.ConclusionInitially, the news coverage of the Unabomber's college reunion prank was just an embarrassment to Harvard. It created an opportunity for people to mock the college and allowed Kaczynski to use his sense of humor to humanize himself. However, the story quickly moved to deeply negative narratives about Harvard's psychology experiments on Kaczynski as an undergrad and questioned whether Harvard had somehow ""caused"" his evil.It also gave pundits more opportunities to revive the topic and damage the school's reputation on news programs and Sunday morning TV. While this incident was annoying to the families of his victims, mildly amusing to bystanders, and fun for Kaczynski, it also created a memorable opportunity to see how seemingly small errors can lead to significant issues if risk mitigation is not properly handled.

""The absolute biggest business plan mistake you can make is to not plan at all."" So writes Noah Parsons in his helpful blog post 17 Key Business Plan Mistakes to Avoid in 2023. But how does one pull together all of the necessary components of a cohesive plan? It can feel overwhelming.Eric Butow, CEO of online marketing ROI improvement firm Butow Communications Group, has teamed up with Entrepreneur Media to update the second edition of our best-selling book Write Your Business Plan to provide you with a simple, step-by-step process for creating a successful business plan. In the following excerpt, he gives ten tips to gather all of the critical information you will need to succeed.1. Know your competition.You need to name them and point out what makes you different from (and better than) each of them. But do not disparage your competition.



2. Know your audience.You may need several versions of your business plan. For example, you may need one for bankers or venture capitalists, one for individual investors, and one for companies that may want to do a joint venture with you rather than fund you.3. Have proof to back up every claim you make.If you expect to be the leader in your field in six months, you have to say why you think that is. If you say your product will take the market by storm, you have to support this statement with facts. If you say your management team is fully qualified to make the business a success, be sure staff resumes demonstrate their experience.

Be conservative in all financial estimates and projections.If you feel certain you'll capture 50 percent of the market in the first year, you can say why you think so and hint at what those numbers may be. But make your financial projections more conservative. For example, a 10 percent market share is much more credible.5. Be realistic with time and resources available.If you're working with a big company before you buy a business, you may think things will happen faster than they will once you have to buy the supplies, write the checks, and answer the phones yourself. Being overly optimistic with time and resources is a common error entrepreneurs make. Being realistic is important because it lends credibility to your presentation. Always assume things will take 20 percent longer than you anticipated. Therefore, twenty weeks is now twenty-four weeks.


6. Be logical.Think like a banker and write what they would want to see.7. Have a strong management team.Make sure it has good credentials and expertise. Your team members don't have to have worked in the field. However, you need to draw parallels between what they've done and the skills needed to make your venture succeed. Don't have all the skills you need? Consider adding an advisory board of people skilled in your field and include their resumes.Write Your Own Business Plan is available now at Entrepreneur Bookstore | Barnes & Noble | Amazon8. Document why your idea will work.Have others done something similar that was successful? Have you made a prototype? Include all the variables that can have an impact on the result or outcome of your idea. Show why some of the variables don't apply to your situation or explain how you intend to overcome them or make them better.


9. Describe your facilities and location for performing the work.That includes equipment you use to create your products and/or services. If you'll need to expand, discuss when, where, and why.10. Discuss payout options for the investors.Some investors want a hands-on role. Some want to put associates on your board of directors. Some don't want to be involved in day-to-day activities at all. All investors want to know when they can get their money back and at what rate of return. Most want out within three to five years. Provide a brief description of options for investors, or at least mention that you're ready to discuss options with any serious prospect.To dig deeper, buy Write Your Own Business Plan and get 1 month of free access to business planning software Liveplan Premium.

99,Why Empathy is Crucial to Your Success in the Business World,"Aug 29, 2023",Ryan McGrath,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-empathy-is-crucial-to-your-success-in-the-business-world/456460,"
Empathy is the transformative force in business and life that allows leaders and managers to empower those around them. Beyond numbers and profits, understanding and connecting with others on an emotional level is a hallmark of exceptional leadership. This article delves into the power of empathy in the business arena — spotlighting its impact on leaders, teams and the legacy we all leave behind.The essence of empathy in leadershipEmpathy in leadership goes beyond just a soft skill; it's a strategic imperative. As a manager, your interactions shape the team's culture and morale. By understanding your employees' feelings, needs, and perspectives, you forge connections that are the bedrock of trust and collaboration.Empathy is the cornerstone of a positive work environment. When leaders genuinely care about their team members' well-being, it creates a culture of camaraderie. Employees feel valued and appreciated, resulting in increased job satisfaction, higher morale and reduced turnover. By acknowledging individual strengths and challenges, leaders can tailor their approach, empowering employees to thrive and contribute their best.

Leaders who listen actively and understand their team's concerns can communicate clearly and tactfully. When conflicts arise, an empathetic approach promotes open dialogue, allowing conflict to be resolved constructively. This prevents issues from festering and maintains a harmonious work atmosphere.


Related: 8 Great Tricks for Reading People's Body LanguageEmpathy and employee engagementEmployee engagement is vital for productivity and innovation. Empathetic leaders foster engagement by recognizing employees as whole individuals with specific aspirations and needs. This recognition boosts motivation and encourages employees to invest their energy and creativity in their roles. Engaged teams are likelier to go the extra mile, driving overall performance and organizational success.Building trust and loyaltyTrust is the currency of effective leadership. Empathy is the linchpin of trust-building, demonstrating that leaders genuinely care about their team's success and well-being. Employees who perceive their leaders as empathetic are likelier to be loyal and dedicated. This loyalty translates to increased effort, reduced absenteeism, and a willingness to weather challenges together.Related: Why Do Your Customers Really Buy from You?


Empathy in decision-makingEmpathy informs strategic decision-making. Leaders who understand the impact of their decisions on employees consider not only the bottom line but also the human aspect. This leads to conclusions that balance short-term gains with long-term sustainability. By incorporating empathy, leaders build a culture where decisions are ethical, considerate, and aligned with the organization's values.Empathy's ripple effectEmpathy is contagious. When leaders embody compassion, their teams often emulate this behavior. This ripple effect extends to customer and client interactions, creating authentic connections that enhance customer loyalty and satisfaction. A company culture rooted in empathy can differentiate the organization in a competitive marketplace.Related: Why Empathetic Leadership Is More Important Than EverStrategies for strengthening empathyDeveloping empathy requires active effort. We can start by actively listening to others without judgment, acknowledging their emotions, and trying to understand their perspective. We cultivate a culture where people feel seen, heard, and valued.


Active listening: When someone speaks, truly listen without interrupting. Let their words unfold without immediately forming your response. This allows you to absorb the depth of what they're sharing. Show you're engaged through non-verbal cues like nodding or maintaining eye contact, indicating that you value their perspective and emotions.Walk in their shoes: Take a moment to imagine what it's like to be in their situation. Consider the challenges they might be facing and the emotions they're likely experiencing. This mental exercise helps you better understand their point of view and fosters a deeper connection.Open-ended questions: Encourage them to share more by asking open-ended questions. Instead of yes-or-no inquiries, ask questions that require thoughtful responses. This invites them to express themselves fully, helping you gain insights into their feelings and thoughts that you might not have uncovered otherwise.Set aside biases: Recognize your biases and preconceptions and consciously set them aside during the conversation. Approach the interaction with an open mind, allowing their emotions and perspective to take center stage. By letting go of judgments, you create a safe space for them to express themselves authentically.Engage in service: Engaging in acts of kindness or volunteering exposes you to diverse experiences and backgrounds. This exposure broadens your understanding of the challenges people face and the emotions they navigate. Being part of a more significant community effort allows you to connect with individuals whose stories may differ from yours.Empathy emerges as a fundamental trait that elevates leaders beyond managerial roles. As a leader, nurturing compassion creates a positive work environment, boosts engagement, fosters effective communication, and builds trust. It's a catalyst that transforms workplaces into thriving ecosystems where individuals feel valued and empowered. By recognizing the transformative power of empathy, leaders shape organizations that achieve financial success and leave a lasting, positive impact on their employees and the world at large.

100,Your Favorite Hobby Should Not Always Turn Into Your Business. Use These 3 Tips to Find Your Next Idea Instead.,"Aug 25, 2023",David Busker,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/why-your-favorite-hobby-shouldnt-be-your-next-business-idea/456986,"
If you're interested in franchise or business ownership and you're in the beginning stages of researching what kind of business matches your entrepreneurial goals, the options available can be overwhelming. After all, 20% of new businesses fail in the first two years of being open, 45% during the first five years and 65% during the first 10 years, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, franchises exist in nearly every service industry, and there are more than 3,000 registered franchise brands across the United States.Because franchise and business ownership can run the gamut in terms of products and services sold, it isn't uncommon for candidates to consider hobbies that already interest them when producing ideas for a future company. However, it's important to understand that sometimes, hobbies and businesses don't mix well.For example, let's consider a hypothetical business owner candidate. Let's call him ""Phil."" One of Phil's favorite pastimes is to hit the green for a round of golf. Since golf is already a longstanding interest, Phil is inclined to consider a franchise that sells a variety of golfing products: clubs, balls, tees, clothing, etc. However, before long, Phil's working hours are consumed with all things golf, and his work days are filled with balance sheets, sales reports and expenses for golf products. Suddenly, escaping to play a few holes on the weekend isn't the break away from work it once was.



When a favorite hobby becomes synonymous with work, you find yourself in a lose-lose situation. To avoid this overlap, examine the following three tips below for considering possible options.Related: Mark Cuban Says ""Follow Your Passion"" Is the Worst Career Advice You Can Get. Here's Why.


1. Separate your personal hobbies from your businessRarely can a person spend their leisure time and work time focused on the same thing. It's basic Business 101 to diversify your investments, and a business is a large investment of your time, energy and money — so why would you keep all your eggs in one basket? Best practice: Separate your personal hobbies from your business.Like Phil, you probably have a hobby or interest that helps you unwind after a long week. However, for a business to maintain longevity, sustainability is the name of the game. So take a moment to consider your hobbies, and rather than focusing on the hobby itself, take a look at the services that support that hobby.If we take our friend Phil, rather than a golf store, maybe he selects a franchise of dry cleaning stores, hair salons or group fitness studios that service a community with fellow golf lovers. Another option might be a B2B franchise in which Phil doesn't perform the services himself but is client-facing and responsible for relationship-building by taking prospective clients out to the green for an afternoon. Either of these options supports his entrepreneurial goals while maintaining his favorite pastime.2. Be passionate about owning your business, not passionate about the widgetBeing a business owner means having more control over your life in so many ways. The top motivators for an individual to become a business owner are autonomy, more flexibility, more purpose/meaning and financial security.


These benefits of business ownership and their ability to support yourself, your family or other financial and non-financial obligations outweigh the appeal of selling a specific product or service.Building on the previous tip, a way to avoid misalignment between the product or service you are selling and the overall vision of the business is to focus on bird's eye metrics of success. For example, owning a chain of cleaning stores might not be your dinner party small talk highlight that ""golfing"" might be, but who's hosting the dinner?Prioritize long-term goals over what sounds cool to sell — a.k.a. be passionate about owning a business and all the benefits that come from that, rather than being passionate about a specific widget you sell.Related: Why You Should Stop Trying to 'Find Your Passion'


3. Your business should match a lasting marketA common misconception about franchises in particular is that they are all centered around the fast-food industry. This makes sense: Everyone eats multiple times per day, hence a stable and recurring consumer base. However, any company that can benefit from proper branding, repeatable processes and continuing product or service evolvement is a candidate to be franchised. While it's true that there are a number of successful restaurant-style franchises, there are so many other options that fall into the ""service-based"" franchise bucket.In today's business world, particularly with a younger generation of consumers, experiences are valued over material items. To support these experiences, a number of non-flashy but necessary service industry tasks are essential. What is a service that you use on a recurring basis that is not centered around food? Clean clothes perhaps? Monthly haircuts? Consistent trips to the gym? Phil would agree.If there is a recurring customer need, then there is likely a franchise that is seeking to capitalize on that customer need.At the end of the day, hobbies are a great place to start for brainstorming purposes, but think outside the box and ask yourself: What tangential services support your hobby or other hobbies that are similar in nature? Before long, you'll have a list of services, and, to bury the lead, I guarantee there will be multiple franchises for you to consider associated with those services.


So remember these three key takeaways when considering business ownership: First, hobbies and business are best kept separate. Second, owning a successful business is the goal (not selling a specific product/service). Third, set yourself up for success by selecting a business that has a strong base of perpetually recurring customers.

The following is an excerpt from Grow Your Business: Scaling Your Business for Long-Term Success by the staff of Entrepreneur Media and Eric Butow, on sale now.Are you running a business or startup that has made it through the past couple of tumultuous years? Congrats! Pat yourself on the back and take your team out to a celebratory lunch. You've all earned it. Your product is selling and your team is in place, so you don't have to do all the work yourself. So what should you do next?The first step is to adopt a growth mindset. Without a focus on growth, you'll likely find yourself trapped in the daily challenges of running your business and miss out on opportunities to achieve new levels of success. Here's how to unlock a ""bigger and better"" mentality.



What is a growth mindset?Stanford University psychology professor Carol Dweck, author of Mindset: The New Psychology of Success (Ballantine Books, 2007), who coined the term, defines a growth mindset as ""the belief that an individual's most basic abilities and skills can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point."" In contrast to a growth mindset, Dweck said, a fixed mindset is ""the belief that an individual's basic abilities and skills, their intelligence and their talents, are just fixed traits."" Dweck concluded that people who believe they can develop their talents through a combination of hard work, good strategies, and input from others have a growth mindset. She noted that people with a growth mindset are likely to achieve more than people with a fixed mindset because they put more energy into learning and aren't as concerned about appearing smart to others.Grow Your Business: Scaling Your Business for Long-Term Success is available now at Entrepreneur Bookstore | Amazon | Barnes and Noble


How to Create a Growth MindsetHow do you know what mindset you have? If you believe that intelligence is innate to a person's nature and can't be changed, you have a fixed mindset. But recognizing this is the first step toward building a growth mindset. A growth mindset requires that you accept and celebrate failure as part of learning and growth—not as a sign that someone isn't intelligent. Once you understand that intelligence and skill develop with time and experience, you can give your team permission to experiment (and maybe stop being so hard on yourself). To consciously adopt a growth mindset, you must do some personal soul-searching and make the following changes:Acknowledge Your WeaknessesWhen you stay in your comfort zone and make excuses for unacceptable results, you won't grow personally or professionally. If you give yourself a reason to get beyond your fixed mindset, such as learning a difficult new skill, it's easier to set an overall goal and specific milestones, such as passing a product certification exam. See Challenges as Opportunities If you see challenges as an opportunity to grow and learn, you won't be afraid to push yourself outside your comfort zone. Even if you fail, the experience can show you to look for a different path to take. Exploring different ways to do things for yourself and for your business can lead to new opportunities—and prove to be more lucrative. 


Learn to Accept FailureYou can't explore your options without learning to accept failure. Sometimes things just don't turn out the way we hope they will, and it's only after some time has passed that hindsight will show us how the failure has affected us, for good or ill. For example, you may have wanted to partner with a big company and kicked yourself after it fell through. But six months later, you learned that the company just went bankrupt, which would have threatened your company's survival. So in the long run, that failure turned out for the best! Don't Seek Approval People with a fixed mindset worry about what other people think about their intelligence and talent. This is especially true for those in a position of authority, who want to appear infallible to people who rank lower in the hierarchy. But people with a growth mindset don't worry about whether they're the smartest person in the room. Indeed, one maxim of leadership is to hire people who are smarter than you and let them work. Then you can focus on your own learning and growth.Grow Your Business: Scaling Your Business for Long-Term Success is available now at Entrepreneur Bookstore | Amazon | Barnes and NobleAccept and Use CriticismPeople with a fixed mindset are easily offended by criticism, but when you have a growth mindset, you don't see criticism as negative. Instead, you see it as an opportunity to learn and improve your product. Businesspeople with a growth mindset encourage feedback, ratings, and reviews from customers and employees alike. But how does that happen with performance reviews, which are dreaded by so many employees and managers because the judgments seem so final? Managers with growth mindsets don't have formal performance reviews at a given time. Instead, managers provide specific feedback in the moment, even if it's bad news. Ongoing and timely feedback encourages employees to double down on good behavior and blunts the shock of any bad news, and that makes your employees more likely to want to do better. If you still want to have a review, you can put it at the end of the year and talk about positive things like setting goals and growth targets for the upcoming year.Related: Want to Sell More Products, Get More Customers and Make More Money? Ask Yourself These 4 Questions.


Focus on the ProcessWhen you have a growth mindset, you're more interested in the process of achieving a result than in the result itself. When you enjoy the learning process, you'll focus on improving it, and the result will take care of itself. You may also find that you get an even better result than the one you originally hoped for.Create a Reflection RoutineIf you don't take the time to reflect about what went well and what didn't, you won't understand the underlying cause of any problems you're having. This is especially important when it comes to reviewing your own actions. Carve out some time at the end of each day to ask yourself what went well, what didn't, and what actions you need to take the next day.For more growth strategies, pickup Grow Your Business: Scaling Your Business available now at Entrepreneur Bookstore | Amazon | Barnes and Noble

102,4 Steps to Moving Beyond the 'Lightbulb Moment' and Turning Your Idea into a Thriving Business,"Aug 17, 2023",Lissele Pratt,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-steps-to-turn-your-idea-into-a-thriving-business/456688,"
Idea evaluation is challenging. In fact, according to existing literature, only 6% of all ""official"" ideas and merely 14% of promising ideas that progress to a development phase manage to achieve commercial success. This stat underscores the arduous task of transforming an idea into a thriving business, emphasizing that the road to success extends well beyond the initial spark of inspiration.Speaking of that spark, many of us have experienced a surge of excitement and boundless possibility when an extraordinary concept takes hold of our imagination.For me, that transformative lightbulb moment arrived during my time as a junior FX broker in the fast-paced world of finance. Immersed in the industry, I couldn't ignore the glaring gap in the market — an underserved space that left many high-risk industries struggling to access vital financial services.



Motivated to bridge this gap, I took a leap of faith and launched Capitalixe. Now, four years later, we stand as a seven-figure fintech consultancy, a testament to the potential of transforming an idea into a thriving business.So how can you embark on this journey and transform your lightbulb moment into a venture that leaves a lasting impact? Here are some key strategies to transform your brilliant idea into startup success.


Related: 3 Tips on How to Translate Your Ideas Into a BusinessStep 1: Deep dive into your ideaTo turn that idea into a successful business, you need to really dive into it and bring out its full potential. Take the time to understand your concept inside out and figure out what makes it unique. What sets it apart from the competition? How does it solve a problem or meet a need?Reflect on your idea and ask yourself critical questions. Identify your unique value proposition and what makes it stand out. Understand how it addresses a specific problem or fulfills a need better than existing solutions. By gaining clarity on your idea's distinctiveness, you'll have a solid foundation for success.Conduct thorough market research to validate the demand and viability of your idea. Explore your target market, analyze competitors and identify gaps or underserved areas. Understand the market dynamics, trends and customer preferences. This research will help you refine and align your idea with market realities.


Get to know your target audience intimately. Dive into their world and understand their pain points, aspirations and desires. Identify their needs and challenges and how your idea can provide a solution. By empathizing with your audience, you can effectively tailor your idea to resonate with them.Step 2: Craft a bold and calculated planNow that your idea has been nurtured and validated, it's time to unleash the power of a well-crafted strategic plan. This is where the rubber meets the road and your idea transforms into a tangible roadmap for success.Start by defining your vision and mission with unapologetic clarity. Let them serve as the guiding light that propels your business forward and inspires your team. Next, set SMART goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound. Break them down into milestones that keep you focused and motivated.With your vision and goals in place, it's time to create a comprehensive business plan. Outline your product or service offering, analyze your target market and competition, develop effective marketing and sales strategies and map out financial projections and operational processes. This plan will provide direction and attract potential investors and partners.


Related: How To Create A High-Performing Strategic PlanStep 3: Nurture an unstoppable innovative mindsetWhen turning that idea into a business, it's essential to cultivate an innovative mindset that fuels creativity and propels you beyond conventional boundaries.First and foremost, redefine your relationship with failure. Embrace it as an invaluable teacher on your entrepreneurial path. Instead of letting setbacks dampen your spirits, view them as stepping stones to growth. Analyze what went wrong, learn from your mistakes and use that knowledge to bounce back stronger than ever.Create a culture where experimentation is not only tolerated but celebrated. Encourage your team to push the boundaries, take calculated risks and embrace the unknown. Provide them with the freedom to explore new ideas and approaches. And when those experiments yield insights, create platforms for sharing the lessons learned, so everyone can benefit from the collective wisdom.


Step 4: Forge unbreakable connectionsIn the business world, your network can be the key to your success.Start by immersing yourself in industry events and conferences. Rub shoulders with fellow professionals who share your passions and aspirations. Engage in meaningful conversations, exchange ideas and be open to collaborations that can take your business to new heights. Don't underestimate the power of face-to-face connections.But don't stop there — tap into the thriving entrepreneurial communities online and offline. Surround yourself with like-minded individuals who understand the rollercoaster of building a startup. Seek communities offering resources, mentorship and a safe space to share triumphs and setbacks. Together, you can navigate the challenges and celebrate the wins.Now, let's talk about mentors — the wise souls who have walked the path before you. Seek experienced mentors who can provide invaluable guidance and share their wisdom. Look for individuals who have deep expertise in your industry or have successfully navigated similar entrepreneurial journeys. Their insights can be the compass that guides you through uncharted territory.


Related: Build the Network Necessary for Your Startup to SucceedEmbrace the journey and shine brightTurning your idea into a thriving business is no easy feat, but don't let that discourage you. The path to success is paved with determination, resilience and unwavering belief in your vision. Embrace the journey with open arms, knowing that each step forward brings you closer to your goals.Remember, your customers or clients are at the heart of your business. Listen to their needs, exceed their expectations and build relationships beyond transactions. Your dedication to providing value and solving their problems will set you apart in a crowded market.When the challenges seem insurmountable in those moments of doubt, hold on to that initial spark of inspiration — the lightbulb moment that set you on this entrepreneurial path.

The following is an excerpt from Grow Your Business: Scaling Your Business for Long-Term Success by the staff of Entrepreneur Media and Eric Butow, on sale now.To grow your company, you need a plan that establishes how you will grow and why your ideal customers should buy from you. Then you need to invest in the people and tools that can turn your plans into reality. If possible, distill your growth plan into a one-page document that will help you focus on the essentials and be easy for your team to digest. Growth plans are different for each business, and you can implement different strategies depending on what type of business you have. But regardless, you need to keep your team thinking in terms of growth. Once you establish a growth mindset in your employees, you and your team can continuously look for new opportunities for growth.What a Growth Plan Is . . . and Isn'tA growth plan may be hard to wrap your head around when you're getting started in your business. Before you offer your product and/or service to the world, you need to focus on establishing a value proposition for potential customers and find out where your ideal customers are. Once you do, you can measure your progress as you sell your product and/or service. Those measurements will help you identify new revenue streams and let you compare yourself to the competition. That comparison will tell where your strengths are so you can focus on them. And when you have a clear idea of what you do and who your customers are, you can use that information to attract talented employees. Establish a Value Proposition Before you can grow, you need to think about what sets you apart from the competition. For example, some companies compete on authority. Whole Foods Market touts itself as the place to buy healthy and organic foods. Walmart asserts that it's the low-price leader and no one can beat its prices. Whatever competitive advantage you find, stick with it. If you don't, you run the risk of devaluing your business because customers won't know what you stand for.

Pinpoint Your Ideal CustomerYou started a business so you could solve a problem for a specific audience. During the startup stage, you may have identified numerous markets you thought you might be able to serve before narrowing it down to your specific niche market. Now you need to hone your target market even further until you've winnowed it down to your ideal customer. Once you know who they are, you can address them consistently in your market or submarket as you grow.


Related: How to Leverage Virtual Sales Events to Grow Your Business2. Define Key IndicatorsYou won't be able to measure growth if you can't measure change. Start by identifying key performance indicators (KPIs), which are quantifiable measurements of a company's performance in specific areas over time. (Examples of commonly tracked KPIs include net profit, liquidity ratio, customer satisfaction, and customer retention.) Then dedicate time and money to improving those indicators.  3. Verify Your Revenue StreamsDon't just think about your current revenue streams—think about new revenue streams that could make your business more profitable. Once you've started identifying possible new revenue streams, get in the habit of asking yourself (and your team) if every cool new idea you and they come up with has a revenue stream attached. If it does, ask if that stream is sustainable over the long run.Related: 5 Reasons Why Your Brand Needs a Chief Growth Officer4. Research Your CompetitionIf your company is struggling with something, you likely have a competitor that excels at it. Don't just put your head down and try to surmount a challenge yourself. Look at similar growth businesses to inform your strategies and solutions. If you belong to an industry trade group or a networking organization (and you should), don't be afraid to ask for advice. Why have similar businesses made different choices? Do your competitors' growth choices mean that their businesses are positioned differently?

Focus on Your StrengthsTailoring your growth plan to focus on and maximize your strengths can help you identify strategies for success. That doesn't mean you should ignore your weaknesses, but starting from a position of strength will give your company the fuel it needs to grow.6. Invest in TalentYour employees have direct or indirect contact with your customers, so you should hire people who are motivated by your company's value proposition and your plans for growth. Pay and treat your employees well because their positive energy will inspire your customers.

104,Why I Ran 48 Miles in 48 Hours to Improve My Business,"Aug 3, 2023",Nicole Bernard,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-i-ran-48-miles-in-48-hours-to-improve-my-business/456111,"
I rolled my eyes so hard that I swear I could hear my mom say, ""They're going to get stuck like that,"" the first time a friend suggested running the 4x4x48 Goggins Challenge back in March of 2022. Why on Earth would I want to run 4 miles every 4 hours for almost 48 hours, equaling a total of 48 miles?""Yes, I'm a runner, but I'm not that kind of runner,"" I thought.But I couldn't shake the feeling deep down. Something in my soul stirred, and as the start date drew closer, I knew I was going to do it (kind of reminds me of the feeling I had when I started my business all those years ago). There would be multiple runs at midnight and 4 a.m. and a boatload of other runs for almost two days straight. It seemed impossible and wild (again, entrepreneurship vibes).



If you're not familiar with David Goggins, you should be. He is a testament to what a human being can truly endure and overcome. His military career is beyond impressive (he is the only person to date who has gone through the Navy Seals' infamous Hell Week three times), as is his daily fight to start from zero and crush his goals.You might not think there are similarities between running a 48-hour running challenge and being an entrepreneur, but there are many!Here are a few that stuck out to me:MindsetSuch an overused term, I know, but in this case, it was true. Like entrepreneurship, it was fun, exciting and kind of easy initially… but things got real fast. When you have to wake up and go run 4 miles at midnight and 4 AM two days in a row, you start to wonder why you started this ridiculous journey.Sound familiar? When business dips, or clients ghost you on your invoices, you start to wonder why you're doing this. Can I go on? Should I go on? Is it worth it? A job with a consistent paycheck (not to mention benefits) sounds just as nice as my warm bed in the middle of the night.But then, you get through it (the runs and the hard times) and realize you're on this journey for a reason!Related: How Spending Time Alone Has Transformed My LifePlanningGood gravy, this challenge had way more planning than I anticipated, much like running a small business!For the challenge, I had to plan out my food (which was honestly one of my favorite parts because I love to eat), find a gym membership in my small town with 24/7 access (I didn't want to run outside in the middle of the night), multiple changes of clothes, a playlist of music and podcasts, schedule around family activities (because it was two days and we still had stuff to do) and the hardest one: how to sleep after running in the middle of the night (you have to figure out to run fast enough to get the torture over with, but also not get your heart rate so high that you would be up all night)!In business, we plan for everything. What is our marketing strategy? How do we balance (another annoying buzzword that I hate but can't find another equivalent) family and business? What are our financial systems? What is our onboarding process? How and when do we bring on an employee, and what does that look like?


This challenge helped me break up planning into compartments, and I could take this same approach to planning in my business. I am a pen-and-paper, write-out-a-to-do list kind of girl, but I realized I could use this experience and create a flowchart in business as I did with the challenge.Related: 10 Growth Strategies Every Business Owner Should KnowGratitudeWhen I finished my last run, I broke down and ugly cried. I don't cry, ask anyone that knows me well, but there were so many emotions. One of the biggest emotions was how grateful I was to finish and that I was even able to do something like this. Sure, the exhaustion might have contributed, but the feeling in my gut was life-changing, and I haven't been the same person or business owner since.We can do hard things, and I was so grateful that I could experience something incredibly hard and realize that I can do so much more than I thought I could. We all can!


I have since learned how to look at hard times, hard clients, hard people, hard anything with gratitude (trust me, not every time) and realize that it will help me somehow. I don't always know how during that time, but usually, I can look back and be grateful for the experience. Gaining that perspective (even most of the time) has helped enormously in both business and life.I would like to encourage (challenge) you to try something hard, whatever that looks like for you.By the way, I have run this challenge two more times since the first time and have a goal to do it multiple times a year because it really brings me back to a mental state that I love and crave now!

105,Former Uber Exec's Tips to Entrepreneurs on Surviving a Bear Market,"Jul 21, 2023",Brad Klune,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/former-uber-execs-tips-for-surviving-a-bear-market/456011,"
Battling a bear market can feel like shouting into a heavy gust of wind for business owners. But Emil Michael, former Chief Business Officer of Uber, says there are ways to navigate a poor macro environment to survive and even thrive. If you are a founder, his advice for cost-cutting, team-building, innovation, and time management is invaluable.If you want personalized help, you can book one-on-one time with Emil on Intro. Click here to schedule a call.1. Expectation resets""The hardest thing to do is to cut your costs now — not for survival today, but for survival tomorrow. Leaders have to reset their expectations on everything and bring their team along,"" advises Michael. ""This includes timing it to an IPO, hitting previously set revenue milestones...everything. You have to let go of the past.""



Cost-cutting may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the goal isn't about mere survival. It's about creating a leaner, more adaptable organization that can weather the storm and pivot to the top when the conditions become more favorable.Related: Book a one-on-one mentor meeting with Andrew Chen, General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz


2. Strategic prioritization of target customersThe key is to conduct rigorous analyses on where you should focus. ""For example, if we need to achieve $50 million in revenue in three years, should we pursue 100 potential customers or focus on 20?"" asks Michael. Such questions must be asked, analyzed, and acted upon with the involvement of all department heads and executives.3. Assume no fundingFounders should proceed under the assumption that raising additional funds in the next 18 months will be near impossible unless they already have a clear product-market fit, advises Michael. It necessitates that companies have a runway of 24 to 30 months of capital left, ensuring they can weather the storm.He suggests cutting more than you want to, which often means ""cutting into bone."" Once some stability returns, you can rebuild almost anything you have cut during a bear market.His remarks underline the importance of balance: trimming fat to survive the downturn, but preserving the core strength and structure of the organization to bounce back when circumstances improve.


4. Promote from within""You should find the hidden talent in your existing young leaders versus getting the 'name brand' outside talent who are set in their ways of doing things,"" says Michael.On the culture front, a seasoned exec from Amazon might be so disconnected from the fight for product-market fit, that the cultural difference could prove detrimental. Leadership must build a culture that places product-market fit at its core; encouraging innovation, adaptation, and tenacity in the face of adversity.It's a moment for the current team members to step up, take on more responsibility, and accelerate their personal and professional growth.Related: Book a one-on-one mentor meeting with Sophia Amoruso, founder of Nasty Gal


5. Your calendar should look differentReflecting on the pre-pandemic era, Michael emphasized that a CEO's calendar might reflect courting investors for funding rounds that aren't in the near future or attending industry conferences. Now, he believes founders should be the ""problem solver-in-chief"", laser-focused on overcoming immediate challenges.Time allocation for meetings should be reduced (can a 60-minute meeting be done in 45 minutes? Can a 30-minute phone call be a 15-minute chat?), making room for more efficient decision-making and problem-solving. ""Don't give me the preamble; give me the problems and the proposed solutions"" should be the mantra in this new reality Michael says. Decisions need to be made faster, with preparation done ahead of meetings to maximize efficiency.6. Constraints breed creativityEmil Michael argues one must harness the power of a timeless human truth: constraints can, paradoxically, breed creativity. This becomes particularly relevant in difficult times. By empowering less experienced team members with more scope and responsibility, you unlock the potential of some of the most creative minds in the room.""The heart of these tech companies are younger folks,"" Michael explains, emphasizing that their energy, ambition, and innovative spirit can be instrumental in defining the company's trajectory. With the right balance between focusing on the existing product line and carving out space for new ones, companies can ""live to fight another day.""


It's a delicate balancing act— if competitors over-invest in the future without paying attention to the present, they might falter before reaching the intended destination. Hence, nurturing creativity within constraints can ensure a company's survival and, ultimately, lead to a thriving future.7. Be honest with yourself""Entrepreneurs should really ask, 'Do I really, really have product-market fit?'"" offers Michael.A viable product is one that people are willing to pay for, directly or indirectly, and which can generate a profit within a reasonable timeframe. It should also possess the growth characteristics of a high-growth company if it is venture-backed.If you don't, your focus should be squarely on achieving it.


Balance now to thrive laterEmil Michael's career and investing journey provides a compelling playbook for dealing with bear markets. At its heart, it's about balancing survival today with success tomorrow. This delicate dance, mastered by few, can be the difference between companies that are merely surviving, from those truly thriving.For a deeper dive or personalized advice, grab time with Emil Michael by booking a one-on-one mentor call on Intro.

106,Your Guide to Gaining a Competitive Edge and Succeeding as an Entrepreneur Over the Next 5 Years,"Jul 21, 2023",Adam Povlitz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/your-guide-to-gaining-a-competitive-edge-and-succeeding-as/454817,"
As an entrepreneur, you must stay ahead and anticipate the future. To do this, you must refine your current skills and understand successful business practices while sharpening the most important skills you should master in the next five years.From recognizing potential opportunities to adapting quickly to change and maximizing resources for growth, you'll be better equipped to take your business further than you ever imagined.Identifying opportunitiesIdentifying potential business opportunities is critical for entrepreneurs looking to take their businesses to the next level in the coming years. Move ahead of the curve and capitalize on emerging opportunities by analyzing market trends, conducting market research to understand your customer base and leveraging data to uncover valuable insights into developing trends.



Recognizing potential business opportunities is about realizing what's happening in your industry and beyond. Identifying current trends can help you spot new markets or understand customer pain points that must be addressed with your product or service. Market research is a key factor, as it provides a deeper appreciation of customer needs and preferences, allowing you to create a better product or service that solves their problems.Develop an understanding of the competitive landscape. This is crucial to identifying potential business opportunities. Analyzing your competitors' strategies helps you find ways to differentiate your product or service from theirs and gain an edge over them. Additionally, staying current on the latest technology trends provides insight into using technology for innovation and identifying new business opportunities.


Utilizing data analytics tools is an entrepreneurial necessity for uncovering valuable information hidden in data sets. Data analytics give you a better grasp of customer behavior, allowing you to make more informed decisions about how best to serve them. With these combined strategies, you're better equipped to identify potential business opportunities in the next five years and maximize your growth potential going forward.Related: The Entrepreneur's Guide to Crafting a Successful FutureDeveloping clear strategiesPlanning and strategizing enable you to identify opportunities, make informed decisions and maximize your growth potential. Here are some key points for developing effective strategies:Analyze the current market and trends: By monitoring the market trends and competitor strategies, you can spot any potential opportunities to capitalize on. You should also consider up-and-coming technologies that could disrupt your industry to stay on top of the latest trends.Set goals and objectives: Goal setting is a natural process of business. But here's some advice: set realistic goals that are reachable within a specific timeline. Stay focused on achieving goals, and don't get distracted by other tasks or projects. Be SMART (specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, time-phased) when setting goals. This process will ensure you have a plan of action that can be easily tracked and monitored.Create a timeline: Planning out each task into specific steps with deadlines helps you focus on completing each step efficiently to reach your goal in time. This also keeps you accountable as you work toward achieving goals over time instead of getting overwhelmed by tackling everything at once.Develop an implementation plan: Once the timeline is set, create an implementation plan detailing each step in the process and any resources or risks involved. This detailed plan will help minimize surprises along the way, which can lead to delays or unnecessary costs.Monitor progress: Regularly monitoring progress allows you to make necessary course corrections quickly to stay on track toward completing your goal within the desired timeframe. It also helps detect areas where additional resources may be needed, such as hiring new staff or investing in technology solutions.Creating connections and building relationshipsThe secret sauce to successful entrepreneurialism is connections and relationships. Establishing meaningful connections not only enables you to gain access to resources but also allows you to learn from others. Furthermore, creating solid relationships can open potential opportunities for growth and success.


To create meaningful connections, do your homework. Research potential contacts through networking websites like LinkedIn or attend local events and conferences related to your industry. You must also use these opportunities to build relationships — engage in conversation and remain genuine and authentic.When building relationships, find ways of adding value to the connection. For example, providing helpful advice or referring someone else who may benefit from the connection is an excellent way of strengthening a relationship and fostering mutual trust. Additionally, it's important to stay in touch even after the initial meeting — follow-up emails or friendly conversations over coffee can keep relationships alive and demonstrate initiative.Now that you've established a network, you must nurture it. Stay in touch with contacts regularly and help each other out where possible. For these relationships to be beneficial in the long run, both parties must be mutually invested in each other's success — this will ensure that both sides get something out of the relationship and foster a sense of trust.Related: 5 Ways to Organize a New Business to Take Advantage of the Future of Work


Adapting to change quickly and effectivelyEntrepreneurs must adjust quickly and effectively to market changes in the ever-evolving business world. First, recognize the catalysts for transformation in your industry and evaluate how these modifications will influence their operations. Designing flexible tactics and processes to handle such shifts is vital for success.You must keep a positive attitude and be willing to explore novel approaches. Keep up with industry news and trends. This will provide useful insight into the movements of the business landscape and customer buying patterns.Successful entrepreneurs understand that adapting rapidly doesn't mean taking every chance without restraint; rather, it requires pivoting quickly without sacrificing quality or efficiency. They develop practices that enable them to make rapid choices based on real-time data points and customer feedback while staying within budgetary and timeline restrictions. You must do the same!Ultimately, remaining agile is imperative to succeed in a dynamic business world. By mastering essential skills — detecting drivers of change, formulating flexible strategies, maintaining an open mindset, tracking sector trends and news updates and gathering customer responses, you'll have all the necessary tools to take your company up a notch over the next five years.

107,The Sunk Cost Fallacy is Ruining Your Decisions. Here are 3 Life-Changing Lessons I've Learned From Pivoting,"Jul 17, 2023",Rodger Desai,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-career-changing-lessons-ive-learned-from-pivoting/454966,"
Imagine for a moment that you are on a hot air balloon anchored to the ground by a rope. As the hot air balloon pilot makes last-minute preparations a few yards away, you hear a SNAP and watch in terror as the balloon takes flight. With the ground disappearing below you, you have a difficult decision to make and need to make it fast. Do you cut your losses and jump off the hot air balloon now, resulting in a few broken bones, or do you stay ""safely"" entombed on the balloon as it soars higher and higher into the atmosphere?Although you may never have stepped foot on a hot air balloon, you have certainly experienced the phenomenon of sunk cost fallacy. Sunk cost fallacy is when you stick with a failed venture because you can't muster the humility to admit you made a mistake, the courage to chart a new course or the strength to start again.Sunk cost fallacy is not always a matter of life and death. It impacts small decisions (this baseball game is so boring, but the tickets were so pricey. Should I leave?) and big ones (I hate being a doctor. But medical school was so difficult. Should I change my career?). In the business context, sunk cost fallacy is something every entrepreneur must be on guard against, especially when deciding whether to pivot your company.



Related: Finding Success in Failure — 8 Lessons Learned from Failed VenturesYou don't need to hire an expensive consulting firm to know that pivoting, the act of shifting a company's strategy in a big way, is a huge risk. Even discussing it can feel dangerous. An unwise pivot can tank a business by confusing customers and scaring off investors. On the other hand, failing to pivot your company when appropriate will result in falling behind the competition and is equally dangerous.


Let's take the video rental chain Blockbuster, for instance. Although digitization was imminent, Blockbuster's leadership likely suffered to some extent from the sunk cost fallacy. Pivoting to a digital model where customers could order films from a website would mean recognizing that its previous investment in brick-and-mortar locations was a mistake. Blockbuster's failure to pivot to digital fast enough gave Netflix a critical in. Today, Netflix is valued at nearly $190 billion, and Blockbuster had gone out of business. Long story short: sunk cost fallacy can cause complacency in business leaders and destroy businesses as a result.From inflation and changing market appetites to Covid-19 and the AI renaissance, there are countless reasons why pivoting or shifting a company's focus may be critical. Determining whether or not it's time to pivot is one of the great responsibilities of any business leader.Throughout my career, I've started — and successfully pivoted — multiple companies in the past. It wasn't always easy, but I've learned several valuable lessons along the way. If the time is now for you to pivot your company, here is my advice:In the words of feminist scholar Gloria Steinem, ""The truth will set you free, but first, it will piss you off."" If you're considering pivoting your company, you had the painful realization that your company was headed in the wrong direction. Recognizing that your idea — that precious gem that inspired you to start the company in the first place — is not quite the diamond you hoped it would be can be devastating. Explaining to your friends, family and team that the business idea you pitched them all those years ago — the one they supported and invested their time in — needs an adjustment probably makes you want to bury your head in the sand. This is normal. If you didn't care, you wouldn't have gotten so far. My advice? Permit yourself to fully grieve your initial business case before you explain your pivot to the world.Join the broken heart club: Pivoting can be heartbreaking, but you're not alone. Wrigley's didn't always sell gum, Ninento used to sell vacuum cleaners, and YouTube was originally conceived as a video dating site. If you're pivoting your company, congratulations, you are now part of a group that includes some of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world.Remember, the best is yet to come: when we changed the company from Payfone to Prove, it was much more than a rebrand. The decision came from the need to update a legacy name after successfully pivoting from a mobile payment company with a much slimmer scope to one with an expanded focus on solving digital identity challenges for a much wider market. Today, our verification and authentication solutions are leveraged by leaders in banking, FinTech, merchants and other industries to accelerate onboarding, prevent fraud and boost revenue. If I didn't pivot, I would never have had the pleasure of working with so many great companies and the total addressable market (TAM) of Prove would be much smaller.Related: How to Know When to Give Up, When to Pivot and When to Persist


The ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus wrote, ""The only thing constant in life is change."" Nowhere is this more true than in business. Shifts in the market, changes in consumer behavior, breakthroughs in technology, and the emergence of new regulations require entrepreneurs to pivot frequently. Unfortunately, society often judges individuals and organizations that pivot, labeling them as erstwhile and short-sighted. As entrepreneurs, it's our job to ignore the critics and determine when to stay the course and when to pivot fast. Both choices have their risks. If you feel that pivoting your company is right, go for it.

108,10 Things I've Learned In 10 Years of Running My Own Business,"Jul 17, 2023",Stacey Burke,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/10-lessons-ive-learned-in-10-years-of-running-my-own/455133,"
In 2013, I made a life-changing decision. I decided to ""take a break"" from my dream job, which while amazing, was also fast-paced and demanding. I gained invaluable experience, opportunities, connections and more as a law firm partner, but my personal life suffered.I was fortunate to have had financial success that enabled a break, and this difficult decision catapulted me into becoming a full-time entrepreneur. While I miss some things about being a part of a law firm, I love setting the pace of my own life and that I still help others daily, just in a different way.Becoming a business owner has revolutionized my understanding of the realities of running a company. I now believe you cannot tell someone else how to run their business if you have never successfully run one yourself. In celebration of 10 years as a fully self-funded female business owner, here are ten things I've learned.

1. You can actually start your own business and be successful!I never intended to become an entrepreneur. However, after deciding to pause, I was asked to consult with lawyer friends who had previously been competitors. Unlike work, it sounded fun, and I could do it while ""on a break"" from law firm life. Ten years later, I manage a team of marketers and work with law firms across the country, helping my team members and my clients succeed.Related: 10 Tips for the First-Time Business Owner2. No matter how good you are at what you do, some people will still treat you like you aren'tYou might expect that after over two decades as a lawyer and achieving both legal industry accolades and marketing industry awards, those I talk to and work with would always treat me with respect. You'd be wrong. No matter how many years of schooling, degrees, years of experience and awards you have, some people will always try to make you feel small, treat you as if you do not matter and belittle your skills.Don't work with those people. Don't employ those people. Don't allow those people to impact your energy and success.Related: Are You a Business Owner or an Entrepreneur?3. You cannot control your clients, but you can only control how you respond to themMost marketing agencies do not refund client money after being paid. I used to feel the same way — I did the work, you paid me, and I deserved to be paid. Fear of having done a bad job, fear of not being able to afford to refund that money and fear of that client keep owners myopic. Success has allowed me the privilege to evolve.I had a client who was negative and abrasive and refused to collaborate. Even though we delivered everything they paid for, the firm was still unhappy. So, I fired them and refunded every cent of their money. While this made my business lose money, the financial price was worth it.4. You do not need a physical office to be a seven-figure companyI spent my legal career working in business attire in a professional setting in office buildings. Once the pandemic hit, the beautiful corner office on the top floor of a building in my neighborhood I had painstakingly searched for and decorated became a source of stress. Our team became remote, not really by choice, and we stayed that way. Now I pay no rent and reallocate those funds. I miss working collaboratively in person, but my team is thriving. We have been able to take on more clients than ever before, all without a physical office.


5. If a new hire is troubling you early on, they are likely not going to work outA successful business owner told me that I would know within two days of working with a new hire if they would work out. I scoffed at what sounded like a lack of care and a lack of willingness to try harder when onboarding.After ten years, two days still seems pretty quick, but it does not take long to know if a new hire is the wrong one. The longer you wait to deal with it, the worse things get for the new hire and the existing team. Cut your losses early, allowing that person to move on and you to start looking for the right fit.Related: How to Find, Hire (and Fire!) Rockstar Employees6. Narrowing services offered means increased expertiseAs a 21-year lawyer, legal marketing is my consulting focus. Because there are a lot of lawyers, and most law firms engage in marketing efforts, I have a decently sized national marketplace from which to obtain clients. One of my strongest selling points is that I have a niche business focused on one industry and am a licensed expert. Expanding into other industries I know less about and have no footprint in would dilute my biggest point of differentiation. Stay focused and grow within your niche.


7. Saying ""no"" leaves room to say ""yes"" to opportunities you don't know about yetIt is scary to say no to paid opportunities early in the life of your business but remember, each engagement is a partnership, and you should only partner when it can be mutually successful. Prevent doomed collaborations on the front end.Gauge compatibility by paying attention to how they speak to and email you, the ""story"" of how they came to be in their current position, and more. Every client you choose to work with can come at the expense of being able to take on another, better opportunity you might not know about yet.8. Being your own boss is addictingOver time, being my own boss has become a commodity worth significant value to me. I greatly enjoy not having to ask permission to spend a full weekend day uninterrupted with my children. The scary part of being the boss is being responsible for yourself, your team, your clients, and many others, but the benefits of determining how to handle those responsibilities are worth it.Related: 5 Essentials for Succeeding When You Become Your Own Boss


9. Set boundaries early and do not compromiseBoundaries are important in both our personal and professional lives. The legal industry cultivates a culture of constant availability and immediate response, which is stressful. Now, running my own business, I make conscious choices to shape our company culture differently.No one on my team is required to work outside of normal business hours. No one on my team has their work email on their mobile device. I no longer provide clients with my personal (and only) cell phone number. Establishing boundaries like these makes work healthier and more productive.10. If you can't pay yourself as an owner, you are not doing it rightA surprising number of business owners I consider successful cannot and do not pay themselves at all. Their businesses do not generate sufficient revenue to allow the owner to make an income. If you cannot pay yourself (after a reasonable startup time, of course), you are not succeeding. You should reevaluate your financial position, overall business plan, and whether or not owning a business is the right choice for you.

109,How to Grow Your Business — Even When You Have No Idea What You're Doing,"Jul 11, 2023",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-grow-your-business-when-you-have-no-idea-what-youre/454760,"
Starting a business, let alone growing one, is not for the faint of heart. It takes time, patience and a lot of humility. In 10 years of owning my own business, our growing pains have had their own growing pains, but at this point, I can safely say they have transformed into gains.I've learned the hard way that expansion is a necessary step in growth, but doing so in a manner that doesn't feel like two steps back for every one step forward has been the most challenging part for me. Growth should be an exciting process that couples a thoughtful approach with some creative bootstrapping and an unwavering ""go get 'em"" attitude.Sometimes growth proceeds only one slow step at a time, but that one step may be critical to the future of your business, so dedicate yourself to making each advancement as ""right"" as it can be, followed by another and then another. This will likely take some fine-tuning and adjusting. You couldn't learn the ropes of first grade until you'd mastered kindergarten (yes, as a mom of five, parenting analogies consistently make their way into my writing!), and the same philosophy applies to business.



Here's how to identify focused steps to take to grow your business.1. Careful planning and strategic decision-makingThe importance of careful planning and strategic decision-making cannot be overestimated but is often overlooked when you're running full steam ahead toward business growth. The last thing business owners need is wasted time on unnecessary work that could've easily been avoided with a little thoughtful preparation. Speaking from my own experience at the helm of R Public Relations, I decided to embrace one instrumental but utterly simple expansion strategy: finding my firm's service niche area and sticking with it.


The truth is, my firm and my team can do more than we actually do, but we had to start saying no to services we didn't really want to focus on so that business growth would be in the right direction. Mine is a PR company, and yet at one point, I had more content writers and editors on staff than publicists. So I had to shift that imbalance, stay hyperfocused on our service niche and then use that very service to promote ourselves, brag about ourselves and show our potential clients how good we are at shouting the good news from the rooftops.Related: Why You Should Never Treat Your Business As A Side Hustle2. Finding your client baseJust like I had to narrow my circle of employees and contractors to those who would most directly contribute to business growth goals, I had to zero in on the client base I wanted to feed my business by offering products and services that would most appeal to them. This step involves understanding your customers' needs and wants — both current and future — and conducting market research to determine them. You don't have to have a degree in data analysis; you just need to be a good listener when speaking to your clients. If you ask and show genuine interest, they'll tell you exactly what they want from you that will keep them on your roster and, in turn, keep your business growing.Related: The 7-Step Guide To Finding the Right Clients and Avoiding the Ones Who Waste Your Time


3. Setting pricing and service offeringsI'm frequently asked, ""How much should I charge for so-and-so?"" You can't stay in business if you don't get paid appropriately for what you deliver, but just expanding your menu of offerings to bring in more revenue isn't always (or even usually) the best route to growth. Diversification and specialization can make all the difference, so when you're reassessing your service line, make tweaks where needed and, in some cases, eliminate some services altogether.In my firm's case, we took inventory of all the feedback we received from our clients, and guess what we found out? We were providing not only more than they were asking for but much more than they were paying for! Not good.When we raised our prices to keep in line with costs, client demands rose in kind. I ended up with a burnt-out staff and clients with unclear expectations until I eventually realized that the trick was to scale back on extraneous services without disrupting client satisfaction. In other words, we stopped overdelivering and instead set definite and finite targets that could track both client growth and our own. We defined and set a value for our services so that we could price them properly and better manage client expectations.4. Understanding your market landscapeThis step could just as easily be labeled ""stalking your competitors,"" and there's no shame in that. In fact, you can learn a lot from scoping out what the competition is doing and then figuring out ways to do it better or differently or with more personalization. When I was just starting out in the hospitality market, there was a ""cool kid"" on campus, and we wanted to be cooler. So we'd pitch to the same clients and often win — maybe based on price or our extreme commitment or a combination of both; but the point is, we learned how and what to pitch precisely by following the lead of our competition and then putting our spin on their moves.


Continually assessing where you can stand out in your market and how you can actualize your exceptionality keeps your current clients from jumping ship and attracts new clients to the buzz you've created around yourself. And you can achieve this with a small team and a small budget. When I had limited amounts of both, I prioritized deepening my relationships with my clients through active listening and customization. In the process, I gained valuable insights into market preferences that allowed my firm to tailor strategies to current market trends, strengthen existing client bonds and foster new ones.Related: Starting a Business: How to Start a Business in 12 Steps5. Being passionate about what you doClichéd as it sounds, truly loving your business — thriving off what you do — is the single most valuable key to business success. Clients want to work with you when you're enthusiastic, energized and fun. When your passion for what you do is visible, it becomes a viable path to growth because people want to join you on that path, follow you on that path and share in the rewards that come from an enjoyable journey to a set destination.I'll keep walking that path, recruiting fellow travelers wherever and whenever I can, because we're all aiming for the same thing: successful, blossoming businesses that stand the test of time and evolve with an ever-evolving marketplace.
