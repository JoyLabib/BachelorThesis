0,How Empathy-Based Leadership Can Transform Your Teams and Businesses,"Apr 25, 2024",Martin Rust,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-empathy-based-leadership-can-transform-your-team/472847,"
By now the expression ""the new normal"" should be familiar to us all. It's used to describe the profound changes in our daily lives, including where and how we work. It also describes the overall societal functioning that has settled into place following significant global events, such as the pandemic, ebbs and flows in the economy and geopolitical conflicts that seem to drop out of the sky.This term also includes adjustments in how we communicate, conduct business and interact personally and professionally. What was once considered one-off occurrences have now become expected, reflecting a shift in behaviors, expectations and norms that are accepted as the baseline for moving forward.This new normal complicates the business landscape, affecting supply chains, market accessibility and the behavior of employees and suppliers. Given these challenges, it's imperative for traditional strategic frameworks to undergo an overhaul to safeguard resilience and sustained prosperity.



The fallacy of strategic plansWork culture has undergone a seismic shift. The changing dynamics of workplace locations and the motivations behind work have rendered numerous conventional business models and strategies redundant. Today's workforce seeks more than just routine; they yearn for purpose and the chance to be part of growth and lifelong learning.Moreover, a glaring disconnect persists within many traditional strategic plans. Their extensive timelines and meticulous details often misalign with the fluid nature of real-world challenges, which are prone to abrupt changes. This dissonance makes it difficult for employees to envision their roles, widening the gap between executives, managers and their teams.


Extensive evidence highlights the shortcomings of strategic plans. A 2022 Harvard Business School study revealed that 60% of strategic plans fail to meet expectations, yielding poor outcomes. Moreover, 95% of employees questioned in the same study could not articulate or understand their organization's core strategies. Compounding these issues, a study conducted by McKinsey and Company found that only 30% of executives are convinced that their strategies are effective.And while many companies are beginning to see the light about the failure rate of strategic plans, many are unsure what to put in their place.Related: How to Be the Empathetic Leader Your Team NeedsAttrition is expensiveAccording to a 2022 Gallup survey, only 23% of U.S. employees feel engaged in their company's mission and see themselves as co-contributors to the company's successes. Because strategic plans tend to sideline the heart and soul of any organization — the employees expected to carry them out — it should be easy to see the correlation between failed strategic plans and disengaged employees.


Attrition is not just a line item on an HR report; it's a symptom of a deeper dysfunction within the organizational fabric. Also in 2022, Gallup published a survey revealing that disengaged employees cost the global economy $8.8 trillion annually, a testament to the high price of ignoring employee happiness. But what if I told you that the antidote isn't found in more rigorous performance management but in something as basic as empathy?Related: Does Empathy Have a Place in Your Workplace?The importance of an empathy-based approach to running a businessIn all that we encounter, from the significant to the seemingly inconsequential, it's crucial to acknowledge that at every turn, it's about the people. In my experience interacting with communities in conflict and post-conflict zones, understanding is vital, particularly when we're poised to make key decisions. Empathy ought to be the guiding force behind our every action, steering us through each decision we face.Navigating these pivotal moments requires a grasp of what matters. It might appear obvious, but amidst the chaos of daily challenges, this lucidity enables us to sift through the noise and distractions, honing in on what's essential: the well-being and consideration of those around us.


However, in my experience, true understanding extends beyond mere realization. It involves active listening—absorbing what others express and endeavoring to perceive the world from their perspective. This level of empathy sheds light on what's important and molds our decisions in a way that resonates with our deepest values.Empathy-based leadership, a concept I explore through various anecdotes in my book, From War Zones to Boardrooms: Optimize the Moment When Strategic Planning Fails, is about seeing beyond the immediate tasks and understanding the aspirations, challenges and emotions of those we work with. It's about creating an environment where employees feel genuinely seen and heard, which I've found to be a powerful motivator for loyalty and engagement.It's about hearing the unsaid, recognizing the effort behind the results and understanding the context of so-called failures. This approach has not only helped me build stronger connections with my team but has also fostered a culture of trust and openness in my consulting practice.Related: Try This Approach to Create an Enriching and Caring Workplace


Another key aspect of empathy-based leadership is adaptability. Recognizing that each team member is unique and may require different approaches to feel supported and motivated should be foundational. A common expression among young people is ""meeting people where they're at."" It speaks truth and wisdom. By adapting our leadership style to meet these diverse needs, we can create a more inclusive and supportive workplace environment.When we approach challenges from a place of understanding and compassion, we're more likely to uncover the root causes of issues rather than just addressing symptoms. This can lead to more sustainable outcomes and a stronger sense of collective ownership over them.Perhaps the most compelling argument for empathy-based leadership is its impact on business outcomes. Leaders who show more empathy toward their direct reports are viewed as better performers by their bosses. Empathetic leadership can lead to increased employee engagement, higher morale and improved productivity and innovation.

1,More Companies Are Holding on to Their Employees — and Vice Versa. Here's How to Capitalize on This Labor Market.,"Apr 25, 2024",Daniel Altman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-era-of-quiet-quitting-is-over-heres-how-to-take/472388,"
The labor market has found a new normal — again. After the dramatic swings of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as a bevy of buzzwords, the market has settled into a pattern we've never seen before. If it lasts, businesses will have to think about human resources in a whole new way.First, we had ""The Great Resignation,"" then ""Quiet Quitting,"" which was quickly followed by ""Quiet Hiring."" And now we're in an unprecedented situation that some economists are calling ""The Great Stay."" It's an unusual moment in time given how workers are holding onto their jobs and companies are holding onto their workers.In February, new hires amounted to just 3.7% of existing payrolls and quits totaled just 2.2%. The last time the sum of these two percentages was so small was in December 2017, when the unemployment rate was 4.1%. To see this little churn in the labor market with an even lower unemployment rate — only 3.9% — is unprecedented in the data we have, which go back to 2001. Usually, churn falls when the unemployment rate rises. But right now, we're still near the all-time low for the unemployment rate.



One reason for this lack of churn is the uncertainty that still plagues the economy. The path of interest rates, the upcoming elections, the wars in Gaza and Ukraine and the possibility of corrections in asset markets are all on the minds of managers, workers and investors. Businesses are also concerned that if they let workers go in such a tight labor market, they'll have a hard time hiring when they need workers again. In the meantime, even expert opinions on the future of the economy aren't carrying much weight, since so many forecasters were wrong about a recession coming last year.So what's a business leader to do? The best approach is to take the labor market at face value and adjust strategy accordingly. This means thinking about new hires and existing workers as partners for the long term. Here are some ways to do it.


Related: Where Will the Economy Go Next? What to Watch For in 20241. Plan recruiting efforts to account for lower attritionWorkers are holding onto their jobs for longer. In the Bureau of Labor Statistics's most recent figures, the median job tenure of American workers had bottomed out at 4.1 years after a long decline. With fewer people walking out the door, you don't need as many walking in. You can spend more time searching for candidates for a given position, but that doesn't mean you can be choosier — there's still stiff competition for the best hires.2. Invest more in trainingThe longer workers stay with you, the more benefits you receive when they pick up knowledge and skills. To reap these benefits over the longest period of time, you have to start investing in training as early as possible.You can be savvy about the types of training you offer, too; boosting workers' ability to use equipment, software, and processes that are unique to your business raises their value to you but doesn't necessarily make them more likely to change jobs. But if you're having trouble attracting workers, you might want to offer training on skills that are in high demand across the labor market. Then you can figure out how to make them stay — which might help you to discover why you had trouble attracting them in the first place.


3. Shift the mix of benefitsTraining isn't the only way to invest in workers. Helping them to build their human capital through subsidies for education also makes them more valuable. Again, you can be savvy about the kinds of education you'll support, such as part-time MBAs for potential managers or skills-specific degree programs for individual contributors.Investing in workers also means keeping them healthy and happy. Comprehensive medical benefits including exercise programs, mental health services and wellness care can make a big difference, as can free healthy meals and paid time off. Businesses that offer support for growing families, such as paid parental leave, are also more likely to hold onto workers for longer.4. Structure incentives differently for retentionHolding onto workers was such a challenge in the past several years that some businesses offered retention bonuses after as few as three months. With workers less likely to leave, these incentives can be pushed back. Laddering incentives can also encourage workers to stay longer. For example, if a worker's bonus for staying two years was 50% more than the bonus for staying one year, then the worker might be more likely to hang around rather than start from the bottom rung at another business.Related: Don't Lose Those Talented Team Members. 3 Ways to Hold on to Them.


5. Explore long-term options in all areasWorkers increasingly think of their labor supply as a portfolio of different kinds of jobs and flexible work, and business leaders can do the same — especially in this labor market. Just as there are ways to take advantage of long-term relationships with permanent employees, there are also big benefits from commitment and consistency among temporary and flexible workers. Reducing turnover and deepening experience in these groups can raise productivity. Our surveys of workers on the Instawork platform suggest that more than half can commit to stay with the same business for at least three months working full-time hours.Matching these workers with businesses looking for long-term staffing — in all of its forms — is a critical task in the current labor market. It's also one that will have benefits far into the future, as workers deepen their skills and receive steadier incomes via more committed relationships with businesses.

2,Your Service Should Go Way Beyond Sales. 4 Ways to Build Long-lasting Relationships With Distributors and Retailers,"Apr 24, 2024",Adam Kroener,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-ways-to-build-long-lasting-relationships-with-retailers/472800,"
Business partnerships can make or break your company's success. Strong business partnerships lead to enhanced efficiency, innovation and staff retention, driving long-term success.I've witnessed my brand become among the top ten in RTD spirit sales across the US despite only selling in eleven states. Much of our 'unprecedented' success isn't unprecedented at all. It stems from a hardline focus on investing in building meaningful business relationships. We launched in 2019 and flourished even when most restaurants and bars couldn't stock our products. While many other factors saw us through those uncertain times, our thriving business relationships proved vital.While no one can predict the future, it is important to build pillars to help your company remain stable and scale during uncertain times. To build robust foundational success for your startup, small business, or freelance endeavors, read the four tips below on building long-lasting business relationships.



Related: Why These 5 Characteristics of Self-Reliance Will Guarantee Your SuccessTip 1. ""Expect Ingratitude."" — Dale Carnegie.My first tip could seem counterintuitive to the untrained eye. Yet, my years of trial and error have opened my eyes to the truth about the famed Dale Carnegie quote, ""Expect ingratitude."" This first tip is the foundation for my remaining suggestions, and it's a notion all professionals and entrepreneurs must appreciate and grasp. Expecting ingratitude isn't as pessimistic as it may appear. It's pragmatic and realistic, preventing disappointment because you won't over-inflate your expectations.


Managing expectations goes hand in hand with business success. In doing so, there won't be any blame game when things go wrong, as they inevitably do. There will only be a streamlined focus on solving the problem, taking full ownership of our actions, and driving the business forward. Instead of facing a string of disappointments, insightfully managed expectations strike a balance between unbridled ambition and remaining grounded, keeping your trajectory upward. Stay grounded but aim high, ensuring a win for everyone involved when outcomes exceed expectations.Related: Successful Businesses Have This One Thing in CommonTip #2: Take accountabilityIf something is not working, take ownership of the result. For example, while many across the sector complain distributors and retailers don't do enough for sales, at my company, Carbliss, we take a different approach.Our philosophy is the reality: Distributors provide logistical services to transport products from 'A' to 'B,' while retailers offer the platform to sell. It's not our partners' job to move the products off the shelves; it's ours. When products don't sell, we don't point fingers at our partners. Rather, we look inward and ask how we can improve. We take ownership and accountability for product sales.


Removing these burdens from our partners' shoulders has enabled us to cultivate a symbiotic relationship with them. We support them by letting them do what they do and expecting nothing more, and they support us by doing their job and then some. It's collaboration at its purest and most productive. Stay accountable to increase your collaboration.Tip #3: Offer substance instead of empty gestures.Strong business partnerships don't require glamorous dinner parties or appreciation galas. Perhaps it can mean elbow grease, facetime and handshakes. Be involved beyond emails and phone calls. Insert yourself into the action to prove you're a partner willing to roll up your sleeves and get involved, not just ""another brand.""Your business partners care far less about being wine and dined. Like our distributors and retailers, they'll respond best when you make them feel supported, valued, and part of something bigger.Tip #4: Be honest and transparentHow can your business prove its commitment to your partners' success? It starts with honesty and transparency about your offerings and expectations. Setting expectations immediately and sticking to them builds trust and respect. These efforts often yield pleasantly surprising positive outcomes. Even when outcomes don't get met, keep your business partners involved and stay honest, and this will pay off in the long run. These efforts go far in building lasting relationships.


Related: Stop Lying and Start Being Radically Honest With Your TeamWhen your products can double as commodities, the partners bringing them to market (e.g., distributors and retailers) are as pivotal to your success as your customers. Thus, your partners require a brand experience similar to what you offer customers. Try these suggestions to build thriving business relationships, cultivate loyalty and foster success.

3,We've Normalized Testing Our Employees. But Why Don't We Test Our Leaders?,"Apr 24, 2024",Greg Waisman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-leaders-should-be-tested-just-as-much-as-employees/472793,"
You might be surprised to hear this, but 82% of bosses tend to come into leadership positions without any management training or qualifications.This has resulted in a major decline in high-quality leaders in various industries across the world. An outcome of this is that we face a decline in levels of trust towards managers among regular workers and a high level of employee turnover.So, to avoid this, shouldn't company founders and top management also undergo growth and improve their skills, especially in the current market conditions when everything is changing every day? Well, let's take a look, shall we? Here's my take on how leaders can undergo self-development and why it's important.



Related: How Leaders Can Cultivate Happiness in the WorkplaceAdopt the mindset of changeAs a business leader, I have long learned that the finance industry is constantly shifting and evolving. This means that my fellow founders and I must constantly monitor these changes if our business is to stay relevant.


Lewis Carroll once said, ""My dear, here we must run as fast as we can just to stay in place. And if you wish to go anywhere, you must run twice as fast as that."" These words perfectly describe how founders should feel when gathering and analyzing new information.And it's not just about the right knowledge. The roles you have to fulfill in the company also change depending on what stage of development you're at. When you first launch a startup, the focus is primarily on building your team and researching the market for possible product niches that you can fill. But as your company grows, the situation changes. And so do the tasks that you, as a founder, have to tackle.For example, all our teams have been formed these days, so I find myself dealing with such matters less. Instead, most of my attention goes to more strategic matters, such as planning the company's course and prospects for the next two to three years.And that's how I think it should be. Founders must be able to switch gears, gradually moving away from dealing with operational matters and towards strategic ones. To this end, adopting a particular mindset and preparing a management team that will allow your business to function without your direct intervention in day-to-day matters is important.


Related: 5 Traits You Must Have to Create More LeadersLearn how to take a back seatIn my mind, the founder's task is to build their company up to a certain stage. You will know that you've arrived at that stage when you start feeling that your competencies are no longer enough to continue fulfilling your responsibilities efficiently. This means that it's time to take a step back and hire people better suited to take over some of your tasks.Being able to do so requires a certain measure of character that allows you to look at things objectively and acknowledge that others would be better suited than you for some of the company's positions. In fact, the larger your business gets, the less suited you are likely to be for many roles that need to be filled. And there is nothing wrong with that.I would say that it's a perfectly healthy situation for a company to be in. A time may come when things will be handled by other people who are better at direct management than you. Meanwhile, you and your fellow founders can form the board of directors without a need to get deeply involved in regular processes.


It's up to you to decide when the moment is right for this transition to take place.Related: 4 Ways Exceptional Leaders Can Provide Stability TodayWhat tactics can you use?It is natural for both founders and employees to grow with the company and its needs. Set specific goals that you wish to achieve and select the kinds of training that would better help you achieve them. Here are some options that I believe would be of great use in boosting the skills you need to better command a business.Leadership coaching: Coaching sessions create a space for reflection, where you can improve self-awareness and explore your aspirations. Get a clearer idea of where you are and where you want to be to achieve sustainable growth for the company. Evidence shows that 70% of leaders who receive coaching benefit from improved workplace performance. Personally, I can say that coaching often allows me to reflect on existing business issues while also learning how to do better based on real cases that we've handled in the past. This has proven very helpful over the years.


Industry analysis: I mentioned before that working in finance means operating under constantly changing conditions. That's why constant market assessment is paramount here. It helps us understand the state of things and the needs that market participants face. This, in turn, enables us to make projections about the demand and supply for our products and possible financial returns. If you want your business to be successful, you can never stop deepening your awareness of the market in which you operate.Collecting feedback: in my company, we don't really have a unified benchmark against which we measure all our people and try to make them fit. There wouldn't be much point to that. Fintech is a very innovative field, so the most desired traits here are the ability and the courage to think creatively, not 'adhere to standards', as it were. As such, we prefer to measure the success of our training initiatives through the feedback given by our management and employees according to the Kirkpatrick model. Whether they are managing to apply new skills and knowledge in their work and whether the training has benefited their levels of self-confidence and motivation. That's how we assess our progress.

I'm constantly asked by managers, ""How can I get my employees to ___?""Fill in the blank: ""work as a team,"" ""step up their performance,"" ""care about their work,"" etc. The question always focuses on fixing the employee. Rarely am I asked, ""How can I improve as a leader?""In most cases, the answer to the second question will also resolve the first. It starts with more self-awareness. Managers can be so focused on everything that needs to get done that they don't take time to reflect on how their leadership style affects their team's work. Or maybe they don't believe they're the problem at all. It always feels better to point the finger than to look in the mirror.

5,Offering Your Valuable Knowledge and Services For Free Comes at a Price — Here's How to Avoid Paying It.,"Apr 24, 2024",Liang Zhao,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/this-is-the-true-cost-of-free-work-as-an-entrepreneur/472196,"
People enter entrepreneurship with the mindset that their creation will ""change the world."" The question is: What is the cost of changing the world, and more importantly, who pays?Even fictional heroes have to budget accordingly. There's a reason our most recognizable superheroes — the Tony Starks and Bruce Waynes of comic book fame — are all established, generationally wealthy billionaires who have the abundance of time and money to concern themselves with bigger, more worldly problems. Even Mission Impossible's IMF team is specifically hired to stop the bad guys for a large chunk of change. Everyone wants to be a hero, of course. But the crux of the issue is that, well, no one can afford to save the world for free.Truly passionate entrepreneurs can find themselves in a quandary when it comes to monetizing their efforts, especially when their primary motive isn't profit. When the harvest is for the greater good, whether for the gain of one person, the community or humanity as a whole, altruistic entrepreneurs find themselves frozen when forced to put a price on one's creation. The various scenarios where an entrepreneur might work for free:



Family or social obligations: The desire to support and share, coupled with the informal nature of such relationships, can lead to scenarios where work is heavily undervalued or under-compensated.Passion projects: When an entrepreneur is deeply invested in the results of a project, they might prioritize its completion or overvalue its impact without immediately thinking about the financial costs of the effort.Beta testing: Offering services for free for a case study or as a beta test could be a way for entrepreneurs to demonstrate results and capabilities to win business in the long run.Building skills and experience: Growing your skillset and gaining valuable experience can easily incentivize an entrepreneur to work without compensation as an apprentice or mentee, especially when it also offers a pathway to a new industry or network that isn't typically accessible to them.Market penetration: Offering free trials and sample work can help individuals and newer companies enter into a new market, launch a new product and attract a hard-to-reach customer base.The list of why an individual might work for free is exhaustive, and it can include many more incentives like strategic partnerships, philanthropic contributions and even educational purposes. The 2021 Volunteering in America Report found 60.7 million adults (23.2%) volunteered 4.1 billion hours. For an entrepreneur, unpaid or lowly paid work, though rich with potential, demands a slice of the entrepreneur's most precious resource: time.Related: The Only 2 Good Reasons to Work for Free


A currency of its own, time is paradoxically boundless and yet finite for the entrepreneur. The essence of the entrepreneurial spirit — ambition, passion and a relentless drive — can veer into murky waters if unchecked, especially when commitments continue to stack on top of one another.Many entrepreneurs work 60+ hours each week serving clients, juggling business operations, managing employees, volunteering and balancing family and friend obligations. But doing it all doesn't get a medal or the front page of the newspaper. In a survey of startup founders around the globe, Startup Snapshot found that 72% of founders struggle with mental health — with over 37% suffering from anxiety, 36% experiencing burnout and over 81% reporting that they feel the need to hide their stress, fears and challenges from others. Superheroes rarely count the toll their battles take on their psyche, and entrepreneurs too can overlook the mental and emotional expenditures of their quests.Another unintended dark side of entrepreneurial hero work is one that many so-called ""valued"" workers have faced before — in that the more that you do, the more that you're expected to do. Many clients, eager to capitalize on the dedication and availability of budding businesses, often feel at liberty to push boundaries, reaching out at all hours and expecting immediate responses. How often has a client called at 10 p.m. — or on a weekend — and expected urgent work to be completed without complaint, or more importantly, without additional compensation? For the new entrepreneurs who prioritize customer satisfaction above all, this could be a sincere opportunity to delight. But in the pursuit of building a reputation that shatters expectations, it begs the question: When does ambition become an exploitable liability rather than an asset?For an entrepreneur, how your time should be allocated is a decision that must be made with careful consideration — and for any initiative to continue to make a real and notable impact, it must also be financially viable. Time, effort and resources are all uniquely and equally as valuable to a growing business as the passion that fuels it.


Related: Entrepreneurship Can Be Draining — Try These 3 Strategies to Restore the Joy.To better navigate the relationship between generosity and professional standards, entrepreneurs can employ strategies that respect both their inherent value and entrepreneurial spirit, while still safeguarding their personal well-being. Here are some tips:Map out your schedule: There are only 24 hours in a day with no time-turner. Therefore, it is crucial to set limits around specific times when you are available for various types of work, including unpaid projects. The goal is to help manage expectations and prevent overcommitment.Set clear boundaries: Be upfront about the value and/or cost of your time. Communicate clearly when work is being offered as a favor, as a part of a strategic partnership or with the expectation of future reciprocity. Even between friends, a clear contract or agreement can help prevent future misunderstandings.Prioritize time management: Utilize time management tools and techniques to ensure that time is being allocated efficiently. Not all free work offers the same return when it comes to exposure, experience or potential business.Value one's work appropriately: Understand the market value of your services and strive to maintain that standard. It is always easier to start at a higher price that has a wider scope and work your price down rather than start too small.Keep tabs on one's contribution threshold: Regularly assessing one's contribution threshold helps to keep an eye on the entrepreneur's capacity tank. Driven by passion and motivation, a regular check-in provides a moment of reflection to assess whether time, energy and resources exerted are in balance with the benefits received. An imbalance can manifest into financial strain, lack of personal time or diminished passion for the work.Balance is imperative for sustaining the impact and viability of your endeavors. When it comes to the success of any venture, entrepreneurs must become comfortable in the space between fervor and practicality. Mastering these dueling motivations is crucial; acknowledging the true value of one's efforts ensures that the vision doesn't just survive the early stages of growth driven by motivation — it thrives with sufficient fuel and funds, without compromising the entrepreneur's mental, physical and emotional welfare in the attempt to change the world.Generosity in pursuit of vision should never overshadow an entrepreneur's professional worth. Time and energy is not infinite, but rather, finite.

6,More Companies Are Rushing to Hire A Chief AI Officer — But Do You Need One? Here's What You Need to Know.,"Apr 23, 2024",Mike Murchison,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/more-companies-are-rushing-to-hire-a-chief-ai-officer/472366,"
This spring, the U.S. government took an unprecedented step: requiring every U.S. agency to appoint a chief AI officer. This follows on the heels of companies across diverse industries adding similar roles to their leadership ranks.This is a move in the right direction for companies seeking to integrate AI, but it's not enough on its own. Yes, every company must become an AI company. But expecting a chief AI officer to get the job done alone is shortsighted.When businesses are confronted with a major technological shift, often their knee-jerk reaction is to stick with what they know: Putting a new executive in charge and hoping they can solve everything. But for AI to truly take root in a company, people at all levels of the business need to get their hands on it and start innovating, not follow orders from a gatekeeper in the C-suite.



In fact, the fastest way to integrate AI into a company, in some instances, maybe to skip the chief AI officer role altogether.Related: The Future Founder's Guide to Artificial Intelligence


Why having a chief AI officer might not make senseCompanies appointing a chief AI officer have good intentions as they seek to avoid getting disrupted by the technology. But they may not need this role, and any business adding it should assume that it's temporary.A useful comparison is the stampede in the middle of the last decade to appoint chief digital officers to oversee the digital transformation to internet and mobile technologies. In hindsight, that looks quaint.Experts pronounced CDO the next big executive title, but it often turned out to be little more than window dressing — especially when digital skills became table stakes for most employees. In recent years, companies have been ditching the role or folding it into other jobs. In digitally native businesses, it doesn't exist at all.Google, for instance, never had a CDO directing how employees use web technology. Instead, they empowered employees to explore tools on their own through initiatives like 20% time, setting the stage for innovations such as Gmail.


Likewise, AI-native companies don't have an executive overseeing AI. That would be redundant. At companies like mine, the technology is embedded from day one across the organization rather than siloed in a single role.By default, we all leverage AI. Our marketing team uses it to better understand our customer base, our engineers deploy it to help write code, and our customer support leans heavily on AI agents. AI is written into every role, much like digital literacy now is at nearly all companies. Of course, there are areas of our business where we could use AI more and better, but making that happen doesn't call for a specific job title. It's everyone's responsibility.A better way to usher in an AI transformationBut I realize that not every company is built from the ground up on AI. So, how can legacy companies make real strides in integrating the technology?In place of the top-down response to organizational change, consider a bottom-up approach. For a company that wants to usher in an AI transformation, the first step is to look across the roles you're already hiring for and pick a few where AI agents can do the job today.


Customer service is an obvious place to start — today's AI agents can now address most issues at least as well as humans. AI sales development representatives (SDRs) are also making an immediate impact, automating much of the toil involved in pursuing prospects. Another promising area — junior data analyst roles, which often consist of pulling information from reports. Then there's coding. Autonomous software engineering agent Devin and OpenDevin, its open-source rival, can step in here.Choosing the right technology partner to provide AI tools is equally important. When it comes to customer service, for example, companies should look for a vendor whose AI agents have a track record of resolving most issues without human intervention. Rather than following a script, they should have some ability to reason, drawing on past interactions and the conversation at hand to determine the best solution for each customer's unique problem.Then, it's important to treat your agents more like employees than like a piece of software that will work straight out of the box. Onboarding, measuring and coaching — the same steps you'd take to develop any new hire — are essential to get the most out of AI tools.The upside here is having team members experiment with AI begins to build AI expertise inside the company. For example, my company works with a financial services firm where AI employee manager has become a key position. Former customer support specialists there now teach AI agents new skills that add value throughout the business — thus making themselves an indispensable member of the team.Companies can even make driving productivity gains via AI a criterion for career advancement. To get promoted, an employee must show their manager how they're applying AI to deliver results for the business.Related: How Generative AI is Revamping Digital Transformation to Change How Businesses ScaleThe next stage: Those departments grow into mini centers of excellence that spread AI knowledge and best practices throughout the organization. Team members educate the rest of the business on how to hire and coordinate AI labor. AI becomes integrated into day-to-day business operations in a way that's hard to achieve with an exclusively top-down approach.


Of course, there's no one best way to take a company through an AI transformation. For legacy industries and large enterprises, a tandem approach — combining top-down and bottom-up — may prove a better fit.At the very least, organizations that want to get the transformation right should think about how they can help AI bubble up through the ranks, rather than just rush to hire a chief AI officer simply because others have taken that step.

7,How Startups Can Boost Team Morale and Drive Success Through Recognition,"Apr 23, 2024",Mike Szczesny,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-boost-team-morale-and-success-through-employee/472802,"
The art of celebrating team milestones has evolved into a crucial leadership skill. A recent study by Nectar, an employee recognition software company, found that nearly 84% of employees say that recognition affects their motivation to succeed at work, and nearly eight in 10 people admit that they'd be more productive if they were recognized more frequently.The benefits of a high-recognition culture extend beyond mere statistics. Teams that feel valued and acknowledged tend to exhibit higher levels of innovation and ownership — attributes that are indispensable for a startup's agility and adaptability.For new ventures, the first few years are a time of intense growth and inevitable challenges. It's during this formative phase that the seeds of company culture take root. Establishing a tradition of recognition early on can have a profound effect on shaping the team's dynamics. Startups like Slack and Airbnb have integrated milestone celebrations into their operational rhythms, acknowledging sales and funding successes as well as product launches, positive customer feedback and team members' personal growth achievements.



Related: The Importance of Recognizing Your EmployeesAcknowledgement needs to be genuineCelebrating milestones is not just about recognizing the past or present; it's about inspiring for the future. It serves as a motivational carrot, guiding the team through the next series of goals and challenges. By publicly celebrating milestones, startups also craft their narrative in the broader industry context, signaling success to potential investors, partners and future employees.


However, the approach to recognition must be genuine and aligned with the startup's values. Hollow gestures or a one-size-fits-all approach can backfire, leading to cynicism and a disengaged workforce. Tailoring recognition programs to fit the unique culture and individual achievements of team members ensures that the act of recognition is both meaningful and reinforces the desired company culture.As such, the entrepreneurial journey demands more than just financial savvy and strategic planning; it requires a keen understanding of human motivation and team dynamics. Recognizing milestones is a way for leaders to show that they value their team's contributions, creating a sense of belonging and shared purpose that can propel a startup toward sustainable growth and innovation.Recognition fuels motivation and engagementWithout a doubt, recognition serves as a critical motivator that enhances employee engagement and drives performance. For entrepreneurs and startup leaders who'd like to improve their recognition capabilities, here are a few considerations:1. Set clear milestonesThe act of setting clear milestones is rooted in the principle of Management by Objectives (MBO), a widely endorsed management philosophy proposed by Peter Drucker. MBO emphasizes the importance of aligning individual objectives with the overall strategic goals of the organization, thereby ensuring that every team member is working toward a common endpoint. By setting clear and achievable targets, startups create a focused and energized workforce.


Setting milestones goes beyond just establishing objectives, however. It's about creating a narrative for the startup's journey. This narrative helps team members visualize their path to success and understand how their contributions move the company forward. Milestones act as chapters in the startup's story, each with its own set of goals, challenges and opportunities for growth.Incorporating behavioral insights into milestone setting can also enhance effectiveness. According to the Goal Setting Theory by Locke and Latham, high performance is linked to specific and challenging goals. Startups that effectively communicate these targets create an environment of high achievement. For example, Twitter, during its early growth phase, made use of specific user growth targets as milestones, which were instrumental in driving the company's product development and marketing strategies.Related: 5 Goal-Setting Guidelines That Drive Success2. Celebrate achievements publiclyPublic recognition leverages the innate human need for social status and belonging, tapping into intrinsic motivation that can elevate performance and foster a strong workplace culture. When a startup takes the time to spotlight its team's successes, it sends a message that each member's work is valued and impactful. This is particularly powerful in smaller organizations, where individual contributions can have a substantial effect on the company's trajectory.


Celebrating achievements in a public forum, such as through social media or industry events, extends the reach of this recognition. It transforms internal milestones into opportunities for branding and networking, positioning the company as a thriving and supportive environment. This external recognition can be pivotal for startups looking to attract top talent and can often lead to increased interest from potential investors who are keen to back a winning team.Additionally, public recognition provides an authentic narrative for the company's progress and work culture. In the digital age, where employer review sites like Glassdoor and social media channels can heavily influence a company's reputation, authentic stories of achievement and recognition are valuable for the employer brand. When done right, these stories can resonate with the values and aspirations of prospective employees and customers.3. Incorporate meaningful rewardsBy rewarding employees after the completion of a milestone, you encourage the repetition of the behavior that led to the success. This strategy is aligned with the law of effect, a theory developed by Edward Thorndike, which states that behaviors followed by pleasant outcomes are likely to be repeated.The keyword here is ""meaningful."" For rewards to have the desired effect, they must resonate with the recipients on a personal level. This requires a nuanced understanding of the team's values and preferences. A reward that feels generic or disconnected from the effort expended can fall flat or even have a demotivating effect. For example, a trophy store might be able to create a special award that's a source of pride for one employee, while another might find an extra day off or educational opportunities more rewarding.


Adobe's Kickbox program is an excellent example of an employee recognition initiative that empowers employees to innovate and pursue their ideas. It does this by providing a physical ""Kickbox"" that contains everything an employee might need to brainstorm, develop and test a new concept, including a guide with six distinct levels designed to steer the ideation process from inception to pitch. The most notable inclusion in the box is a $1,000 prepaid credit card which employees can spend with no strings attached, enabling them to prototype or test their ideas without having to justify the expense or navigate through layers of bureaucracy.Related: Do Your Employees Feel Recognized? 10 Powerful Ways to Set Up Employee Recognition Programs4. Foster a culture of appreciationWhen appreciation is woven into the very fabric of company culture, it can transform the workplace into a hub of positivity and productivity. In September 2023, Workhuman and Gallup released a report that found that ""employees who strongly agree that recognition is an important part of their organization's culture are 3.7 times as likely to be engaged, 3.8 times as likely to feel connected to their culture, and half as likely to experience burnout than those who do not.""A culture of appreciation is particularly important in startups, where the pace is fast and the workload can be intense. In such settings, small gestures of acknowledgment can go a long way in making team members feel seen and valued for their contributions. For example, a platform that allows peers to give micro-bonuses to each other for day-to-day accomplishments can establish a sense of appreciation that comes directly from colleagues, not just from top-down leadership.


Remember, a culture of appreciation must be inclusive and diverse in its recognition practices. It should acknowledge the different roles, efforts and accomplishments across the company, ensuring that no contribution goes unnoticed. This includes recognizing the efforts of support staff, interns or remote workers who contribute just as significantly to the company's success.

8,7 Ways You Can Use AI to 10x Your Leadership Skills,"Apr 23, 2024",Gaurav Aggarwal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/7-ways-you-can-use-ai-to-multiply-your-skills/472737,"
The number of AI-based tools is rising, and it has become difficult to keep track of the changes and updates happening daily in this space. New tools promise to optimize your day, with golden promises of making you a 10x version of yourself. Rightly so, but unfortunately, many employees are not using them to their potential. So, let us discuss how the best are having productivity boosts at their jobs.1. Speeding up grunt workAI-powered tools have become the ultimate sidekicks, seamlessly handling mundane yet crucial responsibilities. You can offload tasks like proofreading and summarizing to these AI models. While it is worthwhile going through scrolls of documentation, it is just tedious to write it down. The AI models can come into the picture here by taking a few ideas and making them into comprehensive documentation.Furthermore, you can be even more efficient by letting AI tools engage with data entry tasks. Just a search away is the plentiful repository of no-code or low-code tools that fill that Excel sheet for you. With the ability to swiftly and accurately complete these tasks, employees can redirect their mental energy toward more challenging and rewarding endeavors.

Employees can streamline their workflows by automating these processes, freeing up valuable time and mental bandwidth. No more time-consuming manual efforts; AI takes the reins, allowing professionals to focus on higher-level tasks that genuinely drive their organization forward. While all corporations and startups hurry to integrate AI into the curated set of tools they already provide, learning and implementing repetitive workflows has become increasingly easier.


3. Just-in-time learningThis is something a lot of people have realized AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini or any other generative AI tool you use have brought just-in-time learning to the center stage. You can now just learn the job while being at the job. The speed of interaction with these tools has become a great enabler, and it is thus a must to leverage and get ahead.AI-powered tools offer just-in-time solutions. Stuck somewhere? A simple consolidated answer is ready for you! providing you with the knowledge and skills they need precisely when they need them. No more going through endless modules or attending lengthy training sessions; AI curates the most relevant information, ensuring that you are equipped with the right tools at the right time.Related: The Importance Of Continuous Learning In The Era Of Artificial Intelligence4. Improve decision supportMany people talk about making their decisions on the overall hunch - a gut feeling that drives their decisions, even in the presence of the various popular data-powered decision tools available. It's primarily due to the hassle with the incumbent tools and urgency of decision making which requires a faster approach.


With so much competition, it may be a fatal flaw to move forward using just intuition. The AI tools have reduced the turnaround time between data interpretation and the time required for decision making thus enabling a data-driven approach to decision-making. AI excels at analyzing vast troves of data, getting insights and presenting visualizations that aid in informed decision-making.5. Personalizing interactionsCrafting personalized emails and providing tailored feedback are essential components of effective communication and employee development. AI tools can analyze vast amounts of data, understanding the nuances of each individual and their preferences. This invaluable insight can help employees craft messages and feedback that resonate deeply, fostering stronger connections and more productive collaborations. Not to encourage, telling your AI assistant to send all of your messages.Remember, it's still an assistant, and the other party also has access to the same tools. An unwanted scenario we are seeing is humans passing the task to an AI assistant, leading to merely the two AI assistants talking to each other in a to-and-fro fashion, one drafting and the other summarizing. While this may be the path of least resistance, the premium to be paid is exactly the opposite of what we intend, that is, loss of personal connection. A choice you need to make on the path you take. Hence use them wisely!Related: AI vs. Humanity — Why Humans Will Always Win in Content Creation


6. Streamlining interactions and feedbackIn the space of customer service, AI can become an indispensable assistant. By compressing customer reviews, inquiries, and feedback into a single, centralized pipeline, AI tools can help teams to identify and address customer needs swiftly. People usually scrape reviews and feedback and go through them. AI tools can go one step further by creating a funnel for the team to address them more effectively.7. Overcoming creative blocksA common problem is that most professionals can be troubled by creative blocks. The thought is right at the tip of the tongue, but it still can't materialize into something meaningful. AI tools have emerged as invaluable brainstorming partners, offering fresh insights, transforming abstract ideas into concrete words, and refining blunt concepts by chiseling them to their fullest potential. You can throw out some words, ideas or notes and see them transform into better-developed frameworks that help you get further.The landscape of business next is one where everybody has their assistant as support; thus, it's crucial to embrace these advancements with open arms. You can unlock untapped levels of efficiency, effectiveness, productivity and overall workplace satisfaction. However, it's important to remember that AI is not a universal cure. The point is that these collections of powerful tools must be used with skill. Striking the right balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and maintaining human intuition and creativity is key to truly optimizing productivity in the modern workplace.

9,8 Little Things That Make Remote Work More Efficient for Everyone,"Apr 23, 2024",Artis Rozentals,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/8-ways-to-make-remote-work-more-efficient-for-everyone/472694,"
For the first time since we were all forcefully thrown into remote work in 2020, it finally feels like the debate surrounding it is settling down.Companies that wanted their teams back in the office have enacted relevant policies. Meanwhile, employees enamored with remote work have lots of options, with vacancies offering just that. Also, many workplaces have adopted hybrid ways of working to get the best of both worlds, with studies reporting more than half of working Americans having the opportunity to work remotely at least once a week.That means that for a majority of employees, remote work remains a core part of their day-to-day life because, even when you work fully in-person if you have a colleague joining from home, you inevitably get sucked into a remote work dynamic. For many, this continues to be a challenge — remote work has its own specifics regarding communication, collaboration and general etiquette, which don't come naturally to everyone.



So here are eight little things anyone can do to improve their remote work experience and that of their colleagues.Related: I Live in Hotels Full Time. It Works Out Cheaper Than Renting and I Haven't Changed My Sheets in 3 Years.


1. Make your availability knownAre you out for lunch? Picking up kids from school? Do you have irregular working hours? While remote work's flexibility is one of its best features, ensure your team is informed about when you'll be in work mode to avoid misunderstandings, missed messages and schedule clashes.For instance, if you start work later, it may be wise to indicate that somewhere so early birds know not to expect your input in the initial hours of the morning. This can be as simple as a relevant emoji on your Slack profile or a quick update at a weekly meeting.2. Document processesSince much remote work collaboration is asynchronous, try to document processes, decisions, and strategies so that anyone in the team can find their footing at any time. If you don't, there's a risk of confusion and repetition — teammates might miss updates, and managers might grow tired of explaining the same things to everyone individually to get people on the same page.If you haven't yet, one good practice to adopt is to send out meeting summaries and make a habit of it for other informal important discussions, too.


3. Don't forget about timezonesAmericans may be accustomed to time differences between coasts, but with the rise of remote work, your team may have added some international talent. Emilia from Finland won't be available for your afternoon catch-up because her day ended hours ago — and unless it's been previously agreed upon, you shouldn't expect her to be.Related: The Most Common Work From Home Problems -- Solved!4. Use the same software and tools as your colleaguesTo avoid constantly converting documents, downloading new software, or getting into protracted arguments about which tool is best, you must agree on a single set of tools that will be used company-wide. Larger enterprises typically already have an established tech stack, and smaller companies should follow suit.Remote work and communication necessitate a variety of technologies for collaboration, work, and management. If everyone starts using whatever they like, it'll sow frustration, impair cybersecurity and leave information scattered.


5. Don't browse social media during meetingsThat's it — that's the whole tip. You know it's counterproductive and affects the overall quality of the meeting and your information retention capacity. Will you stop doing it after reading this? Let's be real — probably not.So here's a pro tip and a fun read: to avoid getting into hot water, take off your glasses when you scroll social media during a conference meeting.6. Avoid common video conferencing issuesMute your microphone when you're not talking, test your connection and tech beforehand, show up on time, turn on your camera, be presentable and ensure your background is as well. By now, we all know these video conferencing best practices, but very few people take the time to practice them. As a result, it's extremely common for calls to get disrupted by basic tech issues, sowing frustration and impeding communication.7. Respect different working stylesEveryone has their own ways of working that suit them best. Some people are gifted multi-taskers who want to know everything that's going on and be constantly in the loop. Others thrive in deep work, and a single distraction can reduce their productivity.


Accordingly, while the former will be happy to receive a Slack message and engage in discussion, the latter may find it irritating and disruptive. Some people will be happy to jump into a quick meeting to get on the same page, whereas others would prefer an email.Respecting how others operate can maximize each individual's productivity. To do so, all you need to do is discuss it with colleagues.Related: How to Navigate Generational Differences and Hybrid Challenges in the Workplace8. Regularly celebrate winsIt's no secret that remote workers struggle with loneliness. One of the chief arguments against remote and hybrid work is that it hampers team bonding and the development of a healthy company culture.


But this isn't an inherent problem with remote work. Rather, fostering camaraderie and a healthy work environment demands more active effort in a remote setting than an in-person one. By putting in the effort, you can overcome the challenges of feeling and experiencing the realities of isolation.A great place to start is celebrating wins — develop a shared virtual ritual that involves the entire team and helps people connect.These eight tips will significantly boost your team's efficiency. But remember that for them to be effective, they need to become foundational to your operation. It's not a one-and-done kind of thing but rather an ongoing collective effort to improve everyone's working environment.

10,Successful Businesses Have This One Thing in Common,"Apr 23, 2024",Wiljeana Glover,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/successful-businesses-have-this-one-thing-in-common/472059,"
High-performing startups often feature strong founding teams that combine business-minded generalists and technical-expert specialists. The mythic founder who does it all is rare for good reason. The skill set that makes someone a top-notch developer or scientist isn't the same skill set it takes to raise capital and coordinate business operations.The best partnerships pave the way for innovation and success. But partnerships can go wrong if business promises outstrip technical realities. Think of Theranos, the fraudulent blood-testing startup where claims to the public and investors never aligned with what the product could actually do.As the founding faculty director of the Kerry Murphy Healey Center for Health Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Babson College, I often assist healthcare experts looking for business partners to push new ideas to market. Research I've done with Babson colleagues Candida Brush and Alia Crocker suggests interdisciplinary teams are most likely to have the knowledge required for a successful venture.



Here are three strategies to build and scale successful partnerships and companies.Related: Want to Grow Your Business? Here's Why You Need Strategic Partnerships to Succeed.


Find the right person by setting clear expectationsInnovators looking to launch a product and business professionals looking for their next startup don't always share the same aims. When you meet a prospective co-founder, be upfront about your economic and mission-driven motivations and ask them to do the same. Check that you're on the same timeline. How fast do each of you want to move? If one person is eager to go to market and the other wants to slow down, you'll encounter serious problems.Verify whether you share the same ethical approach about not cutting corners to make the next milestone, and make sure to discuss roles. In healthcare startups, for example, some scientists prefer to be silent partners rather than a prominent part of the business. So ask your potential co-founder: How involved do you want to be in the company?Partnerships require compatibility, even as they flourish because each person brings different strengths to the relationship. Don't feel pressured to immediately settle down. If your prospective partner doesn't share your expectations, keep searching. Being up front early can save you and your team from disappointment and financial losses down the road.You have options. Co-founder matching platforms such as Y-Combinator, Co-Founders Lab and others offer ways to connect. There are also specialist matching programs for particular industries. MassVX, founded by Vinit Nijhawan, serial entrepreneur and managing director of MassVentures, connects doctors and other scientific experts with entrepreneurs who have experience raising capital and running a business.


Related: What to Look For — And Watch Out For — When Selecting Partners to Fuel Your Brand's SuccessCreate a common languageEven before vetting partners, business-oriented entrepreneurs should become conversant in the field they're exploring. You don't have to be as knowledgeable as the technical expert on the innovation itself; that's why you're teaming up. But you should know the field well enough to discuss its potential. You can't position your company to succeed if you don't understand what your product does and why it's better than existing solutions.If you're entering the healthcare industry, for example, you might attend relevant medical conferences and follow scientific discoveries. If you're wading into the gaming industry, you might attend gaming events, read industry reports and listen to leading podcasts. In 2024, every technical field features a wide range of accessible options to learn more.At the same time, you'll want to find a technical partner who is open to understanding the business side. Before teaming up, you should offer a baseline explanation of your anticipated revenue model, customer base and market size. Are you a B2B company pitching a few large clients? Or a B2C organization that relies on individual consumer buy-in?


Once you find an expert who shares your language, keep the conversation going throughout the partnership. Reserve time for regular updates on how the product is progressing. Genuine curiosity from entrepreneurs makes technical experts feel understood, and helps you better do your job. You won't be tempted to fluff over the details when pitching to investors — a tactic that could eventually catch up with you.Don't let these meetings become one-sided. You should keep your partner apprised of business progress. Teams only succeed when partners understand and build off each other's expertise in the pursuit of a common mission.Related: Most Business Partnerships Fail — 5 Hacks to Make Sure Yours Stays IntactDevelop shared measures of successYou and your co-founder should track progress together. That initial agreement on expectations will be your North Star when setting product and financial milestones.


As an entrepreneur, you're responsible for making sure that fundraising doesn't outstrip results. If you go to series B and C and you're not keeping track of product development, eventually that omission comes to a head. For example, a 2022 study led by researchers at investment firm Rock Health and Johns Hopkins University found that 44% of digital health startups had no clinical trials or regulatory filings to stand on.You should also help technical experts understand financial measures of success like revenue and customer win rate. Sometimes an engineer or scientist might feel like the businessperson is pushing the timeline too fast. Listen to those concerns. If you disagree, explain how your approach contributes to your organization's goals.Profit and purpose can go together when entrepreneurs and technical experts are on the same page. That isn't always easy. Making these relationships work is an art. By setting expectations up front, communicating clearly and working toward shared measures of success, your partnership will reap rewards both for you and your business.

11,Successful Brands Use These 4 Radical Practices to Attract Loyal Customers,"Apr 17, 2024",Adam Kroener,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-successful-brands-should-embrace-radical-transparency/472395,"
In today's marketplace, consumer trust has become paramount for businesses seeking lasting success. A study by Edelman found that 81% of buyers cite brand trust as a deciding factor in their loyalties and purchasing behaviors. With the proliferation of information sources, companies can no longer maintain opaque practices obscuring key details. They must operate in full transparency to earn customer confidence and allegiance.As the CEO of Carbliss, an alcoholic beverage brand, I've witnessed firsthand how radical transparency around all production and business operations drives powerful consumer loyalty and business growth. From our earliest days, we committed to an unwavering open-book approach that has helped cement valuable, long-lasting relationships with our customer base. Below are the four criteria and best practices we prioritize to maintain transparency and customer loyalty.1. Hands-on customer dialogueToday's empowered consumers can easily see right through that disingenuous smokescreen. What they crave from the brands they embrace is true candor about every key aspect, including the ingredients, sourcing practices, pricing rationale, regulatory challenges, and more underpinning the products they consume.



One key way I nurture this culture of authenticity is by being directly involved with a huge volume of customer inquiries myself. This past year alone, I answered around 8,000 emails from Carbliss distributors, retailers, consumers and fans.Ongoing candid dialogue is critical for comprehensively understanding how customers perceive our brand identity, product qualities, and customer service experiences in an unfiltered way.


Through raw, unapologetic honesty in these interactions, even when the facts may be unfavorable or unpleasant for the customer to accept, we actively cultivate invaluable trust. The simple truth is that you cannot build enduring customer loyalty through automated and impersonal responses or convoluted corporate jargon.Related: Don't Talk to Another Customer Until You Learn This Simple Customer Service Secret2. Shining light on complexitiesEmbracing this level of radical transparency means being prepared sometimes to face intense scrutiny from confused, perhaps deflated customers seeking simpler truths. We've found that the payoff is an extraordinarily powerful brand reputation anchored in truth that ultimately breeds sacred trust and loyalty.At my company, we willingly spotlight the very details that other brands may conceal or try to downplay, like our need to use ""artificially colored"" labels on cans despite the colors being derived from natural sources, like the brilliant blue of butterfly pea flowers.


We take every opportunity to explain the nuances of regulatory complexities that result in obligatory technical labeling jargon. We balance that by reaffirming our core principles of prioritizing high-quality ingredients that we legitimately consume ourselves and provide to friends and family without hesitation.3. A culture of authenticityAs you grow and scale, it's important to maintain transparency throughout your team. This can be in the form of understanding the intricacies of the product, the runway to profitability, or the purpose of their unique role in the overall strategy. Our employees, regardless of role, deeply understand the ingredients, sourcing, and production methods behind our products so they can convey that knowledge accurately and credibly in their customer-interactions activities.Our detailed FAQ content clarifies common misconceptions, from our avoidance of artificial colors to our premium pricing rationale based on operational costs and premium product positioning. While some buyers may be dismayed at certain realities we present, we insist on honesty because we've learned it's the only path to fostering long-term customer understanding, respect and allegiance.Related: How to Lead With Authenticity and Build a Thriving Workplace


4. Transparent best practicesFor companies in any industry aspiring to foster powerful brand loyalty by operating in total transparency, below are my personal principles:Be unconditionally open about all business practices by prioritizing clear, forthright communication with customers at every opportunityHave customer-interaction teams be prepared to personally respond to every inquiry with unvarnished candor, excluding no unpleasant truthsThoroughly educate and train all employees on the paramount importance of authenticity in all their customer-interaction words and actions.Embrace both positive and negative customer feedback as a welcome opportunity to demonstrate a real commitment to constant improvement.Ensure all marketing content and messaging accurately reflects the true nature of your products, services, and practices without ambiguity.Be unafraid to openly discuss your company's genuine challenges, as this humanizes the brand relationship.Related: 5 Examples of Companies Succeeding Through TransparencyWeathering backlash to cultivate loyaltyCertainly, this radical embrace of transparency sometimes means facing backlash from those who are displeased with newly revealed information that clashes with their expectations. Cultivated ironclad trust and loyalty far outweigh any short-term friction. When you deal truthfully and withhold nothing from your customers, you attract buyers aligned with your values who appreciate your courage and unwavering integrity.If you're ready to foster true customer loyalty and propel sustainable growth, it's time to embrace radical transparency across your organization. Don't complicate realities; shine a light on every aspect of your products, operations, and business practices. Deal in truth relentlessly, even when facing scrutiny. Your authentic soul and unwavering integrity will attract devoted brand advocates aligned with your values.

12,Renowned Psychologist Adam Grant Says This 3-Step Leadership Method Will Help Fight Employee Burnout,"Apr 16, 2024",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/adam-grant-these-3-steps-will-help-fight-employee-burnout/472803,"
Let's face it — U.S. workers are burned out.Research from Aflac on the stress levels of U.S.-based workers found that over 50% of respondents experienced burnout in 2023, and nearly 75% reported having moderate stress levels at work.But organizational psychologist and bestselling author Adam Grant, a go-to expert for mindset and organizational habits, says that leaders in the workplace are to blame, not burned-out employees.



Adam Grant onstage during a panel at the 2022 Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Summit (Brian Stukes/Getty Images)""I think about burnout as a sense of emotional exhaustion that's both persistent and impairing, meaning it's not just a blip — it sticks. It also interferes with your ability to function,"" Grant told Entrepreneur at BetterUp's Uplift conference last week. ""It's a structural and cultural problem if you have more than one person burning out. That is a challenge to tackle in your organization that leaders need to be responsible for.""


Related: 5 Ways Leaders Can Fight Burnout CultureAs the issue of burnout continues to plague employees and their employers, Grant, a Wharton professor, said the solution is to focus on what he calls the ""demand, control, support"" method of leadership that can help employees find meaning and motivation in their work — and tackle burnout in the process.Grant broke down his strategy for us below using data from Return to Office Insights researched by BetterUp Labs.DemandGrant says leaders need to examine what the demands are that are causing burnout in the first place.


""That has to do with overload, that's having too much work, it's having work that doesn't have clear expectations, it's being expected to be on 24/7,"" Grant says. ""Those kinds of demands are taxing. We need to figure out if there are pockets of people who are burning out with similar kinds of work — that's a sign to me that the demands are excessive.""Reducing demands can mean anything from hiring more staff to delegating responsibilities, but the end goal should always be to make employee demands ""more manageable.""ControlBut sometimes demands can't be eliminated. For example, if you work at a startup and customers are placing orders from all around the world, eliminating hours might not work. Instead, Grant says companies can give employees more control over their day.""What we can do is to try to give more choice and more freedom around how you manage those demands,"" Grant explains. ""We want to give people control over what they're working on, when they do it, who they do it with how they get it done. And those sources of autonomy tend to make demands more manageable is the general finding."" 


Grant also said that today's employees prefer controlling their office hours and want to have a more flexible work environment. Offering this control back to the employees could be effective in mitigating burnout.""There's been a lot of discussion about where we work as a form of flexibility. My read of the evidence is that people want discretion over when they work more than where they work,"" Grant explained. ""So if you give people the flexibility to set their own hours, they are very happy to come to the office, if that's a tug of war.""SupportGrant says ""support"" is about ""giving people the tools that they need to cope with demands"" in the workplace and making mental health a priority.""It's also about building a culture where [employees] feel that they can be candid about their emotional well-being and seek help if they need it,"" he said.But telling employees that you prioritize mental health and actually making them feel comfortable talking about it are two different things, he says.The most effective way to combat this, he says, is when a leader sets an example and is open about needing to take time off for mental health reasons and fostering an open dialogue amongst employees when they're struggling.""I think modeling that makes it clear to people at all levels that this is not just lip service, we're not just claiming that you can take care of yourself, we're actually demonstrating through our own behavior that it's acceptable and encouraged around here,"" Grant says. ""It's been frustrating to watch a lot of companies say, alright, we have a burnout problem, we're going to give you mindfulness training or we're going to teach you stress management skills as if this is not a psychological problem.""

""This year, companies in financial services, healthcare and tech dominate the U.S. ranking, driven in part by pandemic rebounding and overall stability within these sectors despite layoff headlines for some big-name companies,"" the company said in a statement, which also noted that 44% of the companies included in the 2024 ranking are new to the list and represent a range of industries including motor vehicle manufacturing and biotechnology research.Several key trends emerged across this year's top companies. They're embracing the power of artificial intelligence, relying on AI for meeting summarization, code generation, customer service assistance, predictive analytics, modeling and more; cultivating academic communities with an AI focus; and even creating their own AI platforms and governance teams, per LinkedIn.


The top companies are also on the hunt for soft skills like adaptability, curiosity, collaboration and communication, and they're aiming to center company culture and connection, according to the research. Some examples include Wells Fargo, which hosts events like puppy-petting with local dog foster organizations as part of its Stress Down Days program, and PwC, which encourages breaks by outfitting its offices with gaming areas that include foosball, shuffleboard, basketball and more.Related: Unlocking the Power of LinkedIn: How Entrepreneurs Can Leverage the Platform for Growth and SuccessBut perhaps one of the most significant developments for employees? That might be these top companies' mission to ""uplevel"" compensation packages. When asked to rank the most important factors in a job, 45% of workers said pay took the No. 1 spot, a Washington Post-Ipsos poll found. Although many would consider salary the backbone of any compensation package, the top companies on LinkedIn's list also look beyond pay when it comes to their ""robust compensation packages.""JPMorgan Chase & Co. (#1) provides financial coaching to help employees earn and save more; General Motors (#11) offers upskilling initiatives like the Geek Program technical competitive events and tuition assistance; the American Express (#49) Colleague Networks feature international buddy programs and informal coffee chats to increase employee visibility with leadership; Continental (#29) implements job rotations for internal mobility, including short- and long-term international assignments; and Procter & Gamble (#22) wants team members to have the opportunity for ""several careers within a career,"" per LinkedIn.

14,"When Customers Balked at High Prices, This Bubble Tea Maker Educated Them About Quality Ingredients. Now His Flea Market Stand Has Turned Into 3 Permanent Locations.","Apr 15, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-his-company-grew-from-a-flea-market-stand-to-3-locations/472688,"
Mathew Wong, owner of Tea and Milk, initially struggled to meet high costs and customer demand when building his New York City bubble tea business. But by educating his customers and providing quality products, he transformed a single shop into a well-known, values-based brand.The shop's original 10-by-10-foot space at the Long Island Flea Market has given way to three permanent locations across New York City, including storefronts in Chelsea Market, Brooklyn, and Astoria. In the process, Mathew built out a centralized kitchen for sandwich making, an event catering service, and a huge community of boba lovers.Related: The Counter Service at Yo' Mama's Is Just As Unique As Its Name. Here's Why People Come Back for the Experience as Much as the Food.



One of the biggest keys to success for Tea and Milk is their focus on integrity. Mathew and his business partners travel to Asia to source and learn more about their ingredients, visiting tea farms to learn about everything from the tea-making and manufacturing process to the ceremonies that celebrate the cultural role of the ancient drink. Mathew then uses his travel experiences to educate his customers about the products so they feel good about their purchases.Even though Mathew and his team believe in the importance of well-sourced ingredients, the right tea leaves can be quite expensive, and they've had to learn to work around the rising cost of goods.


Mathew reads all of Tea and Milk's financial statements to keep up with margins. His background in accounting has taught him that even though it can be overwhelming to face discouraging numbers head-on, it's crucial to understand how your business is performing so you can make necessary adjustments.""[If] you're reading a [profit and loss statement] and it's scaring you, it's very likely because you're not doing something that you need to do, such as marketing, educating the customers, training your staff,"" Mathew said. ""You need to have standard operating procedures in order to push forward. There's no other way around it.""Related: The Little Coffee Shop That Asks Customers Not to Be QuietIn terms of educating customers, one of Tea and Milk's biggest obstacles is that customers often aren't used to the taste of premium ingredients, so the more they know about the product, the more likely they'll be satisfied with their purchase. This goes hand in hand with getting to know customers' preferences as well.


""We want [customers] to trust the brand,"" Mathew said. ""So [when you] order something that you didn't like, you get something else that you do like. Then you build trust with that person, and eventually, maybe [they'll] try it again.""Despite the challenges that using authentic ingredients has posed, Mathew sees his products as a worthwhile investment. He has situated his shops intentionally across the city to fill gaps in bubble tea offerings in several New York neighborhoods.""We go into neighborhoods that we believe are starving for a certain type of brand. We saw Bay Ridge (Brooklyn), we saw what it was lacking, and we wanted to go in there to be the brand that can offer something different.""He encourages customers to support the local businesses in their neighborhood however they can. If you're not able to spend money at a local spot you enjoy, writing a review or telling your friends to visit can have a lasting impact.


""If you want the business to stay, you have to help support in a way,"" Mathew said.Mathew is a big believer in the power of acknowledging and engaging with customer feedback. While critical reviews can sting, he makes sure to respond to as many as he can to show that he cares about his customers, commenting back in a timely manner while giving himself room to cool off if he needs it.He also encourages business owners to lean on friends and partners for support. Having started Tea and Milk with two of his friends and now operating the business with a co-owner and general manager, Mathew finds it invaluable to have people to brainstorm with about new ideas and improvements. He has also built a network of other small business owners for conversations about business challenges and potential collaborations.Related: How This California Hot Spot Grew From Delivery-Only to Pop-Up Shop to Storefront


""There's always going to be times where people don't agree. But at the end of the day, you have to be very open to these conversations,"" Mathew said. ""The type of people who want to be in your ecosystem will always be there.""In addition to the importance of authentic ingredients and products, Tea and Milk believes in:Staying on top of your schedule and finances. While it can be stressful, looking at the bigger picture and being proactive can help you navigate your business through unexpected challenges.Leaning on fellow entrepreneurs for support. It's important to find and have the right people in your corner when thinking about how to expand and improve.Keeping your eye on the prize.

15,What the C-Suite Needs to Know About the True Power of Earned Media,"Apr 12, 2024",Kelly Fletcher,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-ceos-need-to-know-about-the-true-power-of-earned-media/471993,"
Being part of the C-suite in any company is a monumental responsibility that demands a diverse skill set and a deep understanding of various facets of business. To reach such a position typically involves years of hard work, experience and a fair share of challenges.CEOs, especially, are often tasked with overseeing multiple aspects of the business, from sales growth to financial stability and brand management. While C-suite members are undoubtedly knowledgeable, there's one area that often escapes their attention: earned media.Related: What Is Earned Media and What Is Its Value?



Why earned media mattersEarned media holds a significant place in an organization's success story because of its ability to bolster credibility, enhance brand reputation and widen the reach of its message. Unlike paid media, which includes advertisements, earned media comprises press coverage, social media mentions and word-of-mouth referrals. Consumers tend to trust earned media more because it's seen as impartial and genuine.Research by YouGov indicates more than 90% of consumers put their faith in earned media. Positive coverage from reputable sources not only validates the credibility of the organization but also introduces it to new audiences, thereby boosting brand visibility and awareness. Additionally, earned media sparks conversations and interactions, fostering deeper engagement with the audience and strengthening brand loyalty. In fact, a substantial portion — ranging from 25 to 40% — of all traffic and lead generation originates from earned media. By leveraging the power of earned media, organizations can amplify their message, establish authority in their industry and drive sustainable growth.


Why the C-suite often overlooks earned mediaIn my firm's experience, CEOs and executive teams tend to overlook earned media due to several misconceptions:Perception of importance: Some CEOs underestimate the significance of earned media compared to other marketing channels. They may not fully grasp its impact on brand reputation, trust and consumer perception.Resource constraints: Developing a robust earned media strategy requires time, effort and resources. CEOs may prioritize areas of the business that offer immediate returns, overlooking the long-term benefits of earned media initiatives.Measurement challenges: Many CEOs mistakenly believe that earned media is difficult to measure. However, advancements in analytics tools like GA4, UTM tags and media monitoring software have made it highly measurable.Focus on immediate ROI: CEOs often feel pressure to deliver immediate returns on investment, leading them to overlook the time-intensive nature of earned media strategies.Perhaps most importantly, earned media is a strategic long-game tactic that CEOs must grasp to harness its full potential. Unlike paid media, which often yields immediate results but comes with hefty price tags, earned media requires patience and persistence. While paid placements can cost thousands of dollars, securing coverage through earned channels like bylined articles demands only the investment of time in writing and pitching.Although the process may not deliver instant gratification, the trust-building outcomes it generates over time are invaluable. CEOs who recognize and commit to earned media stand to reap significant dividends in credibility, reputation and sustained audience engagement.Related: 6 Strategies to Maximize Earned Media for Your Brand


Reframing the narrative: Aligning earned media with the marketing sales funnel and buyer's journeyChallenging the conventional wisdom, I've come to realize that earned media is more versatile and impactful than commonly believed. It permeates every stage of the marketing sales funnel and the buyer's journey, from building awareness to fostering loyalty.Consider this scenario: You craft a compelling bylined article showcasing your industry expertise and addressing a common challenge your customers face. The article gets published in a major media outlet, generating awareness for your brand. You then share the article on social media, targeting users in the consideration phase who have already engaged with your brand. Additionally, you incorporate the article into your website content and email newsletters, catering to prospects in the consideration phase. As prospects move into the conversion stage, you leverage the article's credibility to drive conversions, solidifying their trust in your brand. Finally, in the loyalty phase, you utilize testimonials, a form of earned media, to reinforce brand advocacy and deepen customer loyalty.Related: Why Earned Media is the Best Way to Earn Your ReputationFor in-house public relations and marketing executives, bridging the comprehension gap within the C-suite presents a formidable challenge. While traditional business education often overlooks earned media, its potential for exceptional results remains undeniable. Encouraging the C-suite to embrace earned media requires patience and persistence, accompanied by a compelling showcase of its tangible benefits. As the business landscape evolves, urging the C-suite to explore earned media can unlock new avenues of growth and elevate the organization's narrative to new heights.

16,6 Things That Will Tell You If You Are Destined for Leadership,"Apr 12, 2024",Lena Sisco,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-tell-if-youre-destined-for-leadership/472155,"
There are many schools of thought regarding leadership. An online search for the best leadership styles and the top leadership qualities will produce pages of articles. And here's another one, right? Not quite. This article will not tell you how to be a great leader; it will tell you whether or not you have what it takes to lead effectively.As a former military intelligence officer and DoD-certified interrogator, I had to lead a team of interrogators in a very chaotic, stressful, and physically and mentally demanding environment. So, I had to handle my stress effectively to be able to lead my team so they felt safe and successful. Since that time, I have discovered that if you embody certain qualities, you are destined for leadership because people will want to follow you — even in the most difficult and demanding situations. Here are six things that will tell you you are ready to lead!Related: 7 Telltale Signs That You Have a Leader's Mindset



1. You know your personalityWhen you understand your personality traits, how resilient you are when times get tough, your priorities and goals when communicating with others, how you approach deadlines and organize schedules, and the most important criteria for you when making a decision, then you have the self-awareness one needs to be a leader.Self-awareness about personality traits naturally leads to increased understanding and empathy when working with people who possess different traits than us. Instead of being unable to make sense of others' actions, we can analyze them and relate them to their inherent personality preference. This ability can prevent natural triggers towards the unknown from judging, blaming or taking things personally.


For example, when I understand that you prefer to complete projects ahead of schedule by following a checklist of prioritized tasks and expect me to do the same, I won't immediately label you as a micromanager. You won't label me as a slacker when you understand that I am comfortable multi-tasking and being more flexible with timelines and schedules when managing a project.2. You know people handle change differentlyKnowing about personality preferences is essential, but it's also crucial to be aware of how people prefer to handle change. Change is an event, but how change affects people is based on their personality traits. Some people embrace change so much they want it to be fast and vast. However, they tend to have difficulty staying focused and completing tasks. Others have an adverse reaction to change. They honor tradition and enjoy predictability. If they have to get on board with change, they prefer it to be small and incremental. Between these two change styles is another style where people approach change cautiously, investigating all options to ensure change is functional.So, there are three change styles, and the workplace needs all three to function successfully. However, if you weren't aware of these change styles, you may have judged or labeled those who have a different stance on the change as either inflexible, indecisive or impulsive. When we understand the three change styles, we can better communicate change and successfully lead others through it.3. You can make decisions timely and with convictionWhen it comes to decision-making, I am not saying you have to know everything — you won't — or that you have to be right all the time — you won't. However, you do have to make decisions in a timely manner and with conviction, or you will make your followers nervous and possibly lose their trust. Does this describe you?


You seek consensus and get buy-in when it is appropriate and necessary.You know how to communicate your decision clearly.You do not wait until it's too late to decide.You stand your ground and take responsibility for your choice.If so, these behaviors will gain the confidence of your followers.Related: 12 Character Traits Exceptional Entrepreneurial Leaders Have In Common4. You are mindful with your wordsBefore speaking, take a few seconds to review what you are about to say. Check the tone of your voice and your body language. If it is a high-stakes conversation, plan it, script it and practice it. Before saying anything, ask yourself how you would feel if you were receiving the same message. Ask yourself, what can you change to ensure your message is clear, concise and non-accusatory?5. You can create a safe environmentAnswer these questions: Are people comfortable around you? Are they comfortable speaking up in front of you and giving you feedback? Do you model consistent, effective behaviors that make people feel safe? Do people trust you?


As a leader, you are being watched and scrutinized daily, even on your bad days. So, check in with yourself every morning to ensure you have a positive mindset and demonstrate consistent, productive behaviors. You will make a great leader if you:Listen objectivelyAre calm and confidentValue what people sayRespect others' differencesSeek to improve and learnAre accountable and hold others accountableRelated: Being a Born Entrepreneur Doesn't Automatically Mean You're a Born Leader


6. You are resilientEveryone has experienced negative situations, such as making the wrong choices, reacting to someone's words or behaviors with negative emotions or getting sucked into self-sabotaging thoughts. When you can bounce back from these situations with a positive mindset and be productive, you are exercising resilience. Not only will you feel better, but the people around you will feel more comfortable. When people feel comfortable around you, they will trust and follow you. If you are naturally resilient, you are definitely ready to lead!Do not be discouraged if you read this article and thought, ""I have to work on that!"" That level of awareness is exactly what you need and what will help you hone these skills to be an effective leader.

17,Here's How Business Leaders Can Cultivate Happiness in the Workplace,"Apr 12, 2024",Adam Markel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-leaders-can-cultivate-happiness-in-the-workplace/472123,"
To improve workplace well-being, businesses are implementing new techniques to encourage employee satisfaction. These innovative strategies prioritize inclusive activities that support a happier and more satisfying workplace because they recognize the critical relationship between productivity and a positive work environment.Learn some of these progressive tactics business owners use to promote a more joyful and productive work environment. This article offers doable strategies for establishing a happy workplace, from developing a supportive atmosphere to putting well-being initiatives into place.Related: 3 Proven Ways to Keep Employees Happy



The link between happiness and workplace productivityProductivity and job happiness have a proven relationship that is important to organizational effectiveness. Studies have indicated that contented workers demonstrate increased levels of involvement, innovation and efficiency.Individuals are more likely to perform at their peak in a supportive work environment that promotes independence, interpersonal relationships and a sense of purpose. Reduced stress, increased job satisfaction and enhanced morale all have a direct impact on productivity and are linked to the general pleasure and well-being of employees.


Promoting independence in the workplace is about empowering employees to make decisions and take actions that align with the company's goals and values. One effective strategy is implementing a decentralized decision-making process. This approach involves delegating authority to individuals and teams closer to the action, rather than maintaining a top-down hierarchy.Building strong interpersonal relationships among team members is another cornerstone of a thriving business. One tactic that has proven successful is fostering a culture of open communication and feedback. Encouraging regular, honest dialogue between employees at all levels of the organization helps to break down barriers, build trust and strengthen team cohesion.Instilling a sense of purpose in your employees is about connecting their day-to-day work to the larger mission and impact of the company. One way to achieve this is through storytelling. Sharing stories of how your products or services have positively impacted customers or communities can inspire and motivate your team. It humanizes the work they do, making it more meaningful and rewarding.Teams and productivity all increase when employers put their employees' health and welfare first. Investing in employee well-being benefits not only the employees but also the business overall, whether it be through chances for professional development, assistance with leadership or a happy work atmosphere.Building a positive workplace cultureEstablishing a joyful and productive work environment requires the promotion of a positive work culture. A positive work culture is characterized by open communication, mutual respect and a shared commitment to fundamental values. The first stage in the process is to have strong leadership that exhibits transparency, compassion and a genuine concern for the well-being of coworkers.Below are some of the other effective tactics business owners can implement to build a positive work culture:Recognition and appreciation:Acknowledge and appreciate employees' hard work and achievements regularly. Implement employee recognition programs to highlight outstanding contributions.Inclusive environment:Promote diversity and inclusion within the workplace. Create an environment where everyone feels valued and respected.Flexible work arrangements:Offer flexible work schedules or remote work options when possible. Support a healthy work-life balance for employees.Professional development:Provide opportunities for ongoing learning and skill development. Invest in training programs that help employees grow in their careers.Collaborative team environment:Encourage teamwork and collaboration among employees. Foster a sense of camaraderie through team-building activities.Social events and celebrations:Organize social events and celebrations to build a sense of community. Mark milestones and achievements with positive and enjoyable activities.Fair and consistent policies:Ensure that policies are fair, consistent and applied equally to all employees. Address issues promptly and consistently.Related: 12 Ways Happiness Increases Productivity in the Work EnvironmentThe importance of implementing well-being programsImplementing well-being initiatives and programs is a smart investment that comes with a lot of advantages both for businesses and employees alike. These activities, which range from fitness programs to mental health support, help promote a positive work atmosphere.Organizations can improve overall morale, lower stress levels and increase job satisfaction by placing a high priority on employee well-being. Tools like wellness seminars, counseling services and flexible work schedules show a dedication to the overall well-being of employees.


Furthermore, well-being programs frequently boost employee output while lowering absenteeism, which creates a more resilient and engaged team.Measuring and sustaining workplace happinessEnsuring employee well-being and organizational performance depends heavily on measuring and maintaining workplace happiness. Metrics like productivity, retention rates and employee satisfaction surveys can be used to gather important information about how satisfied people are in general.Business owners can quickly address complaints and come up with development opportunities when they have regular feedback channels in place. A happy and rewarding work environment is facilitated by the implementation of sustainable practices, such as professional development opportunities, flexible work schedules and recognition initiatives. Sustaining workplace happiness requires persistent efforts to promote transparent leadership, open communication and a supportive company culture.Related: 3 Ways to Establish a Positive Company Culture


Businesses can see gains in morale, engagement and productivity by implementing innovative strategies to foster a happy work environment. Happiness and productivity are related in so many ways, from developing a healthy workplace culture to implementing well-being initiatives.In the end, putting employee satisfaction first is not only a wise strategic move, but it is also a key factor in the success of the company as a whole.

18,The Best Communicators Follow These 3 Rules When Talking to Those in Authority,"Apr 12, 2024",Darian Shimy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-3-modes-needed-for-good-communication/472223,"
Having the right framework is essential when communicating with managers. It allows you to establish clear boundaries and expectations, which improves your ability to advocate for what you need and often leads to better outcomes.The best frameworks are simple but effective. You need something people can internalize, memorize and repeat. I know this because I've developed one of my own: a three-mode scale that I've passed on to countless colleagues in the years since. Nearly everyone I've shared this framework with says it's been extremely useful for them.I call it The Three Modes of Communication for Managers. Here's how it can help improve your conversations with the people who oversee key activities and personnel at your organization.



Unclear communication leads to unfavorable outcomesThis idea originated from personal experience. Years ago, I was reporting to the CEO of a startup and mentioned some frustration I had with another team member. After I told my boss, he proceeded to talk to the team member in question about it — something I had neither expected nor explicitly asked him to do.I was immediately embarrassed when news of this eventually got back to me. I felt that my confidence had been violated, and I became upset. The next time I talked with my manager, I asked him why he had talked to the team member in question.


""Well, you told me about it,"" he replied.I was upset, but later, I realized that I shouldn't have been. The action my manager had taken wasn't what I wanted, but I had been ambiguous about what I was telling him and what direction I expected from him.Based on that incident, I devised three simple rules for streamlining communication with managers. These rules are extremely simple, but they work at virtually every level of management in any organization.Related: Why Middle Managers Are a Company's Hidden Superpower


The three modes of communication for managersThe next time I spoke with my manager, I explained that I had developed three distinct modes to help categorize the experiences I shared with him. I also explained that I would frame future conversations by identifying what mode I wanted him to apply in advance.The three modes are as follows:Mode One: I want you to listen but not do or say anything. You're just hearing me vent. I will tell you about something probably difficult that happened, and I need you to stay quiet. This allows me to verbalize my feelings while helping you understand my challenges and ensuring confidentiality.Mode Two: I want you to listen and give me your opinion without doing anything. I'll probably explain what happened to me and how I feel about it. I might even ask for advice or feedback, but I don't want you to take action on my behalf. This allows me to grow by solving my own problems and promotes resourcefulness, which is a key predictor of entrepreneurial success.Mode Three: I want you to listen, and I want you to act. In my experience, this mode is rarely used — I reserve it for situations where I know that a problem is beyond my ability to resolve alone.This last mode is the inverse of delegating a task to an employee. Instead, you are appealing to your manager for aid. It can be even more difficult, but it's just as important.Related: 5 Delegation Strategies To Help You Flourish With Less Stress


Clear communication requires courageWhen using this framework, the most important thing you can do as an employee is figure out what problems require mode three. When you have a problem you can't handle and need assistance, it takes humility and skill to recognize it. This can save a company — and I don't say that lightly.Knowing when to ""share up"" and ask for help is an art form. When I worked at Square, 180 people reported to me. I didn't have time to read every line of code they wrote, but I did need to understand if there was an issue with the coding and who was on top of the fix.It was important for the people who reported to me to take inventory of their problems and make sound judgment calls about which problems required my attention. It's like knowing when to see a doctor or a lawyer — you have to know when to seek professional help.Related: How to Get Comfortable Being Uncomfortable, No Matter Your Age — Lessons for Entrepreneurs


When you're working at a senior management level, almost everyone has an ego, so this is even more difficult to do. But setting aside your pride takes courage, and I have always believed that venturing beyond your comfort zone is essential for personal growth.Remember: when you can be clear about the kind of communication you need, it's easier for people to say the right things and take the right actions. I've provided you with one possible framework for having these conversations — now it's up to you to put it into practice.

19,Strong Leaders Use These 4 Strategies to Build Trust in Their Workplace,"Apr 11, 2024",Max Azarov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/good-leaders-use-these-four-strategies-to-build-trust/472051,"
More people are working remotely these days, and there are many tools that business owners can use to help their teams stay on track with their workloads, no matter where they are based. But the secret sauce to making a remote or hybrid team work well together isn't technology; it's trust.According to a 2023 study by WFH Research, approximately 13% of people employed full-time work from home 100% of the time, and 28% of this group of people split their time between home and the office. This remote work trend is huge in tech, finance and administrative office-based jobs.There's still some debate about whether everyone should return to the office, but most people agree that a mix of home and office work will probably become the norm. Why? Companies are seeing proof that amending their policies to allow people to work remotely can boost productivity and profits while keeping employees happy and balanced. It's a win-win!



Trust, not micromanagement, is the key to successBuilding trust is crucial for peak performance, whether your company goes fully remote, hybrid or follows another model. Research backs this up loud and clear.Studies by Paul J. Zak, a Harvard-trained neuro-economist, show that employees in high-trust workplaces are more productive, collaborative and loyal. They're also happier and less stressed, leading to even better results. This ""trust over surveillance"" approach is echoed by leaders like Dropbox CEO Drew Houston, whose company thrives with a 90% remote workforce.


Novakid, a fully remote international company, has achieved success by implementing specific strategies that foster trust between managers and remote staff. The following tactics can be used by any business leader who is establishing a thriving remote team.Related: 5 Ways To Establish Trust In a Remote Workplace1. Building trust is the secret weaponStudies show a clear link between trust (think of it as social glue) and strong economies – and that applies to companies too. But for trust to take root, leaders need to genuinely believe in it themselves. You can't build a trusting company culture (remote, hybrid or in-office) if you're constantly second-guessing your team.The key is finding the right balance. Trust your employees to be responsible, and empower them with the tools they need to do their jobs well (think project management software and clear communication channels). But don't be naive – some monitoring is essential to identify any performance issues.


Create a system where everyone feels accountable. It should be easy to flag unresponsive colleagues or missed deadlines. This can be done via workforce productivity and workflow management tools. Most importantly, this can be done by fostering a culture where everyone feels comfortable speaking up about concerns.2. Hiring for trust and autonomyJob interviews are a way to find great people who fit your company culture, especially people who thrive with the freedom that comes from trust.Sharpen your HR processes and interviewing skills. Learn to ask questions that tell the real story – can they handle a challenge, how do they deal with mistakes, are they team players? Look for both their skills and their personality – watch body language and see if their answers align with your values of trust and honesty.Once you find the right fit, onboarding should be smooth. Don't overwhelm new hires on the first day – explain their role, set expectations, provide all relevant materials they will need for their job and then step back. Trust them to get up to speed. They'll appreciate the freedom and responsibility, and it sets the stage for a trusting work style.


Related: 6 Ways to Encourage Autonomy With Your Employees3. Keeping everyone on the same pageBuilding a team that holds itself accountable is key, no matter your work style. Here's how:Set clear expectations: Make sure everyone knows what's expected of them.Open communication: Keep the door open – your team needs to feel comfortable talking to you.Regular feedback: Give regular check-ins to identify any roadblocks. Be honest and clear if something needs improvement.Accountability can be difficult to implement and manage within fully remote teams. The key is finding the balance: empower your team with autonomy, but don't be afraid to address performance issues. You don't want to micromanage, but some oversight is necessary. The bottom line is that if someone consistently underperforms, it's important to take action, up to and including firing them. This shows everyone that you take accountability seriously.4. Focus on results, not busyworkForget about micromanaging with time trackers or spy software. The best way to gauge performance remotely is to set clear job duties, deadlines and expected outputs.


Remote teams already use project management and workflow tools. These can show you if someone's falling behind, but constant monitoring isn't the answer.Tracking software can creep into employees' personal lives, and that's a big no-no. Trust your team to get their work done – let them figure out how to be most productive. Maybe that means working in bursts or outside typical hours. Micromanaging with monitoring tools just makes people unhappy and unproductive, and according to a Deloitte report, is fueling the ""quiet quitting"" trend.

20,How to Overtake Your Competition With Creative Brand Precision,"Apr 10, 2024",Bora Celik,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/disruption-through-design-how-brands-can-beat-out-their/471347,"
What do you do when every shelf and screen overflows with options? Your brand needs to do more than show up; it must shine. Exceptional design is a significant way to shine. It goes beyond colors and logos to become a story, a feeling, a memorable moment. More than aesthetics, it's about wielding design as a strategic tool to cut through the noise and as a deliberate strategy to disrupt the status quo.My first startup, Jukely, excelled in design. My co-founder was an incredible designer, one of the first designers at Kickstarter. Through his design vision, we kickstarted a movement by innovating in a stale space and created the world's first concert subscription service. Our product was featured as one of the best apps multiple times in Apple's app store, which gave us credibility.At the core of this exploration is a belief in the power of design to alter perceptions. In this article, I explore how challenger brands can stand out through striking design and how they draw a clear line between them and the incumbents.

Every brand is vying for attention, hoping to leave a lasting impression. This challenge requires more than just traditional advertising or a flashy logo. It demands a strategic approach to design — a method that intertwines aesthetics with function, creating an experience that resonates deeply with consumers.


The essence of standing out lies in the ability to merge visual appeal with storytelling, ensuring that every interaction with the brand is not just seen but felt. This approach transforms casual browsers into loyal customers, encouraging them to choose your brand amidst a sea of options. Design, in this context, acts as the silent ambassador of your brand, speaking volumes without uttering a single word.Keep it simpleToday's consumer is bombarded with choices, making the decision-making process increasingly complex. In this chaos, simplicity becomes a beacon of clarity and assurance. Brands that master the art of distilling their message into clean, innovative design capture attention and earn trust.Ritual demonstrates this beautifully by stripping away the unnecessary and focusing on what matters. By introducing a clear, minimalist bottle that showcases its equally transparent capsules, Ritual invites consumers into a visual and physical experience of openness and honesty. Their minimalist packaging is a testament to their philosophy, highlighting the quality and thoughtfulness of what's inside. It's a bold statement in an industry often cluttered with claims and counterclaims, providing a clear, unambiguous message about the brand's values and commitment to transparency. This simplicity extends to the user experience, making the journey from discovery to purchase seamless and straightforward.Related: Why Brands are Simplifying Their Logos and Visual Identity


Connecting on a deeper levelThe power of design transcends mere aesthetics; it has the potential to evoke feelings and forge emotional connections. When a product transcends its utility and becomes a part of the consumer's identity, it has achieved something remarkable. Brightland's approach to olive oil packaging illustrates this perfectly.By engaging artists to create visually stunning labels, they turn each bottle into a collector's item, a token of beauty that stands out in the monotony of kitchen staples. Each bottle becomes a conversation piece, a medium through which consumers share their tastes and values. I've seen numerous reviews where the reviewer was attracted to the brand based on how the bottles would look in their kitchen. This deeper connection is what transforms first-time buyers into brand evangelists, creating a community of users who don't just use the product but love and advocate for it.Related: How to Design an Eye-Catching Website That Truly Captures Your AudienceStorytime through designA well-crafted design does more than please the eye; it serves as a window into the soul of the brand, inviting consumers into a narrative that captivates and enchants. Onyx Coffee's award-winning packaging is a masterclass in this art of storytelling. Each bag is meticulously designed to hint at the unique story of its origin, processing method, and flavor profile. This narrative approach transforms the act of purchasing coffee into an exploratory adventure, inviting consumers to experience the journey from farm to cup. The packaging serves as a prelude to the product itself, setting expectations and building anticipation.


This level of engagement ensures that Onyx doesn't just sell coffee; it offers an immersive experience that begins at the point of sale and continues to the last sip. It's a testament to how thoughtful design can elevate a brand, turning everyday transactions into meaningful interactions.The lesson here? When brands get bold with design, they lay out their ethos for the world to see. And in a market crowded with choices, this courage to be different paints the future of how we connect with what we buy. Looking ahead, it's the brands that embrace this blend of innovation and authenticity that will lead the pack, turning everyday choices into gateways of discovery.

21,Organized Labor Disputes Are on the Rise. Here's Why Leaders Should Pay Attention,"Apr 10, 2024",Jesse Meschuk,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-leaders-should-pay-attention-to-the-rise-in-organized/471964,"
In 1919, the United States was gripped by two seemingly unrelated trends: a global pandemic (influenza) and a wave of labor unrest. Four million workers, or one-fifth of the labor force, went on strike that year.Flash forward a century, and history appears to be repeating itself. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and other multi-layered economic factors, labor strife has rocked a variety of economic sectors: automotive workers, nurses in multiple states, Hollywood writers and actors, and journalists all went on strike. Unionization movements within tech and other nontraditional sectors sprung up all at once. Could it all just be a coincidence, or is something more happening here?Any broad shift in dynamics between workers and management has implications for the present and future of employment in the United States. A deeper understanding of the forces at work could be valuable for a variety of businesses.



In analyzing the commonalities and trends from these recent examples, three lessons stand out:1. Rewarding labor for corporate successWhen business is booming, executives who hold an equity stake in the company are rewarded. Workers lower on the food chain typically do not see a similar boost in their paychecks. This phenomenon is nothing new; however, many workers were hit disproportionately hard in the 2008-2009 financial crisis and again during the recession stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Now that the economy has improved in several sectors, employees are looking to recover lost gains and receive what they feel is their fair share.


Questions like this motivated the United Auto Workers (UAW), which accepted lower pay for newer workers after the Great Recession. Business results for auto companies have significantly improved, and the UAW looked to recapture lost benefits and increase wages for all levels of workers. Their members, motivated by rising inflation and leveraging their collective power, successfully navigated a significant step change in compensation and massive increases in benefits. Similarly, Hollywood writers and actors have recently struck significant deals to navigate changing business models and protect livelihoods. The question is: did it need to be this difficult?The takeaway: today's labor force is increasingly aware of how their companies are performing and has significantly more transparency into what their peers and superiors are earning. They also have more avenues to mobilize. Work diligently and proactively to understand and design systems in which business success can bring increased rewards for your workers to avoid the need for protracted negotiations.Related: 75000 Kaiser Permanente Workers Strike, Demand Better Pay2. Disenfranchised employeesWhen HBO's streaming unit rebranded to ""MAX"" in 2023, it ceased crediting writers, directors and producers individually. That hit a nerve within the guild representing each faction. Fears of AI adoption — were addressed in the ultimate resolution to the writers' strike.


The sense of disenfranchisement among workers upset with the direction of their companies or their industries wasn't unique to the labor strikes in entertainment. Although the money at stake in Hollywood might have been greater, many fields of work run the risk of intrusion from AI in a way that threatens workers' livelihoods.The takeaway: Open communication from management about changes to company policies, practices and directions is essential. Businesses must evolve to stay afloat; the more transparent management can be about that evolution, the less likely workers are to feel disenfranchised. Engage with them directly in the process to think through how shifting technology can help, what concerns exist and how to navigate it together to retain key talent and keep engagement levels high. With AI in particular, consider what skills will be required as business models evolve and how you can properly support and train workers along the way so they can leverage these new tools to help your business grow.Related: Huge UPS Strike Could Wreck U.S. Economy and Benefit Amazon3. Investors and owners can be disconnected from workers' day-to-day realityThe increase in venture capital and hedge fund investments in healthcare and print journalism — to name two — drove pushes for increased efficiency and profits. This correspondingly made a number of employees, many of whom entered these careers with altruistic or public-service-oriented mindsets, feel like their companies were becoming increasingly disconnected from their day-to-day work and, in some cases, their values/reasons for working in the field. A number either left their careers or became disillusioned, feeling they had misaligned incentives between the purpose of their jobs and the processes they were now being asked to follow.


The takeaway: The more disconnected management is from its labor force, the more it invites the potential for misaligned incentives between the two parties. Bridging the gap is necessary as industries consolidate and pushes for efficiency continue. Narrow the knowledge gap between executives in the C-suite and workers on the ground. Understand what motivates employees to do their jobs well and involve them directly in designing more effective and efficient processes - it will drive improved results, engagement, and better change management as businesses evolve.Related: How Your Business Can Be Ahead of the Curve by Looking Backward and Thinking ForwardIn summaryHow can managers anticipate sources of labor unrest before they rise to the level of concern? The following practical considerations can help achieve one or more of the objectives outlined above.Structure incentives and compensation models so everyone wins as business results improve.Keep your employees informed about where business models are shifting (e.g., streaming, AI, etc.), and proactively think through potential employee concerns and how to address them.Involve employees directly in designing more effective and efficient processes and more transparently share your goals. Listen to their concerns and find a way to improve business results, but employee engagement and alignment are a strong part of the equation.Demonstrate the value of ""walking a mile in the employee's shoes"" - have leaders spend time doing the day-to-day work better to understand their thoughts, areas of opportunity, etc.Put in place a system of regular pulse checks with the entire organization to catch issues before they become significant.

22,The 6 Traits You Need To Succeed in the AI-Accelerated Workplace,"Apr 5, 2024",Gaurav Aggarwal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-six-traits-you-need-to-succeed-in-the-ai-accelerated/471784,"
The digital workplace is changing, and more employees are equipped with AI copilots. It's like having five interns at your disposal! Is the productivity of the most skilled employees going up? One thing that you may have noticed is that ChatGPT has become the interface between two conversations. We ask ChatGPT to draft an email for us, and on the other end, ChatGPT summarises the same email in its polished language! This situation should make us realize that copilots and chatbots and a plethora of other tools are, in fact, not the pill to the problems.ChatGPT was launched in late 2022 and pushed as a complete world changer with breakthroughs happening left, right and center. Accenture reports that around 40% of all working hours could be impacted by large AI language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4. That hasn't happened at the pace promised, but certain small groups are leveraging it to its potential. The size of successful tech companies is shrinking day by day. What are the traits of people pushing this? What should you do to be better in this changing world? Here are the six traits to sharpen to be a winner in this new age!Related: AI Is Coming For Your Jobs — Anyone Who Says Otherwise Is In Denial. Here's How You Can Embrace AI to Avoid Being Left Behind.



1. CommunicationIn addition to traditional human-to-human interaction, human-to-machine interaction is critical in modern AI-accelerated work environments. Clarity and precision are crucial when communicating with AI systems.Although AI agents have proved their capabilities in planning out tasks and executing them, an employee with clarity of purpose about all the stages of the task could leverage AI systems much more efficiently and faster than those who lack clarity and rely on AI systems even for planning out the task.


Related: How to Improve Workplace Communication (and How AI Can Help)2. Critical thinkingWorld Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Survey lists critical thinking among the 15 most essential skills in demand by 2025.AI copilots can provide valuable support, but humans need to exercise critical thinking skills to interpret data, make decisions and solve complex problems effectively. For any area of study, there are various levels of understanding. The very basic is ""You don't know what you don't know,"" then comes ""You know what you don't know,"" next up is ""You have the knowledge necessary to interact,"" and the final level is ""You are the subject matter expert.""It's becoming important for employees to move from the last two levels, i.e., having a more critical and in-depth understanding of your craft. This point is essential for beginners and early employees.


3. CreativityCreativity becomes increasingly essential in a world where routine tasks are automated. Employees need to think outside the box, generate innovative ideas and find new ways to add value beyond what AI systems can provide. The current generation of LLMs are popularly known as ""Stochastic parrots,"" which means they can ""generate"" coherent language but intrinsically don't understand the meaning of the knowledge.The field's advancement rate is such that it is inevitable that models will potentially be creative. However, the interface currently with models is of interaction, and thus, the creative thinking process of people is what will set those who accomplish things apart.Related: Is AI A Risk To Creativity? The Answer Is Not So Simple4. AdaptabilityModern-day knowledge workers need to adapt to new technologies and workflows quickly. As a great horse rider becomes one with the animal, their movements are synchronized naturally. In the same sense, modern-day knowledge workers need to become one with AI assistants/bots and synchronize and adapt their style and pace of work with all the latest tools and technologies being introduced.


Different AI systems may have varying interfaces and communication protocols. Hence, modern knowledge workers need to adjust and adapt to effectively use the available tools and technologies. Employees who can quickly adapt to new workflows are great assets and highly valued, especially in the current scenario.5. The ability to break through resistanceThe people who overcome the inertia of getting things done will be the ones taking the chequered flag. This is especially important as the copilots continue to slowly eat away the redundant tasks in the jobs, leaving space for employees to focus on higher-value activities. The best thing to do is plan and take action to stay ahead of the curve.Related: How to Keep Yourself Relevant in the Age of AI 6. ResilienceResilience is the most important quality amid this mist of future job landscapes. It is the best quality an employee can have. It will equip one with the mental fortitude to embrace innovation, learn new skills, and confidently navigate unfamiliar territories. Resilience is the ideal weapon in the armory of modern knowledge workers to combat the devil of growing uncertainty.


Today, learning hard skills is increasingly easier. Modern communication tools, in sync with their mass spread, will put many people in the position of having a ""knowledge worker job."" Thus, it's extremely essential that you take note of these skills to stay ahead of the curve.

23,3 Customer Service Trends to Follow this Year,"Apr 4, 2024",Michelle Van Slyke,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-customer-service-trends-your-business-needs-to-follow/471717,"
Customer service has never been more important. Today's customers not only desire fast and seamless service but also expect a personalized and delightful customer experience (CX). To add even more to the mix, the stakes are high for businesses that don't measure up. According to a recent PwC report, one-third of customers would leave a brand they love after one bad experience.The good news is that succeeding in customer service can reap incredible benefits for businesses. In fact, 86% of customers are willing to pay more for a great CX, per the Tempkin Group. Due to these factors, customer service has become one of the top priorities for businesses in 2024. Here are three CX trends every business leader should buy into to help them excel in 2024.The evolving role of self-service technologyToday's customers expect fast, seamless and convenient service. One recent study found that half of all customers will not wait more than 3 minutes in a store. It's unrealistic to expect businesses to provide instant, in-person service all the time – that's where technology has to play a role. Gone are the days when these technologies were viewed as taboo. On the contrary, many of today's customers prefer customer service, which technology supports in some way. Per a recent study by Aspect, 73% of customers want the ability to solve product or service issues independently. Even many small businesses and franchises should invest in technologies like self-service kiosks or technology tools that support customer service efforts.



If your business hasn't invested in self-service technology for customers, 2024 might just be the year to do so. A great place to start is with self-service kiosks onsite. This is a tool that The UPS Store recently introduced, with over 1,800 self-service kiosks now installed at franchise locations across the country. These kiosks streamline online returns and item drop-offs for The UPS Store customers and offer an option to get in and out of the store faster than ever. Whether self-service works into your business plan or not, technology will be a key player in customer service in 2024.Related: 10 Reasons Why Good Customer Service Is Your Most Important Metric


Connecting with Gen-ZYou may not realize this, but Gen Z is growing up fast. The oldest members of this generation will be much closer to 30 this year than 20. With Gen Zers becoming a bigger sect of most companies' customer base, one of the biggest CX trends in 2024 will be the importance of appealing to this group. So, where should you start? One place is on social media. As the first actual digital-native generation, Gen Zers are often most comfortable interacting with companies on social media. A survey by Hubspot found that 90% of Gen Z expect brands to be active on social media, and 13% claim social media as the preferred form of customer service. If you're not on social media, 2024 is a great year to use it.This shouldn't just be reserved for large national brands; even small businesses should find ways to be active and interact with younger customers on social media. LinkedIn or Instagram are great places to start for most companies, but consider where you feel most comfortable or which platform your customers are most active on. Authenticity must be prioritized in social media customer service, especially when interacting with Gen Z. In addition to responding to customer needs, being active on social media will allow your company to build more trust with Gen Z and interact with customers more often.Related: What You Must Know About the Next Generations of ConsumersHarnessing customer insightsOne CX trend that has persisted in its importance is using customer service interactions for their insights. While customer service should prioritize the customer experience, all companies should also look for ways to learn from these interactions. This can be achieved through high-tech and low-tech means. For example, businesses can use data intelligence software to get real-time insights or social media analytics to collect information. Plenty of data intelligence vendors can offer real-time insights based on customer touchpoints. On the other hand, businesses can also tap their customer service employees for their insights following a customer interaction.


Employees often have some of the best feedback to offer since they interact daily with customers. All businesses should view their customer touchpoints as an opportunity to not only make their customers happy but also as a chance to learn and adapt for the future. In 2024, you should consider finding ways to better obtain customer insights, whether that be through investing in data analytics or looking for insights from your employees.Providing great customer service should always be a priority for business leaders, but it continues to be more important each year. As we move through 2024, be sure to keep tabs on customer service trends, especially when it comes to the importance of self-service, appealing to Gen Z and harnessing customer insights.

24,I Turned My Layoff into a Learning Lesson and Became My Own CEO — Here Are the Lessons I Learned Along the Way,"Apr 4, 2024",Randy Boldyga,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/from-a-layoff-to-ceo-lessons-i-learned-along-the-way/471653,"
In my late twenties, I worked as a government contractor at a subsidiary of Black & Decker. Without much warning, my division's contract was terminated, and I was given two choices: either work for the new employer at their proposed rate or leave the contract jobless.Rather than leaving us out in the cold, the leaders at Black & Decker showed compassion. They provided me and my colleagues with other opportunities and assigned an HR manager to help us search for positions at other locations and companies.Decades later, that experience has stayed with me. Amid industry-wide tech layoffs, I reflected on it often — particularly how I've woven the lessons learned from that difficult situation into the company I've spent the last 25 years building. Caring — not just empathy and compassion, but actually prioritizing the needs and well-being of employees — is something that I've tried to instill in my executive team and will serve you well when navigating layoffs as an employer.



Related: Poor Leadership Is Going Viral on Social Media Amid Mass LayoffsHire for fit and long-term growthMy company initially operated out of a basement as a bootstrapped start-up; now, it is an established name in the ambulatory healthcare technology landscape. Fortunately, in our 25-year history, we've never had to conduct mass layoffs. One of the ways I managed this is by hiring with a conservative and strategic approach. Here's what I mean:


Financial Prudence: We operate with a financially conservative approach, ensuring we have a buffer to weather economic downturns and support our team's development even during slow periods. This financial responsibility minimizes the risk of layoffs and shows our team we're invested in their long-term success.Don't Hire Too Quickly: We are committed to a strict policy not to expand the team unless we have the financial security to support those new hires. This approach ensures we avoid unnecessary employee turnover, which wastes valuable time and resources and deteriorates trust in our decision-making.Prioritize team Fit: We believe in finding the right fit — individuals who possess the necessary skills and align with the values, passion, and drive we bring to our work. This reduces turnover and fosters a more stable, engaged workforce that knows they can trust their colleagues and leaders to deliver.Focus on Long-Term Potential: We look beyond resumes and qualifications to assess an individual's potential for growth personally and within the company. Someone with aspirations and a desire to learn can make a far more significant impact than someone who just has the hard skills. These hires can evolve as our company does.Related: 3 Benefits of a Better Thought-Out Hiring ProcessBe an empathetic leaderWhen you care, your employees can feel and see it, and your culture will thrive because of it. Empathy is of paramount importance. The recent wave of layoffs across the technology landscape is a stark reminder of the human cost associated with financial decisions. The economic landscape will always be uncertain, but leaders who care about their employees will navigate hard decisions and challenging times by prioritizing emotional intelligence and empathy.While downsizing is difficult for many businesses, a strategic approach focused on empathy can significantly lessen the blow. Remember that empathy isn't just about grasping another's pain — it's about translating that understanding into action. It's also about recognizing the human element in everything we do.Losing the contract at Black & Decker was difficult, but it took just a little effort to help point my colleagues and me in the right direction, and that shining example has stuck with me for almost 30 years. As leaders, remember that our teams rely on us for direction and genuine support. Our team is our greatest asset, and empathy is the fuel that keeps them running at their best and can help soften the blow if a company has to navigate a downsize.


Related: 3 Prudent Hiring Practices to Acquire the Best TalentNever forget the value of your teamMy experience at Black & Decker left an indelible mark, shaping my approach to leadership and employee relationships today. While replicating their extraordinary efforts may not be universally feasible, the core message remains: empathy is a strategic advantage, not just a nicety. This lesson has become a cornerstone of my leadership philosophy, influencing every decision and interaction within the company. It taught me that leading with empathy creates an environment where employees feel valued and understood, fostering a priceless sense of belonging and commitment. Similarly, by being financially prudent, prioritizing long-term growth through strategic hiring practices and fostering a culture of trust, companies can minimize the need for layoffs altogether. This strategic blend of financial foresight, empathetic leadership and a commitment to the well-being of employees lays the groundwork for a resilient and thriving organization.This approach enhances employee loyalty and attracts top talent, who increasingly value corporate ethics and company culture when choosing a new position. Your employees are the foundation of your success — let's strive to create a business landscape where hiring for success and acts of compassion become the norm.

25,What's Blocking You From Adopting Generative AI in Your Business? It's Likely One of These Three Things,"Apr 3, 2024","Sahar Hashmi, MD-PhD",https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/whats-stopping-you-from-using-generative-ai-in-your/470921,"
Generative AI is catalyzing a significant paradigm shift in various business sectors, including coding, data science, content creation, virtual assistance, medical support, artistic innovation, media, marketing, game development, financial analysis and digital education, among others. This technology is enhancing business efficiencies broadly and transforming key industries such as healthcare, education and technology, as well as organizational workflows in numerous areas, thereby promising high returns. Consequently, generative AI is reshaping the future of work across a wide array of industries.MarketsandMarkets predicts substantial growth in the global AI industry, estimating it will reach $1,345.20 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.8% from 2023 to 2030. In alignment with these financial expectations, the Infosys Knowledge Institute has shown that ""firms that use AI well can increase enterprise profit by 38% and will help deliver $14 trillion of gross added value to corporations by 2035.""Yet, despite these promising financial forecasts, the actual deployment of AI technologies, particularly generative AI, falls short of expectations. Gartner survey results published in Harvard Business Review indicate a potential gap in AI adoption: While 70% of organizations were exploring generative AI as of March and April 2023, only 4% had fully implemented these technologies.



So why do business leaders hesitate to integrate generative AI solutions into their operations?The reasons experts have identified for the slow adoption of generative AI primarily center on high costs, data complexities and a shortage of skilled professionals, among other factors. Additionally, there is prevalent mistrust among recent startups and technology industries concerning the effectiveness of available solutions and worries about potential pitfalls.


Despite these numerous factors, here are three potential key reasons that stand out for their hesitancy to embrace AI, along with suggested strategies to address these challenges.Related: You Can Fear It and Still Use It — Why Are So Many American Workers Shy About AI?3 reasons business leaders hesitate to adopt generative AI1. Resistance to change and egoLeadership often hesitates to adopt new technologies, preferring traditional business methods. For example, surgeons at MGH only adopted the Da Vinci surgical robot after losing patients to hospitals using the technology, as they found it hard to leave established practices for new training methods. Similarly, many business leaders stick to conventional workflows, perceiving new changes like AI adoption as disruptive, resource-draining and costly. Their personal discomfort with AI may lead them to reject such innovations, claiming they are ""too busy"" to explore new technological advancements.


2. Lack of expertise in the field of AI applicationsThe problem of leadership resistance is further exacerbated by the shortage of specialized training or expertise, coupled with the challenge of retaining skilled professionals in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Despite the burgeoning enthusiasm for AI, there remains a critical need for specialized AI experts within business leadership teams. Although sourcing highly skilled individuals in the market is challenging, retaining them poses an additional hurdle, potentially leading businesses to shy away from considering AI solutions.3. The majority of generative AI solutions are still in the beta phaseWhile generative AI is transforming industries and businesses globally, most of its applications, including ChatGPT4, are still in the beta phase and continuously improving. The more these systems are used, the more data they gather to refine their responses.


However, they are not infallible; they can still experience ""hallucinations"" or produce errors, which might be detrimental depending on the context of use. Such inaccuracies or data security and privacy issues with generative AI applications can have serious implications, particularly in business settings, where they can affect clients or customers and potentially harm the business's reputation. These incidents can lead to distrust among business leaders, resulting in hesitation or outright refusal to adopt AI solutions.Related: This Is the New ChatGPT Trend That Will Enhance Your BusinessHow to thoughtfully adopt AI into your business1. Weigh the benefits and risks for business impactBusinesses that adapt swiftly to change often outperform their competitors, underscoring the importance for leadership to stay abreast of new trends using AI solutions and be ready to embrace them, even when the changes are challenging. A primary consideration is determining whether the AI trend is beneficial for the company's operations, specifically if it can enhance current processes or workflows efficiently and cost-effectively.


It's advisable to engage external expert advisors to assess the advantages and risks of new technological trends, as well as their potential impact on the business. This evaluation process might entail multiple discussions with external AI specialists, financial advisors and internal teams to reach an informed decision regarding the consideration to adopt an AI solution.2. Conduct in-depth technical evaluations of AI solutions before you choose and implement oneOnce the decision to adopt an AI solution has been made, the subsequent crucial step is to conduct an exhaustive market search for AI vendor offerings. It is vital to undertake comprehensive evaluations of AI technology solutions before adoption to minimize the risk of potential failures that could negatively impact a business.Investing in a meticulous and thorough due diligence process, which includes multiple rounds of assessment by different AI technology experts, is imperative. This method is more than a precautionary measure — it's a strategic investment that could save a business not just thousands, but potentially millions of dollars in the long run by ensuring that the selected AI solutions are well-aligned with the business's needs and are set up for successful integration.


3. Make time for ongoing specialized AI workshops and updates for leadership teamsIt is crucial for business leaders to allocate time to understand the basics of available AI business solutions in the market. A recommended approach is to organize regular lunch-hour workshops tailored toward specific AI solutions for leadership, led by AI industry experts. These workshops are an effective strategy to keep leaders engaged and informed about the latest developments in AI technology. By integrating customized learning/training into their schedules in an efficient and focused manner, leaders can stay abreast of advancements and better position their businesses to leverage AI innovations.Related: How Cutting Edge AI Tech Could Be Your Answer to Tackling StressAs we navigate the burgeoning era of generative AI solutions, which is finding its application across various business sectors, it's crucial for leadership to remain engaged and informed to avoid falling behind competitors. The dawn of this new generative AI era is upon us, escalating rapidly. To effectively leverage its advantages, business leaders need to be well-prepared and proactive, ensuring a deep understanding and strategic integration of these advanced technologies into their planning, doing so both efficiently and effectively to steer their business toward success.

      Key Takeaways    



        When I think about the most successful entrepreneurs I know, I realized they say ""no"" to many opportunities.
      


        While it feels counterintuitive, the most crucial question to ask is: ""What won't we do?"" 
      


        Gather your team and make a thorough ""Won't Do"" list. Be thoughtful about it and commit to the result. 
      












    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

""We've said no to Fortune 500 companies,"" said Tim Bergler of Percipio Group Consulting during an expert panel session with 50 entrepreneurs in the room. Bergler was sharing the one piece of advice he would give new entrepreneurs in Portland, Oregon's EO Accelerator program. ""Don't be afraid to say no if you can't nail the work for your customer,"" he continued. His answer rang a bell for me.Recognize the power of noAs I thought about the most successful entrepreneurs I know, I realized they say no to most ""opportunities."" When I reflected on my companies, I noted that our greatest successes occurred after we got really clear on what we would not do.The overarching issue is that most people say yes too much. When you start a business, you mostly think about what you will do — which is pretty much anything to grow the company. So, you say yes to everything and focus on getting more sales however you can. And while that might work in the short term while you are smaller, it doesn't work long-term, and may even keep you smaller.



That's because as a growing company, resources are finite and can easily be wasted. Saying no is critical because it empowers you to focus your limited resources — people, time, money — on the core elements that drive success best.Related: Stop Overworking Yourself Because You Say 'Yes' Too Often — Here's How to Harness the Power of a Simple 'No'


Devise your ""Won't Do"" listWhile it feels counterintuitive, the most crucial question to ask is: ""What won't we do?"" Gather your team and make a thorough ""Won't Do"" list. Be thoughtful about it and commit to the result. Watch how this exercise focuses and propels your company.Businesses with a narrow focus on delivering only what they can nail for the customer — a product or service not readily found elsewhere — are the successful ones. Think about all the businesses you love. Are they doing everything for everybody, or just one thing exceptionally well?Take the grocery business. Standard grocery stores sell an astonishing range of food items in a super-competitive segment with low profit margins. Compare that with Costco or Trader Joe's, which are high-profit and focused on what will or won't sell. They only stock value-added items that customers can't find elsewhere. The top fast-food businesses — McDonald's, Starbucks, Dunkin', Chick-fil-A and Taco Bell — all have strong ""Won't Do"" lists.A recent headline referenced ""the most important stock on planet Earth,"" which rose from obscurity to a $2 trillion valuation because of its ""Won't Do"" list. That company, Nvidia, creates technology that enables AI. Nothing else.


Related: Focusing as an Entrepreneur Is All About Choosing Opportunities WiselyThe impact of strategic omissionI failed to create a ""Won't Do"" list for my first company, a commodity business that wasn't particularly successful.The second time around, my self-storage business was way more focused. We shopped our largest competitors — Public Storage, Extra Space Storage and CubeSmart. Then, we thought deeply about what we could provide that they did not, as a way to differentiate ourselves.We made a comprehensive list detailing what we did not like about those companies. That list informed our ""Won't Do"" list, which includes:


Change our prices every dayUpsell or push extra products/servicesSave hidden costs for move-inRoute calls through a call centerAct like our customer is bothering usMandate insuranceBe a national companyPut a customer in a space that isn't right for themThat list is simple but magical. It does four remarkable things:Determines what you will do. Deciding what you don't like and won't do is a hack to identify what you will do, which is basically the opposite. Establishing a ""Won't Do"" list creates a clear, inspiring answer for what you will be to your customer.Becomes the ultimate time-saver. By eliminating what you won't do, you create space to focus on what you will do — and enhance that offering.Simplifies decision-making. Decisions are either on-brand or off-brand; the list makes it quite obvious.Clarifies your brand in a way you otherwise couldn't. When you nail what you will do, your company will be more successful and profitable. You offer something unique that is not a commodity.Your ""Won't Do"" list is an essential business tool. It doesn't only limit business scope — it can also help shape how you operate; your business practices, pricing structure and how you will treat your customers. A plumbing company might opt out of electrical work but also exclude practices such as overcharging, pushing upgrades or setting half-day-long appointment windows. Ultimately, a ""Won't Do"" list streamlines your focus and helps narrow your niche.Related: How to Say 'No' More Often: Why Every Entrepreneur Needs a 'To-Don't' ListFocus your business with boundariesBack to Bergler, who ran a management consulting company with a narrowly defined space where they could add significant value. He was as selective about the quality of people on his team as he was with the type of business they would do. The resulting quality of work put them in high demand. Eventually, incoming work opportunities exceeded capacity. He turned a lot of business away and even referred clients to competitors when he felt his company could not truly nail it.


As a result, clients started to approach Bergler first because they had so many misses with sub-par competitors. It made Bergler the preferred provider for their best clients. When he chose to sell the business, multiple buyers were confident in the company's durable income because of its 20 years of consistent performance and sky-high customer satisfaction.With our self-storage company, we enjoyed a lot of success quickly. Our differentiated brand made us a customer favorite, earning us higher marks than the big-box companies and ultimately making us a great acquisition candidate when we chose to sell.When we started a new company focusing on vehicle storage, one of the first things we did was shop our competitors and brainstorm our ""Won't Do"" list.As I think of the many businesses I know through 20 years in the Entrepreneurs' Organization, I can tell you there is a robust correlation between success and abiding by a strong ""Won't Do"" list. Do yourself a favor: Make your ""Won't Do"" list today.

27,"6 Principles for Nurturing a Healthier, Happier Workforce","Apr 2, 2024",Milind Pant,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-leaders-can-nurture-a-healthier-happier-workforce/471515,"
One of my favorite documentary series is Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zones with Dan Buettner. I enjoyed it so much, I recommended it to all my friends and colleagues. I love how it helped uncover proven formulas that have been used for centuries for cultivating longer, healthier lives, including nutrition, daily movement, a sense of purpose and strong social networks within intergenerational communities.As a CEO of a global wellness company, it got me thinking: Is it possible to apply some of the learnings from these unique health regions in a business setting?While I've not had the chance to visit a Blue Zone myself (in fact, I was disheartened to learn that many of the Blue Zones are endangered), I have been giving a lot of thought to the role of the workplace in our health. I believe we have an opportunity, as business leaders and entrepreneurs, to nurture and grow environments where team members, customers and stakeholders can benefit from focusing on healthspan: not just living longer, but living better, healthier lives. But how do we get there?Related: 8 Ways to Foster an Environment of Employee Wellbeing



Designing a business Blue Zone Blue Zones don't just have to be defined as regions — companies, online communities and local workplaces can also be places that spark healthy aging. After all, many workplaces are communities with their own cultures and rituals that can either negatively impact our health or truly boost our well-being and longevity.The benefits of a healthy workforce are well documented: better morale, higher productivity, greater employee satisfaction, increased levels of retention and loyalty, and even better performance on the stock market.Here are six principles, borrowed from Blue Zones, that can inspire health and well-being in the workplace:


1. Providing nutritious food optionsWhile many companies provide snacks or lunches as a perk for their employees, more often than not, the foods on offer consist of highly processed junk and empty calories. Studies have shown that eating at work leads to increased weight and health risks, not to mention decreased productivity.Workplaces can encourage healthy eating habits by providing healthier (and tasty) food options and by getting creative with nutrition education and food that brings people together in workplace cafés and business meetings. At our business in China, for example, thousands of colleagues start the day by sharing healthy ""morning nutrition"" juices and smoothies.2. Instilling a sense of purpose in the workResearch has shown a connection between physical health and the ability to live out one's life purpose. And work can be a huge part of our purpose if we're able to find meaning in what we do. For business leaders, integrating purpose throughout the company's strategy and culture can provide opportunities for employees to connect with what matters to them, whether that's contributing to meaningful causes, working to improve their community or designing products and services that improve people's lives. For us, that means not only helping entrepreneurs succeed — but a shared goal of helping a billion people live healthier for longer.3. Fostering intergenerational connectionsOne thing many Blue Zones have in common is the ""village"" approach to life and work. Multiple generations care for one another and work together to achieve common goals — typically in multigenerational homes. But this concept can easily be replicated at work, particularly as the labor force ages. With five generations currently in the workforce, there's value in finding ways for all ages to connect and learn from one another, marrying deep industry knowledge and experience with innovation and new ways of thinking.


Related: 9 Ways Employees Can Stay Healthy at Work4. Encouraging community building and collaborationIn an era of remote and hybrid workplaces, forging genuine connections with colleagues and customers can be a challenge. But it is possible — and highly worthwhile. At our HQ, for example, we have a new ""Treehouse"" workspace that was designed to spark greater in-person connections and inspire collaboration among employees. But I've seen incredible results happen virtually as well — health and wellness entrepreneurs have created thriving online communities that are improving healthspan, thanks to a collective approach to healthy habits.5. Providing stress management resourcesStress at work is inevitable, but American workers are the most stressed in the world, according to a recent Gallup report. And high levels of ongoing stress are literally making people sick. Finding healthy ways to manage stress is crucial for improving our healthspan, and employers can do their part by providing resources and opportunities to practice stress reduction techniques. Personally, I'm a big believer in the power of exercise and mindfulness, but there's also a lot to be said for workplace wellness programs, health benefits and encouraging work-life balance.6. Modeling health yourselfAs a business leader navigating a demanding role running a global company, I've committed to a personal health journey inspired by many of the health and wellness entrepreneurs I follow online. And in the spirit of leading by example, I've chosen to share my journey every step of the way. My goal is to inspire others to explore healthier ways of living and working too, and I hope that more business leaders will join me in doing the same. The more we showcase healthy habits, the greater the impact we can have on improving people's lives — and our businesses.


Related: Don't Underestimate The Importance of Employee Wellbeing. Your Business Will Suffer The Most.Taken together, all of these factors make for a truly holistic approach to health at work. But keep in mind that even if you can only tackle one or two of these principles, you can still have a positive impact on people's healthspan.Designing businesses inspired by Blue Zones ultimately results in stronger companies run by healthier teams. And even if we don't live to 100, at the very least we're helping people live longer, healthier and happier lives. What could be better than that?

At the heart of Philadelphia's culinary legacy stands Pat's King of Steaks, a landmark synonymous with the iconic Philly cheesesteak.Frank Olivieri, the executive chef and owner, traces the origins of this beloved sandwich to a serendipitous moment when his Uncle Pat grew weary of the daily hot dog fare and improvised with ribeye trimmings.""One day my uncle Pat got so tired of eating hot dogs he said to my grandfather, go down to the butcher and see what trimmings he has from the ribeye and bring it back, and we'll make that sandwich that we always like to make,"" Olivieri told host Shawn Walchef of Cali BBQ Media. That sandwich, cooked on the same open flat top as the hot dogs, became what we know now as the Philly cheesesteak.

29,The Truth About Being in Business With Your Spouse — How to Navigate Work and Life Together,"Apr 1, 2024",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-run-a-business-with-your-spouse-and-remain-happily/470498,"
It's a story as old as time. Two people marry. They decide to go into business together because, hey, why not? They're already each other's best friend, trust the other implicitly and presumably share the same professional goals for their future.Given how relatively common marital mergers are, much has already been written on the topic: some call it a science more than an art; some deem it magic, and many married co-owners have shared tips and tidbits about this particular life situation.So I'm not sure I'll have much new to add to the discussion. All I can say is that every married couple is different. So maybe my own personal perspective will be of interest to other romantic partners making a go of a business partnership right here, right now, at this unique point in history: in post-pandemic America at the first-quarter mark of the 21st century, in a largely WFH workplace.



Advantages and disadvantages of a spouse-run businessMy husband and I have learned a lot about balancing (more like juggling) our various roles as parents, romantic partners and business partners as we live atop a mountain together day in and day out in Upstate New York. We share five kids, a mortgage payment, too many college funds than I care to count, even more to-do and task lists, and in-laws flowing in and out of our lives like waves on the beach.Sometimes, it all gets a little overwhelming, and that's when the disadvantages of our arrangement reveal themselves, such as:


Getting on each other's last nerve because we're the only one there to annoy the otherAs a result, undeservedly taking our frustrations out on each other, again because of the proximity factorLetting ""work talk"" creep, even seep, into our after-hours discussions too much and too oftenNot having an outside, objective business partner to bounce ideas off of or counter our arguments when we need counteringNot having separate ""work families"" to hang with during the day, separate from our ""home families"" we return to when the workday is doneThe power struggle that can sometimes arise when one partner dominates a little more than the other in certain areasBoth being dependent on the same source of incomeBut mostly, we've established a nice give-and-take equilibrium that we maintain with fairness and mutual respect. On our good days, the advantages of a spousal business partnership are most apparent, including:We've totally got each other's backs — there's no one we rely on and trust more, and so there's no one to whom we'd rather entrust the fate of our business.Heightened empathy: we share our joys and sorrows together, really share them — not just commiserate with each other over the dinner table — because they happened to both of us.We equally hold responsibility for your wins and losses, which makes for a more equal partnership.It's much easier to coordinate busy schedules and endless family chores when we're splitting them up together in real-time, based on who's more available that day to take care of the home while the other is mired in work.All business finances and decisions are fully transparent and accessible to the other.Every day, all the time, we're working toward the same end goal — we do not have competing interests or priorities.We didn't just wake up one morning and get to this happy place. Over a number of years, we've had to negotiate many points of contention and iron out many wrinkles. Here's what we've come up with as ""5 Rules of the House"" that make our partnership hum and our business thrive.Rule #1: Formally schedule work timeIf you don't erect firm time boundaries, you will never truly get away from the office and into your personal relationship space. Sometimes, you can combine the two, being both a couple spending time together and business partners using that time productively. For example, at least once a week, my husband and I will schedule a 20-minute walk during which we hold hands and enjoy the outdoors, but we also agree to go over work issues.Rule #2: Work in separate spacesThis is really important — you each need your own space to talk freely, organize things the way you want them, play music or insist on silence, remain immovable at the desk for hours or pace the floor nonstop. My husband and I don't just work in separate offices; we work on separate floors! Although I realize not everyone has the square footage for two individual offices, you can devise a configuration of two distinct workstations in separate areas of your overall workspace. In my opinion, you have to. It's the best way to work together, but not in a stifling way.


Rule #3: Plan date nights and date daysYou must have couple time, not just co-partner time. I cannot stress this enough. Before my husband and I agreed to designate time on the calendar just for us, not our business at all, the business was all-consuming and overpowering, threatening to destabilize our union. We were forced to wrestle back control over our daily planners. Don't let things get to that point: set aside time to be a couple from the start.Rule #4: Accept that you will disagree, but do so in privateBecause Mom and Dad are always work partners, even at the soccer game or camping with the family, your children are bound to overhear some of your shop talk. Inevitable as that may be, you must strive mightily not to argue about work in front of the kids. They will feel the tension and sense the discord that has nothing to do with the two of you as a couple and everything to do with you as coworkers. When we need a facilitator or referee, we bring in our business manager to mediate. Do not use your children or other family members as sounding boards for your own sides of an argument.Rule #5: Divide and conquerAs mentioned above, when you're right there with each other all day, it makes it much easier to determine who's more accessible at that moment to go pick up the kids, to run this one to play practice or to pick up tomatoes for tonight's salad. My husband and I don't keep a formal tally sheet, but we have a very good sense of when one of us is picking up more of the slack, and we make a concerted effort to even things out in the long run.We don't resent the other for being able to leave the office when we're stuck on an endless conference call because they're leaving the office to take care of something for our joint life. Everyone wins when we divvy up the duties as housemates and officemates.


Running a business with the person you're closest to in the world isn't for everyone. If you need a lot of alone time, if you're more of a solo act than a team player and if the two of you just jibe better when you spend some time apart each day, I wouldn't advise it.But for couples who are comfortable with each other's work styles, who work in the same industry and bring separate but equally valuable skill sets to the enterprise, it's a wonderful option to go through life together feeling even more connected and conjoined. Not only can you navigate the challenges, but you will — because you're in it together, every single step of the way.

30,I Specialize in Exit Planning — You Need to Make These 5 Moves Before Selling Your Business,"Apr 1, 2024",Mark Kravietz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/you-need-to-make-these-5-moves-before-selling-your-business/470750,"
It's never too early to prepare your company for a sale. The business landscape is evolving rapidly, and entrepreneurs considering selling their businesses must adapt to the changing market dynamics. Strategic planning and timely decision-making can significantly impact the success of selling a business. In this article, we will explore five crucial moves business owners should make in preparation for selling their business in 2025.1. Embrace technology and digital transformationIn the digital age, technology plays a pivotal role in business operations and value proposition. As of 2022, businesses that fully embrace digital transformation are more likely to attract higher valuations when it comes time to sell. According to a study by McKinsey, companies that invest in digital capabilities experience revenue growth rates 2.5 times higher than their counterparts.To position your business for a successful sale in 2025, focus on enhancing your digital infrastructure, adopting advanced technologies and staying ahead of industry trends. Leverage data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to streamline processes, improve efficiency and demonstrate the scalability of your business to potential buyers. Most importantly, help ensure your employees are using this technology responsibly; implement an AI policy to protect your customers and employees.



Related: How Much Time Do I Need to Sell My Business? First, Consider These 7 Factors.2. Strengthen financial performanceA robust financial performance is a key driver in determining the value of a business. Prospective buyers closely scrutinize financial statements, profitability, and cash flow before making acquisition decisions. They also look for growth of earnings. I'm working with a client whose business was off significantly in 2020 and 2021 and just started to come back in 2022. There will be excellent growth from '23 to '25 and he is looking to sell by the end of '25. It was his patience, cost-cutting and streamlining of his products that turned things around. I believe he will have a successful exit.


To help maximize the value of your business, focus on improving profitability, minimizing debt and maintaining a healthy cash flow. Implement cost-cutting measures, optimize operational efficiency and diversify revenue streams. By presenting a solid financial foundation, you will increase the attractiveness of your business to potential acquirers.3. Build a strong and adaptable teamBuyers are not just acquiring a business; they are inheriting a team. Having a skilled and adaptable workforce is crucial for the long-term success of any business. According to Deloitte, organizations with strong leaders are 2.3 times more likely to financially outperform their peers.Invest in training and development programs to upskill your employees and help ensure they are equipped to navigate the evolving business landscape. Provide each employee with an annual budget for continuing education and make sure they use it! Every employee that attends a conference should present their key learnings to the company so everyone can benefit.A skilled and adaptable team adds significant value to your business, making it more appealing to potential buyers who are looking for a seamless transition.


4. Enhance customer relationships and brand equityCustomer relationships and brand equity are intangible assets that greatly influence the perceived value of a business. Additionally, a strong brand can command premium prices and create a competitive advantage.Invest in customer satisfaction initiatives, gather feedback and address any issues promptly. This is not a one-time thing, but something that must be done on a regular basis. Cultivate a positive brand image through effective marketing and public relations strategies. These initiatives take time and funds to implement, so start early and make sure to budget accordingly to keep the momentum going. By enhancing customer relationships and brand equity, you not only improve your business's market position but also make it more attractive to potential buyers who seek a reputable and customer-centric acquisition.Related: You Sold Your Business. Now What? Embracing a New Chapter with Care and Purpose5. Engage professional advisors earlyNavigating the complex process of selling a business requires knowledge and experience. Engaging professional advisors early in the process can significantly impact the outcome of the sale. In an Exit Planning Institute NY Chapter's State of Owner Readiness Survey, 78% of business owners indicated that they had a formal transition team. This shows the importance of creating a team of professionals.


Seek the assistance of financial advisors, legal professionals, merger and acquisition specialists and investment bankers. Make sure your financial advisor has experience with exit planning; the Certified Exit Planning Advisor (CEPA®) has proficiency in helping business owners sell their businesses. Their insights, negotiation skills, and market knowledge can be invaluable in maximizing the value of your business and ensuring a smooth transaction.Selling a business in 2025 requires strategic foresight and proactive measures. By embracing technology, strengthening financial performance, building a strong team, enhancing customer relationships and engaging professional advisors early, business owners can position themselves for a successful and lucrative sale. The statistics and industry insights mentioned in this article underscore the importance of these moves in the context of the evolving business landscape. As you prepare to sell your business, remember that early preparation and strategic decision-making can make all the difference in achieving a favorable outcome in the competitive market of 2025.

31,4 Ways the Labor Market Is Changing Right Now,"Mar 29, 2024",Daniel Altman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-ways-the-labor-market-is-changing-right-now/471109,"
The worker shortages of the Covid-19 pandemic may be a thing of the past, but that doesn't mean the labor market looks just like it did in 2019. Some trends have accelerated, and new ones have been set in motion. Here's what to look out for as you plan for your staffing needs.Remote work is leveling outAccording to the latest data from the Census, 30% of Americans ages 18 and older spend some time working from home. Among those aged 25 to 54 — the prime working years — the number rises to 38%. About half of these people work from home five days a week.These numbers were much higher during the pandemic, but they are largely stable now. And though the data include people who are self-employed and others who may have worked from home before the pandemic, they still represent a huge increase. In 2019, the share of Americans working from home was only around 6%.



With so many people expecting remote and hybrid working arrangements, companies will have to rely more on flexible schedules, fractional positions and job-sharing to fill their payrolls and meet their targets. Also, training workers to perform multiple roles will become more valuable, so that production can continue no matter who is in the office or on the factory floor.Related: Where Will the Economy Go Next? What to Watch For in 2024


Churn is finally slowing downIn 2020, the median tenure of American workers — the time they'd spent in their current jobs — fell to 4.1 years, the lowest number since 2008. Both of those years included recessions, where more people were losing their jobs. But the recent low persisted until 2022, thanks to people switching jobs and raising their pay in a tight labor market.All of that is changing now. In January, the share of workers quitting their jobs dropped to 2.1%, the lowest rate since 2018, after peaking at 3.0% most recently in April 2022. The hiring rate has also plunged back to 2018 levels. The sum of these rates tends to peak around 6% in a normal economic cycle, as it did in 2005 and 2019. Both employers and employees are showing more caution now.Indeed, less churn — fewer hires, fewer quits — signifies uncertainty. And despite the economy's strong fundamentals, an outsider might see a couple of causes for concern: a divisive presidential election coming up later this year and a stock market that looks overvalued by historical standards. Even with a low unemployment rate, workers are no longer as eager to move.From a corporate perspective, this is a great time to invest in existing employees. With workers less likely to leave, the returns to training are more likely to stay inside the company. It's also a good time to launch projects that require a team to work together for the long term. Increasingly, companies are even bringing in flexible workers for long-term assignments rather than one-off shifts. On the Instawork platform, where I work, the share of shift bookings for long-term assignments has doubled over the past six months.


Related: These 5 Economic Trends Will Drive Consumer Spending in 2024Pay rates are stabilizingEven though the unemployment rate has only risen half a percentage point off its lows, job openings have come down by roughly 25%. The labor market is gradually loosening up, and increases in pay are starting to ebb. These increases peaked at about 7% on an annual basis in July 2022, but now they're down around 5% — just a couple of percentage points above inflation.Wages usually rise a little faster than inflation because of workers' growing productivity. In fact, we may see unusual productivity gains in the near future as artificial intelligence spreads across the economy; the same thing happened when the internet, mobile telephony and fiber optic cabling arrived on every worker's desk. So pressure on wages could return soon, though for different reasons.With inflation roughly under control and pay increases moderating for now, forward-looking companies will be thinking about locking in their labor costs for the next few years. Companies with union labor can do this via contract negotiations, and other companies can do it by setting pay scales and planning cost-of-living adjustments.


Older people are leaving the workforce againIn November 2023, the share of people ages 55 to 64 who were working reached an all-time high of over 66%. For several decades, rising life expectancies had led people to extend their careers to stay active and fund their retirements. The trend was reversed during the pandemic, thanks to health concerns and the rising stock market, among other factors. But then higher costs stemming from inflation and interest rates drove older people back into the workforce.And now, the trend may be turning around once again. In December, this rate dropped by more than half a percentage point, the biggest decrease outside of the pandemic since 2010. With the stock market again hitting record highs, inflation coming down and interest rates poised to follow, there is less pressure on people to delay retirement (or to come back out of it).Related: The 12 Best Jobs for Retirees and SeniorsMoreover, a significant share of the older people who stay in the workforce are choosing flexible work rather than full-time jobs. The average age of Pros working shifts on the Instawork platform in February was 38.5 years, with 8.4% of the shifts being completed by Pros aged 55 or older. This percentage is back where it was five years ago, before the pandemic.


This is an important insight for recruiters. The most experienced talent in the labor market hasn't gone missing; it just has to be accessed in a different way. By offering flexible schedules and temporary positions, companies can still bring in older workers to guide and mentor their younger staff. The labor market is still pretty tight, and tapping every possible source of talent is paramount.

32,3 Ways to Nurture the Entrepreneurial Spirit in Your Children,"Mar 29, 2024",Mary Banks,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-nurture-the-entrepreneurial-spirit-in-your-children/471572,"
The entrepreneurial landscape is changing with the youth embracing entrepreneurship over traditional career paths. It's becoming clear that Gen Z and the generations to follow are drawn to the idea of being their own bosses. It's an exciting shift that gives parents the unique opportunity to nurture and support the entrepreneurial spirit in their children. After all, entrepreneurial spirits embody heightened creativity, visionary thinking and excellent problem-solving — qualities every parent hopes to instill in their child. Here's how you can cultivate entrepreneurship in your child:1. Nurture their creativityCreativity is one of the pillars of entrepreneurship. The hard part is that creativity isn't something you can force; it's something you can inspire. To do so, you must give children ample creative opportunities. These don't have to break the bank or be overly complex. It can be as simple as taking trips to the library, choosing different books each time and having discussions about them. You can talk about books' stories, characters and themes and ask your child to write alternate endings. You can also provide them with art supplies to draw, paint, or sculpt, allowing them to experiment with different materials and techniques to express themselves freely.Part of sparking their creativity is also giving children age-appropriate opportunities to problem-solve, whether it be through extracurriculars, fun escape rooms, puzzle-board games, competitions or real-life planning, such as for family trips. Ultimately, you should create an environment where creativity, experimentation and expression are welcomed and celebrated. Doing so will help them learn to think outside the box, take risks and see possibilities where others may see roadblocks.



Related: How Your Entrepreneurial Spirit Can Lead The Way in Crisis2. Normalize failureAs parents, we want to see our children succeed in everything they do. However, failure is an inevitable part of everyone's life, and shielding our children from it will only give them unrealistic expectations. Normalizing failure as an inherent part of the learning process is imperative. It's a challenging concept that we must first embrace ourselves. By encouraging children to perceive setbacks as stepping stones to success rather than obstacles, we can help them develop the tenacity to bounce back stronger and propel themselves toward any endeavor they pursue.


Related: How to Use Your Entrepreneurial Spirit to Ignite the World3. Encourage early business ventures and mentorshipYour child doesn't have to wait for a distant MBA program or ample business opportunity to dip their toes into entrepreneurship. Remember those classic lemonade stands we all started with? Well, they're more than just a childhood memory — they're proof that the entrepreneurial spirit runs deep in us, even as kids. Take my son, for instance. When he found out we had no more space for his toys, he took matters into his own hands. He set up a makeshift shop near our apartment in New York City, laid out his toys on a blanket, and sold one to a passerby!So, we must shift away from the idea that entrepreneurship is only for adults with fancy degrees or massive investments. It all starts with those little bouts of creativity and ideas that turn into action. Encouraging our kids to be independent thinkers, make decisions independently and take on small passion projects can go a long way.

33,5 Leadership Misconceptions That Hinder Success,"Mar 26, 2024",Sam Reese,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/leadership-misconceptions-that-hinder-your-success/471449,"
Leadership is a muscle that requires consistent training and development. While some people may find they fall into leadership roles more naturally, no one is born ready to be a CEO.In fact, many misconceptions about leadership exist, and the reality of what it means to actually lead is often far from what new CEOs expect when they first take on the role.Over the course of my career, I have frequently heard some of the following common misconceptions about leadership. But with the wisdom that comes from experience, I've also seen great CEOs learn how to reframe their thinking and carve out their own leadership principles on their unique paths to becoming better leaders.



Related: 10 Popular Myths About Leadership and How to Overcome ThemMisconception 1: Leaders can't make mistakesA common misconception is that leaders must be infallible, with an innate ability to make flawless decisions. This assumption often leads to the notion that leaders must project unwavering strength. In reality, effective leadership is more nuanced. Top leaders recognize the strength in vulnerability and acknowledge that making well-informed decisions is a continuous learning process. Creating an environment where everyone can learn from mistakes and failures allows leaders to connect authentically with their teams and cultivate a sense of trust and openness.


When I first became a CEO, I made the mistake of isolating myself from my team, thinking I needed to have all the answers. But that couldn't have been further from the truth. At some point, every leader is going to make a decision that didn't quite turn out as planned. Great leaders show that they are resilient, adaptable and open to change amid new information. When an organization is operating at its best, it's well understood that everyone is learning and improving together.Misconception 2: Leadership is about giving ordersThere is a misconception that a leader's role is to dictate orders, perpetuating a command-and-control mentality. Leadership requires action, and leaders are the ultimate decision-makers in a company. However, command-and-control leadership stifles creativity and discourages open communication. Great leaders establish an inclusive working environment where collaboration flourishes, innovative ideas are shared freely, and team members are empowered to contribute their expertise — even if it means challenging preconceived notions.A leader's role is not just to give orders but to inspire, guide and facilitate the success of the team. By delegating and relinquishing the need for absolute control, leaders can tap into the diverse skills and perspectives within their teams. Great leadership isn't just about top-down communication of the strategy. It is also about listening to your team and creating space for them to share ideas, challenge thinking and honestly discuss problems.Misconception 3: There is one best leadership methodologyThere is no single ""best way"" to lead. Many great leaders and coaches have completely different leadership styles. Some people think that all great leaders have to be extroverted. However, introverted leaders often excel by leveraging their listening skills to engage in thoughtful decision-making. Similarly, I've heard from many CEOs who have quickly realized the downsides of hiring a team of executives who think exactly like they do.


But there are two characteristics that most great leaders do have in common: emotional intelligence and empathy. Regardless of leadership style, they show their team that they really care about them as individuals. This empathetic approach builds trust, enhances communication and creates a positive environment.Related: 3 Ways Increasing Your Empathy Makes You a More Effective LeaderMisconception 4: Leaders should only share good newsSome leaders think they need to insulate their employees from bad news so the team doesn't get deflated by business challenges. But when leaders shut off communication, the team ends up making up their own stories to fill in the gaps, and the leader ends up isolated. As Jim Collins says, ""Face the brutal facts."" Great leaders respect their team, win their hearts and minds when they are transparent and see them as partners in overcoming challenges. Transparent communication also creates shared accountability.Misconception 5: Leadership is solitaryWhile it may seem isolating at the top, leadership is not a solo pursuit. Great leaders intentionally select a diverse team of executives who think differently from them. They also consistently seek out CEO peers facing similar challenges. Every leader has their biases based on their past decisions and life experiences. Hearing other perspectives helps leaders to separate the facts from their personal stories or opinions about what is really going on. This opens the channels for constructive feedback and course correction.


Spending time with other leaders who are outside your company creates room for honest conversations about strengths, weaknesses and struggles. These types of candid exchanges reveal a crucial universal truth — no leader has everything figured out. Embracing this reality not only strengthens leadership skills but also builds a supportive community where shared insights propel growth.Moving beyond these leadership misconceptions is a critical milestone for personal and organizational success. Embracing vulnerability, communicating transparently and encouraging collaboration, while rejecting a command-and-control mentality, are key to becoming a more effective leader. Great leaders know leadership is not a destination; it is a unique and dynamic journey, requiring a lifetime commitment to continuous growth, adaptability and learning.Related: Don't Believe These 5 Leadership Myths That Undermine Your Confidence

34,Empower Your Customers and Exceed Expectations With These 3 Customer Service Strategies,"Mar 26, 2024",Cheri Beranek,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-ways-to-exceed-expectations-in-customer-service/471321,"
Giving people what they want drives the bottom line. Statistics consistently show that consumers are more likely to buy, purchase again or recommend a company to a friend based on the quality of their customer service. Until recently, competitive businesses knew the equation to meet those expectations and stay ahead: Listen well enough to understand what customers wanted and provide it, but one step better.Today, customer needs have changed. In a 2023 Salesforce survey of 14,300 global consumers and business buyers, 80% said the buying experience is now just as important as the products or services a company offers. Seventy-three percent expect greater personalization alongside advancing technology. Competitive companies now need to ""win hearts and wallets"" by proving their ability to consider the customers' best interests.This year, rather than New Year's resolutions, our company made reaffirmations to the core institutional practices that have driven its success, including efforts to exceed customer expectations. Knowing those expectations have fundamentally changed and may continue to do so, here are our three main customer service strategies:



Related: 5 Reasons Setting Customer Expectations Goes a Long Way1. What they want, and…In the past, our approach to exceeding our customers' service expectations was simple: focus on product and network training so we could provide the best quote and turnaround with the least amount of lead time. Now, our customers still want quality, price and lead time, but to provide that one step better, we need to help them navigate new purchasing problems and find new ways to make them happy.


Our post-pandemic path of high demand and supply chain challenges has left many industries in a position of over-inventory. As a fiber-optics connectivity supplier, exceeding our customers' expectations has meant helping them make better decisions with what they have and, in the face of rising inflation and interest rates, more cost-effectively.To do this, we take the word ""no"" out of our vocabulary. Saying ""no"" to a customer request would not exceed their expectations. Instead, we find a way to give them a ""Yes, and…."" If a customer comes asking, ""Can you take my inventory back?"" on a non-returnable item, I can say, ""Yes, I understand your inventory challenge, and I can reach out to some customers who might need what you have to help resolve it."" If they want a specific product unavailable at our company, I can say, ""Yes, we have an equivalent product, and I think it could fulfill your requirements equally or better.""Never lie if something is not possible. Rather, empower people to offer ""Yes, and…"" honestly. The truth opens the door for a future opportunity to work together, but getting caught in a lie can keep someone from ever returning for more business. Empower individual contributors with a clear understanding of what is possible and alternative options so they can apply their ""Yes, and…"" response most effectively.Related: How to Keep Up With Customer Expectations


2. ListenSometimes, to arrive at a successful ""Yes, and…,"" we need to listen. Suppose a customer wants ten items delivered within eight days, and I know we can only turn around an item per day. In that case, asking for more information might help me respond with a suitable ""Yes, and…"" Customers are not always aware of what they truly need when it comes to technology components, and listening to how they intend to use the products might empower me to say, ""Yes, I can get you eight of the items you need in eight days, and still achieve the same solution.""The best customer service salespeople talk only 30% of the time because the other 70%, they spend listening. Listening to customers keeps them sticky. When a significant potential customer came to us looking for a new fiber optic cabinet supplier, we listened and heard them describing a desire to do more with fewer resources. So, we conducted field studies to assure them that our cabinets could allow twice as many connections. We also provided free field training so they could conduct the study and see the results for themselves. That customer stuck with us even after they passed through their economic difficulties because, by listening, we were able to go above and beyond what they needed.Related: 8 Ways Customer Service Affects Your Business's Bottom Line3. Reset and alignExceeding customer expectations is an opportunity to reset — a reintroduction to your customers and their needs. We were previously focused on drawing the early majority in the technology product adopter lifecycle: more adept and in need of constant change. Now, our biggest customers are in the late majority, who are less confident, require more support, and are more convinced by lower prices. Our job is to strike the right balance.


So, to replace the requirement of having a sales engineer present the first time installing a product, we invested in building a technology platform. Using the same application that could explain how to assemble a newly purchased grill, customers can now learn our technology in bite-sized chunks over their phones. Exceeding the expectations of the late majority meant providing more accessible support and requiring less effort.After a reset, we need to break down silos to ensure organizational alignment. Nearly eight out of ten of Salesforce's 2023 survey respondents said they expected consistent service interactions across a company, but more than half felt like they were communicating with isolated departments. Under pressure to make a sale, a product manager might offer to meet a price that undermines gross margins, while among leadership, we find that greater customer awareness of market prices tends to diminish such expectations. Especially after a customer reset, breaking down silos ensures alignment around best practices when meeting customer needs. The pandemic allowed me some time to work on my business, but now, we need to work in it. Our leadership teams are getting more hands-on, and we are working to empower our people to say, ""I'll get right back to you."" Whenever they find themselves without a ""Yes, and…,"" they can turn to their manager or leader for more insight. Our examples and experiences help team members navigate their customer challenges and discover new ways to exceed expectations.

35,Good Manager vs. Good Leader — Which One Are You?,"Mar 26, 2024",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/good-manager-or-good-leader-which-one-are-you/470499,"
Part of running a business is learning what makes you run. Some business owners are focused on productivity, profits or personnel. Some prioritize operations, company branding or organizational morale. It takes all kinds of bosses to make things happen, but knowing what kind of boss you are is vital to shaping and growing your company.Over the years — through much trial and error, being open to input on my management style and lots of self-reflection — I've discovered that I'm more of a good ""leader"" than a good ""manager."" My strengths include creativity, problem-solving, team-building and a growth mindset; my weaknesses include time management, data organization, workflow processes and setting boundaries.This isn't to say that there's a hard demarcation between ""management"" and ""leadership,"" that skilled managers and skilled leaders don't share many of the same assets. Of course they do, like sharp analytical skills, a focus on team performance, resiliency and deft delivery of constructive feedback. It's just that, by and large, most people lean to one side or the other, and if they try to push themselves too far in a direction that doesn't come naturally to them, they could lose their balance or even topple over.



That's why it's worth examining where you excel, so you can leverage those areas, and where you don't, so you can devise a plan to mitigate your deficits.1. Good managers organize and engineer, good leaders empower and inspireThis is probably the clearest distinction I've observed in my years of running my own PR firm. Noteworthy managers are the ones that drive the engine — they devise, design, set in place and enact. Their job fulfillment comes from a job well done, and they're respected for their follow-through. On the other hand, an adept leader is often far more concerned with — intrigued by, actually — learning what makes their team members tick so they can motivate and empower them to become their best selves and achieve their highest purpose.


I asked a colleague of mine what he considered his greatest attribute as a leader: ""My favorite thing about my role is inspiring my people to discover their potentialities and nurture their aspirations. Even if they leave because of it, it utterly delights me to help ignite that spark in them.""Related: You Need to be a Good Manager and a Great Leader2. Good managers meet deadlines, good leaders meet needsIt's all good to cheerlead a squad, but things must get done, right? And on time! Accomplished managers are pros at keeping things on point and on track so that deliverables are delivered and clients are properly serviced. However, those with more of a leadership bent tend to base their actions on supplying what their people need to get the job done. By routinely inquiring about individuals' wants and needs — an ergonomic chair, words of affirmation, early departure on Tuesdays for physical therapy — the team leader enables the team manager to manage most effectively.3. Good managers have tenacity, good leaders have charismaA good manager will stay on the job until it is complete. They are thorough, resolved, steadfast in their goal-attainment and resourceful in their tactics. They take supervision very seriously, and oversight is their jam. Leaders rely more on instinct and insight, more in tune with the overview of any atmosphere they enter. They know how to read people and, therefore, how to talk to them and reach them. This isn't an act — a talented leader doesn't practice being charming and relatable; they just have a gift for appealing to human sensibilities, and so others follow them.


Related: The 5 Characteristics That Make a Charismatic Leader4. Good managers earn praise, good leaders earn loyaltyWhere would we all be without that key person who manages so much of our daily operations? Personally, I know my schedule would be a mess, my client files would be unorganized and my content calendar would be akimbo. But I've never met a really proficient manager yet who doesn't thrive on recognition of that proficiency. To earn loyalty, be generous with your praise and effusive with acknowledgment of what should be acknowledged. When a manager is told they're doing a stellar job, the light reflects onto their own team and everyone and everything shines brighter.5. Good managers excel with workflow, good leaders excel with peopleA manager with discernment knows how to set the agenda: what to do, in what order, by which staff members. Because of this, things flow smoothly, employees are clear on expectations and workarounds are put in place for the occasional procedural blockage that arises. However, those who pursue leadership over logistics set the tone of a workplace. They do so with a skill set that includes active listening, coaching, accountability and empathy — qualities that make staffers feel seen, heard and valued.Related: 5 Traits You Must Have to Create More Leaders


6. Good managers build cooperation, good leaders build cultureManagement-minded bosses sit at the desk and role-model how to do the job correctly. They're so good at training, instructing and directing their staff because they've gone through all the paces themselves and have risen to their current position based on their know-how. As a result, they can generate connections and foster collaboration among all the various working parts of a chain. In this way, they breed team unity.Leadership-minded bosses walk the floor on the lookout for what the organizational environment needs to stay healthy, sound, humming and vibrant. Employee retention, employee satisfaction, job immersion and group inclusivity are top of mind, bolstering employees' self-confidence and expanding their comfortability at their chosen place of work. In being the culture-maker and culture-bearer, they breed team unity.Closing thoughtsMuch more could be said about management vs. leadership acumen — how the one produces output while the other begets other leaders; how natural-born leaders master decision making whereas natural-born managers master decision implementation — but the point is that both have a vital role to play in the evolution of a thriving business.In my opinion, a great manager does not need to be a great leader; they just need to know how to make things happen in given areas. Likewise, a talented leader doesn't need to be particularly skilled in given areas, like coding or packaging or financial forecasting; they just have to have the foresight to fill those positions with people who are particularly skilled and the self-awareness to delegate whatever they don't specialize in themselves.


A peer of mine is a superb manager. But she's not really interested in uplifting her staff, in mentoring or molding them into superstars. She's a ""live and let live"" person with an ""I'll do me and you do you"" attitude, and she just doesn't think it's her place to guide employees down a specific path or light their way for them. Her thinking is, ""If they want a light to follow, they'll find one of their own choosing. If they want to lead a team themselves someday, they're more than capable of making their way there.""Who's to say who's the better boss? Me with my outreach approach or her with her outcomes approach? Ideally, the boss would be a combination of both, but finding both sides of the coin in the same person is rare. So my advice is to polish the most authentic side of you … and trust that your innate talents will rub off on the other side as well!

36,Want Success? Invest in Your Biggest Enemy,"Mar 26, 2024",Jon Michail,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/want-people-to-follow-you-invest-in-yourself/471357,"
When most people think, talk or try to research investment, they often focus on opportunities in areas like real estate and stocks. For many people, investment is all about financial gains. Of course, pursuing and building an investment portfolio that would yield financial gains is a commendable feat. Yet, an investment that is equally as important, if not more, is self-investment.Self-investment is hard because one can often be their own worst enemy, as they are intimately aware of their weaknesses and insecurities, which can lead to self-doubt and self-sabotage. Their inner critic often amplifies their fears and magnifies their failures, hindering their progress and potential for growth.According to Warren Buffet, one of the most successful and wealthiest men in the world, ""The best investment you can make is an investment in yourself… The more you learn, the more you'll earn."" This statement is not cliché; it is straightforward and practical, but people still often overlook the importance of self-investment.



Whether you want to earn the highest figures, reach the peak of your professional career or become a better person overall, investing in yourself is non-negotiable. It's that sort of investment that yields a substantial gain every time.Now that we're in a constantly and rapidly evolving era, self-investment — an investment in personal development and self-growth, is the best insurance policy for these challenging times. Here are some instances of how self-investment can set you up to nurture growth, personal fulfillment and career success.


Enhancing personal growth and developmentIt's impossible to talk about self-investment without its impact on personal growth and development. Self-investment involves using available resources to improve your overall well-being. This goes beyond formal education; self-investment sets one on a path of continuous learning and development by pursuing passions, curiosity and innate skills. Apart from the apparent rewards, those who remain dedicated cultivate adaptability and resilience — the ability to be flexible, composed and decisive in crucial times. These traits are essential for anyone who will successfully navigate today's competition and uncertainty.By investing in their personal growth and development, individuals become self-aware and authentic to their true selves. This sets the foundation for a purposeful and successful life.Related: Want to Succeed? Learn to Say 'No'Promoting mental and physical well-beingMost people are not proactive, paying little to no attention to their mental and physical well-being in pursuing success until a problem arises, and then they react. People often believe their physical and psychological well-being must suffer if they're to attain success until a problem arises. This couldn't be farther from the truth; to give yourself the best chance of achieving your goals, your mental and physical well-being has to be in the best conditions possible. By investing in your mental and physical well-being, you get to


Sustain your energy and productivity for longer periods due to improved fitness levels.Cultivate the habit of remaining focused and peaceful because you know how to manage stress.Operate at your optimal level and give your best effort daily because you're well-rested.By investing in a sound mind and body, you strengthen your cognitive and problem-solving skills, thereby increasing your chances of excelling in your ambitions.Facilitating financial excellenceWhile it's true that the reward for most investments is money, self-investment promises more than just financial gains. Self-investment helps nurture a healthy relationship with the pursuit of money. You can create feasible financial goals because you understand the importance of savings and planning. The result is that it almost looks like you earn more than you do because you still have enough to pursue your goals and aspirations. By investing in yourself, you equip yourself with the basics and foundational knowledge necessary to live the life you aspire for.Advancing your careerGlobal incidents in the last couple of years, like the pandemic, have emphasized that the modern workplace is dynamic. You can't afford to stay stagnant. However, when you consciously invest in yourself, you plug yourself into lifelong learning and the perfection of your strengths. By so doing, even when there are disruptions, you're well equipped not just to cope and stay relevant but also to use such disruptions to further advance your career.Also, proper self-investment allows you to refine your skill set continuously, thus giving you the right to establish yourself as a thought leader in your industry.


Related: Why You Need to Invest in Your Happiness (and How to Do It)Improving social and emotional intelligenceThe success and meaning of every relationship, whether personal or business, are determined by those involved's social and emotional intelligence. By investing in yourself, you develop the ability to communicate effectively. Improved emotional intelligence means not only knowing what to say and when to inspire those around you, but you're also able to gracefully manage and resolve conflicts, thereby making you a professional and distinguished leader. This modern day is characterized by diversity, so interpersonal skills, empathy and emotional regulation are needed to navigate social complexities with grace successfully.Building legacy and impactThe final reason we're going to discuss self-investment is the subsequent impact such a person can have in the community. By striving to become the best possible version of ourselves, we spread our impact and influence across our immediate environment. This impact can come from providing resources, mentorship or philanthropy to drive progress and build a legacy in society. To put this in simple terms, the better we become as individuals, the better our contributions and services to society will be.Related: 4 Ways to Begin Investing in Yourself


ConclusionIt's worth remembering that the best investment anyone can make is to invest in themselves. This is particularly important in our present-day society, where material success and external validation are primarily the order of the day. An investment in core values like self-development and purpose-driven growth will set anyone apart. Not only does self-investment set you apart, but you also give yourself a better advantage in achieving all your goals while living a prosperous and fulfilling life.In navigating the challenges of our modern society, we should always remember that our greatest investment lies in treasures within. When leaders and entrepreneurs embrace and practice this reality, they realize their 'value' possibilities in new and inspiring ways.

38,You Might Spend Unnecessary Money If You Don't Stay on Top of Your Expenses. Here's How to Manage Them.,"Mar 25, 2024",Jim Conroy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/dont-waste-money-on-unnecessary-spending-heres-how/470466,"
Whether you went into your business with open eyes or have been kicking and screaming about the parts you don't like, expense management is essential to keeping the lights on and creditors (and the tax man) away.Failing to manage your expenses could leave you continually spending on unneeded subscriptions that automatically renew. You could wind up short of funds at the end of the month and have to carry a credit card balance at a large interest rate. Or you could wind up with a tax debt you can't pay and the IRS knocking at your door.Reconciling your expenses is at the heart of managing them. Reconciling simply means comparing two things to make sure they match. For instance, comparing the receipt for the computer you bought and the credit card statement for the card you used in the transaction. Or your credit card statement and the bank statement for the account you used to pay off the card balance. When you do this, you have a sense of what's going on with your cash flow.



Avoid the bad. You can spot things that can really hurt you, such as fraud or identity theft, or catch small math errors before they become bad ones. Invoices are less likely to be lost. You're less likely to wind up paying late fees. You'll reimburse employees before they're hurt financially or harbor a grudge against you. You're less likely to find yourself facing an unexpected expense. And, since one of your key expenses is paying your estimated taxes to the IRS, you reduce your chance of penalties for underpayment or late payment of those estimated taxes.Embrace the good. With up-to-date and accurate expense records, you can make better decisions about a range of issues — everything from hiring to new products to taking time off. You may even discover money you didn't think you had, meaning you can pay down debt or set aside funds for future business growth. If you're going to borrow for growth or to cover expenses for your slow season, well-kept expense records will smooth the process.


Related: Don't File and Forget: Use Your Receipts to Gain Insight on Business SpendingEmbrace these five strategies to go from ""survive"" to ""thrive""Commanding expenses is especially important for a small business. Imagine a bakery that doesn't know what it spends on flour or a freelance web designer with more professional memberships than time to use them. Expense management is more challenging for a small business; they typically have a small staff, which means that everyone is stretched. Distractions are greater and space — real and cyber — can be limited, making it easier to lose things.These five expense management strategies will keep you on track and move you from struggling to overcoming:1. Budgeting


Budgeting is central to expense management. Budgeting sets guardrails for how your business should run. By comparing (reconciling) your spending goals for important categories against what you actually spend, you stay up-to-date on the financial state of your business. These will differ based on your business but will include things like rent, supplies, employee expenses and utilities. Compare your spending to your budgeted amounts for a specific period (say monthly or quarterly).The simplest way to do this is to list your budget items on the left side of a notebook page or spreadsheet, and then enter the actual expenses to the right. Add a third column showing the difference between your budget and your actual expense from your cash receipts, credit card statements and checking statements. Prioritize which categories are most important. Those that are essential — such as coffee and sugar for a coffee shop — will need more attention than those that are simply nice to have, like a television for customers.2. Identify cost centersExpenses may be important because they're big (say, rent) or because they're critical to performing your work (for instance, your internet bill for a programmer or a web developer). Marketing could be important because while it creates customers, it's easy to fly out of control if your strategy includes pay-per-click or pay-per-impression internet advertising. Cost centers can indicate a spending problem when there's too big of a variance from the usual expenditure, or they can indicate that your business is either growing or starting to decline. By tracking your spending and its return on investment (ROI), you can identify products or processes that aren't paying off internally. If your marketing ROI is too low, you may elect to back the trend to self-serve buyers and drive your sales through online experiences, using fewer sales reps.


3. OutsourcingAdministrative tasks you pay someone for may be better outsourced online. These could include payroll, data entry, bookkeeping, web design, marketing, call centers and even human relations (HR). Or you can try to handle them yourself with software-as-a-service (SaaS) vendors. Start with your biggest expense, but anything that improves profitability should be looked at.4. Establish office proceduresWhen you've determined your course of action, you need to routinize it. If you're a sole proprietor, write down what you need to do, then do it. It may even help to pretend you're reporting to someone else (even if you went into business to be your own boss). Consider ""accountability partners"" who keep you on task. If you have employees, document your procedures. Include when they're to be done — for instance, Tuesday is payroll day and Thursday is inventory day. Include who does it and detail all of the steps.

Audit what you do and revise any of the above procedures if they don't work or in the event of change. Whether through growth, lost business or outright disaster, things will change. These will affect all of the above and require new budgets, cost-center decisions, outsourcing needs, office procedures and technologies.

39,5 Delegation Strategies To Help You Flourish With Less Stress,"Mar 25, 2024",Jessica Fisher,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-delegate-as-a-business-owner/471260,"
One of the hardest parts about owning a business is getting it off the ground and establishing it. However, once you make it a success, the responsibilities increase, and you have to let others take control of certain tasks to maintain the business' momentum.Delegation can seem terrifying to a business owner. Taking someone into your company and trusting them to do a job is a big leap for someone who's been handling every aspect of the business from day one. Fortunately, there are strategies you can implement to maintain smooth operations while letting go of control.Related: Want to Succeed? Learn to Say 'No'



1. Find someone who excels at the task at handIt's crucial to find the right person for the job. When looking at resumes, pay attention to employment histories with similar duties to those you seek. During interviews, ask questions regarding their past responsibilities and follow up on their responses by asking them to elaborate on how their skill set would translate to the type of work you need them to do.If you're stuck between two or more candidates, closely consider those who have experience that aligns with your field. Prioritizing skill over availability is always a smart move, especially when the work you require is specialized or imperative. The ideal person is likely to complete their duties more efficiently than someone who is less suited for it but more available.


2. Maintain a watchful but trusting eye on their responsibilitiesWhen a team is small, it's especially vital to stay aware of everyone's duties and daily work. While you must delegate tasks and loosen up control on certain aspects of the business, you also need to be in the loop, as errors and overlooked responsibilities can have a detrimental impact if you don't pay attention.For a business that includes sales or frequent client interactions, one way to stay on top of events is to have your staff BCC you on every email they send. This way, you are still trusting that they can complete their tasks, but you can also look over things should any questions arise and quickly jump in on any conversations.Reduce mishaps by having your team utilize email templates when writing people outside of the organization. A business that involves continual back-and-forth with others often follows similar patterns of conversation. Identify those themes and copy the proper responses into a shared document that workers can reference when they're responding to someone. Google Drive is an excellent tool for this type of collaborative work.Related: 10 Simple Ways to Build a Collaborative, Successful Work Environment


3. Recognize their skill and adapt accordinglyEven if someone seems like a good fit, they may struggle at first to learn their responsibilities and how best to complete them. If the company is smaller, their job may have a larger scope, with many small but cumulative elements that require time to master. When a team member seems ambitious and reliable but slower in the first few days, offer more guidance and support. Thorough training of an individual with talent pays off.If they seem to be still struggling with specific tasks later on, it can be helpful to eliminate those from their job duties and have them focus on what they are good at. Hand those tasks to someone else on the team or hire another person who is comfortable doing them. When outsourcing is not an option, resetting your expectations may be beneficial. The job might be done differently than you would do it, but it is still getting done.Related: 5 Invaluable Soft Skills to Seek in Your Next Hire4. Set clear expectations and define successTo do their jobs well, workers need to know what exactly you need from them. As workers settle into their position, help them understand what is important to you as their superior and what you expect to see from them. Outline specific goals, such as 'we want to increase sales by 25% this year' rather than 'we want to increase sales this year.' Providing tangible measures of success will enable them to create a plan to reach those benchmarks.


Timelines are also useful, preventing staff from spending too much time on one task or not enough time on another. Each project or assignment should have an expected due date, helping to establish priorities.Provide workers with resources for support so they know who or what to turn to in case anything goes awry. Examples include going to their manager for advice, looking at company email templates or giving them access to specific company information so they can problem-solve on their own.5. Keep an open line of communicationFor staff to effectively take charge of a task, they need to be able to speak with you or a manager without difficulty. Similarly, you need to be able to come to them when you have questions about any of their responsibilities.There is no shortage of ways teams can stay in contact. Google Chat is especially useful for businesses using Gmail as their company email. Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zoom and Discord are other chat apps popular with businesses of all sizes. Try to only utilize the chat feature for quick questions, and always hop on a video or phone call for clarity. Typed words tend to get lost in translation and can seem ambiguous.


Regardless of the method you choose, workers need to know they can always approach you for advice, information or general dialogue. A company's success is synonymous with its ability to communicate effectively.Mastering the art of delegation is a transformative chapter in a business owner's life. When you can confidently pass on responsibilities to a competent employee, you can establish a healthy work-life balance and focus on what you do best: growing the company. By choosing skilled, reliable workers, adapting to their abilities, setting clear goals, and fostering communication, you lay the foundation for a thriving business environment.

40,How To Embed Your Client Needs into Your Business DNA,"Mar 25, 2024",Rim Elijah,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-embed-customer-centricity-into-your-business/470963,"
Today, the evolving dynamics of the B2B landscape demand more than just service enhancements to achieve true client orientation. It requires a foundational shift in strategy, embedding a deep understanding of client needs into every facet of the business.In this piece, I talk about how strategic client orientation extends beyond the introduction of new features and suggest a comprehensive approach that integrates client feedback into the very fabric of your business operations.Understanding client orientation as a strategic approachClient orientation in the B2B sector transcends the mere addition of novel services or features. It embodies a strategic foundation integral to a company's success. This strategic approach involves a deep understanding of your client's needs, preferences and challenges, ensuring that every aspect of the business operation, from product development to marketing, aligns with delivering exceptional value to your target audience. I see it as embedding client-centric thinking into the company's DNA, where every decision is made with the client's best interest at heart.



While things like proactive customer support or live webinars might initially appear as client-oriented innovations, true client orientation requires a holistic strategy that considers every touchpoint in the client's journey, ensuring that their experiences are not just satisfactory but exceed expectations.Related: How Pivoting Saved My Business When Things Didn't Go According to Plan


Integrating client feedback into business strategyThe essence of a client-oriented strategy lies in the systematic integration of client feedback into all areas of business operations. This process begins with the collection and analysis of feedback across various channels, turning these insights into actionable strategies that directly address client concerns and desires.Regular strategic reviews also serve as checkpoints to assess how well the company's offerings align with client expectations and market demands. These reviews ensure that client feedback isn't just heard but is a driving force behind strategic decisions, leading to continuous improvement and adaptation.For instance, the feedback from the attendees of EOSDA webinars helped us recognize the need for deeper client engagement and the implementation of more personalized, value-driven offerings in our space/agriculture industry. This decision exemplified how strategic client orientation evolves based on comprehensive feedback analysis in our team.Related: The Role of PR in the Changing B2B Landscape


Aligning departments towards a unified client-centric visionAchieving a truly client-oriented company requires the alignment of all departments toward a shared vision of putting the client first. This alignment ensures that every team works cohesively to enhance client satisfaction and loyalty from product development to sales, marketing, and customer support.A pivotal step in this process is establishing clear communication channels and collaborative platforms where insights about client needs and feedback are shared and discussed openly. Such an environment fosters innovation and ensures client-centric strategies are consistently applied across all touchpoints. By doing so, each department contributes to a unified client experience that is seamless, personalized, and, above all, oriented toward exceeding client expectations.The transition to this aligned approach signifies a company-wide commitment to understanding and truly meeting the clients' needs, marking a significant shift from isolated efforts to a holistic strategy.Practical implementation of a client-centric strategyMoving beyond foundational theories, strategic frameworks, and established collaboration platforms, our actionable approach to client orientation is manifested through the deliberate modification of internal processes, product development, and communication methods to better align with client needs. Such changes demonstrate our commitment to transforming client feedback into tangible improvements that enhance the client experience.


As an outcome, the development and adaptation of our product offerings are now directly informed by client interactions, ensuring that new features and services are not only innovative, but also directly responsive to identified client needs.By actively implementing strategies that reflect our dedication to meeting and exceeding client expectations, we are now able to foster stronger client relationships and position ourselves as a responsive and evolving leader in our industry.Related: Why B2B Companies Can't Ignore the 5th P of Marketing — PaymentsBottom lineStrategic client orientation is the cornerstone of a successful B2B company. It surpasses traditional service enhancements to foster a deep-seated commitment to understanding and addressing client needs. The journey from continuous feedback collection and analysis to pivoting to more personalized client solutions reveals the transformative power of adopting a client-centric approach to each of our team members.


By ensuring that client feedback informs strategic decisions and that all departments are aligned in their commitment to client satisfaction, you can enhance client relationships and solidify your competitive advantage in the market.My ultimate takeaway is clear: a strategic, holistic approach to client orientation is essential for businesses aiming to thrive in today's dynamic market environment.

41,How This Family-Run Company Has Thrived for Five Generations,"Mar 25, 2024",William Salvi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-al-capone-inspired-the-launch-of-a-95-year-old/471438,"
Creating our show The CEO Series has allowed me to sit down with some of the most innovative and inspiring business leaders in the world to get their insights on what it takes to launch, grow and sustain a meaningful business.This episode took us to Ozinga, the concrete and building material powerhouse. They're based in Chicago and if you're in the area, you're surely familiar with their iconic red and white trucks. They have approximately 2,500 employees and I got to have an amazing chat with the guy who oversees it all, Marty Ozinga, the fourth-generation CEO of this 95-year-old company.Below are some highlights of that conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity. Watch the full video above.



His approach to leadership""It's not the people are working for you, they're working with you. That's the way I was mentored and taught. We all need each other. We all have different roles and responsibilities, but we're working with each other.""Related: Why Notre Dame's Football Coach Tells His Team to ""Choose Hard""


Ozinga's 95-year history""Our family came from the Netherlands in 1893, the year of the World's Fair here in Chicago. The family was always in the delivery business. Then in 1928, my great-grandfather was working with the Cook County Sheriff's Department during Prohibition and dealing with the hazards of Al Capone and all of that. He had five kids at home and decided, ""You know what? I don't want to fight Al Capone anymore."" So he started a coal delivery business. And then around 1950, ready mix concrete became the era's disruptive technology. Ready mixed means that it is batched for delivery from a central plant instead of being mixed on the job site. And so Ozinga became one of the first ready mix providers in the region.""Related: This Entrepreneur Started Making Short Videos to Share Her Passion for Cooking. Now Her Food Company Is a Global Powerhouse.On their iconic trucks""We've supplied concrete to iconic Chicago landmarks like Soldier Field and Wrigley Field, so it's fun to be connected to places like that. And we're really proud of our trucks' red and white stripes. I think it was a combination of this keen sense of marketing, but also of national pride. But there's also some joke that they were Dutch and very frugal and those were the two paint buckets in the garage. So I like both those stories.""The power of peacefulness""Our dispatch office is the nerve center of the business. It's where all the orders come in from our customers, and then where we dispatch the trucks. It is intentionally very quiet inside. We've tried to get it as quiet and peaceful as possible because historically the dispatch office is a very intense, chaotic, loud and crazy place.""


Building and sustaining a legacy""There's an emotional connection for my family and this company. We've been really fortunate that we get to embed ourselves in communities throughout the Midwest. We're committed to our employees and our customers — we want to be here for the next hundred years and longer. That's our intention. And while change is necessary so you don't get disrupted and die and go out of business, there are certain things that you shouldn't meddle with. Our core principles are the foundation for who we are and why we do what we do — that should never change.""Related: How Personal Passions Fuel Business Success for the CEO of Vivid SeatsCheck out more profiles of innovative and impactful leaders by visiting The CEO Series archives.

42,2 Phrases I Learned From a Senior CIA Officer That Changed My Leadership Style,"Mar 22, 2024",Jon B. Becker,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/2-leadership-tricks-i-learned-from-the-cia/470821,"
Since the days of the first James Bond movie, the life-and-death game of international espionage will always be exciting. Covert operations in high-risk environments conducted by intelligence services certainly make a fantastic theme for novels, movies, and TV shows. But the reality of intelligence work is far from what is portrayed in the movies. It is a deliberate and methodical process-driven profession where the entire team must be precise and perfectly coordinated. The slightest error could compromise the mission and run the risk of losing lives.That said, it is not surprising that the leadership skills of intelligence professionals are constantly being redefined and studied. Whether you are a business owner or an aspiring entrepreneur, you can learn some key lessons from these professionals that will make you a smarter leader. I had the opportunity to interview one of these leaders, and this is what I learned.Marc Polymeropoulos is one of the CIA's most decorated senior intelligence professionals — he even wrote a book about his time there. Marc spent 26 years working in the world's most dangerous places and leading covert operations. His tried-and-true leadership techniques also have broad applications beyond the world of the CIA. Two of his approaches stuck with me, not only for their operational utility but also for the catchy nicknames: respecting the process monkey and honoring the glue guy.

43,8 CEO Mindset Quotes That Keep Me Honest and Inspired,"Mar 21, 2024",Jason Hennessey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/ceo-mindset-quotes-that-keep-me-honest-and-inspired/471192,"
Quotations are popular for a reason — sometimes a short piece of wisdom is exactly what's needed to inspire you, keep you honest or ground you in your values. The ones that tend to stick with you might be large ideas contained in small pieces of text or simple advice that helps you remember something important. They can feel inspiring and give us principles to remember to live by.I'm known to wear a variety of printed T-shirts with words of motivation on them to help me remember something important to me and to inspire others around me because I love to share an inspiring message. So here are eight of my favorite quotes for CEOs and why I think they're useful to remember:Related: 30 of the Most Inspirational Leadership Quotes



1. ""If you don't have an assistant, you are one!"" — Cameron Herold, author and coachOne of my favorite quotes that got me to take action was this one from Cameron Herold. This quote represents one of the most important lessons for an entrepreneur to learn — your time is your most valuable resource, so spend it on the tasks that are most important. That means delegating anything that doesn't require your level of expertise. Would you pay someone your salary to do the work of an assistant? If you don't have one, you're already doing that!2. ""It's okay to admit what you don't know. It's okay to ask for help. And it's more than okay to listen to the people you lead — in fact, it's essential."" — Mary Barra, CEO of General MotorsStrong leadership requires some level of vulnerability. Admitting when you don't know something, asking for help and listening to your employees are markers of an effective leader. The leader who tries to do it all on their own will never accomplish as much as the leader who values the expertise of others.


3. ""All our productivity, leverage and insight comes from being part of a community, not apart from it. The goal, I think, is to figure out how to become more dependent, not less."" — Seth Godin, author and speakerOne of the most important leadership lessons to learn is that your greatest business asset is your team. Each person brings a unique perspective and skillset, and the best innovations happen in collaboration. Your community extends beyond just your team as well — friends, mentors and family members all provide valuable, enriching relationships. Don't neglect them.4. ""No legacy is so rich as honesty."" — William ShakespeareIf there's anyone who managed to set a remarkable legacy, it was Shakespeare. More than what you accomplish, people will remember the way you behaved. And your legacy doesn't just start after you die; it's already in action, in the way people associate with you. A legacy and reputation as an honest person will take you far.Related: 15 Quotes on Success From America's Top CEOs5. ""You can't use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have."" — Maya AngelouAs the CEO of your business, your creativity is one of your most valuable skills, so it's worth taking the time to practice it. I'm known for dedicating a day each week to creative endeavors to help keep my creative muscles in shape. And I highly encourage everyone to make intentional time for creativity, because the more often you do it, the more easily ideas will come to you.


6. ""A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties."" —Harry S. TrumanStop letting your thoughts get in your way. It's easy to adopt a pessimistic attitude under the guise of ""realism,"" but the reality is that it's optimists who tend to get the best outcomes. Why? Because they're not easily discouraged, so they're more likely to learn from their mistakes and keep trying. As opera singer Robert Breault said, ""The realist sees reality as concrete. The optimist sees reality as clay.""7. ""What looks like multitasking is really switching back and forth between multiple tasks, which reduces productivity and increases mistakes by up to 50%."" — Susan Cain, authorIf you're anything like the majority of entrepreneurs I know, you're always trying to do more with your time. Time is your most valuable resource, so it's important to use it wisely — which is exactly why multitasking is a bad idea. You'll always get more done when you dedicate your focus to a single task and give it your all.Related: 'Let's Punch Today in the Face!' 20 Inspiring Quotes and Sayings That Motivated Successful Entrepreneurs8. ""The best way to drive performance in an organization is to create an environment in which information can flow freely, mistakes can be highlighted, and help can be offered and received."" — Simon Sinek, author and speakerCreating a productive workplace culture can seem dauntingly complex to many executives, but the core of it is collaboration, where each employee is given the resources to perform their best. And in order to have strong collaboration, you need a creative and judgment-free environment where people can bring their ideas, perspectives and expertise to the table, communicate freely, take ownership over their tasks, ask for help when needed and have the freedom to make mistakes. When you create a culture of collaboration, that's where innovation begins.


If you found one of these quotes particularly inspiring or helpful, write it down on a sticky note and put it somewhere you can see it regularly. Sometimes these short reminders are exactly what we need to refocus and maintain our perspective.

44,The Secret Sauce to Entrepreneurial Success — Why Your Business Needs a Diverse Team Now!,"Mar 15, 2024",Chris Kille,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-your-business-needs-a-diverse-team-now/470607,"
Have you ever considered why some businesses are just ""on point"" while others keep getting lost in the market? It isn't the product or even the service at all times. Sometimes, it is people who matter. No, not just spending the time joining and contributing to different clubs — what I meant was a diverse team!Regarding entrepreneurship, diversity isn't just one of those popular words; it's your most reliable tool. It makes us stand out, separates us from the rest and allows us to shine. Therefore, it is worth exploring why building a diverse team shouldn't just be considered an option. It should be considered a necessity, and in this article, I'll explain why.Related: Diverse Teams Drive Innovation in Ways Homogeneous Teams Just Can't



1. Humanize: The embodiment of ingenuityThe different perspectives and experiences of diverse teams make them innovation powerhouses. When you combine different backgrounds, experiences and outlooks, you're not just adding; you're increasing the possibilities that your team has to be creative. A blend of diversity, creativity and innovation is born, which can help you stand out in a heavily crowded marketplace.2. Decision-making becomes a lot betterA thing of the past is the moments when echo chambers prevail and groupthink happens. Working in a multidisciplinary team offers a broad base of possible perspectives during the decision-making process, where the final choices must be comprehensive, balanced, and most importantly, effective. It is almost like having an internal consultancy group!


3. Mirror the market, encompass the marketThe customers you have are diverse. Why don't you get a team that reflects this diversity? A team with a diverse background can be of significant value by offering in-depth insights into different market segments, thus improving the business's ability to connect with the public. It's a straightforward formula: Take your market knowledge to the next level, and serve your market better.4. Talent magnetThe top-tier professionals align with companies that highly value diversity and inclusion. You aren't just ensuring a multicultural workplace but also creating a new norm that will be a magnet for the best candidates in the industry. It's a unique selling proposition that will ultimately be your brand's trademark.5. Increase the employee satisfaction, and retain the employeesEmployees who are engaged and part of a culture that makes them feel valued and heard will succeed and thrive. A team with different backgrounds and identities automatically creates a sense of belonging for its members, which promotes employee satisfaction and helps with retention. The cheerful and productive employees are not just the best brand ambassadors, but they also multiply your profits.6. Enhanced problem-solving skillsDiversity is far more than just a mere representation of how we look. It brings a variety of problem-solving approaches to the table. Each team member might possess a wide range of such skill sets, which can allow the team to tackle problems from diverse angles simultaneously and consequently discover solutions that most people do not know.


Related: Diversity in the Workplace: Benefits and Why You Need It7. Global perspective for global successIn a world where globalization is being strengthened each day, the composition of a team with different cultural backgrounds is your access to success at a world level. They can overcome cross-cultural obstacles and master global markets to reframe the problems as economic chances.8. Resilience like never beforeThe variety of views in a team makes it a robust team. Due to various cultural views and their abilities, they can rapidly adapt and become more viable after a blow. This adaptivity is a factor that is necessary today due to the constantly changing business environment.9. Ethical leadership and corporate responsibilityEthical leadership and corporate social responsibility (CSR) have also become integral to business operations. Assembling a uniquely diverse team is not only good for business, but it is the right way to do things. It stands for the ethics and social principles of equal treatment and supports your brand's image and reputation.


10. Financial performance to envyLet's talk numbers. The studies continue to portray that diverse teams perform well and are connected to better financial results. Diversity isn't just a moral responsibility but also a financial responsibility.And so, how do you ensure that your concept becomes a reality? Be stringent with the hiring process you are employing. Look also at the ponds of creativity. Build an inclusive environment where various views are not only allowed but also appreciated. Offer training and development programs that allow the whole population to show their talent and share their qualities.Related: Diversity and Inclusion Best Practices for Your WorkforceHaving a diverse team is good and essential for the continuous success and innovativeness of any organization in a dynamic business environment. That is encouraging a work environment that mirrors our world, then drawing from the vastness of experiences, perspectives and skills to further boost your business.


So, leap. Many entrepreneurs mistakenly think that success comes from homogenizing their client base. However, I recommend that you embrace diversity and watch your business transform. In the conductor of a corporate symphony, it's a harmony of instruments playing together that gives the most beautiful music. Why not make your office be the exhibition of your artistry?

45,Making the Strong Business Case for Driving Human Brilliance,"Mar 15, 2024",Fasika Melaku,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-harness-human-brilliance-to-power-organizational/470753,"
Twenty years ago, when I first worked with my current CEO at a different company, she taught me what it truly meant to always think about the human element first. When she promoted me, she launched my professional journey, but she also did something I'll never forget — she invited me over for wine.At the time, she was a director, and I had only just started as a manager. I was one of two African Americans working at the company and an immigrant. I often felt that reality with others, but never with her. I remember asking myself, ""Does she not see that we're so different?""Her invitation was the first time I saw someone create a space for human brilliance. Fast-forward 20+ years, and she is at it again. As my current CEO, she is still creating spaces for me to do my best work, fueling my career to Senior Vice President of HR and Chief Learning Officer at Denny's. When human brilliance thrives, we create positive change: where we sit, work, and live in the world and for an organization.



Related: How To Attract (And Encourage) Brilliance In Your WorkplaceWe do our best when brilliantHuman brilliance is different for everyone. Like a stone polished to its gemlike core, bringing out an individual's brilliance is smoothing away externally imposed ideas to uncover raw, authentic thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. We bring out our strengths from that essence and polish them to our ultimate brilliance.


Human brilliance is not just what we get right, but all the times we fail, realize where we went wrong, and learn. Years ago, we ran the ""Surprise and Delight"" campaign, a marketing initiative that included surprising our guests by paying for their meals. By leaving extra cash in their pockets and treating them with unexpected kindness, we put our guests in a position to do better, achieve more and positively impact more people in their day.We considered the campaign successful, but reflecting, we realized we could have done more. Our current CEO joined the organization and established a new level of thinking: impact comes when those who create impact — our teams. She asked how we surprised and delighted the cooks, servers and staff. By not considering the rest of the team, that successful campaign missed an opportunity to create more points of exponential brilliance across the organization.Related: Eight Steps To Build Teams That LastMake the most of time and moneyIn my most challenging moments — heartache, illness, even death — I often realize the preciousness of time. These moments teach us that any time spent on being our most brilliant selves is an invaluable investment into who we can become and the impact we can have on the world. By helping others realize the value of investing time in developing their brilliance, I simultaneously help myself realize mine.


Time is a precious commodity in business, and the cost of capital has reached an all-time high. Not harnessing the full potential of a team's talents is a lost financial opportunity. When leaders focus on enhancing the brilliance within their organization, they unlock a competitive edge. It starts with just one person believing they can make a positive difference; this inspires others, creating a domino effect. When individual brilliance is connected and amplified, we cultivate collective wisdom, accelerate innovation, boost performance, and ultimately increase profitability.Related: Seven Ways You Can Establish Loyalty (And Even Love) In Your TeamBrilliance thrives in safetyBrilliance thrives in environments where everyone feels safe to authentically express their ideas and identity — to learn, fail, and cry ugly tears. When an organization provides such an ecosystem, it evolves into a community, and its people find a common purpose in doing their best work together. Upon this stage, we create places of brilliance. To build this foundation:1. Help remove self-limiting beliefsMany of us struggle with self-limiting beliefs that can hinder our ability to support ourselves or contribute effectively to others. I was recently diagnosed with chronic self-doubt. When leadership once presented me with an advancement opportunity, better pay, and an improved title that could open future doors, I hesitated and, ultimately, said no. This was not for a lack of qualifications but rather my self-limiting beliefs preventing me from fully committing to my organization and unleashing the full scope of human brilliance within me.


By cultivating gratitude and resilience, we can tackle these doubts head-on and inspire our teams to develop these crucial qualities. When facing self-limiting beliefs, I practice pausing and engaging in deep reflection. I ask myself, ""What's preventing my progress right now, and how can I navigate past it to unlock my true potential?"" Acknowledging obstacles and actively seeking ways to surmount them encourages growth.Related: Why Gratitude is the Missing Piece to Your Success2. Understand the existing frameworkEvery group of people has its own culture. When I greet someone from my Ethiopian heritage with three kisses on the cheek to represent warmth and connection, this customary gesture is unique to that culture. Similarly, within any organization, unique methods of connection and communication prevail, reflecting its distinct cultural environment. Leaders aiming to unlock the potential of human brilliance should first aim to understand and support the existing group connection.The approach must capture everyone for it to succeed, so get to know people and really listen. Putting in the work to understand them and meet them at their table helps pave the way for more authentic connections and a stronger foundation for collective brilliance.3. Build upon strengthsOnce at their table, I explore questions like: What is the general language of connection and can everyone easily understand it? How does our communication foster inclusivity? What rituals define and unite us? Just as childhood rituals shape our identities and lay the groundwork for trust and unity within our families, the same happens in a company.


We uncover hidden cultural strengths and insights by thoroughly examining how people learn, engage, and show vulnerability. When new leaders enter an organization believing a complete cultural overhaul is needed, when it isn't, they waste time and money. Instead, they should focus on enhancing existing strengths, nurturing and supporting them to unlock significant impact and foster human brilliance.Working with 12 million people or one, with $1 or $1000 in your bank account — anyone can foster environments that illuminate the brilliance in others. Make mindful decisions to craft spaces for individuals to reach their fullest potential. Progress towards brilliance is a mosaic of smaller yet significant achievements — each one a spark of brilliance deserving of celebration in its contribution to the larger glow of success.

As entrepreneurs, we're simultaneously expected to be dreamers but never succumb to the slumber of inaction. We're supposed to be able to snap our fingers, fall into a trance, dream of some marvelous future, then awake to cast vision in a compellingly contagious way to our teams, and then martial pragmatic, organized marching orders. But shifting gears like that can be tough, especially at a blistering pace in an age of distraction.I'm inspired today to examine these three separate stages, which can each lull us in with their siren song and keep us stuck for far too long. Let's explore these three entrepreneurial responsibilities and the inflection points between each.The ""Dreaming""Some of us are natural dreamers. We collect concepts like keepsakes, and our heads stay in the clouds — incessantly flipping puzzle pieces and looking for previously undiscovered connections. This is how genuine innovation comes into the world. We must spend uninterrupted time putting things together.



It reminds me of Bill Gates at the height of his career, taking ""think weeks"" where he'd disappear for two weeks to amalgamate a dozen random books and recent learnings into fresh insight for Microsoft's future. Maybe this feels very natural for you, and if it does, make sure you don't get stuck here. Dreams in business are only helpful if you do something with them once you wake.Related: 10 Surprising Facts About Bill Gates


The ""Dramatizing""And then it's time to share. When you wake, how do you articulate your dream? And beyond that, how do you bring others into your idea? How do you compellingly tell the story that people understand and can even begin to own themselves? Some people are gifted communicators, and storytelling is second nature. But for those who need pointers, here's what I've found helpful — a distillation of the hero's journey.Your dream is likely solving some tangible problem people are plagued by. Introduce that person as the story's main character, with hopes and dreams of their own, only to be burdened by some impervious obstacle. They have a problem they can't solve on their own, and this problem is preventing them from achieving their own dream. They need help, and you are perfectly positioned to help them. Your personality is exactly the kind they connect with (perhaps even an inverse of their own personality, offsetting their negative personality traits), and your guidance speaks to both their head and their heart, encouraging and inspiring them to take action. You end by sharing a clear articulation of what's at stake (""What's the worst that could happen?"" by them not taking action, followed by ""What the best that could happen?"" with your help).Related: A Brand Story Is What You Need to Share Your Entrepreneurial Vision.That story formula will always resonate, no matter your audience or industry. And by telling it as a story, it's far more likely to be remembered and shared contagiously throughout your network. People remember and love telling stories, especially when they're easy to remember and have an emotional payoff.


The ""Doing""But now it's time to get moving. How does this baby giraffe of an idea take its first steps? Slowly — that's how — with great intention. In my fifteen years of entrepreneurship, I've found that milestones are great but that inchstones are even better.In your mind's eye, put yourself a year down the road. At that point, you've arrived at some new inflection, which will require another cycle of dreaming. Now, give yourself 3-4 milestones you need to hit between now and then. Don't worry about flowery language, and don't focus on feelings.Be as plainly pragmatic as possible when describing those milestones. Use phrases like, ""We raised enough for 24 months"" and ""We have our first paying customer."" And when you've got those milestones down, break each into 3-4 inch stones. Baby steps, if you will.This may seem wildly uninspiring or unrevelatory, and that's the point. When wrestling our wispy, aspirational brain into action, it'll feel like we're robbing our work of all its romance — and we are — but our future selves will thank us.


When that final milestone comes into view, it's time to dream again. Gather everything you've collected since your last dream, absorb it, take a break from your typical routine, and let yourself fall into a dream state again.Related: Moving Beyond the Idea Stage — 4 Strategies for Taking Action and Achieving Your Entrepreneurial GoalsThere you have it — the three primary hats most entrepreneurs are expected to joyfully vacillate between from day to day deconstructed in plain language. It takes extraordinary discipline to follow this flow and not jump back to dreaming again once you've shared an idea. As a point of confession, my biggest fault is over-dreaming and under-doing, so this process becomes my guardrail. And trust me, my team is grateful for it. There are only so many times you can jerk the wheel before people onboard get seasick and want off.Founders don't need to keep all three hats on as companies grow, thank God. As we experience a bit of success and hire to replace ourselves, we can slowly nuzzle into what we love most (the Dreaming, the Dramatizing, or the Doing). But in the first stages of entrepreneurship, we're likely going to have to wear all three hats.


And it's quite the dream.

47,Former Interrogator Shares 5 Behaviors Liars Exhibit and How to Handle Them,"Mar 14, 2024",Lena Sisco,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/former-interrogator-shares-key-behaviors-that-liars-exhibit/470777,"
I often get asked how a former Human Intelligence (HUMINT) interrogator can help me transform into the business leader I want to be in a field that has nothing to do with investigating the criminal activities of terrorists.Most of my clients work in human resources, employee relations, sales and finance-related investigations. They are entrepreneurs and business owners, C-Suite executives, coaches and auditors. I left the world of interrogation long ago and still use my HUMINT skills to lead challenging conversations with confidence and authority to accurately identify deception and go after the truth. In the past two decades of interviewing, I can accurately say that liars exhibit the same deceptive behaviors.Here are five deceptive behaviors to pay close attention to and how to handle those behaviors when you encounter them.Related: Use This Secret Military Trick to Tell if Someone Is Lying1. Inability to answer yes or noThe easiest test to give someone you believe is withholding the truth is to ask them a yes/no question such as, ""Are you being honest with me?"" The reason is that truth-tellers typically answer a closed-ended question quickly and succinctly with a yes or no answer, whereas liars tend to avoid answering them.



For example, in the post-trial interview with OJ Simpson in 2016, the reporter asked OJ, ""Did you ever have any [Bruno Magli shoes]?"" OJ paused, took a deep breath and shrugged his shoulders as he said, ""First of all, I would have never worn those ugly shoes."" He never answered the question. If he was being truthful, he should have answered ""no.""Liars tend to oversell a yes or no answer because they don't believe it is convincing enough. As a result, they will usually say ""absolutely, always"" for yes and ""I would never"" for no. Ask a closed-ended question and then listen to the response. Is it truthful or deceptive?2. Missing ""I"" and ""my"" pronounsPronouns play a big part in detecting deception. The possessive pronouns ""I"" and ""my"" indicate that a person is taking ownership of what they say. Typically, liars will replace those two pronouns with other pronouns such as ""you,"" ""we"" or ""they"" or avoid them altogether when they do not want to take ownership of knowledge or information.For example, if you ask an employee allegedly involved in an ethics violation, ""What happened?"" and they answer with, ""We're trying to figure out what happened."" They could be avoiding responsibility because they didn't say, ""I'm trying to figure out what happened."" Remember Anthony Weiner? When he was lying, he said, ""We're trying to figure out who sent the tweet from my account."" He takes accountability for his account but NOT for trying to figure out who sent the tweet because he knew he sent it. A great way to handle this behavior is to ask, ""You and who are trying to figure this out?""


3. Behavioral incongruenceBehavioral incongruence is the most accurate indicator of deception. It happens when our body language contradicts our spoken language. When we are being truthful, our words, voice, emotions, facial expressions and gestures are naturally in sync; when we lie, they are incongruent. Two great examples of behavioral incongruence that are easy to identify involve shoulder shrugs and head nods and shakes.We will shrug our shoulders in uncertainty when we doubt what we are saying. If someone says, ""I know exactly what happened,"" and they shrug their shoulders, you have a problem. They are doubting what they are saying — and so should you.In most cultures, head nodding signifies ""yes,"" and head-shaking signifies ""no."" If someone says, ""I like your idea,"" but shakes their head sideways, they may not like it. When you see incongruent behaviors in someone, do not trust them. Instead, ask them, ""Why should I believe you?"" A truthful person will usually say, ""Because I'm telling you the truth."" Any other response should be suspicious.Related: 10 Telltale Phrases That Indicate Somebody Isn't Telling the Truth


4. The smokescreenA smokescreen is a ruse to disguise someone's real intentions or actions. People will try to avoid answering a question by taking the conversation onto a different topic, so you focus on their ruse rather than what really happened.Here is an example: Drew Peterson, a former cop now in prison for murdering his third wife while his fourth wife is still missing, during an interview with Larry King, said that his marriage to his fourth wife was going through tough times because she was medicated for depression after her sister died. That is a great disguise to blame their marriage troubles on. He also claimed she ran away with another guy. Yet another cover-up to take him out of the investigation spotlight.When you ask questions to discover the truth, if a liar doesn't want you to know the truth, they may try to disguise it and use a smokescreen to take your attention elsewhere. If you notice someone using a smokescreen, redirect the conversation to the topic in question!5. How liars sound (pitch, rate, breathy)To discover lies, you must focus on the words people say and how they sound. When most people lie, they become nervous, and their vocal cords can tighten, raising their voice's pitch. They also will unconsciously change the rate of their speech. Liars may try to speak faster to avoid being questioned, while others slow down because they struggle to think of what to say. They may be so worried that their cognitive abilities are lessening, so they will speak slower. Either way, in the past 20 years of listening to liars, I will say for certain that their rate of speech will change when they lie.


Finally, when someone is lying to you, they may begin to breathe heavily, and you will hear them becoming breathy. Essentially, they are out of breath because their heart rate has increased due to flight or fight. So, when you hear a change in how someone sounds, investigate it! Ask questions on that specific topic to uncover the truth.These five behaviors are very accurate when deciphering between truth and deception. Reading about them has increased your awareness about them, so the next time you have a gut feeling that someone isn't being honest, ask yourself if they demonstrated one of these five deceptive behaviors.Related: The One Interviewing Technique Guaranteed to Get You the Truth

48,How to Battle Burnout While Protecting Your Most Valuable Asset — Your People,"Mar 14, 2024",Apu Pavithran,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-battle-cybersecurity-burnout-and-protect-your-people/470720,"
The cyber threat landscape is a relentless battlefield. As leaders in this unforgiving arena, we wear many hats — strategists, innovators, risk mitigators and, most importantly, leaders. In this constant state of defense, it's easy to overlook the most critical line of protection: our own people, the cybersecurity professionals who stand guard day and night. They are the human firewall, the skilled hands deciphering cryptic codes and thwarting insidious attacks. But here's a brutal truth: they are burning out.The numbers paint a grim picture. A Forrester study last year revealed that a staggering 66% of cybersecurity professionals experienced extreme stress and burnout, with 51% being prescribed medicine and 19% consuming three drinks daily to deal with the stress. This isn't just a human cost; it's a business vulnerability. Burnout threatens to leave our digital castles unguarded in an industry already plagued by a 4 million talent gap.Related: How to Spot Entrepreneurial Burnout (Before It's Too Late)



Reframing the narrativeThe causes of cybersecurity burnout are multifaceted. The ever-evolving threat landscape generates a constant sense of urgency and an unending race against unseen adversaries. Long hours, on-call expectations, and the weight of potential breaches together create a highly strenuous environment. In addition to the resource crunch, understaffed teams grapple with inadequate budgets and outdated tools, further amplifying the stress.To reframe this narrative, realizing that fostering such an environment starts by acknowledging stress is important. Hence, the first step is to promote open dialogue about the pressures associated with cybersecurity work. Creating a safe space for employees to express their concerns and providing adequate support can significantly impact them.


Companies that promote and facilitate the exchange of information and knowledge among different functions and departments tend to be more cohesive in pursuing objectives. Enhanced collaboration often leads to greater trust among teams, which in turn promotes additional sharing of knowledge. This positive cycle can significantly enhance organizational cybersecurity, as each employee's actions contribute to overall resilience. Another pillar of a stress-free workplace is encouraging a healthy work-life balance. Cybersecurity professionals must be reminded to take breaks, utilize vacation days, and disconnect after working hours. Moreover, leading by example is essential; as leaders, demonstrating healthy boundaries sends a powerful message.Related: Are You at Risk for Burnout? This Psychologist-Created Quiz Lets You Know in 5 MinutesBuilding sustainable systemsAddressing burnout doesn't stop with individual-level interventions. It necessitates a strategic and systemic approach that addresses the root causes. Businesses must take charge of building sustainable systems that support and enhance the resilience of the cybersecurity workforce.One significant contributor to burnout is the overwhelming workload faced by IT teams. As companies embrace digital transformation, they have access to many solutions, each with its own benefits. However, a major drawback is the increasing burden on IT professionals. In this context, solutions integrating multiple capabilities are invaluable in lightening the workload.


For example, implementing a unified endpoint management (UEM) solution consolidates device management, application management, patch management and more into a single console. Similarly, secure access service edge (SASE) combines network connectivity and security functionalities into a unified platform.Another approach is promoting cross-training. This facilitates knowledge sharing and fosters a collaborative approach within the cybersecurity team. Furthermore, it helps distribute workloads more effectively while also cultivating a sense of collective ownership. Finally, offering avenues for continuous training and upskilling ensures that employees have the necessary knowledge to stay ahead in the ever-evolving threat landscape.Related: Cyber Attacks Are On the Rise — Here's How Your Business Can Continuously Prepare for ThreatsCultivating an atmosphere of appreciation and recognitionIt's often easy to overlook the tireless efforts of our cybersecurity professionals, working diligently behind the scenes to thwart attacks without seeking recognition. Yet, this silent service deserves acknowledgment. Recognizing their contributions and celebrating their successes can reignite their passion and dedication. Highlighting successful security outcomes and the individuals responsible fosters a sense of pride and accomplishment.


Additionally, to foster a culture of collaboration and trust, break down silos, and encourage open communication and information sharing across teams. Empowering employees to contribute their unique perspectives fosters a sense of belonging and deepens appreciation for their invaluable contributions.We are fortunate to be in an era where mental health is regarded as important as physical health. However, in a field known for high-stakes scenarios, mental health often takes a back seat. Therefore, businesses should ensure that employees have access to assistance programs and mental health resources, fostering an environment where discussions about mental health are normalized and stigma-free.In short, cybersecurity burnout is not an inevitable consequence of the job. It's a systemic issue demanding leadership. We can turn the tide by prioritizing our people's well-being, empowering them with the right tools and resources, and fostering a culture of support and appreciation. Remember that protecting our data and systems starts with protecting the human beings who are our most valuable assets in this digital warzone.

49,Boomers: The Wealthy Client Group You Can't Ignore — Here's the Best Way to Market to Them.,"Mar 14, 2024",Scott Keffer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/boomers-own-most-of-the-wealth-heres-the-best-way-to/469989,"
In the unending search for the holy grail of marketing, financial advisors are lately tempted by promises of quick and easy client acquisition through digital marketing miracles. From buying digital leads to endless social media posts, content marketing and webinars, the financial industry has embraced the allure of online strategies with hopes of waves of new affluent clients.However, starting with a method is marketing backward. Marketing should always begin with your ideal client. Knowing their mindset is the recipe for success – embracing their desires, mastering their language, and resonating with their values.The ideal clientThe first and foremost consideration is defining the ideal client. Seeking to be everything to everybody positions you as nothing to no one.



My definition is an E.L.K. — Easy. Listen to you. Keep paying you the most — who is successful, serious and salt. Successful financially ($2 million to $25 million), serious about their money and future and salt-of-the-earth (loyal and trustworthy). Most importantly, they are in a position to become a client today and move their money to you now (ages 64-74).That's a Baby Boomer. Boomers own 51 percent of all wealth in the United States, have the most wealth per household, have the most money in retirement funds and have the most money in stock and mutual funds.


Related: The 7-Step Guide To Finding the Right Clients and Avoiding the Ones Who Waste Your TimeThe normal and natural testProspects do what is normal and natural.Think about this: Would an affluent Boomer normally and naturally go online to find a CPA, attorney, heart surgeon or financial advisor? The answer is no. Sure, there are always exceptions. However, in marketing, relying on exceptions is foolhardy and costly. Marketing must be sustainable and scalable to be successful.Many mistakenly assume that the majority of retail purchases are made online. Not true. In 2023, only 15.6% of all U.S. retail sales occurred online, according to Statista. Furthermore, 84% of Boomers prefer visiting a physical store for their shopping needs.


Understanding the mindset of Boomers, who grew up in a world devoid of technology, unveils a picture of their unique set of values and preferences. Growing up with catalog shopping, green stamps, waiting for the mailman, service stations, rotary phones, telephone operators, sending postcards while traveling, adjusting the antenna on the single black-and-white TV, vinyl records, having milk delivered to a box on the front porch and getting news from Walter Cronkite has stamped an indelible set of values and preferences on them.Not surprisingly, Boomers align with traditional values, are most comfortable with conventional communication, and value information from trusted sources.Typically, three kinds of people go online for financial information: 1. Hot tip investors seeking the latest stock ""intel,"" 2. DIYers seeking ""how to"" information, and 3. Price-shopping penny pinchers seeking a deal. None of these are the kind of people who make the best long-term, loyal clients.Related: How You Can Build Long-Lasting Customer Relationships


The ideal marketing mediumDirect mail aligns perfectly with the preferences of Boomers. They trust the tangible.According to the United States Postal Service (USPS), 92% of Boomers check their mail daily, with 91% stating that sorting through mail doesn't stress them. Furthermore, 82% express a greater likelihood of buying from a business that sends them direct mail, considering it more personal than digital communications. These statistics reinforce that Boomers trust direct mail more than any other marketing channel.Even Google and other popular brands rely on direct mail to get businesses to advertise with them. In a 2018 Vox article, they report, ""Yet over the last few years, brands — including hot, digitally savvy, direct-to-consumer ones like Casper, Harry's, Wayfair, Rover, Quip, Away, Handy, and Modcloth — have taken to targeting customers in the mail.""Better yet, mailboxes are less cluttered these days, which means less competition. As advertising spending overall grew 50% (2015-2021), the dollars that went into Direct Mail dropped 17%, per Statista.


Related: 5 Ways to Effectively Market to Baby BoomersHere are five keys to make for direct mail success1. Personalize the mail: Make it unique — Craft your message as if it's a letter written to a friend. Address the dreams, desires, and concerns of a Boomer. Make them feel seen and understood, establishing an immediate connection. Use their name, acknowledge their individuality, and tailor your communication to resonate on a personal level with authenticity and sincerity.2. Invest in presentation: Make it hard to ignore — Design your mailing package to be visually arresting. Invest in quality paper, eye-catching graphics, and a layout that demands attention. A well-presented letter not only reflects professionalism but also intrigues prospects, urging them to want more.3. Appeal to both the heart and the head: Mix emotion with reason – Strike a balance between emotional resonance and logical persuasion. Connect with them emotionally and support your claims with rational arguments, data, and evidence. This harmonious blend creates a persuasive narrative that speaks to both the heart and the head, leaving a lasting impact and setting you apart from the crowd.


4. Include high-value content – Provide information that adds genuine value. Offer statistics, trends, and insights that position you as a source of exclusive knowledge, elevating the perceived value of your message. By sharing relevant and intriguing content, you position yourself as an indispensable resource, fostering trust and credibility.5. Use familiar analogies and metaphors – Communicate complex ideas using relatable analogies and metaphors. Create a bridge between unfamiliar concepts and your prospects' existing knowledge. Analogies serve as mental shortcuts, making it easier for your reader to grasp the essence of your message. By using familiar comparisons, you enhance accessibility.In a world barraged with online noise, the key to success with affluent Boomers lies in delivering messages that are normal, natural, and, above all, trusted by them. Financial advisors can unlock a deep gold mine of affluent Boomers with little competition by embracing direct mail and crafting personalized, engaging marketing.

These days, keeping good employees can be difficult. Two of the biggest concerns for small business owners are hiring the right talent (60.7%) and retaining and motivating employees (33%), according to survey data from the nonprofit organization SCORE.A study from The Society for Human Resource Management found that, on average, it costs a company six to nine months of an employee's salary to find a replacement — and a Gallup poll revealed that more than half of employees who quit said their manager or organization could have done something to prevent it.Related: 4 Ways to Boost Your Employee Retention in an Uncertain EconomyBut what does preventing a mass exodus of talent actually look like?It can literally pay to draw on examples from some of the world's most successful billion-dollar firms.

51,5 Surprisingly Critical Employee Skill Sets in Demand for 2024,"Mar 14, 2024",Jason Zickerman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-invaluable-soft-skills-to-seek-in-your-next-hire/470695,"
A reporter once asked professional development guru Dale Carnegie how he was able to pull off hiring 43 millionaires. Carnegie responded that those people were not millionaires when they were hired. Rather, he had identified their potential and cultivated them into the successes they ultimately became. Carnegie, whose leadership insight was clearly ahead of its time, added, ""Men are developed the same way gold is mined. Several tons of dirt must be moved to get an ounce of gold. But you don't go into the mine looking for dirt. You go in looking for the gold.""The trick for business leadership and hiring managers is knowing what great potential looks like. And in all likeliness, you can't glean that from a resume, as the promise of an employee's greatness isn't necessarily evident from their current skill set or perhaps even their past jobs. Sure, experience and hard skills are important, but there are more powerful indicators of long-term success — gold, if you will — that are far better telltales of an employee's ability to flourish.The interesting thing here is that employees often aren't even conscious of their capacity for growth. While it is surely in one's best interest to have self-awareness related to one's natural talents and deficits, the onus is on leadership to recognize the potential for greatness within their employees. But often, those who should know best simply miss the ball when assessing and nurturing talent.



Many people, particularly those new to management, focus too heavily on identifying weaknesses and overcoming deficits in their employees. This is the dirt that Carnegie was referring to. Regardless of how successful we are, everyone (and I do mean everyone) possesses at least some challenges and shortcomings. We also all have certain behavioral profiles that work wonderfully in certain situations and not so great in others.As managers grow into true and effective leaders, they recognize that focusing on employees' faults rather than their potential is a losing game for everyone. For instance, a performance improvement plan (PIP) aims to address an employee's deficits rather than how to leverage their talents better. True or not, many workers feel that PIPs simply document their failures as a precursor to being let go. So, while PIPs are ostensibly designed to foster progress and growth, they often have the opposite effect due to their focus on the dirt. While the stats don't currently seem to exist, it would be interesting to learn what percentage of PIP recipients ever move on to advanced positions within that organization. I imagine it is astonishingly few.


More evolved and successful managers instead work purposefully to find and foster the strengths in each member of their team. Their job is to identify that gold in each individual and put them in positions where they can maximize their strengths for the betterment of themselves and the company.I know, I know. Your pushback is, ""What if the employee is actually untalented or unredeemable in some way?"" That reflects as much on the hiring process and HR management as it does on the employee in question. If a business finds itself making lousy hires after bad hires, the process is broken or is ironically due to talent deficits within the hiring manager. Somewhere along the line, the wrong attributes are being favored instead of the right stuff.Related: High Performers and High-Potential Employees Are Not One in the SameThe following are a few soft skills worth their weight in gold that you should look for in your next great hire.


1. Adaptability and resiliencyAn employee's ability to adapt is an exceptionally valuable characteristic and a strong indicator of long-term success. Adaptability means that an employee is not only quick on their feet, but also reflects an innovative, agile and agreeable spirit. Resiliency is reflected in their capacity to bounce back from misfires and overcome obstacles.2. CommunicationVerbal aptitude, writing ability and listening skills are invaluable talents that you should look for in every employee, regardless of their pay grade. Your entire team's ability to express themselves to others ultimately leads to better connection, improved collaboration and a more compelling company culture.Related: How to Delegate Effectively Without Ruining Your Team3. CreativityCreative thinkers are natural innovators. They not only offer fresh ideas and approaches but also inspire others to do the same. Creative thinkers tend to be your best problem solvers and are catalysts for organizational improvement and growth.


4. Leadership potentialWhile leaders can certainly be developed, natural leaders possess some key traits long before they ever climb the corporate ladder. Those best positioned for future leadership roles are wired to inspire those around them, demonstrate initiative and take ownership of their decisions regardless of their current title.Related: Feel Like an Imposter? Practice These 5 Habits to Beat Your Imposter Syndrome5. Continuous learningA hungry mind is a tremendous asset and a clear indicator of a growth mindset. An employee's drive to attain new knowledge reflects an incredible array of transferable skills, including increased capacities in problem-solving, collaboration, critical thinking and innovation. So, keep a keen eye out in your hiring process for job candidates with curious minds.As you begin to focus on the right skills in your hiring and employee development initiatives, you and your entire organization will surely be rewarded with all the riches you deserve.

Back in the late 1980s, when I was in the early stages of establishing my advertising agency, an invitation came my way to speak at a Chamber of Commerce event in Upstate New York. I turned it down. At that moment, the idea of declining might have seemed counterintuitive, especially given my aspirations to grow my business.The reason? I was afraid. Fear held me back from seizing an opportunity that could have propelled my agency forward. Not long after that failed opportunity, a pivotal moment arrived during a staff meeting. A few days after the meeting, my Art Director approached me with feedback that was both unsettling and enlightening. He said that everyone had been confused about a particular topic I had discussed, yet no one felt comfortable confronting me about it.This incident served as a wake-up call, prompting me to confront my fears and recognize the crucial role effective communication plays in business success. It was clear that if I intended to thrive as a businessperson, especially in a leadership role, mastering the art of public speaking was not just an option — it was a necessity.



Fast forward to today, forty years later. I started and ran a very successful advertising agency for nearly twenty years. I have been speaking and training globally for over twenty years. I can say with 100% certainty that focusing on better presentation skills after that feedback from my employee was the most important career decision I've ever made.Related: The Complete, 20-Step Guide to Ace Public Speaking


You don't have to be a professional speaker to speak like a professionalThroughout my career, I've had the distinct privilege of coaching aspiring professional speakers as well as numerous executives, guiding them toward becoming not just better communicators but compelling presenters. Whether it's delivering a critical pitch to board members, leading a staff meeting, or captivating an audience at industry conferences, the power to communicate with both passion and precision is paramount. And by precision, I mean far more than just covering bullet points. It's about hitting those crucial, emotionally charged points that truly connect with your audience.Related: What is a Keynote Speaker and Why Are They Important?Improving presentation skills is an ongoing process that can significantly enhance a leader's effectiveness and ability to achieve organizational objectives. Here are seven steps to becoming a better presenter and a more effective communicator.Understand your audience: Begin by researching and understanding your audience. What are their interests, challenges, and expectations? Tailoring your message to the audience's needs and perspectives increases engagement and impact.Master your content: Know your material inside and out. This doesn't mean memorizing your presentation word for word but being comfortable with the content so you can adapt on the fly, answer questions, and engage in meaningful dialogue.Practice relentlessly: If possible, practice your presentation multiple times in various settings. This can include practicing in front of a mirror, with a trusted friend or colleague, or recording yourself to review your performance. The goal is to become comfortable with your delivery and refine your pacing, tone, and body language.Engage with storytelling: Incorporate storytelling into your presentations. Stories are powerful tools for making complex information understandable and memorable. Use personal anecdotes or hypothetical scenarios that resonate with your audience's experiences.Hone your nonverbal communication: Pay attention to your body language, eye contact, and use of space. Nonverbal cues can reinforce your message or, if not managed well, distract from it. Ensure your posture is confident, your gestures are purposeful, and you maintain eye contact with your audience to build a connection.Manage nervous energy: Learn techniques to manage anxiety and nervous energy. This can include deep breathing exercises, positive visualization, or a pre-presentation routine that helps you center yourself. Recognize that some nervousness is natural and can be channeled into dynamic energy that enhances your presentation.Seek feedback and continuously improve: After each presentation, seek constructive feedback from peers, mentors, or audience members. Reflect on what worked well and what could be improved. Consider working with a coach or joining organizations like Toastmasters International to gain insights and practice in a supportive environment.By following these steps and committing to continuous improvement, you'll become a better speaker or presenter and a more effective communicator, capable of inspiring and leading others with confidence and clarity.

Now, let's delve into the key benefits of mastering presentation skills for any leader.Influence and persuasion: Effective presentation skills enable leaders to influence their audience's attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Persuasive presentations can motivate teams, sway stakeholders, and drive organizational change. A leader who is a compelling presenter can better advocate for their vision, inspire action and garner support for initiatives.Clarity and direction: Leaders often need to communicate complex information, strategies, and visions to a diverse audience. Being a better presenter helps ensure that messages are delivered clearly and concisely, reducing misunderstandings and aligning the team with organizational goals. Clear presentations help demystify complex issues and provide a roadmap for what needs to be done.Credibility and trust: Presentation skills are directly tied to a leader's credibility. Leaders who present confidently and effectively are more likely to be perceived as knowledgeable and competent. This perception builds trust within the team and among stakeholders, which is essential for effective leadership and collaboration.Engagement and inspiration: Dynamic presentation skills help leaders engage their audience emotionally and intellectually. By being a better presenter, a leader can connect with their audience on a personal level, fostering a sense of community and shared purpose. This engagement is crucial for inspiring teams and driving them to embrace challenges and achieve goals.Adaptability and impact: Leaders must be able to tailor presentations to different audiences and situations. Effective presenters can adjust their message, tone, and delivery to suit the situation, whether they're motivating a team, pitching to investors, or speaking at a large conference. This adaptability maximizes the impact of their communication, ensuring that their messages resonate broadly and drive desired outcomes.In conclusion, becoming an exceptional presenter is a personal and professional evolution, marking a leader's commitment to excellence and influence. It's a path that amplifies a leader's effectiveness and elevates the entire organization. For leaders aiming to leave a lasting imprint on their teams, stakeholders, and industry, refining presentation skills is not just a strategy — it's a mission. As we've seen, the benefits are clear, transformative, and within reach for those ready to embrace the challenge and harness the power of truly impactful communication.

      Key Takeaways    



        Tremblay and Ciupka wanted to ""think beyond the industrial era five-day workweek, two-day weekend."" 
      


        After reading case studies and analyzing their own team's productivity, they decided to eliminate Fridays. 
      


        The model requires an ""experimental, progress-oriented mindset,"" but they'll never go back to a five-day workweek.
      



This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dominic Tremblay. He and his partner Ludwig Ciupka are co-founders of TUX, a creative agency that gives back through its Karma Foundation and boasts clients including Eucerin, Prada, Lancôme Paris, Make Up For Ever, Milk & Bone and Doctors of the World, among others.

We're an LGBTQ+-owned company that's been B-Corp-certified since 2017, inspired by many companies that were really innovating in terms of sustainability practices. For us, the next quest became, Could we reinvent the workweek? Could we think beyond the industrial era's five-day workweek and two-day weekend? It was a big decision, so we began the research process.

56,From Trusted to Cancelled — Here's How to Navigate the Double-Edged Sword of Social Media,"Mar 11, 2024",Jon Michail,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/social-media-can-be-used-against-you-heres-how-to/470505,"
You work so hard to build up your own name and protect the reputation you have developed. Yet in our super-connected and politically evolving world, everything you post — every comment, photo and status update — could also be used against you. For a CEO, leader or entrepreneur, the task is all the more high-stakes: managing your online persona.This article will explore social media's profound benefits and potential pitfalls for personal brands and reputations like yours. You will learn strategies that can help you harness its power for maximum effect while sidestepping traps that may otherwise cost you your reputation.What is personal brand, and why does it matter?Your brand is that shimmering something of skills, experiences, values, and even your little quirks that make you unique and an increasingly attractive choice in your business.



It is the constant reminder you etch into people's minds about how you need to be perceived and interacted with. Authentic personal branding can make all the difference in the world. It enhances you and increases your solidity, much in the same way that a thick layer of chrome adds to something.Establishing a well-defined personal brand opens the door to valuable new opportunities, as it allows you to attract like-minded people who resonate with your message. It also prepares you to be the trusted authority, building bonds of trust with audiences so tight it would take steel cables to pull them apart.


This means that if one typifies the loud, clear proclaimer who overflows with contagious passion concerning one's purpose, one presents a consistent narrative that will resonate as a tuning fork does with one's people. In summary, this will lead to business growth and career and personal development galore.Related: Reputation Management Starts Before Your First Bad Review — Here's How to Develop a Proactive Crisis PlanThe relationship between an online presence and brand reputationThe connection between your presence on social media and your brand reputation has never been stronger these days. Your presence on social media is a high-definition digital mirror that showcases your brand, values, thoughts, triumphs and spirited interactions for the world to see.Every LinkedIn post, tweet, and digital status update is another brush stroke on the canvas of your portrait, building an unshakeable representation of your radiant essence for others to view. Intentional social media can take your brand to the stratosphere, get your people consistently dialed in, and have you firmly positioned as the thought leader in your space.


In contrast, a poorly managed online presence may easily vanish like a sandcastle in front of an aggressive tide, washing out the foundation of trust that one has built up with hard work.Every mistake, every controversy, every fight, or one inappropriate overshare on the Internet can take a life of its own and go viral, so much so that it might cause unthinkable, possibly irreparable damage to your reputation. You've got to understand that we're in a digital age that casts a stark spotlight. Every move you make prints an indelible record for the world to scrutinize.Here are five ways social media can make your personal brand and reputation authentic.Visibility. Always lead with gravitas. Social media hands you a bullhorn through which you amplify your expertise, insights, and every single win to a global audience who would not have the time to catch up otherwise.Builds good relations. Avoid Ai generated auto responses, use your real voice in comments, candid conversations, and genuine talks builds up loyal brand connections more effectively than any steel rope ever would.One will manage to show oneself as an expert. Your constant authoritative content, unique perspectives, and lively activity within the sphere of industry discussions make you a respected thought leader. Indeed, your credibility and influence are drawing close to that of a gravity well.Brand your reputation. Social media gives you the ability to proactively craft and control your brand message and to act quickly on anything positive or negative that could potentially alter your hard-earned company reputation.Dominate your network. Social networking makes possible easier communication and collaboration with other visionary competitors, industry bigwigs, and potential partners, hence throwing wide open, opportunities for growth, creative synergy, and win-win-win action.Digital amphitheaters, which are equaled by a huge potential to create authentic personal brands and reputations, bring substantial risk. One errant step or poorly executed post can deal catastrophic damage in the twinkle of an eye, unraveling years of patience and painstakingly earned progress more quickly than a Jenga tower kicked by a mule.


Related: How to Balance Between Personal and Professional Social MediaPotentially provocative, offensive or controversial contentWith all shares potentially provocative, offending, or controversial, you may very literally switch off your reputation's light as if it were a light bulb and lose the audience in thousands.Inconsistent inauthenticity. Poor presence and lack of earnestness consistent with the cause breeds dissonance. You either seem less credible, confusing, or just disingenuous, worse.Unengaged Ghosting. Don't play the pretend ""I'm too important to respond"" game. Ignoring followers, comments, or concerns on social media is a better way to lose trust and loyalty than even leaving a half-melted icicle in the heart of summer.Unprofessional Faux-Pas. Trudging through embarrassing online meltdowns, the moronic slinging of insults and abuse at other people's comments, or conducting oneself in an unprofessional manner can damage your reputation faster than a wrecking ball through the drywall.Failure to Address. Burying the head in the sand and bungling controversies, PR crises or negative feedback only fans the flame by providing it with more oxygen. To make things worse, problems get nurtured to create almost insurmountable barriers while trying to rebuild lost public trust.After all, personal branding in social media is a double-edged sword since, on the one hand, it gives great power to multiply your voice, create absolutely valuable connections, and become a leader of thought for the world. On the other hand, even a small slip can cut very painfully deep with grievous wounds to your reputation.You must learn to use these digital tools to become an adept brand leader, influencer, or entrepreneur. Achieving the art of appropriately presenting yourself and getting your community involved to grow it to next level is synonymous with enhancing your reputation.


The same reputation you have labored to secure over the years can be gone in the blink of an eye due to controversy, inconsistency, or simply not being professional. Be aware of these perceptions and still know how to use today's social media power.

57,6 Ways I've Achieved a Healthy Work-Life Balance as a Business Owner,"Mar 11, 2024",Kartik Jobanputra,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-master-work-life-harmony-with-these-simple-steps/469893,"
Collaboration is a powerful tool that has become increasingly essential in the modern business world. Working together with others can help drive growth, innovation, and success. My journey with collaboration caused me to discover some hacks that have improved my work-life balance.This article will explore the importance of these hacks and provide some tips for re-prioritizing your work-life relationship and using it to achieve your goals.Related: Why Strong Collaborations Will Change Your Business



1. Set clear boundariesThe first step to finding balance is to set clear boundaries between your professional and personal life. When you're working, focus solely on business tasks without letting any outside influences distract you.Similarly, when you're out of the office, ensure that work doesn't infringe upon your other activities or relationships. You must understand what lines must not be crossed for both sides of your life to remain healthy and balanced.


2. Prioritize your timeWhen managing your time as an entrepreneur, it's important to prioritize the most important tasks first. This means taking some extra time during the day or week to plan what needs to be done ahead of time so that nothing is left undone or forgotten about. Doing this will help keep task-related stress at bay and give you more freedom in determining how best to divide up the rest of your day or week into a manageable schedule.Additionally, don't forget to add some non-work-related activities into your schedule, such as exercise or leisurely activities — these can help provide much-needed respite from your otherwise hectic workloads.Related: 15 of the Best Time Management and Productivity Books of All Time3. Take regular breaksIt's easy for entrepreneurs to get caught up in their work and forget about taking regular breaks throughout their day. But breaks are essential for maintaining both physical and mental health — they can help reduce stress levels while providing an opportunity for creativity, too.


Try setting reminders on your phone or computer so that you take regular breaks throughout the day – this could mean stepping away from the desk for 10 minutes every hour or even going for a walk during lunchtime, if possible! Taking regular breaks will refresh your mind and body alike, helping you stay productive yet balanced over time.Related: How to Achieve A CEO Level of Focus by Breaking Habits and Taking Breaks4. Learn to say noAs an entrepreneur, it can be easy to overextend yourself by saying yes too often when asked for favors or projects outside of work hours — but learning when (and how) to say no can ultimately save considerable amounts of unnecessary stress in the long run.Don't feel guilty if you need to turn down certain requests; just politely explain why it's not possible at this particular time, perhaps offering alternative solutions depending on what may be suitable instead. By knowing when (and how) to say no without feeling guilty, entrepreneurs can find greater peace of mind while still being able to give back where needed most.


5. Schedule regular 'me time'Making sure that there is adequate 'me time' built into each week is essential – regardless if it's reading a book in silence, going out with friends, or simply enjoying a warm bath after work hours — whatever activity works best for giving yourself some much-needed rest. Having this type of downtime allows entrepreneurs ample opportunity to recharge their batteries before returning to business mode — allowing them to manage better stress levels associated with being constantly busy with numerous tasks at hand.6. Don't neglect your health and well-beingLastly - one key area that entrepreneurs needn't forget about balancing is their health & well-being; don't neglect to eat nutritious food regularly during working hours nor avoid exercise altogether either — these are paramount needs necessary for keeping one's energy levels high while reducing any risks associated from sitting down all day — thus ensuring both physical & mental well-being remains balanced over longer periods.ConclusionManaging a successful career and a satisfying lifestyle outside of work can be difficult but achievable, no matter what stage in business development one might find themselves at now.The key lies in understanding where our limits lie and setting clear boundaries between our personal life and professional obligations accordingly—along with scheduling sufficient 'me' time each week where necessary. Following such guidelines helps ensure balance remains intact over extended periods while promoting productivity and achieving success simultaneously, too.

59,I Attended an Ivy League University's Most Popular MBA Leadership Class and Learned How Steve Jobs Became a Better Leader in 10 Minutes,"Mar 8, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/heres-how-steve-jobs-became-a-better-leader-in-10-minutes/470841,"
Hitendra Wadhwa, professor of practice at Columbia Business School and founder of Mentora Institute, teaches the university's most popular class on personal leadership and success — two topics that most business students are eager to learn more about.That much was clear on the rainy January day when I sat in on the afternoon session of Wadhwa's course; despite the dreary weather, the energy was palpable, with every seat taken and some attendees even standing in the back.Wadhwa wrote the literal book on looking inward to find outward success. In Inner Mastery, Outer Impact: How Your Five Core Energies Hold the Key to Success, Wadhwa reveals how activating purpose, wisdom, growth, love and self-realization can help people make a real mark on the world.

During the session I attended, Wadhwa relayed a compelling story about Steve Jobs that captures those core energies in action — and shows that the best leaders are willing to pivot, even when it's difficult.""Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.""The story starts in 2001, just before Apple was set to open its first retail store. Ron Johnson, the company's senior vice president of retail from 2000 to 2011, was riding to a weekly planning meeting with Jobs when he shared his concerns about the proposed layout of the new store.Like most retail outlets, Apple planned to organize its store by product. But Johnson saw an opportunity to design it according to activity, like making movies or listening to music, and lean into the innovation that had already helped Jobs' brainchild become a category of one.


But Jobs wasn't having it: The store's opening was fast approaching, and he didn't think there was time for a complete overhaul. Johnson and Jobs sat with the tension of that disagreement as they rode the rest of the way to the meeting.Related: As Steve Jobs Once Said, 'People With Passion Can Change The World'Then, about 10 minutes later, the pair walked into the meeting, and Jobs surprised Johnson by telling the team that Johnson believed the store's design was completely misguided — and that he agreed. Jobs said he was going to step aside while they all worked together to figure out the best way forward.By telling the story about Johnson and Jobs, Wadhwa makes an invaluable point: The kind of leader someone is in one moment doesn't have to dictate the kind of leader they'll be in the next. A willingness to change your mind and think outside of the box, even when it means additional challenges in the short term, isn't a weakness — it's a strength.


And, as Jobs himself once said, ""Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.""Related: Is Your Leadership Style More Steve Jobs or Elon Musk? Here's How to Tell — And Why It Matters.

As the founder of a growing company, I've seen firsthand just how crucial team spirit is. In those early days of building our business, we faced all sorts of challenges. But one particular moment sticks out in my mind. We were up against an extremely tight deadline, and it seemed like every obstacle imaginable was getting in our way. Instead of giving up, though, my brilliant team banded together.That experience really drove home the importance of team spirit for me. It's about more than just getting along — it's about truly believing in each other's abilities and lifting each other up when things get tough. Without that kind of teamwork, I honestly don't think we'd be where we are today.So, how can you ensure that your team, regardless of its size, harnesses the transformative power of team spirit? Let's explore.Related: Life's Too Short to Work With Incompatible People — Follow These 3 Secrets To Building High-Performing TeamsWhat is team spirit in an organization?Team spirit isn't just reserved for sports teams. No, it's just as crucial in business settings. Essentially, it's about fostering unity, trust and a shared purpose among your employees. It's creating an environment where everyone feels valued and supported, where their viewpoints and opinions matter. And, when you have a strong and united team, it leads to a whole host of benefits for your company, including:



Improved communicationIncreased collaborationBetter job satisfactionActive problem-solvingHow to create a good team spirit at your companyBuilding team spirit requires deliberate effort and nurturing. When the bonds among your team members are weak, it's time to roll up your sleeves and get to work on strengthening them. Here are some key steps to fostering team spirit within an organization:Encourage collaboration and teamworkThink of your team as a well-oiled machine — each person has their own role and responsibilities, but together, they're unstoppable. To foster collaboration, consider implementing the following actionable strategies:Establish clear team goals: Make sure everyone knows what they're working towards and how their piece fits into the bigger picture. When everyone's on the same page, it's easier to work together towards a common goal.Host brainstorming sessions: Schedule regular brainstorming sessions where everyone can share ideas and challenges and explore new possibilities. No idea is too big or too small and you should encourage everyone to contribute their thoughts.Invest in team-building activities: Make some time to get to know your team outside of work. Whether it's a team-building workshop, an offsite retreat or just grabbing lunch together, building those personal connections can go a long way.Related: This Four-Part Formula Can Help You Build Great TeamsClear communication is keyYou've probably heard the phrase ""communication is key"" more times than you can count, but let me tell you, there's a reason it's such a timeless mantra. When your team can communicate well with each other, they can better bond with each other. Here's how you can make sure everyone's voice is heard loud and clear:


Create a culture of transparency: Nobody likes feeling left in the dark. Make transparency a top priority by keeping everyone in the loop about important decisions, changes and updates. When everyone knows what's happening, it builds trust and prevents rumors from swirling.Embrace two-way communication: Communication is not just about talking but about listening. Make sure you're not just broadcasting information, but actively listening to what your team has to say. Whether it's through one-on-one check-ins, open-door policies or mentoring. At Capitalixe, we hold monthly mentoring sessions to get to know our team and their dreams and aspirations.Lead by example: As the leader, your actions speak louder than words. Be proactive about sharing information and soliciting feedback, be your team's biggest cheerleaders and be open to new ideas.Recognize your team's winsIt may seem like a simple gesture, but employee recognition goes a long way in boosting morale and keeping everyone motivated. Here's how you can make sure your team feels appreciated and valued for their hard work:Celebrate wins, big and small: Maybe your team has hit a major milestone or landed a new client. Or, maybe an individual is experiencing a personal win like an engagement. Celebrate their success. Host a team lunch, throw a work party or even just give a heartfelt shout-out during a team meeting. Celebrating wins together can do wonders in boosting team spirit.Create a culture of recognition: Make recognition and appreciation a regular part of your team culture. Encourage team members to recognize and celebrate each other's successes through peer-to-peer shoutouts, kudos boards and other recognition programs.Reward achievements: As well as verbal recognition and praise, consider offering actual rewards for team successes. This could be an annual bonus, extra paid time off or other incentives that praise your team for their hard work and dedication. When team members see that their efforts are being rewarded, it motivates them to continue giving their best.Related: Why Acknowledging Your Team Members Is Critical to Your SuccessFinal thoughtsSo there you have it. We've unpacked how team spirit can make or break an organization's performance. From my own journey, I've learned firsthand that the results speak for themselves when the team's spirit is strong.Team spirit isn't just about high-fives and pep talks — it's about creating a vibe where everyone's rowing in the same direction. To get there, it's all about encouraging teamwork and collaboration. You want your team to feel like they're part of something bigger like they're all in the same boat and paddling together towards a common goal. Communication is also key. So keep those lines open and make sure everyone's voice is heard, and don't forget to sprinkle in some recognition and celebration along the way.


So, let's keep the energy high, the communication flowing and the good work rolling. With the right team spirit, there's no limit to what you can achieve together.

      Key Takeaways    



        Every business has a strategy because strategy involves making choices. However, the effectiveness of a strategy lies in whether these choices actively contribute to the business's goals and the delivery of value.
      


        This article outlines seven common but ineffective strategies that businesses may have unintentionally adopted and advice on how to make better choices.
      












    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

""One of the biggest problems with strategy is that the business doesn't have one."" It's common to read this phrase in articles that aim to identify why a business strategy isn't working.And yet, every business has a strategy because strategy is about choices — and the team makes choices every day. The issue is that the choices they make do not advance the business.Effective teams make deliberate choices so every action the business takes drives toward delivering the value the business exists to deliver.Related: 7 Strategies Businesses Can Use to Be Profitable and SustainableSeven common but ineffective business strategiesWhether you're consciously aware of it or not, you make choices based on something. That something and your choices serve as your strategy. Here are seven common but ineffective strategies you may have inadvertently adopted:



1. You're reactiveWhether it's a new idea, a raging fire or the ping in your inbox, you choose to act based on what hits you at that moment. I've made the mistake of saying this type of team isn't strategic when I meant to say they aren't deliberate. You're likely pedaling at full steam but not going anywhere.2. You do what you want to doYou build what you want to build. The quintessential example is a robotics company that wanted to build X even though all the input they received from their customers told them they needed Y. The company continued to build X because that's what they wanted to build. Now, they don't exist anymore. If you're the only one reaping value, you have a hobby, not a business.3. You do what you've always doneYou know the approach works. You're comfortable doing it. And you definitely don't want the stress of changing it. So you keep on keepin' on. Alas, too many businesses no longer exist because they failed to evolve. You must adapt what you do and how you do it because the world changes all the time.4. You chase the new cool thingEvery day brings new priorities that start with emails like, ""Check out how cool this is. We should do it."" Sometimes, you start a new thing because you enjoy creating. Sometimes, you do it because the new thing is simply more exciting than doing the hard work you actually need to do. Much like a reactive strategy, your team finds it hard to gain any traction or soothe their spinning heads.


5. You spend as little money as possibleYou scrutinize every investment looking for the cheapest option, including what could be done for free. Slowly, sometimes glacially, no one wants to work on your team, and your business loses all the resources required to do, well, anything.6. You go after the moneyYou see a way to get a lot of cash in the near term, so you immediately apply effort in that direction. Never mind what you were doing before. Never mind that you (somehow) want team members to keep doing that stuff, too. If you can put a check in the bank today, you'll worry about tomorrow later. Unfortunately, you may not have a business tomorrow.7. You pursue moreWhen someone asks for your strategy, you answer, ""To be the biggest company in the world!"" You pursue more markets, more users and more followers. When asked why, you say, ""Because we need to be the biggest!"" Your team has a tough time making choices and a high likelihood of running an unprofitable business.Related: 5 Common Growth Strategy Mistakes and How You Can Fix Them


How to make better choicesIt's not that the companies making choices in any of these seven ways don't have a strategy; they don't have a particularly good strategy. They may even operate using a few of these strategies at once, which only compounds the negative effects.New businesses launch every day. We can create products and services faster than ever before. And soon, production will come at pennies on the dollar. The only way to thrive is to focus on delivering meaningful value.Define the value you deliver by engaging the people you serve. Then make choices so everything you do as a business drives toward delivering that value. To succeed, you'll need to assess how your choices work — i.e., how effectively they deliver value — and adjust accordingly.Routinely gather input from the people you serve, your team and the external environment, so you're positioned to evolve your business as value shifts, your team grows and the world changes.


You and your team make choices every day. You choose to hold this meeting, adopt this software or launch this product. You need to make deliberate choices that advance your ability to effectively deliver value. The choices you make — and what you base them on — define your strategy. And like so many things, some strategies work better than others.Related: How to Recover From a Failed Strategy

62,3 Ways to Prepare Your Business For an AI Future,"Mar 6, 2024",Dean Guida,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-ways-to-prepare-your-business-for-an-ai-future/470297,"
It's official. AI has gone mainstream.Once reserved for researchers and enterprise companies alone, AI is now accessible to all kinds of organizations and everyday consumers. It's powering content and image generation, customer service, marketing personalization and, yes, even mechanical bees that are pollinating plants. And this is just the start of it.The growing capabilities of AI have quickly moved it from a buzzword to the top of businesses' to-do lists.



But there's no shortcut to implementing AI into your business. AI is more than just another platform in your tech stack – it's technology that can completely redefine how your company works and does business. This requires a complete organizational shift.AI is here to stay, but before businesses can fully dive into everything it has to offer, they have to make sure their organization and employees are ready for it. This includes the reskilling of employees, centralizing company data and making teams comfortable with AI, among other things.


Here are three ways to prepare your business for a future with AI.1. Make sure your data is AI-readyOrganizations today have hundreds of thousands of data points. Think, sales numbers, engagement with prospects, marketing stats, and so many others. The problem, however, lies in who has access to this data.Majority of the data within organizations is siloed between teams and executives – the sales team only has access to the sales data, the marketing team to marketing data, and so on. And for teams with access to data – it's spread across different channels and tools. For example, the marketing team has to check every individual platform they use (i.e., HubSpot, Google Ads, social media channels) for data and manually put it together to understand the big picture.All of this is to say that if employees can't even access their data easily, how is AI supposed to? Without data, AI cannot run.


Before companies can start their journey with AI, they need to centralize their data. One place where all of a company's data–or the metrics that performance, profitability, people and process–live and can be accessed by every employee.Companies that centralize their data will see benefits beyond AI as well. With data now at the hands of every employee, they'll increasingly look at it to make business decisions–rather than relying on their gut or guessing what's right.Related: AI May Not Take Your Job, But Someone Using AI Likely Will — Here's Why.2. Be transparent about AI's role in the workplaceWhile AI may have gone mainstream, there is much we still don't know about it. This can, understandably, cause some uneasiness among employees.Because it's still a new, developing technology, educating employees about AI and being transparent about how it will be used in the organization is important.There will inevitably be employees who think that implementing AI means that they're out of their jobs–but that's not the case.AI can help to complete the manual, time-consuming tasks that employees are responsible for daily, so employees can instead focus on more strategic and creative tasks. AI isn't taking their job – it's quite the opposite: AI is upleveling their role.An ongoing conversation with employees about AI and how the technology will evolve is crucial to AI's success in the workplace. It will help employees understand the why behind the technology and excite them about its opportunity.


3. Take it step by step with AIIt's easy to get excited by AI and its capabilities. There's so much potential in AI and its impact on your business–it's tempting to want to implement it as much as possible in every business area. But don't get in over your head.Start small with AI and then grow from there. There are new skills employees need to learn and tools they need to be onboarded to, not to mention getting used to AI in the workplace overall.Introduce AI to small pieces of a project instead of having it automatically take over a task. This will not only give employees time to learn how to use the technology but also make them feel comfortable enough with it to know it's there to help–not take over their job.Beyond onboarding employees to the technology and getting them to feel comfortable with it, it's critical to ensure that AI drives the success you want within the organization. There might be technology that doesn't work well for specific organizations, and that's ok, but it's better to figure that out before you move every aspect of your business to include AI.


Try introducing AI to specific departments or tasks for a few months and monitoring the success. If it's working, widen your work with AI. If it's not, it might be time to return to the drawing board.

63,Many Confident Leaders Resist Change — And These 5 Emotional Wounds Could Be to Blame,"Mar 6, 2024",Kelly L. Campbell,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-reasons-why-leaders-resist-change/469901,"
Confidence can be an effective leadership trait, and assertive self-confidence requires getting ahead of limiting beliefs to achieve what we desire or deem successful. But what if a leader's confidence is actually just one of the masks that help them assimilate in groups where power dynamics call for boldness and strength?How could that mask of confidence work against them and hinder the success of an organization when a leader is afraid of change?Five Soul WoundsRejection, abandonment, humiliation, betrayal and injustice are the five soul wounds often passed down to us by our parents, following us from childhood into adulthood. While first identified by an American physician and psychiatrist, a Canadian therapist wrote about them in her book and brought the research to the masses. The transference of wounds from generation to generation is actively discussed on social media, podcasts, and in other books like Heal to Lead.



Let's break down each of the five primary wounds as they apply to low-conscious or unhealed leadership.1. RejectionLeaders with the wound of rejection might withdraw from situations or discreetly avoid them altogether for fear of being rejected. Their ability to work anchors them in reality, which starkly contrasts the many ways in which they prefer to escape. Their people-pleasing tendencies are a means of self-protection, which can manifest as perfectionism and not asking for help in leadership roles.


Related: Rejection Is Part of Entrepreneurship. Here's How to Handle It.2. AbandonmentLeaders with the wound of abandonment project a type of sadness that is almost indefinable, as their deepest fear is loneliness. To combat the inner strife that causes mood changes, they can seem dependent on others, seeking advice and support to keep themselves in center focus. Compliments are a natural reward for overgiving, and if those are in short supply, leaders with wounds of abandonment may create drama to receive attention differently.3. HumiliationDeep feelings of shame accompany the wound of humiliation. For wounded leaders, this might show up as humility and taking care of others. They keep themselves busy because they fear freedom — associated with the absence of limits and engaging in too much fun, pleasure, or the like. These wounded leaders often tend toward self-deprecation to make others laugh; in this way, they control who humiliates them and to what extent.Related: Bullies At Work: Stamping Out Abuse In The Workplace


4. Betrayal (linked to Abandonment)The wound of betrayal shows up most often in people-controlling leaders because control is the mask they wear to avoid separation and denial. In demonstrating a lack of trust in others, these wounded leaders disempower those around them by setting standards impossibly high to ensure failure. Though unconscious, these authoritarian leaders are out to prove their perceived value by stepping on, manipulating, and mandating that others do things precisely how they would.5. Injustice (pairs with Rejection)Leaders with an injustice wound also tend toward people-pleasing, but the difference is in pretending that nothing impacts them. They refuse help and would rather run themselves into the ground than admit that they're tired or angry. In not wanting to be treated unfairly, they can project that onto others without realizing it. Everything must be justified, even if it means exaggerating or outright lying.Related: Why Trauma Integration Will Give You a Competitive Advantage in LeadershipResistance to changeSo, how do these soul wounds correlate to a strong resistance to change? Wounded leaders often employ unconscious survival strategies to ensure their worst fears don't materialize. In the face of uncertainty of any kind — where their safety could potentially be at risk — low-conscious leaders dig their heels into what will protect their ego, even if the change at hand would benefit their organization.


Change can be stressful and even terrifying for most people, but add the layer of a soul wound, and it can feel like life or death — because that's how the ego perceives it.When leaders are unaware of these unhealed aspects of themselves, those around them can suffer unnecessarily when on the receiving end of unhealed projections, from an organizational perspective, that can lead to higher employee attrition, a negative impact on morale and overall culture, and a plateau in revenue and innovation.When they feel resistance to change arises, the best thing leaders can do is to take radical responsibility for their own trauma integration. They can start with small steps that develop self-awareness, like listening to podcast episodes or reading books on the topic, or perhaps talking with a trauma-informed therapist or coach.If they won't do it for themselves (at first), they can think about how many others will benefit from their inner work. From family members to business partners, employees, clients, and community members — when leaders do the work, they become more adaptable to change. As a result of their improved abilities to self-regulate, embrace curiosity, and make decisions for the good of the whole, their organizations grow more flexible to meet uncertainty with ease.

64,Why Middle Managers Are a Company's Hidden Superpower,"Mar 6, 2024",Sam Rockwell,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-middle-managers-are-secretly-the-heart-of-a-company/469682,"
When I set out to study organizational identity and the role that organizational leaders play in creating and reinforcing that identity, I expected to uncover some surprising results. Even then, I did not expect what I learned from Ervis Dinkel, a director in a financial management firm. She described her role in middle management as that of the translator — adding that middle managers are responsible for listening and communicating expertly all the way up and down the organization.This descriptor struck me because I have worked with many translators in my decades of nonprofit and consulting work worldwide. As I thought more, I realized that ""translator"" is a perfect term for middle managers' role in propagating organizational identity. Let me explain.Translation begins with in-depth listening and then involves converting the original message into words and a delivery that another party will understand. This skill requires constant code-switching and cross-cultural sensitivity because communication needs to be bidirectional and continuous for shared understanding to result. This is no small feat.



Related: Why We Should Be Talking About Organizational Identity and Not Just Company CultureThe same is true for middle managers, who serve as conduits between upper and frontline management. Like translators working at the borders of two or more cultures and languages, middle managers work at the borders of two distinct subcultures and languages within the organization.


As articulated by Robert L. Katz, a strategy consultant who had served on Dartmouth, Harvard and Stanford faculties, upper management is concerned with conceptual and strategic matters, slightly less with interpersonal concerns, and even less with the technical details of how the work is carried out.In contrast, frontline managers and individual contributors focus on technical details, with the least concern for strategic matters. Standing in the gap are the middle managers, who must have robust competencies in all three domains because they must speak the language and understand the concerns of all levels for information to flow effectively throughout the organization. It is not enough to pass down senior leader mandates and expect the frontline to implement them. Nor is it sufficient to simply report to upper management what first-level managers and individual contributors are experiencing.Related: 3 Practices for Leaders in a Polarized WorldAccording to Dinkel, an effective organizational translator requires significant mental and emotional energy. When it is done right, organizational performance is supported and enhanced. When it's not done well, communication breaks down, misunderstandings proliferate, and initiatives face an increased risk of failure.


The translation challenge can be particularly acute when it comes to matters of who the organization is and what we need to do collectively and individually.For example, these concerns usually center on the language of ""organizational identity"" at the upper levels, while ""culture"" is the terminology used more frequently at lower levels. These are not synonymous concepts: Whereas culture refers to the shared assumptions and values that culminate in habitual patterns of behavior within the organization, identity refers to those characteristics of the organization that are core, distinctive and enduring — adding up to ""who"" the organization essentially is.Related: How Business Leaders Can Foster an Innovative Work CultureBoth identity and culture are powerful, influencing each other, yet they are not the same. Thus, as translators, middle managers must understand these differences and take extra care to translate messages into the language and lifeworld of each subculture. Only then can shared understanding develop, leading to alignment among culture, identity, strategy, and tactics. In turn, the organization can act in concert as one entity.


Four tactics are helpful for carrying out the middle management translator role.1. See what they seeGerman philosopher Edmund Husserl and later phenomenologists developed the concept of the lifeworld to suggest that people perceive, make sense of, and interact with the world depending on their subjective experiences, surroundings, and interactions. It follows that senior leaders operate within different lifeworlds than do middle managers, and both of those lifeworlds are different from the lifeworlds of frontline managers and individual contributors. Middle managers must become familiar with all these lifeworlds and their differences in order to anticipate how each level may interpret organizational communications and, in turn, encode messages appropriately.2. Speak like a nativeTranslators must develop fluency in the vocabulary, idioms, and nuances of the multiple languages in which they operate. As a middle manager, you must speak the languages of senior leaders, frontline managers, and individual contributors like a native. Specifically, some concepts may not have direct equivalents across levels due to cultural and language nuances. Such differences can significantly impact the meaning of a text. Therefore, middle managers need to engage in frequent interaction and immersion at each organizational level to deeply understand the viewpoints, needs, and concerns of each group.3. Communicate whole messagesEffective translation requires communicating not only the text but also the tone, emotion and subtle cues to convey the intended meaning. In this way, middle management translators convey the spirit, meaning, and content of what is most important to each party. Without whole messages, the inspiration behind senior leaders' vision may fall flat, or conversely, the dire technical challenges experienced by the frontline may get lost during upward communication.


4. Navigate your biasesPersonal bias is inevitable; therefore, be mindful of it and control it. Depending on your personality and predispositions, you may find yourself oriented toward shepherding and translating what is happening at the top to your direct reports. Alternately, you may be more naturally drawn toward bringing direct reports' perspectives to senior leadership strategy sessions. It is not uncommon to feel drawn in one direction and fatigued moving in the other direction. Be aware of these tendencies and make time for self-care so that you have the energy to navigate up and down. Finally, be intentional about spending equal time and attention translating in both directions because both are essential to the healthy and aligned functioning of the organization.

65,These 5 Economic Trends Will Drive Consumer Spending in 2024,"Mar 6, 2024",Daniel Altman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/these-5-economic-trends-will-drive-consumer-spending-in-2024/469732,"
Spring is just around the corner, promising a thaw not just in the weather but also in household spending. Consumers will be leaving their homes again to enjoy baseball games, soccer matches and other outdoor events, as well as conventions and corporate meetings. In the past few years, consumers were able to fund their exploits by drawing on trillions of dollars in savings that built up during the Covid-19 pandemic. But what about this year?1. The spending bonanza is about to run its courseAccording to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, households saved about $2.1 trillion more than usual during the pandemic. Because people were confined mainly to their homes, they simply didn't spend as much money. When the economy started to open up in 2021 and 2022, consumers started spending this money with a vengeance — in some cases literally.Now, however, only a fraction of this money is left. The same economists have written that only about $200 million in extra savings remained at the end of last year, and they expect it to disappear in the first half of 2024.



This means consumers may have one more big spring season left in them for travel, leisure and entertainment, as well as all the other goods and services that are typically in demand, from hot dogs to wedding rings. After this spring, however, consumers are unlikely to feel as flush.Related: Where Will the Economy Go Next? What to Watch For in 2024


2. The balance of spending is still shifting back toward servicesFor decades, consumers have been shifting their spending away from goods and toward services. Prices for goods have come down in relative terms, travel has become more popular, housing has become more expensive and the arrivals of the internet, mobile phones and fiber-optic connections have greatly expanded the services available to consumers.But this long-term trend stunningly reversed during the pandemic. In February 2020, consumers spent about 31% of their dollars on goods. By March 2021, this share had risen to 35%, the highest share since 2006. And now, with prices for goods basically flat, half of the change has disappeared. Over the next few years, it's likely that the long-term trend will resume.3. Consumers will pull back on big purchasesWhen consumers could draw on big pools of savings, it was easier for them to buy expensive goods and services ranging from new smartphones to Taylor Swift tickets. Without this extra liquidity, the big-ticket items will not be as accessible. Consumers will be more likely to smooth out their spending via smaller purchases.The change will be especially notable for items that are harder to finance, like cars where dealers insist on downpayments in cash. With time, interest rates on credit cards, car loans and the like will come down in parallel with the Fed's cuts. Yet this process is likely to take many months, and consumers may postpone big purchases in anticipation.


4. There won't be a big boost to spending when the Federal Reserve cuts ratesFor months, executives and investors have been waiting for the Fed to cut short-term interest rates — and many have assumed that there will be six or seven quarter-point cuts this year. But Fed officials have maintained their intention to cut three times, and recent data on inflation could make them even more cautious.Stock prices aren't likely to rise much higher when cuts begin, so there won't be a lot of newfound wealth to propel spending. Wall Street bonuses, which can drive markets for luxury goods and services, were also disappointing this year. If anything, uncertainty about the elections in November is likely to keep the markets — and investors' exuberance — on hold.Related: Interest Rates Are Going to Drop This Year. Here Are 6 Ways Businesses Can Take Advantage When the Time Comes.5. Caution in the labor market could also be a drag on spendingWith the unemployment rate still below 4% and a high level of economic uncertainty, companies have become reluctant to make all but the most essential hires. Raises are also likely to be small alongside slowing inflation. This could restrain income growth, which will in turn affect spending.


Businesses that do need labor — like the stadiums that will fill in the spring — are relying increasingly on temporary workers. And even companies that might have been looking for permanent employees are turning instead to flexible workers on long-term assignments. They're easier to find and hire, and they don't require the same level of commitment. To the extent that full-time jobs are replaced by these fractional jobs as a result of economic uncertainty, consumers' spending may be lower.In the short term, we may see one more bonanza for consumer-facing businesses, especially in the service sector — and we expect them to hire proportionally. In the second half of the year, the picture becomes cloudier. But unlike the forces unleashed by the pandemic, none of the other trends is entirely unprecedented. So the best course of action for business leaders is to consider how trends like these have affected revenue in the past, and then project what they might do to revenue in the future.

66,Why These 5 Characteristics of Self-Reliance Will Guarantee Your Success,"Mar 5, 2024",Maha Abouelenein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/follow-these-5-characteristics-of-self-reliance-to-succeed/469983,"
Decades ago, my dad told me that relying on myself was vital for my success and personal growth. His advice is more relevant now than ever. In today's business landscape, where technology — such as OpenAI's Sora — is advancing quickly and workers across industries are being laid off, self-reliance is crucial for long-term entrepreneurial success.Throughout my career, I've practiced self-reliance (whether I knew it at each moment or not). I've found that entrepreneurs who do not have a self-reliant mindset are more likely to fail because they struggle to make tough decisions, solve problems, or take necessary risks for success. Self-reliance empowers you to adapt swiftly to shifting market dynamics and reduces your dependence on external factors. You are driven to innovate, relying on your ingenuity and resourcefulness to develop solutions.When I say self-reliance, I don't mean going at it alone; it's about knowing when to seek help and where to find it. Self-reliance involves looking inward for answers and reaching outward for support and ideas. As a self-reliant entrepreneur, you think big and bold without waiting for others to solve problems for you.



There are five inherent characteristics of self-reliance that entrepreneurs should embrace for success:1. Take initiative and don't be afraid to innovateEntrepreneurs benefit from self-reliance by taking initiative and innovating. This mindset of self-reliance allows them to turn ideas into reality, identify opportunities, and create solutions independently. In challenging situations, a self-reliant entrepreneur explores alternative plans to keep the business moving.


For instance, when faced with financial challenges in my company, I cut non-essential expenses. Then I innovated by expanding our offerings to a wider clientele through online workshops. This initiative, born out of self-reliance, not only added value but also generated a new and consistent revenue stream without increasing prices or overhead. Entrepreneurs' ability to innovate and take initiative is fundamental to self-reliance.Moreover, taking the initiative as an entrepreneur is crucial for staying ahead of the competition. Entrepreneurs can carve out their niche and distinguish themselves from competitors by actively seeking opportunities and proactively addressing challenges.Whether launching a new product, entering a new market, or exploring new technologies, entrepreneurs can find growth and success when they take the initiative.2. Be adaptableEntrepreneurs who embrace self-reliance possess the critical qualities of adaptability and agility. Challenges are inevitable in entrepreneurship, and they require quick adaptation and adjustment. Take, for example, the transition to remote work during the pandemic. As entrepreneurs, we had to quickly figure out how to operate our businesses and network from home. Entrepreneurs who embraced adaptability and adopted new collaboration tools and strategies were successful. They sustained their business operations and discovered newfound efficiencies and flexibility that continue to benefit them.


Adaptability is crucial as entrepreneurs navigate the complexities of remote work and ""return to office"" policies. We must carefully assess the impact of returning to the office on employee morale, work-life balance, and overall productivity. Striking the right balance between remote and in-person work while addressing individual preferences and concerns is paramount for fostering a supportive and inclusive work environment.Related: Success Is the Biggest Benefit of Being Adaptable3. Trust your instincts and take accountabilityThroughout my career, I have found that a self-reliance mindset allows you to trust your judgment, instincts, and vision. Owning a business involves constant decision-making that impacts the company's trajectory – from personnel management to business relationships. As leaders, we often face high-stakes decisions that shape our success's strategic and financial direction. While data and analysis are essential, sometimes you must go with your gut feeling.Trusting your instincts means having confidence in your judgment and intuition, even when uncertain. Whether deciding which market to enter or which partner to collaborate with, you must rely on your instincts to guide you. While not every decision will be perfect, trusting your instincts can lead to innovative ideas, bold moves, and success. It enables you to make decisions that align with your company's needs, no matter the situation.


I want to point out that a vital aspect of trusting your instincts is taking accountability for your decisions. Entrepreneurs who embody self-reliance understand that they alone are responsible for the success or failure of their ventures. By holding themselves accountable, they demonstrate commitment to their goals and responsibilities and avoid reliance on external factors or excuses. This mindset fosters personal growth, drives initiative, and enables entrepreneurs to persevere in the face of challenges, ultimately enhancing the resilience and sustainability of their efforts.4. Have confidence in your abilities and leadershipThe entrepreneurial journey is often likened to a roller coaster, marked by ups and downs, requiring leadership, grit, and resilience. Entrepreneurs wear many hats and handle various responsibilities. The initial challenges of being the boss, answering questions, and providing solutions can be daunting, but working across the business fosters self-reliance, instilling confidence in one's abilities. I've learned that this confidence is crucial for earning trust from clients, stakeholders, and your team. Self-reliance is vital in making internal decisions, offering feedback, and cultivating a proactive, problem-solving culture. Moreover, the confidence derived from self-reliance aids in hiring the right people and building a winning formula based on training and trust.Related: 10 Ways to Build Your Entrepreneurial Confidence5. Seek opportunities to learn and improveIn today's world, continuous learning is essential for success. Successful entrepreneurs adopt a growth mindset, actively seeking opportunities to learn and improve. They embrace feedback and constantly search for new skills to master. For example, you may attend workshops, courses, or networking events relevant to your industry. You might also engage in mentorship or coaching programs to gain insights from seasoned professionals and learn from their experiences. I recently took a proactive approach to expand my knowledge of finance and attended a specialized course at the London Business School.


Entrepreneurs must be curious, open to learning, and willing to acquire new knowledge to stay prepared. You must view a growth mindset as taking ownership of your education and remaining open-minded about what you don't know.

67,5 Best Interview Questions to Ask Potential Employees —And What Their Answers Reveal,"Mar 5, 2024",Entrepreneur Staff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-5-best-questions-to-ask-potential-employees/470273,"
The job interview is one of the best ways to determine if a candidate will mesh with the company's culture and add to its long-term success. Sure, they might look stellar on their resume, but a lot can be revealed when a candidate is asked pointed questions about their background and working style.Some human resource managers screen candidates, asking a few preliminary questions over the phone before bringing them in for a formal interview with managers. Others save time by turning to AI-powered platforms such as CandidateView, which allows them to ask prerecorded questions and view applicants' answers via video. Still, others skip the pre-screening process altogether and go right for person-to-person interviews out the gate.Whatever your interview process, you want to ask questions that give you a clearer view of the candidate's work ethic, values, and personality. While there are no guarantees that any candidate will be the perfect match, here are some of the best interview questions to boost your chances of finding an employee who will strengthen your workforce.



Related: Avoid Costly Hiring Mistakes With These Five Essential TipsCultural fitA good cultural fit means recruiting employees whose values and shared behaviors align with your company's. As the saying goes, fitting a square peg in a round hole is tricky. So why force it if it's not a good match?


During the interview or a video-based pre-interview, be sure to ask a few questions that dive a bit deeper into the candidate's past experience navigating other work environments.Ask: Can you tell me about a time when your workplace had a great culture? What did management do to foster that? Now, tell me about a time when the workplace was toxic? What do you think management did wrong?By posing two contracting cultural scenarios, you will better understand what the candidate believes makes a good work environment and what breeds disharmony.Management styleWhether you're hiring someone in a junior-level or management role, it's helpful to understand how they prefer to be managed. Some employees like the autonomous, hands-off approach, while others thrive with clear objectives and guidelines.


Ask: How you best like to be managed? Describe the ideal manager for your personality style.The answer will help determine if the candidate will get along with the specific manager or department. For example, if they prefer a results-based manager who doesn't care how they do their work as long as they get it done, they may not fit with someone who is more hands-on.Self-awarenessIntrospection is a vital skill for any employee because it reveals an ability to be honest about one's strengths and weaknesses—and helps them make better decisions. For example, if an employee knows they struggle with public speaking, they might improve those skills or delegate the task to another employee.Ask: If you had to weigh in on your challenges, what areas would you want to work on to improve?


The answer reveals several important things: It helps you determine if a candidate can self-reflect, and it gives you some insight into their strengths and weaknesses. Beware of the candidate who says they have no challenges. Everyone has room to improve, and people who don't think so are probably not being honest with themselves.Related: The 10 Communication Skills Every Entrepreneur Must MasterConflict resolutionUnless you're working in Barbieland, there will always be challenges in the workplace. How an employee deals with these hurdles can be the difference between harmonious conflict resolution and a train wreck. During the interview, hone in on specific challenges the candidate has encountered and what they did to resolve them.Ask: Tell me about a conflict you faced at work and how you dealt with it.


Listen for clues on how they relied on their skillset to resolve the issue. Did they take a conscientious and considerate look at the situation first? Did they manage to stay calm? Did they collaborate with others to find a solution? These are some of the C's you want to look out for.Related: Here's What Hiring Managers Should Focus On to Find Their Next Great Employee.Detail orientedEmployees who pay attention to the details tend to produce work more aligned with your needs and require less supervision and hand-holding. There's an old standby question, a classic but a goodie, that can help you determine right off the bat if they're detail-oriented.Ask: Why do you want to work for our company?


When you ask this question, you get a better understanding of how well the candidate prepped for their interview. Their answer tells you if they've researched your company and what product or service you sell. If they've done their homework, it's a good indicator that they pay attention to details.Related: Here's What to Expect in a Job Interview in Today's Job Market

69,He Built a Personal Finance App That Manages $8 Billion for Half a Million Customers. Here Is the CEO of M1's Hard-Earned Advice for Future Founders.,"Mar 4, 2024",William Salvi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/m1-ceo-brian-barnes-on-creating-a-fintech-platform-built-to/470390,"
We've been visiting the headquarters of some of the most innovative and imaginative leaders in business for The CEO Series, learning what it takes to launch and grow a thriving brand. For this episode, our crew went to the office of M1, a fintech platform that bills itself as ""the finance super app."" The powerful online investing and banking platform has raised $315 million at a valuation of about $1.5 billion and manages about $8 billion for half a million customers. I sat down with founder and CEO Brian Barnes to learn all about the platform, how it was created, and his advice to founders on running a company built to last.Below are some highlights of our conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity. You can watch the full video above.The thrill of investing""M1 is a personal finance platform. We started the company about eight and a half years ago. We now manage about $8 billion on the platform for half a million customers. And we are really just trying to create the best possible way for someone to manage their finances. And we do that with a lot of personalization, customization, and automation. I was fortunate to be introduced to finance at a pretty young age and I was immediately hooked. I love the idea of investing, of trying to find out what a company's worth and how it's operating in a complex world. As an investor, you're making a high-conviction bet. If you're right, you make money. If you're wrong, you lose money. And so, you know, some people like sports gambling. For me, it is what is a company going to be worth in the next five or ten years.""

There are companies out there that have lasted for centuries. If you are around for that period of time, it's unquestionable that you're going to have these massive disruptions in the overall market. And so we have been trying to build the organization so that we can survive in any macro environment and not just be tailor-made for one.""


Calm in the storm""I try to stay calm — on the outside. [Laughs] The entrepreneurship quote I love is that the highs are high, the lows are low and they're ten minutes apart. There are times when you think you're taking over the world. And then there are times where you're like, What the hell am I doing? I took all this money, I convinced people to quit their jobs and join me, I'm competing against the Schwabs of the world. But stewing in all of that stress accomplishes nothing. I think maintaining my emotions and figuring out how I can allocate my time productively has been a good attribute that I've had as I've built the organization.""Related: How Personal Passions Fuel Business Success for the CEO of Vivid SeatsThe life of a founder""Being a founder of a tech company is more than just being a CEO. You're both the most senior and most junior person at the company. You get to set direction and strategy and things like that, but in any area where there is not someone dedicated to that role? It's on you to fill the gap. I would say I played CEO from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. And then I played junior analyst from 11 a.m. to midnight every night. You're just running around and trying to add value where you can. As you grow, you'd love to put things on pause while you figure out how to scale your team. But that's not how it works — you've got to scale your team and build a product and acquire customers at the same time. There's a little bit of chaos, but you have to sort of thrive in the chaos.""Related: Inside Potbelly's Recipe for Fast Casual Success


Legacy of leadership""My mom Brenda Barnes was CEO of PepsiCo and Sarah Lee. I mean, that's a great person to learn from. She was one of seven sisters. They all shared a bedroom. They were a Polish immigrant family in Chicago. Her father was a factory worker. And so, I think she always had an insanely healthy respect for people who did the actual work at her companies. The people who bottled the cola, who loaded the delivery trucks. As a CEO, you need to respect that they know their job better than you. And the leader's job is to set an example for what you want the values across the company to be. If you could write down all the positive attributes and values that you would want instilled throughout the company, then you better exhibit those things.""Check out more profiles of innovative and impactful leaders by visiting The CEO Series archives.

70,How Tech Companies Can Harness the Power of Non-Verbal Communication for Enhanced Efficiency,"Mar 1, 2024",Greg Davis,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-harness-the-power-of-soft-communication-for-enhanced/470360,"
The importance of soft communication and operational efficiency cannot be overstated in today's fast-paced business world. These concepts, often overlooked, play a crucial role in the success and fluidity of a company's operations. Similar to the bustling environment of a restaurant, where seamless non-verbal communication ensures efficiency, the same principles apply to other business settings, including tech companies.Soft communication involves the subtle, often non-verbal interactions that occur in a workplace. These cues, whether a nod, a glance or an unspoken understanding, contribute significantly to the smooth operation of a team. They help convey messages quickly and efficiently, reducing the need for constant verbal directives. In environments where time is of the essence, these forms of communication are invaluable.Recognizing and understanding these non-verbal signals requires high team cohesion and awareness. Employees who are tuned into each other's habits and preferences can anticipate needs and actions without explicit instructions. This intuitive understanding enhances workflow and minimizes disruptions, leading to a more streamlined work process.



Related: 7 Communication Skills Every Entrepreneur Must MasterThe role of non-verbal cues in team dynamicsNon-verbal cues play a pivotal role in facilitating smooth communication in a team setting. These cues, ranging from facial expressions to body language, help convey emotions and intentions, often more effectively than words. They serve as an undercurrent of communication, complementing verbal interactions and providing additional context. Being attuned to these cues in a business setting can prevent misunderstandings and foster clearer communication.


Building trust and reliability in a business settingTrust and reliability are foundational elements of effective team dynamics. Just like in a restaurant where staff trust that someone will fill the ice bin without being told, in business, this level of trust ensures that each team member can focus on their tasks without worry. Knowing that everyone will handle their responsibilities effectively creates a sense of security and confidence within the team. This trust is not built overnight but develops over time through consistent and reliable actions.Reliability, a key component of this trust, is demonstrated when team members consistently meet their commitments. It's about knowing that colleagues will deliver on their promises, which reduces the need for micromanagement and fosters independence. This reliability strengthens the team's cohesion and enables a more efficient division of labor.Learning from the operational dynamics of a restaurantThe operational dynamics of a restaurant offer valuable insights into efficient team management. In a restaurant, staff members often work in close quarters under time pressure, requiring high coordination and unspoken communication. This environment demands quick decision-making and an implicit understanding of each other's roles and responsibilities. Observing these dynamics provides lessons in operational efficiency that can be applied to various business settings.Restaurants function smoothly when there is a clear division of labor, with each staff member understanding their role and the roles of others. This understanding enables them to anticipate needs and respond accordingly without explicit direction. Such a system reduces confusion, increases speed and ensures a high level of service.


The principles of operational efficiency in restaurants can be effectively translated into the tech industry. Clear and efficient communication is vital in tech companies, where projects often involve multiple team members. Adopting the restaurant model of implicit communication and role clarity can streamline processes and reduce time wasted on unnecessary discussions. This can be especially beneficial in fast-paced tech environments where quick adaptability and responsiveness are crucial.Just as chefs and waitstaff coordinate seamlessly to deliver meals promptly, tech teams can synchronize their efforts for timely project completion. This requires a clear understanding of each team member's strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to support each other effectively.Related: One Negotiation Expert Shares the 4 Body Language Cues Every Entrepreneur Should RecognizeActionable strategies to foster an efficient workplaceTo cultivate an environment of efficient soft communication, it's essential to establish clear roles within the team. This clarity allows team members to understand their responsibilities and how they fit into the larger picture. It also helps set expectations and reduce ambiguities, which is crucial for smooth operations. Clear role definition is the first step towards building an environment where non-verbal communication can flourish.


Fostering open communication is another vital strategy. Encouraging team members to share their thoughts and ideas openly can build trust and mutual understanding. Regular team meetings and feedback sessions can facilitate this. In addition, creating a culture where team members feel confident that their colleagues will deliver on their commitments is essential.Cultivating a culture of unspoken understanding and commitmentDeveloping a culture of unspoken understanding and commitment requires a consistent and deliberate effort. It starts with leadership setting an example in non-verbal communication and trust-building. Leaders should demonstrate the behavior they wish to see, such as reliability, attentiveness to non-verbal cues and a commitment to the team's goals. This sets a precedent for the rest of the team to follow.In the ever-evolving landscape of modern business, the significance of soft communication has never been more pronounced. As teams become more diverse and projects more complex, the ability to communicate efficiently, both verbally and non-verbally, becomes increasingly important. Soft communication facilitates quicker decision-making, reduces misunderstandings and builds a cohesive team dynamic. These qualities are essential for businesses aiming to stay agile and competitive in today's fast-paced environment.Related: Improve Your Company's Efficiency with These 5 Strategies

71,5 Strategies for Dealing with High Employee Turnover,"Mar 1, 2024",Dave Ragosa,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-strategies-to-reduce-employee-turnover/469939,"
Do you sometimes feel like your employees are on a fast-moving conveyor belt out the door, and you're on a sluggish treadmill as you try to hire and train their replacements? You're not imagining things, and you're not alone. Aways an unfortunate fact of business life, employee turnover has only gotten worse – as high as 24% above pre-pandemic levels, according to Gartner, Inc. But you can take steps to minimize it or at least lessen the harm it does.The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), citing a study by the Work Institute, says employee turnover adds up to some $680 billion in training costs and lost productivity. High turnover can also lead to decreased morale among remaining staff, inconsistency in service quality and, ultimately, a negative impact on the bottom line.Even more frustrating, SHRM believes three of four workers who quit could have been retained.



As a restaurant, Ford's Garage is certainly not immune to turnover problems. We employ various strategies to retain employees, including offering competitive wages and benefits, fostering a positive work environment, providing opportunities for advancement and skill development, implementing recognition and reward programs and actively soliciting employee feedback to address concerns and make improvements.Related: How Employee Retention is Impacted by Various Leadership StylesHere's what we've learned about the best ways to manage rising resignation rates and try to reduce them:1. Don't ignore itWhile some turnover is inevitable, excessively high turnover rates indicate underlying issues that must be addressed. Take a look at working conditions, compensation, staffing levels and other factors that may be leading team members to head for the door. You may be unable to fix everything, but ignoring the situation cannot be an option.Related: Here's Why So Many Companies Are Losing Employees Shortly After Onboarding2. Take care of your remaining employeesStaff members left behind will have higher workloads, at least temporarily, and may suffer from stress and low morale. It's crucial to prioritize communication, transparency and support for them. Providing opportunities for recognition, professional development and work-life balance can help mitigate the harmful effects of turnover. And don't forget your managers, especially those at mid-level. If you have a seven-day operation, as most retailers and restaurants do, think about rotating local managers so they can take off one or two weekends a month.


3. Remember, it's not always about the moneyPay and benefits undoubtedly play a significant role in employee resignations, but they're not the sole determinants. While competitive pay and benefits are essential for attracting and retaining talent, good working conditions, such as a positive company culture, opportunities for growth and development, and work-life balance, can compensate for slightly lower compensation in some cases. Bear in mind that while flexible work arrangements can be a valuable retention tool for businesses that can offer them, it's essential to balance flexibility with operational needs and ensure clear communication and accountability to maintain productivity and teamwork.4. Foster a culture of continuous improvementHigh-performing team members leave an even bigger hole than most of their colleagues, so they need special attention to keep them motivated. Are you offering them assignments that excite and challenge them? Does their work align with their career goals? Ask them what keeps them returning and how you can help them achieve their goals. They need to be driven and motivated to see the growth and how they contribute to it so they don't leave.Related: Attract Top Talent: Show Them You Have What They Want5. Stay positiveI'm not saying you should ""look on the bright side"" of losing longtime employees, which can have potentially harmful effects on everyone. However, employee turnover can have some positive outcomes. It's an opportunity for workers to step up and show what they can do, revealing talent you never knew your team had. It can also foster innovation and fresh perspectives. Just be careful how you present this attitude to your team; don't give the impression that you think it's great news.


Making work worthwhileIndividuals seek opportunities that align better with their personal and professional aspirations. However, other factors such as job dissatisfaction, lack of growth opportunities and workplace culture play significant roles, so make sure you address all of the above-mentioned to keep your employees motivated and keep them with your company.

72,Does Personality or Past Experience Matter More When Hiring? Here's What to Focus On to Find Your Next Great Employee.,"Mar 1, 2024",Jonathan Small,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-personality-traits-hiring-managers-should-look-for-in/470093,"
Every hiring manager wants to find the perfect candidate for the job.But the application process is set up against them. Typically, the first step involves reviewing a resume and possibly a cover letter that lists the applicant's hard skills and experience. Unfortunately, many job seekers don't make it past this initial screening stage if their prior experience doesn't perfectly align with the job listing, and they never have the opportunity to showcase their personality in an interview. This process plays over again and again thousands of times a day in HR departments across the country.It doesn't seem very effective and according to a study conducted by education company Hyper Island, it is worse than it sounds. Hyper Island polled 500-plus leaders across companies in the communication, technology, and business development industries and asked which candidate attributes would make them want to hire them. Seventy-eight percent of respondents picked ""personality"" as the quality they most wanted in employees. ""Cultural alignment"" was next. Guess what was dead last on the list? ""Skill-set.""



Technology is helping hiring managers overcome this roadblock. New platforms, such as CandidateView, ask potential employees to record themselves answering custom-tailored interview questions. This way hiring managers can quickly get a sense of the person behind the resume before deciding whether or not to call them in.So what are some key personality traits managers should look for before hiring an employee? Here are five attributes that experts say will help predict if this person will be a good fit for your company.


Related: Avoid Costly Hiring Mistakes With These Five Essential Tips1. Good people skillsPlaying nicely with others sounds like something valued in preschool, but it's just as important in the workplace. You want to hire employees who are good communicators, collaborators, and just easy to be around.Billionaire Richard Branson argues that a good personality ""always wins over book smarts."" In an article for LinkedIn called ""You Can't Fake Personality, Passion or Purpose,"" he writes, ""Company knowledge and job-specific skills can be learned, but you can't train a personality. We look for people who are friendly and considerate and who like working with others.""2. Problem solverA resume may tell you how long a potential employee worked at a certain job and what they accomplished, but how good are they at solving problems? The ability to face and resolve challenges head-on is a characteristic worth its price in gold in any business.


How do you find a problem solver? If you are using a video pre-interview platform, start by asking them about a problem they faced in a previous role and how they pushed through it. This is a strong screener question that can help determine if you to take the time to meet this candidate in person.3. ConfidentA job candidate's resume might tell you they've accomplished much in their career. But competence is one thing—having self-confidence pushes a person past the finish line.Whether your job candidate is coming in at a junior or senior level, their self-confidence matters when communicating with others, making decisions, and taking risks.Look for employees who can explain their strengths with real-life examples from past jobs. If someone avoids eye contact or has trouble speaking clearly during the interview, that might be a red flag.

Without it, you will continually feel anxious about delegating any responsibility and will either avoid this co-worker or start to micromanage them. Neither is a good strategy.Reliability is one of those soft skills that's hard to predict just by looking at someone's past experience. Be sure to identify candidates with a stable work history who don't hop around jobs every few months. Trustworthy employees tend to commit to roles for extended periods.Also, check their references. If you don't want to ask upfront if they're trustworthy, ask about their attendance record, consistency, and whether a past employer was comfortable assigning them a complicated task.


5. CoachableIs the potential employee open to learning, or do they think they know how everything is supposed to be? If the answer is the latter, you want to stay far away. One key personality trait is an openness to learning. You want to hire an employee who is eager to grow and has enough humility to ask questions if they don't know how to do something.To determine if someone is coachable, ask them about their past experiences learning from a colleague. Have them share an experience in which they learned a new skill from someone in the workplace. Ask them what they learned and why it was meaningful for them.

73,How to Lead With Positive Energy (Even When Times Get Tough),"Feb 29, 2024",Taja Dockendorf,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-lead-with-positive-energy-even-when-times-get-tough/469577,"
When the most recent ""recession"" hit, I didn't worry. And as it still looms, I continue to exercise the choice to not worry. Mainly because I've learned not to fear the unknown. Moving forward without fear has become second nature to me.As a leader, brand co-owner and owner of a creative agency, I know fear is the last thing I need. Instead, I need to be proactive and aligned with this truth: That even in a time of slowing economic growth, we will continue to find space for our business. I need to unlock every single door and window, and what we need will come. It always does.This is the power of positive energy in leadership.Related: 8 Ways to Stay Positive Regardless of What Is Going on Around YouHow to lead with positive energyHolding positive energy as a leader is essentially about removing fear from the process. Fear blocks opportunity and isolates, while positive energy attracts on a quantum level. Both are a state of mind and a bodily response that we can affect with our choices and intentions.



When we lead with positive energy, it comes down to not leading with the assumption that there's always a problem threatening to overtake you; it's about leading knowing there is always, always a solution.But let's be clear: This isn't about plastering fake smiles on our faces while our world crumbles around us. I've come to understand that the power of realistic positive energy doesn't come from ignoring the challenges we face. It's about acknowledging them, accepting their existence, and then choosing to respond in a way that fosters growth and development. It's about approaching them with resilience, optimism and a belief that we can overcome. It's about leading with a mindset that promotes constructive, grounded optimism — a space where acknowledging imperfections and setbacks isn't a sign of weakness, but instead an opportunity for learning and improvement.For me, how I live and lead with the power of positive energy means understanding our journey is a continuous evolution, where each step forward, no matter how small, contributes to our growth. It means acknowledging rough patches are a natural part of life, and they can serve as stepping stones to something greater if we choose to approach them with the right mindset.I won't sugarcoat it. Leading with this perspective isn't all rainbows and butterflies. There are moments of doubt and unforeseen challenges that can test even the most positive of attitudes. It's during these times, though, that the power of constructive positivity can really help us advance.


Related: How to Actually Be Your Most Positive SelfHow to cultivate and maintain this mindsetCultivating and keeping this mindset takes time and intention. It requires finding your own inner peace, moments of glimmer and a stable center you can come back to when things become turbulent.Easier said than done, right? But try this: Remember a time and place when things felt easy, when they flowed, and you were content. Think back to how you felt in that moment — open, energized, happy, excited — and try to find that same feeling again. That feeling can be your base, a place of realization and understanding that opens you to positive energy flow.For me, this process started with utilizing my own style of meditation and vibrational sound work, which included teaching myself to be in the moment and present to how I was feeling. Later, I taught myself how to meditate into sleep and hold that state. From there, I was able to deeply relax, let go and ease into this mindset in my conscious hours. What I found then was no matter what the issue, fear or concern, I had a solution and a more generative and open mindset the next morning. I entered the new day ready to move forward.


Today, I don't meditate often, but I continue to offer my body and mind deep sleep and rest. High-quality sleep continues to be a powerful energetic reset for me. It's a time when I can release what isn't helpful, let a problem's moving pieces reshuffle and reorganize, and trust the answers will come.Related: This Simple But Effective 'Positivity Challenge' Will Completely Change Your MindsetQuestions to ask yourselfWhat you need to find your own stable center and lead with constructive positivity might look different. Here are some questions and tips that can help you tune in to what will help you in this journey:What helps you access your intuition, allowing you to make your best choices?What activities — which might include things like sleep, meditation, running or even driving — bring your best ideas and solutions forward?Spend some time getting to know and understand your full capability. What strengths and personal power can you access when you go to the deepest level? In other words, what brings you an abundance of energy and excitement?Unpack your mistakes, so you can learn from them and own them. Then make a conscious effort to use those failures as fuel. When it feels like something new is falling apart, don't be afraid to ask yourself: What is the worst-case scenario? And then: What essential things are still preserved, even then? Once you've made some level of peace with this possibility, ask yourself: How can I draw upon my intuition, creativity, wisdom from past experiences and full capability to avoid it and find a better solution?In the end, the power of positive energy in leadership lies in its ability to inspire resilience, foster growth and cultivate a culture of continuous improvement. It's about recognizing that life isn't perfect, times are often hard, and there are a lot of unknowns, but our response to these imperfections shapes our journey in profound ways.


By embracing the power of positive thinking, we can navigate rough patches with grace, learn from our experiences and emerge as stronger, more empathetic leaders ready to tackle whatever challenges come our way. Because ultimately, the most powerful positivity isn't about pretending everything is alright. It's about believing that no matter what happens, we have the strength to make it through.

74,Stop Losing Great Talent! 5 Ways to Attract Highly Engaged Employees to Your Business,"Feb 29, 2024",Nicholas Leighton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-ways-to-attract-highly-engaged-employees-to-your-business/470146,"
Attracting and retaining good employees in today's business world is extremely difficult. A growing number of employees are feeling the pressures of rising costs, the threat of job displacement due to technology and a perceived lack of respect and loyalty from their employers. This is causing a shift in the ways companies need to operate in order to successfully navigate employee retention and recruiting.Below, I'll share five things you can do to attract and retain good, highly engaged employees to your business.Related: How to Attract and Retain Top Talent



1. Family care benefitsOutside of work, employees often have a lot on their plate. Caring for children has always been a balancing act for workers. However, this is becoming increasingly difficult since the current economic climate often requires both parents to join the workforce. In the United States, the average cost of childcare is nearly $15,000 a year. With the rising costs of childcare, many employees have been forced to choose between their careers and caring for their children.Companies that offer benefits like on-site daycare centers, dependent care flexible spending accounts (FSAs), parental leave policies and discounted babysitting services can reduce their team's stress and keep them more engaged at work.


Companies should also acknowledge that some employees don't have children, so adding benefits such as pet insurance or elderly care is a great way to make sure everyone feels included.2. Focus on employee wellbeing and mental healthEach year, the global economy loses about $1 trillion to decreased productivity as a result of burnout, depression and anxiety. The reality is that more and more employees are suffering from mental stress as a result of economic uncertainty, global instability and technology addiction.Employers who recognize this can position themselves to support their employees. Not only will this boost productivity, but it can also encourage loyalty from employees who truly believe their employer has their best interests in mind.We live in an era where employees are often expected to carry the work that was once handled by two or three people. While maximizing resources is smart, entrepreneurs need to make sure they aren't creating unintended consequences for the business.


One of the top factors in employee wellbeing is work-life balance. Companies can relieve stress by making sure their team has the right resources available and feel that they can reasonably unplug and recharge. Entrepreneurs should carefully evaluate if they are overloading their employees and ensure that work is distributed equally. In addition, getting rid of employees who aren't pulling their weight can boost morale and productivity within the remaining team.Related: 8 Ways to Foster an Environment of Employee Wellbeing3. Job insecurityLayoffs seem to be in the news every other day. Some of these losses are a result of the economy; others are a result of job displacement due to technological advancements. If employees feel uncertain about the future of the company, they will be more likely to leave and not risk sticking around to see their job eliminated.Unfortunately, there is a growing culture of disloyalty to employers as employees feel like expendable resources. Entrepreneurs can shift this narrative and retain their workforce by staying proactive. Open and transparent communication can provide a comfortable level for uneasy employees. Companies can also offer incentives such as severance packages or extended layoff notification periods to give employees the peace of mind that they will have some level of protection if the worst happens.


4. Reevaluate compensation packagesThe cosmetic retail brand Sephora received a lot of heat in the news recently for ""rewarding"" their employees with a cookie for helping the company achieve its $10 billion revenue goal. With rising inflation and increased costs of living, pizza parties and gift certificates will no longer be sufficient in retaining employees. This forces employees to seek better compensation elsewhere by finding a new job.Employees are quickly realizing that loyalty no longer pays. Why would employees stick around for a 3% annual merit increase when they could get 10% more by changing employers? Companies that focus on paying their existing employees market rates will reduce the risk of employees pursuing more lucrative salaries with other companies.Related: Employee Retention: 4 Tips to Help Keep Your Top Talent5. Address toxic cultures and work environmentsEmployees want to work in an environment where the entire team pulls together toward a common goal. Unfortunately, the average workplace is teeming with toxic cultures and poor leaders. Since employee referrals are one of the best sources of new talent, having a bad culture not only drives away good employees but also reduces the chance of finding high-quality talent.


This is especially true in an era where employees have access to employer reviews on sites like Glassdoor. The key to building a better culture is carefully listening to what employees have to say about the company. As an entrepreneur, driving a healthy and desirable culture begins and ends with you.

It's Leap Day: the extra day tacked onto the end of February, typically every four years, to account for the Earth's full 365-day-plus rotation around the sun.And it's Thursday, which is a traditional workday for employees and entrepreneurs alike. But does your annual pay reflect the fact you've worked an additional day in the year? Well, that depends — mostly on if you're an hourly or salaried worker.Related: Leap Year: How To Utilize the Extra Day As An EntrepreneurNaturally, employees paid by the hour will be paid for every hour worked; as a result, those bonus hours worked should show up in the next paycheck. Salaried workers, on the other hand, won't necessarily see any pay adjustment.In this case, are salaried employees getting the short end of the stick? Not exactly, according to CNN Business, as many of those employees will see work hours ebb and flow week to week depending on their projects, so it might work out in the end.But it's worth noting that a 2019 Gallup poll found that 52% of full-time workers reported working more than 40 hours a week, while 39% worked at least 50 hours a week, and 18% worked at least 60.Related: Want to Be More Productive?

76,How Job Seekers Can Craft the Ideal Application — and How Employers Can Create a Job Listing That Attracts the Right Candidates,"Feb 29, 2024",Lesley Pyle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-both-job-seekers-and-employers-can-win-the-job-search/468166,"
I recently sat down to chat with one of my customers. She runs a small business and listed an open job position with my company, HireMyMom. I asked her for feedback on the hiring process, and she shared with me that her company had received lots of applications. However, not a single one of those applicants was allowed onto the next stage which would have been a phone interview. I, of course, asked her why. The reason?Job candidates were not following the directions.This company had listed a very niche job with specific requirements, and to ensure that candidates had all the skills needed, the company had a handful of things listed in the job description that candidates needed to provide upon submitting their application materials. Additionally, one of the skills required for the job was attention to detail … which was demonstrated from the start to be missing for many who did not read the entire listing.



I think this brings up important points for both job seekers and companies looking for new hires, so I would like to address both sides.Related: 3 Things Small Business Can Do to Compete with Big Business for Talent


Tips for job seekersThe obvious thing to say here is to carefully read each job description. This is even more important when you look at some hiring statistics from employers according to LegalJobs: only 2% of applicants will make it to the interview stage, and out of all those that apply, 75% of them are unqualified. Take that and combine it with the fact that 52% of companies that are hiring believe wading through applications is the most time-consuming part of the process, citing that it can take as much as 23 total hours to go through all the applications. That's a lot of information to go through for most of it to be thrown out because it does not meet the requirements!I recommend skimming through job listings and saving the few that stand out to you. Then, go back and re-read the entire thing in-depth to determine if you believe you are a correct fit. You then need to customize your application materials — this means tailoring your résumé and cover letter for each company. On your résumé, list specific skills and jobs that line up with the one you are applying for, and in your cover letter, tell a brief story of how you came to gain those skills and how you would like to apply those for this new company.If you are submitting the same materials en masse, it is very obvious to employers who are looking for candidates who are truly interested in the position they are offering; many companies feel that job seekers are not dedicated or truly interested in the job if they receive nonspecific application materials.Customize your résumé and cover letter, and use keywords from the job listing in your materials. This shows that you read the listing and that you are truly interested in the position, and if the company is using software to sort through applicants, then your materials will be flagged for a human to look at because they contain important keywords.


Related: Finding Talent Remains the Single-Biggest Issue Facing Small Businesses. These Tips Can Help Find Your Next Great EmployeeTips for businessesFor companies, sometimes job seekers miss important details because the listing you have provided is too long or the process too complex. In fact, according to SHRM, 60% of job seekers state that if the application process becomes too time-consuming or complicated they will walk away and not finish their application. You need to also keep in mind that 86% of job seekers are applying mobile devices, so your application process should be mobile-friendly.Just as you do not want to read a cover letter that is several pages long, job seekers do not want to wade through an extremely long description to get to the details they need. I have seen some companies spend paragraphs talking about their history, their goals and what they accomplished thus far, and then the actual job will be at the bottom of all that information with just a few sentences.Keep things short and organized. Limit yourself to a few sentences about your company's history and goals. Clearly label those sections with headers that say ""Company History"" or ""Goals We Strive Towards."" Be sure to also clearly label your other sections with job information, skills needed, required application materials, etc. Try to keep this information in bullet points so that it is easy for job seekers to immediately see if they are a good fit or not.


Sometimes when a listing is too long, unqualified candidates will apply because they are unable to see if they are unqualified due to the amount of information provided. Additionally, be sure to provide very clear instructions on how to apply for the position. Even if it is as simple as ""click apply now below,"" this ensures that job seekers know what is needed out of them. It is also a good idea to put in possible timeframes that job seekers will hear back from you — you can also include whether or not you want applicants to send follow-up emails. Some companies love the check-ins while others do not want to be contacted past the initial information being submitted.Related: This Is Why Your Hiring Process Isn't WorkingLet job seekers know up front what is expected of them and what the company will provide in return. More often than not, companies get overwhelmed with applicants and do not respond to all of them. This leaves many job seekers feeling ghosted and left out in the cold; it can be helpful to include in your listing that if applicants have not heard back by a certain date that means they were not selected for the next step.At the end of the day, job seekers need to be sure to carefully read through job descriptions and tailor their application materials while companies need to write succinct descriptions that communicate the job requirements and application process clearly.

There's no fast path to becoming a master — it takes work.As a renowned sushi chef and owner of Royal Sushi & Izakaya in Philadelphia, Jesse Ito carries a legacy of culinary excellence and rich tradition. Jesse embarked on an apprenticeship at the tender age of 14 at his family's Japanese restaurant, before immersing himself in the intricate world of sushi.""You can read books and you can just watch YouTube and learn a lot, but the only way is to learn through a chef working with the product,"" Jesse says to Shawn Walchef of Cali BBQ Media.



In 1979, before Ito was born, his parents opened Fuji in New Jersey just a few years after moving to America.Related: Celebrity Chef Maneet Chauhan Shares Her Best Tip for Aspiring TV Chefs


Shaped by his early years working with his parents at their restaurant Fuji (his mom at the front of the house and his dad making food) Ito's culinary journey began with a hands-on apprenticeship. ""The best way to learn is through apprenticeship,"" he says. ""You have to apprentice and work at places, and work with the product.""Starting as a teenage dishwasher, he was soon thrust into the sushi bar, navigating the challenges of mastering the craft.Ito's father was instrumental in shaping the Japanese food culture in the tri-state area and became known among top chefs as a culinary authority. They sold the restaurant in 2015 to help their son fulfill his dream of opening Royal Sushi & Izakaya.Ito now has the honor of working alongside his dad at his own restaurant. ""He kind of built this foundation. He was part of building the Japanese culture food scene in this tri-state area. So it was big shoes to fill. And having him there is really great,"" says Ito.

It's another thing to fail people relying on you. That may sound like a heavy burden, but it's also very empowering and will push you to move mountains.""The Next Generation of OmakaseFrom behind a back curtain at Royal Sushi & Izakaya, Jesse Ito brings a unique vibe to the traditional omakase experience — blending contemporary Japanese aesthetics with modern comfort and fusion of cultures.

78,The Top 5 Strategies for Overcoming Naysayers in Business,"Feb 26, 2024",Roy Dekel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-strategies-for-overcoming-naysayers-in-business/469941,"
Throughout history, countless entrepreneurs and innovators have stood their ground amidst a sea of skepticism, channeling doubt into determination and proving their critics wrong.Take Sir James Dyson, for instance. When he first conceptualized his innovative vacuum cleaner with cyclonic technology, many in the industry dismissed it as a gimmick.Similarly, critics initially balked at the idea of a private space company like SpaceX. Many thought Elon Musk, the entrepreneur behind SpaceX, Tesla and Neuralink, was merely chasing a pipe dream.



Lastly, look at the journey of J.K. Rowling. Before becoming the world-renowned author of the Harry Potter series, she navigated a sea of rejections. Publishers dismissed her manuscript, citing that a story about a young wizard could never capture readers' hearts.Although discouraging words can become a great obstacle, they should not deter us.


Instead, these challenging voices can be an opportunity to face criticism robustly and leverage it to persevere. It's a rite of passage in business — you haven't truly arrived until you've attracted a chorus of naysayers, each ready to cast doubt upon your innovative ambitions.Yet, we must remember that their negativity can help us sharpen our ideas and expand our thinking. Below, I'll share a breakdown of the top five strategies to overcome naysayers in business with resilience and poise.Related: Haters, Doubters and Naysayers — How to Rise Above Negativity in Business1. Transforming criticism into a catalyst for growthConstructive criticism, though harder to swallow, is a golden opportunity for personal and professional growth. Often, being told ""that's not possible"" or ""that will never work"" is not necessarily a sign of impending doom but a stimulus to prevail.


It serves as an unconventional motivator, providing that fiery challenge to react, prove them wrong and validate your belief system. Insightful comments peddled by the detractors can provide you with viewpoints that were hidden from your thought process, helping you refine your business acumen.2. Conduct rigorous research and trust your instinctsIt is vital to discern the difference between baseless negativity and useful skepticism. The Cognitive Balance Theory supports this very thought process. Criticism isn't always without merit, but neither is it always correct.Before you disregard the detractors, make it a point to carry out extensive research — testing the waters before you dive in. If, after doing your homework, your conviction in your venture's feasibility remains unshaken, accept the unfounded criticism lightly. Maintain your faith in your instincts while staying objective and intelligently informed.3. Stay focused on your goalsUnflinching focus is an essential ingredient in the recipe for running a successful business. Ignoring distractions and channeling your energy towards the things that have a positive impact on your business and your employees can significantly aid in preventing detractors from blurring your vision.


To achieve higher performance, Locke and Latham advocate setting specific and challenging goals.Undoubtedly, there will always be enough clamor that shake your belief, but by clinging to your focus, you can ensure that the vision prevails over the noise.Related: Haters Gonna Hate: 10 Ways to Use Haters As Fuel for Success4. Ignite the bridges of doubtThere lies a hidden force in showing relentless commitment, in narrowing your choices down to just a Plan A. Harnessing negativity and using it as fuel can effectively convert skepticism into a personal challenge.


Many risk-taking theories point out that negatives can become motivational fuel, vital for driving a new enterprise forward.It boils down to the sheer determination you possess. Burn the bridges leading back to self-doubt and commit wholeheartedly to your business venture.5. Welcome the journey of learning and growthTo embrace entrepreneurship is to accept continuous learning and change. You transform immensely from the person you were before you decided to take the plunge into entrepreneurship to the person you become once you take that step.In Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory, this is the shift between ideation and practical application.Ironically, naysayers might be doing you a favor by forcing you out of your comfort zone and instigating a growth you hadn't foreseen.Related: How to Use Other People's Doubts to Fuel Your Own SuccessMore often than not, the opinions of most naysayers resonate more with their own constraints and fears rather than your potential. Although it is necessary to lend an ear to them — there might be nuggets of wisdom hidden amidst their words — it's more crucial, however, to anchor yourself in your vision, strategy and self-belief.Bear in mind, that every triumphant entrepreneur has faced naysayers. Their victory did not stem from evasion; instead, it flowed from a concoction of trust in their ideas, openness to incisive critiques and an unyielding chase after their goals.


Picture it this way: Criticism presents a unique stage where your resilience in business is tested and subsequently forged. So, perhaps, we should extend our gratitude to the naysayers. They may unwittingly be the ones constructing the robust foundation of your determination.

79,How to Know If Your Business Is Profitable This Very Second,"Feb 26, 2024",Jim Conroy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-to-know-if-your-business-is-profitable-this-very-second/469484,"
Here's an example: Alex owns a custom framing store with low prices — just above cost — to attract customers. Volume helped keep the cash coming in. One wall of the shop was devoted to artist's paintings, for which Alex received a percentage of the sale. Until a stationery store opened down the block, Alex was the only person in the area who offered custom framing. In addition to pens and printer paper, the stationery shop devoted a corner to custom framing at 20% less than what Alex charged. Alex quickly put a big sign in the window promoting the same price as the stationery shop — and finished the month in the red.You probably recognize Alex's mistake was changing his prices without assessing how it would affect profitability. It didn't help that Alex didn't know whether the framing shop was profitable to begin with.Alex's reactive pricing decision is one of many that a business finds itself needing to make every day. A contractor must decide on the number of workers to bring on board. A growing business may be offered a great deal on manufacturing equipment for cash today. In these cases, there may not be time to run the numbers to make a decision.



Related: Why This Metric Should Be Prioritized Over Growth for Startup SuccessHow is profit determined?Your profit is the amount you have left after accounting for the cost of operating your business. It's different from your revenue. Here it is expressed as a formula: total revenue - total expenses = profit.


Total revenue is all the money that comes into your business. For Alex's business, it's the money paid for framing plus the money received as a percentage of the paintings on the wall. If framing yielded $84,000 and the painting commissions yielded $24,000, Alex's revenue for the year is $108,000.Alex's total expenses include the materials needed for framing, the shop's rent, utilities and supplies. These add up to $96,000 for the year. Using the basic formula, $108,000 - $96,000 = $12,000 profit.That's not much wiggle room. A 20% drop in framing revenue means an annual revenue of $67,200; with the painting commissions, you're looking at $91,200. If expenses don't change, Alex's framing shop is now unprofitable to the tune of $4,800.What does knowing your profitability let you do?Before the new competition showed up, all Alex knew was that the framing business paid its bills with a little left over. When the market changed, Alex needed to determine how to react.


Knowing exactly where the shop stood might have changed Alex's decision. He might have chosen to reduce prices by only 10% — or not at all — or he may have looked for a way to reduce expenses, like finding a less expensive space to rent.Knowing the profitability of any business enables the owner to react quickly. That can be the difference between profit and loss, as in the case above, or it can add profit. For instance, knowing that there was a $1,000 profit every month might have prompted Alex to rent a stall at a farmer's market for $100 a month, which could have led to $500 worth of extra business, or he could have put more paintings in the shop for sale.Business circumstances change and gainful opportunities present themselves at any time. Not every decision needs to be made in a split-second. However, if you can make one quickly, it can make or break your business. This can also be important if you've taken a loan out for your business. If your profitability is different than what you'd presented to your bank, it might affect the loan terms or interest rate. If your profit is less than expected because of the cost of needed materials, you can find a new vendor.Related: Don't File and Forget: Use Your Receipts to Gain Insight on Business Spending


How do you know whether you're profitable?To get a full picture of your condition, consider using the following tools:Profit and loss statement (or income statement). The basic math for this was covered above, but there can be a large number of elements that go into your profit and loss statement. If you know these now, you can make a decision now.Cash flow statement. A cash flow statement focuses on liquidity. In the example of Alex's framing shop, suppose the commission on paintings was paid only once per year. Alex would be in the red most of the year. The essential formula is:Cash inflow - cash outflow = net cash flow. Cash inflow is any source of incoming cash; sales is the big one. Cash outflow is any source of outgoing cash such as rent, utilities, and taxes.Revenue vs. expenses analysis. Total your revenues and your expenses over a period (say, this month) and compare those to another period (for instance, the previous month or a year ago). You'll see whether your business is making progress and what effect expenses are having on your revenue.Real-time metrics for business healthThe only way to know whether your business is profitable at any moment is to keep on top of your bookkeeping. Alex wanted to frame art, but soon learned that keeping books was necessary. The old-school way to do this was by recording each transaction in a journal. A more modern way is a spreadsheet. Cloud-based storage can help, and there are storage options from all of the major digital players. The most modern way to track your business is a document management system (DMS), which can capture data in multiple ways and store it in the cloud for access from multiple places.Timeliness and accuracy are key. Decide when you will attend to your bookkeeping and don't deviate from your schedule. Be accurate; double-check your entries and your calculations (especially with a spreadsheet). You'll be glad you did when you're making a key decision. If you think you'll need data in an instant, then do your bookkeeping frequently.Related: Want Taxes to Be Easy?

Now is your timeBanks can call loans, business can fall off, competitors can open, consumer demands may change, the perfect storefront may become available, a complementary business may be offered for sale at a great price — any of these may happen to your business at any time.

80,3 Strategies to Help Leaders Ignite Passion in the Workplace (and Why It's Important),"Feb 23, 2024",Itzik Elbaz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-strategies-to-help-leaders-ignite-passion-in-the-workplace/469450,"
It's time to reframe how we look at work and view it through the lens of creativity. Because if we're trying to help motivate our employees, once we understand that so much of our work is about creativity, passion becomes much more important. The most creative artists are deeply passionate about their craft. And the most successful employees are normally those with a similar passion for their work.Employees who are passionate about their work are transformed from a group of people trying to get through a list of tasks to more productive, creative and happier professionals. That, in turn, leads to a better product, happier customers and more sales.Related: How To Keep Employees Feeling Passionate About Their Work



Start by leading with passionCompany culture comes from the top, so it's really important to hire leaders who openly display and role model passion in their day-to-day work. Managers who are enthusiastic, communicate transparently and actively engage with and support their team's ideas will help them understand the true value of their work and how it's helping the end users. This can then inspire a similar passion across the organization.When team members see genuine passion in their management, they feel more connected to their work and motivated to contribute their best. Passion is infectious.


How to bring passion into the workplaceSteve Jobs once said that the only way to do great work is to love what you do. That's all well and good, but as leaders, it's up to us to create a work environment where people have the space to love what they do, and therefore do their best work. But how do you motivate your team and inspire passion? That's the million-dollar question. Here are three methods I use to bring passion into the workplace:1. Focus on passion from day one:When you onboard new employees, don't just tell them about your products and services. Immerse them in your company culture. They can't feel passionate about what they are doing if they don't feel a deep connection to the organization, its goals and how their role will make an impact. Excite them. Inspire them. Make sure they fully understand what is expected of them and how they fit into the big picture.2. Connect everyone to the bigger picture:By being transparent about the company's business goals and sharing information, you connect your employees with the bigger picture. Your ultimate aim should be to make them feel that they're an inseparable part of achieving the company's goals, which will empower them to do their best work. They should easily understand the steps they need to take to reach their objectives and shouldn't have to put unnecessary energy into irrelevant tasks.3. Put the right person into the right job and set the right expectations:Employees who are professionally suited to the work they are tasked with are naturally more passionate about what they're doing. While it seems obvious to assign projects to people with the right skill set, a lack of resources or a failure to deeply understand the task can lead to a mismatch — and that's a great way to kill passion and increase frustration. On the other hand, when projects are built around motivated individuals, with realistic and agreed-upon expectations, the sky's the limit.


Related: 7 Steps to Building an Inspired Team That Achieves Amazing ResultsWhy does it matter?Passionate employees have a direct positive impact on the success of a business. Engaged employees have a positive influence on everyone around them. Two teams with exactly the same skillset can have completely different results, driven by the level of their energy and enthusiasm.The data confirms this. A huge Gallup study involving over one million employees found that the most engaged teams can outperform the least engaged teams by over 20%. A separate study by Deloitte found a direct connection between passion for work and better innovation and customer satisfaction.This also extends outside of work. In the teams I work with, there are people who make music, record podcasts, write blogs; others who love to go hiking, surfing and climbing. We use these personal passions to recharge and come into our work with renewed energy.


But even more than that — when people have the time to develop their personal projects, it enriches their creativity by encouraging them to think differently than they would in their day job. It opens their minds to new ideas and approaches that they bring into work, helping them take on their tasks with a more creative and passionate mindset.So, cultivating passion in the workplace results in employees who work harder to find solutions to challenging problems and deliver better results. In turn, I believe that passionate employees lead to passionate customers. Your team's passion comes across in marketing materials, it's felt in interactions with the sales and support teams, and it drives a better product. As I said previously, passion is infectious, and great experiences with your brand will turn your customers into passionate advocates on your behalf.By giving your employees the freedom to think outside the box, implement innovative initiatives and find creative solutions to problems, you're fueling their passion for your business. When they see that their ideas are transformed into action, and have a real impact, their passion and creativity will only increase. And your customers will feel the difference.Related: 8 Ways to Motivate Employees Into an Unstoppable Team

81,6 Ways to Prepare For and Reduce Employee Turnover,"Feb 23, 2024",Megan J. Shen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/6-ways-to-manage-employee-turnover-and-retention/469546,"
If you've managed a team for any amount of time, you've dealt with the inevitable truth: most of your team members will leave at some point. Many of your members will leave to go on to other roles — with the annual turnover rate in the U.S. being 47% — while others will go out on temporary leave due to personal reasons such as medical leave or caregiving responsibilities.These gaps in employee coverage rarely come at a convenient time. You get two weeks' notice from someone right before a major client deadline. Someone goes out on parental leave as you push across the finish line on a major project. Or, right in the eleventh hour of meeting a client's deadline, a critical team member gets sick. Despite the known reality and near inevitability that gaps in your team will happen — both short and long-term — very few teams are built in flexible ways to plan for this ahead of time.The smartest thing you can do as a team leader is to think ahead and build a flexible team that can absorb this wave when it inevitably hits.



As a social psychologist, researcher, and manager of my team, I have repeatedly faced this reality. I firmly believe in creating teams that work with the realities of people's lives, which means they are designed to absorb the hurdles life throws at us. For myself and other leaders I've spoken to, we are all facing higher turnover rates, use of paid medical leave, and sick days on teams than in past years. Given this new reality, given the turbulence presented by these constant gaps in employee coverage, I got curious about how to set up teams for success.I researched, consulted with several team leaders, and discovered my own tips on building flexible teams. Here are six key tips that emerged from that process:


1. Hire with a diversity of talents and cross-coverage where possibleThis requires thinking ahead, but it's best to think about cross-coverage on your team at the point of hiring. This is especially important if you have a small team of 10 people or less. It helps to hire people with more than one talent who can fill various roles while someone is out. Don't get too laser-focused on hiring only for the specific skillsets you need for the role you are filling, but keep your eyes open to other talents that candidates might bring to the table besides the core skillsets required to do their job.Related: If Your Team Has a High Turnover Rate, It's Time to Re-Evaluate2. Anticipate short- and long-term gaps and put a system in place for handling these ahead of time.You should have two strategies on your team for when someone is out on leave. One strategy for times when there is a longer runway and you can plan. Another strategy is an emergency landing procedure for when someone must leave quickly and unexpectedly. First, have templates and procedures in place to guide what your employees will finish before they leave, who they will hand certain tasks off to, and what will be put on hold until they return or you find a replacement.For the emergency landing scenario, it's helpful to have a running list of what is considered top priority vs. what can wait so that you can put a pause on all non-urgent tasks. For more urgent, have a list of backup employees who can step in to take over.


3. Train your team members ahead of time for cross-coverageIt's best to have clear leads on projects but to cross-train at least one backup for every project who is in the loop and could step in where needed. That way, you know you have coverage but aren't using too much of their time to be on the project fully if they aren't needed.Related: Want an Unstoppable Team? Try Using Manager and Peer Recognition.4. Explicitly communicate with your team what will happen during leaveOne of the biggest fears employees mention when someone goes out on leave is that they will now be tasked with doing double the work. This can put your remaining staff at risk of burnout, resentment, and ultimately leaving as well.To avoid this, be sure to explicitly mention in one-on-one meetings that you are aware that the person leaving will create shifting workloads, explain your plan for handling that workload so as not to add more to the person's plate, and open the line of communication for them to voice questions or concerns. For instance, if you need one of your remaining employees to handle some of the tasks the person leaving handled previously, try removing some of their non-urgent commitments to free up their time to address the more urgent items.


Related: 5 Ways to Reduce the Cost of Employee Absences5. Delegate wiselyBe sure you have people step in with their highest skillset possible. In other words, don't have a high-level project manager editing slides when a lower-level employee could do that. Tap into everyone's highest skill set to use your remaining team members wisely.6 Create an environment that normalizes taking leaveOne of the most important but overlooked things you can do to prepare for employees being out on leave is to normalize the act of taking leave. By normalizing it, you can increase employees' chances of mentioning upcoming leaves earlier in the process. This can help ensure you are less blindsided as a manager and more able to develop a clear action plan for the team.The reality is that life happens to us all – people get sick, medical issues come up, we have children or aging parents to care for, and we leave jobs. Knowing these realities and creating teams that are openly set up to thrive amid these major transitions is an excellent step toward managing your teams through these times.

Fall Creek Farmers Market in Humble, Texas, is not just a spot to stop by for your Sunday morning coffee and a fresh vegetable or two. Owners Jonathan and Andrea Haskin built this vibrant space with a vision to change their community's food shopping habits and educate their customers on the importance of buying fresh and local items.The couple came up with the idea for the market in 2015 when they started taking a longer look at what kind of food they had available to them and realized they had to travel far and wide just to source quality ingredients from local farmers. What would happen if they brought their community closer to the source?Related: Top Health and Wellness Franchises



To their delight, the Haskin's neighbors embraced the concept. Situated in the beautiful Fall Creek neighborhood, the market's outdoor setup is near a golf course and several walking trails, drawing tons of people and their pets into the space every Sunday morning.Jonathan and Andrea prioritize being present in their space and providing a personalized experience for every visitor. Getting set up two hours before the market opens and staying until the last group trickles out, the pair walk around to greet and share their story with customers. In the market's early days, their daughters sat at the entrance making bracelets for shoppers as they walked in.


This community feel is what drew in reviewer Forest B., now a regular visitor of Fall Creek Farmers Market. ""All of the vendors were so personable, willing to share advice and their specific stories,"" his review reads. ""I particularly enjoyed the cultural diversity. So much to learn at each booth.""With 20+ vendors spanning global cuisines, there is no limit to the kind of food you can sample at Fall Creek Farmers Market. On his first visit alone, Forest tried a Colombian coffee blend, two empanada flavors, Vietnamese egg rolls, and an Italian ice dessert. The cherry on top was getting to engage with the vendors themselves, learning firsthand about their products and journeys.Related: 4 Reasons Why You Should Enter the Health and Wellness Industry""One [vendor] that's not mentioned in my review is the Indian couple who serve prepared foods there,"" Forest said. ""They are a little bit older. That's completely different, say, from the couple who owns Frostbite, which is the Italian ice vendor. They're youngsters and [are] actually looking to you to provide them information on your journey here in the United States. So you just learn quite a bit about the people. Sometimes people are a little surprised to find out that you know a lot about topics in their areas, but the way you learn a lot is by talking to people and being open and receptive.""


Forest's experience is a perfect example of Jonathan and Andrea's educational ecosystem in action. First and foremost, the market aims to teach its visitors about the importance of fresh, quality food. The Haskins ensure their vendors share this passion and make an effort to educate every customer who visits their booth. 90% of Fall Creek's vendors farm and ranch full-time. Some even take agriculture classes at Texas A&M.""They live it as we do,"" Jonathan said. ""And it starts from the inside. We are really passionate about immersing ourselves into the market, and we are very selective with who we allow [to be] a part of our team.""Jonathan and Andrea's goal is to be the tipping point that pushes customers into the world of local food shopping, and they've found that preparation is key. They engage with customers online ahead of each sale to make sure they have all the information they need for a smooth visit. Because offerings shift each week to spice things up for shoppers and ensure seasonal produce stays front and center, Jonathan and Andrea provide a list of vendors and produce options in advance to help customers plan their meals and build out their grocery lists before arriving at the market.Related: How This Healthy Food App Scored a $200K Investment


The most faithful customers do around 80% of their food shopping at Falls Creek Farmers Market, which was the vision the owners had in mind when they set out to build a business.""It's not a craft show. It's not a bake sale. You can actually come and get your pastured eggs and real items,"" Jonathan said. ""Knowing where your food is from is a big deal. It's like getting a root canal or heart surgery. So it feels really good to be able to serve and to be able to give them access as we have it.""Not only is shopping locally good for your health, but it's good for the local economy. Forest stressed the importance of spending your money and time at small businesses.""Business owners typically are here from other countries. [They] come from backgrounds in which there was virtually no safety net, so they bring their knowledge to the United States. When I'm looking at these businesses, I'm looking at how I can learn more so I can help other people in the community continue to start these small businesses that make our economy run.""


Beyond making visits, reviewing is a powerful way customers can show support. Jonathan and Andrea take every review they receive to heart, always looking to expand the offerings and inclusivity of their space. They find it important to stay receptive to feedback, keeping the dialogue with customers open, genuine, and full of love.In addition to prioritizing customer education and building community, Falls Creek Farmers Market believes:Passion starts from the inside. Put love and care into what you do and it will trickle down to your partners and employees—and ultimately your customers.Preparation is key. Communicate online with your customers ahead of a sale so they know what to expect. Plus, make time to help out with any problems that come up.Supporting local is a great way to learn new things. Opening up your mind and heart to small businesses might just help you discover an important lifestyle change.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Jonathan, Andrea, and Forest, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.Available on: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Pandora and Soundcloud.Editorial contributions by Callie Morgan and Kristi Lindahl.

84,4 Reasons Why Your Customer Service Is About to Get a Whole Lot Better in 2024,"Feb 22, 2024",Mike Murchison,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/why-ai-customer-service-will-get-a-whole-lot-better-in-2024/469240,"
You've just assembled your new grill, but you're stumped on how to hook it up to the gas line. So you call customer support and start talking with an agent. Turns out they're an AI, not a person, but it's hard to tell the difference.Answering questions in conversational English, the agent asks you to share a video of the barbecue so they can ""see"" it — then talks you through a fix in real time. Problem solved.Sound like science fiction? Soon, such calls will be routine.



That's good news for consumers. When it comes to AI and customer service, we're going to see a virtuous cycle in 2024. As the technology gets better, cheaper and easier to use — a far cry from the stiff, robotic chatbots of just a year or two ago — more companies will embrace it.In turn, many people will have their first truly positive experience with an AI agent. Consumers are ready to engage. In a recent poll, eight out of 10 respondents said they're comfortable with using generative AI for customer support or service inquiries.


As the founder of a company that specializes in AI customer service, I know how much companies value this technology. Already, AI agents handle upward of 70% of customer conversations, according to one estimate. As those agents start outperforming their human counterparts in many respects, look for the quality of customer service to greatly improve.With that in mind, here are four trends that will drive a better AI customer experience in 2024.Related: Why AI Is the Next Revolution In Customer Service1. Generative AI for voice support goes mainstream""For billing, press 8."" We've all experienced the frustration of getting stuck in a phone menu with an automated voice agent whose only skill seems to be pressing our buttons. Good news for consumers in 2024: Those agonizing calls will soon be history.


That's because customer support is shifting from declarative to generative AI. For users, it's the stark difference between punching numbers and having a real conversation about why that mystery charge appeared on your credit card statement. Even better, rather than direct you to the billing department, the agent will give you an informed answer about what happened and even be able to resolve the issue on the spot.It's no leap to say that some of these experiences may soon prove more effective and satisfying than traditional interactions with human agents. Often, through no fault of their own, the people who staff support lines could use better training, don't speak the same first language as their customers and lack access to the business systems of the company they represent.The new breed of AI agents don't face such challenges. Capable of absorbing and following detailed instructions, they're fluent in your language of choice. These agents also play nicely with company systems, allowing them to handle tasks like tracking orders and issuing refunds. The most capable ones will have the same authority as a manager, removing the need to pass a customer between people to resolve an issue.For companies, the benefits are real. In one study, businesses using generative AI in contact centers tripled customer satisfaction versus peers that didn't.


2. Multimodal communication takes root in customer supportIn the new and improved world of AI customer support, voice is just one element of truly multimodal communication, which will spring to life this year.Traditionally, phone support, chat support and other channels like email have been largely siloed. We've probably all had the frustration of just wanting to text a photo or video on a service call, only to find there's no easy way to do it. Even as AI has transformed customer service, these platforms have remained largely walled off from one another. Until now.In 2024, customers will be able to contact a brand via their channel of choice, moving seamlessly between talk, text, video and pictures, just like they do in chats with friends and family. All of those channels will work together to help them best resolve an issue.Multimodal will give AI customer service agents the power to do everything from eyeballing a broken product to offering customized financial advice. Can't figure out how to mount that new OLED TV? Start a video chat with an AI agent, which can use machine vision to pinpoint exactly the mounting bracket you need, then text you a code to buy one.We caught glimpses of this fast-approaching multimodal future in Google's recent demo of its new Gemini AI model. The model is ostensibly a breakthrough, powering a chatbot that holds spoken conversations with users and can recognize, distinguish between and describe images. Yes, Google took heat for making it look like Gemini could process visual information instantly, but it won't be long before multimodal customer support will be table stakes for any business using AI agents.


Related: Will Artificial Intelligence Replace Human Interaction? 4 Ways AI is Impacting and Empowering Customer Experience3. Brands peer inside their AI agent's brainFor all of the upsides, some early efforts at generative AI for customer support have left companies and consumers frustrated. Brands have struggled with irrelevant or unhelpful answers, ""AI hallucinations"" and even bots that defy business logic. Just ask the car dealer whose AI agent offered one customer a brand-new Chevy for $1. The classic refrain: ""Boy, are these bots dumb.""What's often overlooked is that poor outcomes are usually the result of poor or unclear instructions from humans. Until now, however, it's been exceedingly hard for companies to peer inside their AI's decision-making process and understand the ""why"" behind decisions — the frustrating ""black box"" problem. But new software tools are shedding light on the reasoning that informs AI responses, giving brands a chance to see where things went wrong and to correct course.That makes a big difference in customer service, where understanding why an AI agent made a decision is just as important as the decision itself. In fact, it's the only way to drive improvement.


Let's say an agent gave a customer a refund that wasn't warranted. By using a tool to examine the agent's reasoning, the company discovers that the person who trained it gave conflicting instructions. What looked like a mistake on the agent's part was actually a management error. Knowing that, the company can issue new guidance to avoid future mix-ups.Like people, AI agents often have a good reason for a questionable decision, given the chance to explain themselves.4. AI manager becomes a hot jobThe growing capacity to course-correct AI agents hints at a broader trend in 2024. Smart companies are increasingly treating their AI agents not like a piece of software but like an actual employee. Brands seeing the greatest return from their AI investments have quickly discovered that it's not enough to simply buy an agent and set it loose. To thrive, that worker needs to be onboarded, measured and coached — like any other employee.And those tasks call for a new breed of manager we'll see more of in 2024.


AI employee manager is already a key role at companies like money management firm Wealthsimple, one of our clients. Along with setting goals for their AI agents, giving them feedback and helping them learn, AI managers must bring data analysis, project management and technical skills to the table. It represents a true leadership role — one with the potential to make an outsized impact on business results — and will become an important career stepping stone for young professionals across industries in 2024.Related: 5 Strategies to Protect Your Company's Customer Service from AI PitfallsSooner rather than later, AI agents will start collaborating with each other, too. For example, a customer service AI agent inside a streaming platform might notice that a login button is broken for iOS users. Time to alert the code generation AI agent to issue a fix. These generalist and specialist agents will need a new class of ""HR"" to coordinate them. At first, that job will likely fall to the CIO, who will turn to new dashboards to track the AI team's performance, analogous to performance management software for people.The biggest transformation of all in AI customer service this year may well be our own expectations. Early AI support experiences may have underwhelmed some of us. In 2024, prepare to be wowed.

85,The 4 Pros and Cons of Being a Part-Time CEO,"Feb 22, 2024",Artis Rozentals,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-4-pros-and-cons-of-being-a-part-time-ceo/469464,"
Traditionally, chief executive officers (CEOs) must devote long hours to steering their organizations. Being a CEO is almost synonymous with overworking, so it's no surprise that 82% of senior leaders admit to having experienced burnout and exhaustion.That said, 80-hour work weeks are no longer seen as the badge of honor they once were. And with that, the concept of a part-time CEO is gaining traction.In 2023, I transitioned to a part-time CEO position at my company, DeskTime. I quickly learned that high-responsibility roles in fast-growing companies can make it challenging to step back and fully embrace this work format.



Your success depends on how reliable your team is, as well as on your personal flexibility. In my case, I fully trust my team, but I'm also ready to dedicate full-time hours to support them whenever necessary. During quieter periods, my part-time role allows me to focus on developing new business ideas or dedicate extra time to my family and hobbies.Now, if you're contemplating this work format, too, here are some pros and cons to consider before you make the switch.Related: 3 Lessons in Embracing Discomfort From a First-Time CEOPros of being a part-time CEO1. Less exhaustion = more energy. According to U.S. government data, 21.8 million people chose to work part-time in 2023, which is up 5% from a year ago and 15% from a decade ago. This means people have realized the value of prioritizing their welfare over professional and monetary factors. A part-time job keeps the brain stimulated while avoiding exhaustion and stress.As most part-time workers will attest, your work-life balance will thrive in a three or 4-day workweek. No burnout and less exhaustion mean you can always tackle anything feeling 100%.2. No time for micromanagement. Being part-time necessitates full trust in your team. You won't have time for micromanagement, even if you're prone to it.


Instead, you'll have time to focus on the most value-added activities — if you're smart about your time. Clear your priorities to your team so everyone knows where you allocate your time and which concerns to bring you.3. A cost-effective choice for your company. Employing a part-time CEO can be cost-effective for companies, particularly startups or small and medium businesses with limited resources. This arrangement allows organizations to access experienced leadership without incurring the full financial burden of a full-time executive.4. Broadening your skills and flexibility. By not being tethered to a single organization full-time, part-time CEOs can diversify their activities and become more flexible and adaptable. They can remain deeply committed to the business while bringing a fresh perspective from outside the bubble of full-time employment.Related: Making the Transition from Entrepreneur to CEO


Cons of being a part-time CEO1. Falling out of the loop. When your organization keeps running while you're away, you may feel like losing touch with daily operations and company events. In a dynamic business environment, things happen daily, and you might find that full-time employees need to update you about them constantly.To avoid falling behind, schedule weekly or bi-weekly team huddles where everyone shares what they're working on. Also, accept that you don't need to be informed about every process happening within every project — focus on the big picture and information that influences the path to it.2. Challenging to build strong relationships. Part-time CEOs may face challenges establishing and maintaining strong relationships with employees, clients, and partners, as their limited presence may hinder effective communication and rapport-building.Part-time CEOs may also face distrust from employees and stakeholders regarding their commitment to the organization. Let's face it — the phrase ""I've done my hours this week"" sounds strange coming from a CEO. Thus, demonstrating leadership in front of full-time employees becomes more important.


Consider prioritizing human interaction over admin and screen time during office hours. To develop and maintain a strong company culture, strive to be available and helpful to the whole team, acting as a touchstone and mentor. For example, my top priorities are one-on-one sessions with team leads during work hours.3. Less time for strategic planning. The role of a CEO is inherently strategic, requiring a keen focus on long-term goals and organizational vision. Part-time CEOs may find it challenging to allocate sufficient time, which may impede the company's ability to chart a sustainable future course.To remain strategic and focused, avoid being dragged into too much deep detail. Your task is to build a robust business plan and lead the delivery of it. While your full-time staff handles the day-to-day, stay focused on the big picture and oversee things to ensure everything is on track.4. Limited availability in crises. Some organizations may struggle with the limited availability of their CEO in intense and critical times. As a part-time CEO, you may struggle to provide the level of responsiveness and decisive leadership needed during such critical periods.


Make sure your company has a clear chain of responsibility to be able to navigate turbulent times effectively. Assemble a power team that can operate well even if you take a 2-week vacation or when a crisis situation hits.My team has a COO who keeps a close eye on daily operations. In addition, we have developed monthly, quarterly, and yearly KPIs and a clear roadmap for supporting them. Having a clear structure in place helps to avoid crises and tackle them if they do arise.Related: How to Successfully Implement a 4-Day Workweek Even if You're a Fast-Growing StartupIs being a part-time CEO a good idea?It can be if you have a strong team and a clear vision of where you should allocate your limited work hours. If you're unsure, start by reducing your workweek to 35 or 32 hours instead of jumping straight to 20 or 24 hours. I'd suggest starting by taking Fridays (or any other day) off.


As the business landscape evolves, part-time CEOs may become more prevalent. However, their effectiveness will depend on carefully balancing the leader's ability to manage time and commitments and the organization's ability to accept a non-traditional leadership model.

In an era when technology dominates the landscape, algorithms wield power far beyond mere computation. The transformative promise of artificial intelligence (AI) lies not solely in its ability to enhance products or streamline services. Of far greater significance is its capacity to deepen our understanding of ourselves as a society and highlight the necessary moral compass amid this transition.Related: The Top 4 Most Bankable AI Skills You Need to Succeed in 2024AI is a catalyst — orchestrating pivotal revolutions across diverse industries — and the advent of driverless cars stands as a testament.

No one knows everything. There's no need to pretend that we do. A great leader is honest about their limitations and strengths. Accept that you will fail. Being honest and open about failure is not a weakness.A great leader is not defined by having all the answers but by a willingness to grow and learn, a curiosity that leads to finding the required answers. It is about stopping, refueling, and being the best version of yourself.Think about it. Do you want a team that comes to you for the answers? That has no mind of its own? No creativity?

88,Why Blockchain Technology Hasn't Dominated the Supply Chain... Yet,"Feb 19, 2024",Asim Rais Siddiqui,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-blockchain-hasnt-dominated-the-supply-chain-yet/469395,"
Blockchain technology has garnered constant debate ever since its inception, and the interest does not look like it will die out anytime soon. A piece of technology that holds the power to revolutionize existing systems, with experts back in 2017 predicting that the transformative powers of blockchain will be the perfect fit for supply chain management.However, as we look at the supply chain landscape over the past couple of years, the results are very different from what was anticipated, and the question lingers — why hasn't blockchain taken over the supply chain yet?Let's go over why this is the case.Related: Disrupting Supply Chain With BlockchainThe promise of blockchain in supply chainImagine a supply chain where every step is recorded in a ledger that can't be altered and is accessible to all authorized parties. With this kind of transparency, businesses can expect to see a great reduction in fraud, improved efficiency, and streamlined operations.



With 2.8% of the world's population already on blockchain, the technology holds great potential for revolutionizing supply chains. Blockchain is a favorite among experts due to some of its core attributes. These include:DecentralizationA major reason for blockchain's popularity is its decentralized nature, a breath of fresh air from traditional hierarchical structures. Since the launch of Bitcoin, the world has been moving towards decentralization, and it could mean big things for the supply chain realm.Let's think about a network where all participants, from suppliers to manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, share equal authority, and no single entity holds disproportionate power. This balance of power may help cultivate trust among stakeholders, as each party can keep track of all transactions.Related: Decentralization Can Be Your Friend


TransparencyThe transparency that comes with blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize supply-chain networks. It ensures that every authorized party has access to the same real-time data, eradicating any data asymmetry.This may especially be crucial in industries where accountability is important, like the pharmaceutical industry, where drugs can be life-saving or life-threatening. Knowing the authenticity of medication and keeping track of its expiration can help hold the right people accountable in case something goes wrong. Not to mention that it also increases customer confidence in the product.UnchangeabilityAccording to the KPMG Global Fraud Survey, more than half of the frauds committed were aided by the business' own technology, with 24% of the frauds having used these technologies to create false or misleading information in accounting records.One of the biggest advantages blockchain brings to supply chains is the inability to alter or erase any data that has been recorded on the network. This means that records of transactions, shipments and certifications are permanently etched into the digital ledger, which brings a new level of integrity to the supply chain.


SecurityWith supply chain cyberattacks in the United States affecting 1743 entities in 2022 alone, security breaches and data leaks have been rampant in supply chains for years and are only on the rise. The security mechanisms of blockchain offer a potential solution to this extremely troubling problem.Within a blockchain, transactions are secured using cryptography, and once validated, they are linked to the previous transaction, creating an unbroken chain. This makes altering old records an extremely difficult task. Apart from that, the business data will be spread across the network instead of being stored in a single location, making any centralized data breaches futile.Related: How to Mitigate Cybersecurity Risks Associated With Supply Chain Partners and VendorsChallenges faced by blockchain in supply chainWhile blockchain technology in the supply chain shows incredible promise, the path to seamless integration is treacherous and fraught with Herculean challenges. Let's look at some of the challenges you might encounter:


1. Unfamiliarity with the chain. Understanding and successfully implementing blockchain is not everyone's cup of tea, especially if you're a supply chain professional accustomed to traditional systems. Blockchain consists of several technical intricacies, like consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, and cryptographic hashing, which require time and patience to learn. The learning curve can also be steep and often requires specialized training and expertise.2. Scalability issues. The lack of scalability is one of the biggest hurdles facing blockchains today. This is mainly due to the blockchain's consensus mechanism, which requires all participants in the network to agree on which transactions are valid. So the bigger the supply chain, the more difficult it will be to scale it with blockchain because, as transactions increase, the network's performance can degrade, leading to delays and congestion.3. Regulations and legal hurdles. The regulations and legalities that come with integrating blockchain can be daunting to many. There are many intricacies when it comes to data privacy and cross-border transactions in particular. The lack of knowledge available regarding these makes many business owners hesitate for fear that something might go wrong and they might encounter a legal pitfall instead.4. Costs and resources. I believe the most obvious reason why blockchain isn't as common in supply chains as people believed it would be is the heavy investment required to integrate it. Implementing and maintaining blockchain requires building the infrastructure for the chain, hiring blockchain experts, and incurring operational costs as well. This alone is enough to deter any small businesses considering investing in integrating blockchain into their supply chains.


Related: Mass Adoption of Blockchain Technology by Entrepreneurs? Major Challenges Are Involved.The future of blockchain in supply chainAlthough these challenges are unnerving enough to scare away many keen entrepreneurs, some solutions are emerging to address them. These hybrid solutions involve integration with IoT devices, AI algorithms, and cloud platforms to reduce scalability and complexity concerns, making blockchain integration less complex and more desirable.

89,How to Disagree Respectfully in the Workplace — Your Ultimate Guide,"Feb 16, 2024",Cyrus Claffey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-handle-disagreements-respectfully/469318,"
Whether you start a company with your lifelong best friend, a close family member or a stranger, disagreements are an inevitable part of running a business. But disagreements don't have to be negative. In fact, they're often the catalyst for growth, innovation and success.When I founded ButterflyMX in 2014, I built a small but mighty team of brilliant and talented individuals. And with several smart, talented minds working together towards the same goal, we unsurprisingly butted heads occasionally. But how we reacted to disagreements has made the difference.At ButterflyMX, we approach disagreements with respect. We do this to foster a healthy work environment where open discussions are cherished.Read on to discover how you can do the same.Related: How to Disagree the Right Way



Pick the right timeWhile confronting someone with a different perspective can be satisfying at the moment, it's rarely the best solution in the long run. Publicly disagreeing with a colleague, especially one you don't have a long history with, will likely negatively impact your relationship.So, when is it a good time to share disagreements with coworkers?Here are a few times when it's healthy to bring up disagreements:When in private: If the disagreement concerns just you and one other person, bringing it to their attention during a one-on-one meeting is significantly more effective than bringing it up in a group setting. Not only does this allow for the person to respond to your concerns immediately, but it also eliminates the embarrassment or awkwardness that comes with public disagreements.After the heat of the moment has passed: Oftentimes, disagreements feel much stronger at the moment than they do just a few hours later. Don't bring up a disagreement if you're still heated about it. Instead, wait several hours, or even a full day, and bring the issue up when you've calmed down and can have a logical discussion.In a scheduled meeting: As mentioned above, bringing up disagreements during a one-on-one meeting is one of the most effective ways to approach them. But springing meetings on a colleague out of the blue may be cause for contention. Schedule a meeting in advance, and if appropriate, outline the purpose of the meeting so both parties arrive prepared to have a productive discussion.Consider the costNot every disagreement is worth causing a commotion. Before approaching the other party, you must consider whether it's worth scheduling a discussion.Consider why you disagree with the other party. Are you concerned about how the decision will affect ROI? Does the idea conflict with your branding?


It may be worth a discussion if you can see a clear, logical reason as to why you disagree. If you disagree simply because you feel like things should be done differently, but can't back that up with data, it may be worth leaving it be.Related: 7 Steps for Keeping Conflict HealthyReinforce opinions with dataIt's easy to disagree with your colleagues. But simply disagreeing with someone isn't enough to change their point of view. Instead, backing up your opinion with facts strengthens your argument and increases the likelihood that they'll agree with you.Say you disagree with a colleague's marketing strategy for your newest product. Can you back up your opinion with numbers to prove your point? If not, it's important that you find data that supports your opinion before bringing the disagreement to light.


Not only will taking the extra time to reinforce your opinions with data help you state your case, but it'll also help the other person understand your point of view and why you think your approach is necessary.Keep emotions out of itIt's easy to become passionate about professional and creative disagreements, and that's not a bad thing; it just proves that you truly care about your work. But you must remain calm when presenting topics that you disagree about.But why?Because becoming overly emotional may cause you to become unraveled or to lose focus. Consequently, the person you're speaking with may become preoccupied with the tone of your argument instead of the content. Keeping your emotions out of your professional disagreements helps you share your point of view without becoming distracted.


Furthermore, demonstrating that you can present differing viewpoints without becoming emotional is key to your professional development. Showcasing your level-headedness in times of stress improves your credibility and increases your colleagues' respect for you.Remain flexibleSharing your ideas and countering the status quo is necessary to promote innovation in all companies — from brand-new startups to legacy companies. But sharing ideas or disagreements doesn't mean that every new idea you pitch will become commonplace. In fact, being willing to compromise and concede to the other side during professional discussions is just as important as sharing new ideas.Great employees question the status quo without starkly disrupting the workplace. It's unlikely you'll agree with every choice made in your workplace, and sharing your disagreements is necessary for growth. But understanding that not every disagreement will end in you getting your way is key as well.As much as you share your opinions, be willing to accept your colleagues' different opinions. Stay flexible and willing to hear different perspectives, and you'll set the stage for prosperity at your company.


Related: How to Accept Different Perspectives and Collaborate More EffectivelyThe key to running a successful business isn't handpicking a workforce that agrees on every idea. Instead, it's about guiding your employees to raise differing opinions through respectful disagreements.To disagree respectfully, pick the right time to address issues, consider the cost of addressing the issue, reinforce your choices with data, keep emotions out of it, and remain flexible.

It's a weird dynamic, because neither side of this equation is accurate and yet both sides — at least in the public eye — are true."" As the CEO of a team of 15+ team members, I immediately got what he was saying and realized it's part of my daily role.Think about it: The ground-shattering advancements of Apple have historically been attributed to just Steve Jobs. When Tesla stock goes down, it's all Elon Musk's fault. And when people think ""Amazon,"" they think ""Jeff Bezos"" — no other name at all except Bezos. The space heater that didn't arrive the day it was supposed to? Bezos better get on that!But of course, none of this is the case, is it? No single business owner, whether they have a team of 15, 1,500 or 15,000, can possibly be responsible for every single thing that goes on in the company, and they sure as heck aren't responsible for all the things that go right. And yet they're routinely assigned this burden. That's an awful lot of weight on the shoulders of leaders. How you carry it is up to you.



Some truths about being the bossIn my 15 years of running my own PR firm, I've been on both sides of this seesaw. I've sat on the side of a client singing my praises to the skies for a fundraiser that exceeded expectations, and I've also been harshly reprimanded by a client who was sorely disappointed by the lackluster results of their press release pickup. In the first instance, it was my events coordinator who chose the venue, the date, the band, everything; in the second, there's only so much you can do if the media is simply not at all interested in your widget.In both cases, I've had to assess what is real and true for me, and I've come to some conclusions about being responsible for the whole shebang. Interestingly, most of what rings true is about the value of my team, not me.


Related: Don't Let Your Biggest Client Become Your Biggest Nightmare — You Should Fire Them Instead. Here's Why.Truth #1: You can't manage effectively without delegatingEven bosses of small teams know that they can't do every task themselves and have their whole hand in every pie. I'm not advising bird's-eye management, but micromanaging isn't the answer either. You'll limit your vision of the big picture by concentrating too much on the pixels, and you'll stymie your staff to the point of building hostility and resentment.I field about 2,000 emails a day. It just isn't realistic or sustainable for me to have to follow through on each and every one of those emails. I have to forward most of them on for implementation; I have to delegate to manage the workload so my company can succeed and thrive. Delegation means getting things done better and faster than I could ever pull off alone. Delegation makes sense, and it affords room for growth. But when you don't see every single document produced and every single assignment completed, it also means that something can go awry at any time.Truth #2: Some mistakes are not your ownOver the summer, my bags were hugely delayed after a flight. I was livid with the airlines, and when I got home, I sent a strongly worded letter to the head honcho expressing my discontent. The fact of the matter was that it was the contracted baggage handling company at the airport that was at fault, but that didn't matter to me in my anger. I threatened the airline to never fly them again if they didn't shape up.


The same will happen to you. Embarrassing typos that get published. Misstatements by others you wish could be retracted. An employee having a public meltdown one day under extreme stress. You weren't a direct part of any of this — you did not take these missteps. Doesn't matter. Does. Not. Matter. You're in charge, and when a team member makes a mistake (as humans are wont to do), you have to own the mistake as yours. Your staff will not only love you for it, they'll remain loyal. It's not just the right thing to do, it's the only thing to do to maintain morale and support the people who propel your business forward.Related: 7 Mistakes That Make or Break Small BusinessesTruth #3: None of the glory is your ownBosses can easily get a big head when they win a nifty award, slay it at the board meeting or see record profits. Did you earn all this yourself? Do you deserve the credit for all this? No, you absolutely did not and do not.I can't think of one fellow entrepreneur I know who got where they are now just on their own coattails. If we're honest with ourselves, we all know that we simply couldn't proceed and progress without Amanda's diligence, Ty's way with numbers, and Steph's IT prowess. I don't care how proud or excited you are about a worthy accomplishment; you should not only share the laurels but plant them firmly in your team's camp, never your own office. Sometimes, you didn't make the mistake that got you into some hot water for a time. All the time, I'd be willing to bet, you alone didn't bring about the achievement you're celebrating. The celebration belongs to the team that made it happen for your company.


Truth #4: The buck IS yours; take itAll of this is to say that the buck does stop with you. So grab it and put it in your pocket, no one else's. Do not encumber your staff with an affliction they did not mean to create or an onus that is not theirs to bear. Being the boss means holding tight to the reins of leadership when the ride is smooth and when the ride is bumpy.This all comes with time and practice. Accepting the blame and deflecting the credit aren't always easy shifts to make in your mindset — at first, it's natural to get defensive when something goes amiss on your watch that you weren't aware of, and it's equally natural to want to rejoice in your triumphs. But ultimately, it's empowering to train your brain to adjust to this aspect of strong leadership and to overcome initial impulses in lieu of the greater good for your company.A president is a presidentThere are some striking similarities between being the president of an enterprise and being the president of the United States. When things are going swimmingly, the person in charge is lauded for establishing the sunny climate, and when things are floundering, the commander is denounced for the stormy weather. But you can't throw your people under the bus for poor results any more than a sitting president can finger-point at members of his cabinet during a State of the Union address. Both types of presidents need to assume the mantle they have accepted, and that mantle is called accountability.It might just be a mental game you play with yourself — to get comfortable taking responsibility for the bad and not taking responsibility for the good — but it's a game with fair rules. It's a game that protects your players and allows them to shine at the same time. It's a game you can win, and it's a game that every good boss needs to learn to master if they want to become a great leader.

91,How Asynchronous Work Can Help Battle and Eliminate Burnout,"Feb 16, 2024",Tom Medema,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-asynchronous-work-can-help-battle-burnout/469374,"
The overall change in workplace dynamics has been widely covered in recent years and for obvious reasons. Due to my professional focus, I have had my fair share of this coverage, but my perspective has mostly been on the positive end of the spectrum. I understand that the generally inquisitive nature of humankind can sometimes lead to heavy questioning and, thus, a naturally slow and tentative adoption of rapid change, but that is why I see it as crucial to highlight benefits that I believe can be massive and that largely arise from this adoption.My professional focus as the founder and CEO of Bubbles revolves around workplace dynamics, and more specifically, asynchronous work environments and the need for optimization of meeting calls that are deemed essential. It represents a quest to adopt revolutionary changes in both general working patterns and behavior, and the improving technology that facilitates it.Now, many view the continued stronghold of remote, asynchronous work negatively, but I am of the opinion that the majority of those holding this view have not fully considered the extent of the benefits. One of them is the impact of asynchronous work environments on burnout and how changing work patterns have impacted our perception and management of workplace stress. To clarify, burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged exposure to stress. Burnout is something that has been of growing concern in work settings, both traditional and (to some extent) modern. Nevertheless, we should all want to reduce or even eliminate burnout. I just specified that the lack of full extent for modern burnout is a concern because of the positive impact of asynchronous work habits.



Nevertheless, there remains a long way to go. To put some numbers to this claim, a 2022 study by Asana that quizzed over 10,000 knowledge workers across seven countries found that around 70% of respondents experienced burnout in the previous year. This is a crazy number, but as I mentioned, if we can all collaborate to increase our expertise and awareness of burnout, I know we can find ways to reduce it, improving our work individually and when working as a team. Let's now explore how this is possible by first gaining more of an understanding of the problem itself.Related: 6 Ways to Avoid Burnout While Working Remote


Understanding burnoutPer the World Health Organization, burnout is a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. Symptoms include energy depletion and increased mental distancing from the job at hand, which all combine to reduce the worker's efficiency. The roots of burnout can be vast but generally encompass excessive work, especially with a lack of control and a subsequent lack of fairness and conflict in values. Burnout can itself be a root of more serious health issues, such as depression, anxiety and cardiovascular issues. A Gallup study found that employees with regular feelings of burnout are 63% more susceptible to sick days and are 2.6 times more likely to be on the new job hunt.Of course, there are a variety of burnout types, from being overloaded to being under-challenged, and technological burnout is also more than possible in the digital age. Still, part of this journey is to recognize that entirely eradicating is unrealistic. Instead, we should see these startling health statistics as a trigger to reduce the prevalence of burnout as much as possible, which is what async working, in my view, has been doing.Related: 5 Tips to Build Mental Fitness Within Your TeamsThe rise of asynchronous workAsynchronous work is a flexible working style where tasks are completed without the need for real-time interaction, and it has gained popularity recently due to the desire to optimize remote working. Flexibility brings control, directly counteracting a root cause of burnout, but also retains or even increases the effectiveness of collaboration, as the async approach allows more deliberation time to communicate those thoughts effectively. Any team member succeeding in achieving this is bound to feel like they are constantly improving their teamwork and team success, which will increase morale and work-life balance, which is pivotal to reducing stress and preventing burnout.


Furthermore, these success stories are becoming ever more common with the rise in async adoption. Speaking from a position of experience with Bubbles, which is partially an asynchronous communication platform, I have heard that my own team, who all pioneer this technology, feel far more comfortable and happy in their collaborative efforts due to the reduced pressure of immediate responses, and flexibility to manage personal responsibilities.From my perspective, implementing asynchronous communication in your team can appeal to every member. Those who are shy and reserved in their input feel less stressed by everyday meetings and conversations, and those who are more boisterous can continue to be so but also have that added flexibility to communicate on their own time. In these instances, the former experiences less stress and, therefore, usually less burnout, and the latter feels less pinned down and restricted to tight timings, potentially, for example, meaning they can attend a gathering or meet with a friend while still ensuring they complete their work. The effect here is a boost in work-life balance and happiness, which hopefully has a mirrored effect.Related: Avoid These 3 Key Mistakes for Team Success in 2024To conclude, asynchronous work environments hold significant potential for reducing workplace burnout through revolutionary shifts in everyday communicative and collaborative patterns. This is not to say that async is a panacea, and the success of these environments in reducing burnout largely hinges on their implementation and management. Nevertheless, the risk of adoption and testing is minimal compared to the reward of unblocking your team from burnout and ensuring a healthy, productive work environment. Therefore, my final words are to move with the trends and explore how beneficial this can be for you and your team.

92,The No. 1 Priority for Small Businesses This Year Is to Increase Revenue — Here Are 4 Ways to Do Just That.,"Feb 16, 2024",Rich Rao,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-ways-for-small-businesses-to-increase-revenue-in-2024/468815,"
As 2024 begins, goals and resolutions are top of mind. According to a recent report by Intuit QuickBooks, the top priority among business owners is to increase revenue, above getting financing or launching new products or services.Increasing revenue is no easy feat, but entrepreneurs can employ a variety of strategies to help achieve growth in 2024. Even if some macroeconomic pressures like inflation and interest rates may ease this year, they are likely a continued concern for businesses. By looking for new ways to modernize and improve business processes, entrepreneurs can be better positioned to power momentum in 2024 and beyond, even in ever-changing economic conditions.Related: 4 Secrets to Turbocharging Revenue Growth Every Executive Must Know



Hire skilled workersHaving good employees is key to business growth, and in 2024 business owners say it's a top priority, even ahead of cash flow. Entrepreneurs believe hiring skilled employees will help them meet increased customer demand, and most employers (89%) want to hire more employees or contractors this year. But hiring can also be costly and according to one study, the average cost per hire was almost $4,700 when you take into account onboarding, training and the ramp up to productivity.Expanding the workforce is especially top of mind for younger entrepreneurs, with more than three-quarters (76%) of Gen Z small business owners and 80% of millennial small business owners saying they want to hire employees this year. Compare this to just 34% of baby boomer-owned small businesses. In terms of how to hire qualified workers, I recommend business owners be very specific when developing job descriptions, zeroing in on the problems and challenges you're trying to solve with the role. And by offering employee benefits like health care and paid vacation, small businesses will be better positioned to compete with larger enterprises in attracting top talent.


Optimize inventory management to enhance omnichannel salesAs business owners embrace omnichannel sales, selling across multiple online and in-person channels can maximize revenue but can also add new complexities to running your business. Have you ever ordered a product from a business, big or small, only to find out it's actually sold out? Optimizing inventory management so you can deliver the best customer experience is key for success and continued consumer loyalty.Take for example Matt Paggi of Barred Woods Maple, a QuickBooks customer who shared with our team just how crucial a positive first-time shopping experience is — especially during the busy holiday season. The holidays are typically when they do almost a third of their annual business, and each year they see returning customers who've made gifting their maple products a tradition. To help ensure they can manage increased inventory needs they've expanded their presence across various channels to capture both new and returning customers, ramped up production ahead of time and brought on seasonal employees.For business owners like Matt, my number one piece of advice is to use the power of data analytics to optimize inventory management and sales strategies. This includes looking at your sales history to identify the most popular products and impactful channels to drive strategic decision-making and maintain a real-time understanding of stock levels to avoid over and understocking. Additionally, data trends around the cost of raw materials can also help business owners know when they need to buy in bulk or scale back on production.The data shows improving and expanding omnichannel sales is particularly important for Gen Z entrepreneurs, with 88% of Gen Z small business owners looking to expand ecommerce or physical locations to boost revenue in 2024 compared to 66% of Gen X and baby boomers.


Related: These 4 Quick Wins Can Boost Your Customer Count and RevenueDynamic management of cash flow and credit card debtTo make money, you have to have money on hand. Access to cash and maintaining healthy cash flow is essential to small business survival. Whether it's earmarking enough cash to cover overhead costs if payments are late to paying for unexpected expenses and emergencies, business owners have to be ready for the inevitable curveball that will come their way.There are a few simple ways business owners can build a cash flow cushion. First, know your fixed and variable costs and monitor cash flow projections regularly to spot potential problems before they arise. Digital tools can be incredibly valuable in providing you with real-time insights that can help you plan ahead and react quickly. I also recommend treating cash flow savings as a fixed expense and setting firm guidelines for when you'll tap cash reserves.Entrepreneurs also should be mindful of how they use and manage credit cards. Recent data has pointed to the increased reliance small businesses have on credit cards to manage cash flow — 83% of business owners have relied on a credit card to manage their business finances, and 59% of business owners who use credit cards said it was ""an emergency or temporary source of funding.""


What's more, almost 24% of small businesses don't believe they will be able to pay off their credit card balances in 2024 without paying interest. It's important to have a strategy when using credit cards to manage cash flow — and to ensure you stay on top of managing your interest rates on the cards you use — otherwise, this could be a costly expense in the future.Related: 6 Strategies for Optimizing Cash Management When Starting a BusinessSet your financial goalsWhether it is setting an intention for the day or creating a workback timeline to hit a big business milestone, goals are an important part of a business owner's journey.As we kick off 2024, business owners should evaluate what financial goals will make them feel successful. These financial goals can help provide a clear sense of direction, serve as a benchmark for progress and success or unearth areas that need improvement. They can also serve as a road map of your longer-term mission or vision for the business and can ultimately help fuel overall growth.


Success can be measured differently by different people, but regardless of how you view success, setting a goal and understanding revenue targets for your business can help in planning for and achieving a fruitful year ahead.

Danielle Cohen-Shohet.When did you start your side hustle in the self-care industry, and what inspired it?



My interest began when I did freelance makeup artistry out of my Princeton University dorm room. I've always had a passion for design and art, and for as long as I can remember, I have been entrepreneurial. I have a tendency to want to become an expert at something I do, so when I became interested in makeup, I took it much further than most and started a side hustle in college. During that time, my twin sister and I also pursued a digital receipts payments venture. Those were both enriching experiences; however, I had no idea at the time that I'd later take a leap and combine those interests to start a software payments company now worth over $510 million.Related: These Sisters Started a Side Hustle After a 'Light Bulb' Moment Standing in Line for Coffee — Now Their Business Has Done $100 Million in Total Sales


What were some of the first steps you took to get that side hustle off the ground? I learned voraciously, strived to be the best and just rolled up my sleeves to start. Back when I was in college, makeup artistry tutorials were just starting to be democratized on YouTube, so I dove into them and just got my hands dirty practicing. I drilled college classmates and friends for feedback and just kept getting better from there. It sounds simple, but these first steps helped me succeed faster.Were there any challenges that came with running the side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those? Anything that you can grow from will have challenges. While doing makeup artistry, I experienced first-hand the pain points that many of our GlossGenius business customers face today: time management, coordinating schedules and growing a client base without the proper infrastructure, just to name a few. I dove headfirst into solving these challenges with manual spreadsheets and tools that I would hack together, which sparked the idea for what would later become GlossGenius. I wanted to provide other business owners with best-in-class technology and infrastructure that would make it easier to run a business.


How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue? On average, how much revenue did it bring in? For me, it was originally more so about satisfying a creative interest than revenue. It took several months before I started to earn real revenue, and it was meaningful enough to cover a lot of living expenses while in college.Related: She Spent Her Honeymoon Working on a Side Hustle. It Raised $35 Million and Counts Celebrities Among Its Investors.When did you decide to transition into startup mode and found GlossGenius, and what motivated that move?


After understanding the problems facing service-based self-care businesses, I decided to start a software company that would solve many of these problems with technology. I had graduated college and started a career in finance at Goldman Sachs, but I kept thinking about how to help self-care entrepreneurs run better businesses. It was really hard to manage a client-first business when there were so many scattered, disconnected systems.I had taught myself how to code, so I felt as if I could do anything. After getting a couple of years of experience at Goldman, I took a leap and left to start GlossGenius. Given the industry experience, my technical background and the digital receipts payments company I had pursued with my twin sister — who is my partner and chief business officer at GlossGenius — it just felt obvious to put all of this into a software payments company focused on the self-care industry.Image Credit: Courtesy of GlossGenius. Danielle Cohen-Shohet and Leah Cohen-Shohet.How have you approached scaling the company? 


Before we could even think about scaling the company, we first focused on solving a real problem that is a critical part of our customers' lives. There is so much opportunity to empower entrepreneurs to run, manage and scale their own local businesses. Our platform impacts customers' livelihoods, and our solutions are an important part of their everyday lives. That focus was foundational to have in place before scaling.With that in place, one of the things I did early on was learn everything about the business: Building products, launching products, recruiting, marketing, closing partnerships, handling customer support tickets and much more. Having a deep knowledge of all parts of the business has been important to scaling the company as it has helped me understand what excellence looks like in all parts of the business. With that type of understanding, I could surround myself with fantastic people and leaders to take teams even further.Related: The Sweet Side Hustle She Started 'On a Whim' Turned Into a $20,000-a-Month Income Stream: 'It's Simple, It's Affordable and It's Fun'Because there are so many problems to solve for businesses, we also had to remain disciplined in solving the most important problems for customers first. So as we've scaled, we have continued to flex discipline and only pursue initiatives that create value for our customers. We say no often and are thoughtful about how we sequence what we pursue. We obsess over our customers' needs and absorb their feedback like a sponge, as it plays a key role in driving GlossGenius' growth and new products. Keeping the connection with our customers as we've scaled is something I'm really proud of.


When you look to GlossGenius's future, what are you most excited about? We are creating a gateway for entrepreneurship, giving self-care business owners the infrastructure to scale their businesses and empower more entrepreneurship. While we've already built a platform that is mission-critical to our customers, there is still so much for us to do to achieve our mission. With the responsibility of serving over 65,000 businesses and powering billions of dollars of transaction activity, we are working to make our software products more intuitive and magical for customers.The recent launch of our GeniusAI, a generative AI-powered tool, is a good example of this. This tool helps beauty and wellness practitioners draft ready-made, personalized email marketing campaigns, enabling users to simply enter a few notes and receive messages tailored to their goals and brand. In an industry that has traditionally lagged in technological adoption, it is exciting that we get to be the company that puts this in customers' hands. Another recent GlossGenius product launch is Genius Loans — fast, flexible financing that helps customers grow their businesses. Products like this underscore our support of customers with what they need, when they need it — well beyond what's typically expected from SaaS platforms.What are some of the biggest lessons you've learned over the course of your entrepreneurial journey? 


I've learned that true success means helping others succeed. I am fortunate to lead a company that's so tightly aligned with our customers' success. With the opportunity to build and lead GlossGenius, I've had a masterclass in learning the special framework of how to make decisions that build long-term value for customers.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill.

Don't take no for an answer. And importantly, surround yourself with like-minded people. You might find this through a community like the one we've created for entrepreneurs with GlossGenius, or you might look to people closest to you. I've had many close supporters along the way, but my strongest collaborator is my twin sister, Leah. She has been a thought partner from day one and has played an invaluable role in expanding the company into what it is today. So surround yourself with people who get you.

94,Lack of Trust — What Does It Do to Your Company? Here's What Leaders Need to Know.,"Feb 15, 2024",Greg Davis,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/lack-of-trust-what-does-it-do-to-your-company/469215,"
Trust is the cornerstone of any successful organization, especially when it comes to scaling up. A lack of trust within a company can lead to numerous challenges, undermining the organization's potential for growth. It not only affects the internal dynamics but also has far-reaching implications on how the company is perceived externally. Understanding these implications is crucial for businesses aiming to grow and thrive in today's competitive market.What do modern business leaders need to know about trust and how to foster transparency in the current landscape?Related: Trust Should Be the Foundation of Your Business — Here's How to Earn It.



1. Turnover will be an ever-present issueHigh turnover rates are often a direct consequence of a lack of trust within a company. Employees who do not trust their leadership or feel undervalued are more likely to seek opportunities elsewhere. This turnover not only disrupts the workflow but also incurs significant costs in terms of recruiting and training new staff. Furthermore, frequent personnel changes can lead to a loss of institutional knowledge and negatively impact team dynamics.In addition, high turnover can create a negative reputation for the company in the job market. Prospective talents might be deterred from joining an organization known for its high employee turnover. This can create a vicious cycle where the best talents are lost to competitors, further hampering the company's ability to scale. Establishing trust is crucial to maintaining a stable and committed workforce.


2. The loss of intellectual property will be detrimentalA lack of trust can lead to the loss of valuable intellectual property (IP). Employees who don't feel valued or trusted might not take the necessary precautions to safeguard sensitive information. This can result in leaks of proprietary data, harming the company's competitive edge. In addition, distrust can lead to a lack of open collaboration, which is essential for innovation.In scenarios where employees leave the company due to distrust, there's a risk they might take their knowledge or even trade secrets with them. This not only affects the company's current projects but also its future endeavors. Protecting IP is fundamental for companies, especially in high-tech and creative industries, and trust plays a pivotal role in this protection. Hence, fostering a culture of trust is essential to safeguard a company's intellectual assets.3. A lack of succession planning is a red flagIn companies without trust, succession planning becomes a significant challenge. Without trust, leadership might hesitate to delegate responsibilities or groom future leaders, fearing for their position or the misuse of power. This lack of succession planning can lead to chaos when key personnel leave or retire, hindering the company's stability and growth.In addition, a clear succession plan is a sign of a healthy, forward-thinking organization. The absence of such planning can demotivate ambitious employees who see no clear path to advancement within the company. This can further exacerbate turnover issues and prevent the company from developing strong leaders from within, which is crucial for long-term sustainability and scaling.


Related: 5 Ways to Build a Culture of Transparency4. Lack of transparency will cripple growthWhen trust is lacking, transparency in communicating the company's goals and strategies becomes a major casualty. Employees who are not privy to the company's vision or direction can feel disconnected and unmotivated. This lack of alignment between employee efforts and company goals can lead to inefficiency and a waste of resources.In the absence of transparency, rumors and misinformation can flourish, leading to confusion and mistrust among staff. It becomes challenging for employees to align their individual goals with those of the company, which is essential for a cohesive and productive work environment. A transparent culture, fostered by trust, is key to ensuring that everyone is working towards a common goal, thus facilitating scaling and growth.5. Quality, performance and productivity will declineA workplace lacking in trust is often characterized by decreased quality, performance and productivity. Employees who do not trust their leaders or colleagues may not feel compelled to put forth their best effort, leading to subpar work. This decline in quality can be detrimental to the company's reputation and customer satisfaction.


Furthermore, distrust can lead to excessive micromanagement, stifling employee creativity and initiative. This environment hampers innovation and can slow down processes, further affecting productivity. Companies striving for growth must recognize the importance of trust in enhancing performance and maintaining high standards of quality.Related: You Can't Lead Effectively Without TrustIn the end, the importance of trust in a company's growth trajectory cannot be overstated. It is a vital ingredient for fostering a positive workplace culture, ensuring employee retention, protecting intellectual property and facilitating effective succession planning.Companies that prioritize trust and transparency will find themselves better positioned to navigate the complexities of scaling in the modern business world. Thus, building and maintaining trust should be a key strategic goal for any organization looking to scale successfully. Business leaders should not hesitate to reach out to experts who can help ensure a culture of trust.

Entrepreneurs play a vital role in the global economy by spearheading innovation, fostering job creation and pioneering entire industries. By helping entrepreneurs understand themselves, insights into personality type can help them operate more efficiently, resulting in tangible advantages to the economy and society at large (not to mention their employees).Psychometric assessment can be a powerful tool for providing insight into how entrepreneurs tend to operate and what makes them tick. A recent study by my firm found a relationship between an individual's Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®) personality type and the attributes they perceive as either aiding or hindering their success as an entrepreneur.In this article, I'll explore how type preference can give clues to areas that entrepreneurs can either leverage or that they need to pay attention to. But first, let's look at some of the more general characteristics typically exhibited by entrepreneurs, and how they may impact performance.



Related: Your Personality Type Determines Your Leadership Potential. Here's How to Find It – And Unlock Its Full Power.General attributes contributing to success or failureMy firm's research found that entrepreneurs displayed a notably greater inclination toward creativity, risk-taking, impulsivity and autonomy. Likewise, the businesses they lead tend to be less structured and hierarchical than typical organizations.


While there can be clear positive aspects to these characteristics and this approach to business, the study indicates that entrepreneurs might be placing excessive emphasis on passion, enthusiasm and cooperation. Conversely, they might be undervaluing the more practical aspects of business such as administrative tasks, attention to detail, marketing and sales. Similarly, those who expressed dislike for data, statistics, finance-related matters and networking tended to demonstrate comparatively poorer performance.While these findings might provide a general starting point for self-improvement, I've observed in my own consulting that these sorts of descriptions are usually a little too vague to be actionable. However, when people begin to understand the nuances regarding how these descriptions may play out according to their own personality type, they can be addressed in much more tangible ways.According to the MBTI model, personality can be described by preferences along the following dimensions:Extraversion or Introversion (E-I), which describes people's orientation toward the outer world and how they gain/focus their energySensing or Intuition (S-N), which reflects one's preference for how they take in informationThinking or Feeling (T-F) which describes people's emphasis on either the tasks and logical consequences or personal/social values in their decision-making processesJudging or Perceiving (J-P), which describes whether people tend to orient themselves toward the outer world in a more decisive and planned or flexible and spontaneous wayLet's explore, according to a few different MBTI personality types, inherent entrepreneurial strengths that can contribute to success as well as aspects that, if left unattended, could potentially hinder it.


The entrepreneurial approach of the conserver (ISTJ, ISFJ) Those with favorite processes of Introverted Sensing often tend toward being detail-oriented, knowledgeable, structured, organized, focused, reliable, punctual and natural avoiders of procrastination. However, as the study notes, these individuals may want to exercise caution regarding their potential:Propensity toward risk aversion that could lead to missed opportunitiesHesitation in making critical decisions and temptation to engage in less strategically significant activities as a form of displacementFor example, imagine an ambitious tech startup founder who possesses a wealth of knowledge in their field and is incredibly detail-oriented, organized and reliable. Despite these clear advantages, their risk-averse nature and hesitation in decision-making pose challenges as they navigate the unpredictable startup landscape.


Recognizing the need to fine-tune their entrepreneurial skills, they might seek out specific training focusing on strategic thinking and decision-making under uncertainty. Successful training would enable them to learn to reframe their perspective on risk, understanding that they can parlay their natural talent for detail and structure into calculated risk-taking. It would also help them learn methodologies to analyze and prioritize tasks critical to a startup's success, avoiding the trap of postponing strategically significant actions.As they apply these newfound skills, they'll evolve into a more dynamic and well-rounded entrepreneur, striking a balance between their meticulous, detail-oriented nature and a more strategic, risk-embracing mindset.Related: What Your Personality Type Says About Your Career Destiny (Infographic)The entrepreneurial approach of the explorer (ENFP, ENTP)At the other end of the spectrum, those with favorite processes of Extraverted Intuition may show strong social confidence, evidenced by a robust network of contacts. Moreover, they may be well-served by curiosity, innovation, willingness to explore novel approaches and embrace risks, adaptability and generally enthusiastic demeanor. However, they may also possess a:


Tendency to get easily distracted from the tedium of administrative tasks which could lead to overlooking errors, including in financial mattersDislike for structured approaches that may produce disorganizationSusceptibility to distraction from critical immediate tasks by new and intriguing ideasFor instance, consider an entrepreneur leading their own innovative tech startup who's known for their social confidence and an extensive network of contacts within the industry. Their curiosity, innovative spirit and enthusiasm that initially drove the creation of their company, however, walk hand-in-hand with challenges that make them less effective in managing the administrative aspects of the business.


Recognizing this, they seek training focusing on enhancing their organizational skills, attention to detail and time management.During the training sessions, they address the inclination to overlook details in financial and administrative matters, focusing on tools and techniques for effective management. Additionally, they explore how to improve their approach to structured planning. To mitigate their aversion to structure, they focus on flexible planning methodologies and creating adaptable yet comprehensive plans that allow for creativity while maintaining organizational coherence.As they implement these strategies and techniques, they develop an approach that is flexible yet structured, allowing them to maintain organization while fostering innovation and remaining diligent in overseeing detailed matters and administrative tasks.Tying it all together with a personality type-based approachThese two scenarios are, of course, only descriptive of four of the sixteen MBTI types. But in either of these cases, understanding of type offers important clues as to how they'll likely fall prey to some of the pitfalls common to entrepreneurs running their own businesses.


By understanding their key entrepreneurial strengths and vulnerabilities, they can take a tailored approach to their growth areas, while leaning into their strengths and preferences. In some cases, this involves identifying a somewhat modified approach to an area of concern that, rather than forcing them to be something they're not, allows them to flex comfortably to be what their company needs.Related: 10 Personality Traits of Legendary Entrepreneurs

97,3 Big Reasons Why Leaders Should Embrace the Joy of Missing Out,"Feb 14, 2024",Heather McLeod,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-big-reasons-why-leaders-should-embrace-the-joy-of-missing/469092,"
As a high achiever, your to-do list will expand to fill the space you give it. You can see the value in every opportunity, and the fear of missing out (FOMO) is powerful. As an ambitious leader, I'm always thinking about how to maximize my time. You probably are, too. But are you missing out on life's quiet moments? The ones that spark creativity and build resilience? Embracing the joy of missing out (JOMO) is my unlikely professional development recommendation. Choosing fulfillment over FOMO gives me space to trust my team and the time to reconnect with my priorities.I credit one of the leaders on my team with teaching me about JOMO. Her decision to reframe ""fear"" into ""joy"" allows her to maintain a healthy work-life balance and enjoy a more intentional experience of freedom than most people I know. Spurred on by her example, I decided to log off during a recent vacation. For eight business days, I didn't check my email. I deleted the email app from my cell. I was fully present for my trip, and my loved ones and I returned to the office as a JOMO evangelist.Ultimately, knowing and modeling that ""less"" can be ""more"" will make you a better leader. Here's why.Related: Once a Month This CEO Kicks Staffers Out of the Office. Here's Why.1. Focus and creativity flourish with restOur attention spans are decreasing. The average person shifts focus on a screen every 47 seconds. Every time the focus shifts, our brains must start from the beginning of the new task. We make more mistakes, and it takes longer to complete a task. Plus, endless hustle can stifle creativity and innovation, which is a concern for 60% of leaders. Our base level of distraction is the real productivity-killer. Combatting it takes effort. Enter JOMO.



Traditional understandings of ""maximizing time"" might be hurting productivity instead of helping. While collaboration can be a tremendous source of creativity in the workplace, tougher problems require more time for the brain to make connections and form new, big ideas.Science shows that intentional breaks, even very short ones, help our brains better process all the information we're juggling at any given time. A mind that's given the time to wander intentionally is free to solve complex problems.Related: 9 Ways to Rewire Your Brain for Creativity2. Disconnecting from the hustle fuels deeper connections with yourself and othersThe always-on mentality can drown out the very things that make work meaningful. Focusing too narrowly on the day-to-day work and stressors can leave us feeling disconnected from our inner selves. Intentional disengagement and embracing JOMO gives us the space for introspection and self-awareness. We remember what we care most about and what really motivates us.


The highlights of my career so far aren't KPIs; they're relationships. From franchise owners I've helped reach new heights to nurturing blossoming leaders on my own team, it's all about people. That goes for most businesses, too. Performance boils down to trust and authenticity. To show up as your authentic self, you must cultivate self-awareness and interrogate your values: Who are you, really? The opportunity for this kind of thinking doesn't come up during the average workday. You have to make the choice to pause and reflect. You have to opt to miss out on doing something from your to-do list.Learning that it's OK not to be in every meeting is an exercise in trust. When you have strong relationships on your team and across departments, you can rely on their good judgment to pull you in when necessary.3. Modeling resilience-boosting habits has a ripple effect on teamsEmbracing ""less"" is imperative for leaders who want to have a collaborative, supportive and high-performing team. Chasing achievement can be exhilarating, but over time, the perception that success demands a 24/7 schedule takes its toll. According to Gallup research, people are more likely to leave a job due to culture or work-life balance problems than for better pay.Overall, employees are more disengaged than they were just a few years ago, and 1 in 4 employees is experiencing signs of burnout. A good leader can help prevent burnout (and all its costs) by walking the walk with their teams. When leaders normalize setting boundaries, it empowers their team to do the same.


Related: These Invisible Energy-Draining Habits Are Making You — And Your Team — Less ProductiveChoose fulfillment over FOMO and reap the rewards""More"" is a defining characteristic of work for high achievers and leaders: more emails, more meetings, more urgent decisions, more ways to connect, more opportunities to make a difference. Honestly, I thrive with all that ""more."" That's why I have to be so intentional about saying ""no"" to some of the pressure.By making the conscious decision to miss out sometimes, we create space to remember who we are and what really matters. There is so much satisfaction to be found in focus and intentional choices. Work is not the most important thing we do. The time we spend with the people who love us is what really matters.

98,The 4 Personalities You Need on Your Marketing Team,"Feb 14, 2024",Heather McLeod,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-personalities-every-marketing-department-needs/469072,"
If you work with the right people, you don't need to have all the right answers. I grew a marketing team from two to more than 80 employees in a handful of years. We're still growing regularly to support Authority Brands' explosive growth from one home service franchise brand to 16 brands in just six years. My leadership philosophy is the same now as with two employees: build a strong team, empower them with scalable processes and systems, and get out of their way. Collaborative leadership is about an optimal balance of support and autonomy. The first step is selecting the right people.A strong team isn't just about hiring for skills and experience. That's the baseline expectation. A long term hiring plan has to take a holistic approach to team structure. Now that remote work is the norm, talent pools are bigger than ever, and leaders have the opportunity to tailor their teams to perfection. Fostering the right personalities within the department is the difference that elevates the marketing team into an example for the whole organization.Whether your team comprises 5 or 50, here are the personalities you need.Related: You Have to Actually Know Your People to Retain Them. Here's Why It Matters.1. The Acrobat: Always impressive and key in a crisis""Adapt and overcome"" is the Acrobat's motto. At first glance they're all calm and confident. But when you know exactly what they're managing, you can fully appreciate their ability to do it all wgracefully Being productive under pressure is great, but Acrobats make it look effortless. They adapt to new realities and find balance quickly, setting an example for the whole team.



The Acrobat is the kind of person you want on your team during a crisis. Even now, most businesses overestimate their preparedness for a major disruption. Of course, there's more to organizational crisis preparedness than having an Acrobat on the marketing team, but their ability to remain composed under any set of circumstances is an invaluable daily asset.2. The Sunbeam: Brilliance amplifier and ego managerKeeping a shared purpose at the center of a marketing team is vital. The task becomes more challenging as the team grows, but Sunbeams help immensely. Their genuine enthusiasm is infectious and gently directs the team's focus to opportunities and solutions even through hardship. The presence of a Sunbeam sets the tone at meetings and helps to neutralize ego-driven behavior that can derail collaboration and business-wide progress. As a bonus, their nature helps tremendously with maintaining a sense of camaraderie in hybrid teams.The Sunbeam's empathetic soul brings out the best in all of us. They lift others up, providing the encouragement and support that allows individuals to blossom and their brilliance to shine. I've learned from the Sunbeams on our team that the kinder approach often results in a greater impact.Related: Connected for Success: 4 Crucial Values of an Interconnected Organizational Culture


3. The Codebreaker: Interdepartmental MVP and bridge builderNo matter the size or scope of the marketing department, leaders must constantly battle information silos. Building relationships across departments is time well spent, and Codebreakers excel at it. Codebreakers have a remarkable ability to see beyond the surface of business. They effortlessly grasp the intricate connections that define our operations and often ""speak"" multiple business languages.One of our Codebreakers thrives at the intersection of marketing and IT. She speaks both languages and bounces between them easily. Then, she turns around and illuminates the path forward for everyone else. She'll always break down confusing lingo, explain steps clearly and teach others while she's at it.Interconnected thinkers are continuous learners. Their keen insights inspire bold leaps of faith, allowing the department to capitalize on emerging opportunities.4. The Renegade: Thoughtful skeptic and rule breakerMarketers love to push boundaries, and no one pushes harder than a Renegade. They revel in critical thinking and challenging the status quo. They aren't contrarians or pessimists. Renegades are driven by the desire for continuous growth, and they are not afraid to point out any opportunity for improvement. At the same time, a Renegade has the good judgment to know when to push with an incisive question and when to go with the flow.


If a process has stagnated, a Renegade will tell me. I embrace their ""what-if?""s, which often lead to valuable realizations. They understand the rules well enough to subvert them and empower others to break free from assumptions that might be holding everyone back. Complacency is out the door when there's a Renegade on your team.Related: How Leaders Can Support and Embrace The Untapped Potential of Neurodiverse TalentStrengths-based leadership supercharges talentThere are so many ways to put together a dream team, but the Acrobat, Sunbeam, Codebreaker and Renegade are necessities. Seek out the individuals who embody these essential traits and nurture them on your team. They each have unique strengths, but ultimately it's about the energy and attitude they bring to the department as a whole.I have had tremendous success scaling up a marketing team by empowering teams to lead with their strengths. When my team was tiny but mighty, I needed the Sunbeam to be the Acrobat at the same time. In building out a larger marketing department I've had the honor of elevating these personalities to leadership roles. I still learn from them every day.

When people talk about retirement, typically, they're referring to a linear path: Go as far as you can in your career, turn a certain age and leave the professional world for good. It might be the traditional model, but these days, it doesn't work for everyone — for several reasons.More than half (56%) of American workers believe they're behind on their retirement savings, according to a recent Bankrate survey. Meanwhile, since the beginning of 2020, prices of everyday goods and services have increased about as much as they did in the full decade prior to the pandemic, per Bloomberg.Related: This Is the Key to the Retiree Lifestyle You Want — and the Income You Need

100,Stop Wasting Your Grind — Why Having a Growth Mindset is the Answer to Hustle Culture,"Feb 9, 2024",Kelly Hyman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-a-growth-mindset-is-the-solution-to-hustle-culture/468899,"
Every entrepreneur has experienced the hustle culture — the idea that every waking moment must be focused on building and bettering your business. When riding solo, it's easy to blur the boundaries between work and life, a habit that can quickly lead to burnout. However, post-pandemic people are reprioritizing their work and finding ways to feel and be productive.Reevaluating the grindThe rise of Silicon Valley tech companies in the last part of the 1990s and into the early 2000s have been named as largely responsible for romanticizing ""the grind."" Pulling all-nighters and being constantly connected was a way to show how into the work you were.Though entrepreneurs are known for being passionate about their work and dedicated to maximizing their time, the pandemic slowed everything down. The forced halt gave everyone time to reevaluate how they wanted to approach their work going forward.



Many surveys highlight employees' willingness to cut pay in exchange for a better work-life balance. Flexible schedules, remote working and other customized perks and benefits all have become part of the mainstream. This type of freedom is a world entrepreneurs know all too well but may have forgotten during their company's growth phases.It's nice to remember that a schedule doesn't have to be filled up to achieve goals. And growth doesn't necessarily mean a slowdown. It's an intentional look at what does and doesn't work to optimize time. As entrepreneurs and the workforce as a whole continue to evolve past the hustle culture and appreciate what it feels like to have more balance, here are some ways to transition into this growth phase and still feel you are making strides.


Related: 5 Goal-Setting Strategies That Drive Success1. Budget your timeLike a monetary budget, look at your overall work time and evaluate where you spend most of it. How much is assigned toward administrative work? How much is reserved for meetings? And more importantly, where are areas that can be freed up?By closely examining where your time goes, it makes it easier to pinpoint places that need improvement. For instance, an entrepreneur in growth mode may be ready for a virtual assistant or professional services to ease their load. Hiring someone who can take care of emails, keep track of projects, and help with content management and social media can take your business to the next level.Start small by outsourcing a few assigned weekly hours and add to it as needed. Relinquishing control is a big step as an entrepreneur, but to grow, it's best to get help where you can. Delegating specific responsibilities gives you more time to focus on strategy and the next steps so you don't remain stagnant in the same work patterns.


Related: How to Achieve All Your Financial and Career Goals2. Prioritize your healthAs an entrepreneur, taking a sick day is practically unheard of since there's no one else to fill in when you're out. That's why it's crucial to take care of your everyday health.The hustle culture made us believe that work came before sleep, eating and exercise. Using caffeine and adrenaline to fuel the system is not a method that will work long-term. Practicing the basics of self-care, like daily exercise, quality sleep, and good nutrition and hydration, like drinking water, doesn't seem as exciting, but they are the difference makers.These healthy habits will help you think more clearly and function more effectively. So often, these are the first things to go in place of work. When, in reality, they are the things most needed to get the work done.


In growth mode, you have to move beyond a scarcity mindset that requires around-the-clock working. Instead, focus on long-term goals, in addition to short-term wins, which involve taking care of your health first and foremost. Put it on the schedule and consider it an investment in your work life.Related: 3 Daily Habits Tp Protect Your Mental Health3. Find new ways to expandEven in today's instant gratification world, faster isn't always better. However, in some ways, the grind can be necessary… but not a forever approach. It can help you focus and build a good foundation, but the next step is to create processes that allow things to flow more easily.As you grow and scale your business, some tasks should become automated. Look into virtual and in-person assistance, digital tools, and resources to make your life easier. Email, social media, and e-commerce platforms are all part of what creates better workflows.


The hustle is not as popular as it once was because we have the technology to do things differently — which works best for you and allows you to expand creatively and make more authentic audience connections.Entrepreneurial life is about adapting. But now, the focus is more on adapting to what works more favorably for you. Not subscribing to hustle culture doesn't mean you're behind the competition; the approach is simply different. As a whole, society is entering a phase where quality, personalization, and intention matter - so it's important to recognize where you need and want to grow.

""Be nice, be clean, and be present."" This is the mantra of Philip and Sibs Harrell, owners of Sundae Scoop, a mom-and-pop ice cream shop in Virginia Beach, Virginia.Customer service is the number one priority for these business owners. Whether chatting with customers or selecting and training staff, Philip and Sibs focus on creating an inviting community space for friends and families to gather.Related: 7 Essentials of Great Customer Service



""At the end of the day, being in the community is what an ice cream shop is about,"" Philip said. ""We represent every culture that's in our area. That's where the ube ice cream comes from, or the coquito, or rum raisin. Each one of those [flavors] is gonna respond or touch something in someone that they remember from their childhood.""Sundae Scoop's warm and engaging customer service has earned the business a 4.8-star Yelp rating with nearly 100 reviews (at the time of writing). Most reviewers discuss positive experiences they've had interacting with Philip and his friendly staff, including Yelp Elite Aneesa P.


Arriving right after the store had opened for the day, Aneesa chatted with Philip as she ordered her ice cream. He shared the story of the shop, helped her pick out the perfect gluten-free flavor, and even helped her snap the perfect photos and videos to accompany her review.""I felt like we really connected,"" Aneesa said. ""He wasn't just like 'Here's your ice cream. Go.' He was like, 'Hey, I want to let you know, behind the scenes, the story of how I came up with this idea.'""Philip and Sibs see positive reviews like Aneesa's as a key tool for boosting staff morale. When a scooper gets called out by name for contributing to a positive customer experience, Philip and Sibs are the first to let them know.""They're young kids. They're very self-conscious,"" Sibs said. ""So it feels really good when people give them their big-ups and name them.""


Philip and Sibs spend a lot of time not only encouraging existing staff but also hiring scoopers who will contribute to Sundae Scoop's hospitable culture. They ask all job candidates to thoroughly read the reviews and take note of what people love most about the shop. They want to make sure all new and potential hires are ready to deliver the peppy, friendly service Sundae Scoop promises.Related: How Chef JJ Started a Rice Bowl Revolution in HarlemAs a community-driven space, Sundae Scoop is active in the Virginia Beach area, partnering with local schools and businesses on events like ice cream socials.

In his three years running Sundae Scoop, Philip has helped three other businesses get off the ground.""They took the risk too. They took that leap of faith,"" he said. ""So if someone like myself or my wife can come along and help them on their journey, that's all the better because it's building a stronger community.""


Philip has found these relationships especially important to cultivate as a Black business owner. He speaks to the fear of the unknown that can surface in the Black business owner community when you don't know who to turn to or what resources are out there.Related: 3 Strategies This Vietnamese Noodle Shop Has Used to Thrive in Minnesota""I always encourage people just to join something,"" he said.

And you need to be able to use advice from all of them and put it together.""Supporting Black-owned businesses was part of Aneesa's motivation to visit Sundae Scoop. Being one of a handful of Black women in her field, she was able to connect with Philip over what it's like to be successful in a white-dominated space. Aneesa stressed the importance of writing reviews to ensure that great Black-owned businesses don't get closed down due to a lack of support.


""We all have to support each other, not bring each other down,"" she said. ""[It's] really important to me to be able to let everybody know, 'Hey, we can own all of these spaces and also be successful as well.'""Philip and Sibs remind themselves every day of their commitment to being groundbreakers in their community with a mural on the wall of Sundae Scoop.

""At the end of the day, just be good, support each other, and help each other where you can, and I can almost promise you that it's going to come back your way.""In addition to the power of warm and engaging customer service, Sundae Scoop believes:Reviews are the roadmap to success. Positive feedback can be used to set key expectations for staff, and critical feedback can be used to make important changes to operations or processes that make the customer experience easier or more enjoyable.Friendly staff play an important role in creating positive customer experiences, and training them on your processes and values is a key part of your customer service strategy. Hire a diverse team of employees who are dedicated to delivering your business's mission.Minority-owned small businesses need to support each other.

102,What the Ivy League is Looking For in the Next Generation of Entrepreneurs,"Feb 9, 2024",Mary Banks,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/what-the-ivy-leagues-looks-for-in-the-next-generation-of/468585,"
Many students today are keen to chart their entrepreneurial paths even before setting foot on a college campus. In fact, according to an EY Ripples and JA Worldwide survey, approximately 53% of people born between 1997 and 2007 desire to start their own businesses. Colleges and universities also recognize this preference shift and offer an environment to help students take off their entrepreneurial ventures either during or after college.Among these institutions, the Ivy Leagues emerge as a coveted option for students as a result of their attractive networking environments, access to resources and challenging courses. However, these educational powerhouses are extremely competitive, admitting only a fraction of the aspiring entrepreneurs. What sets apart those who make the cut? What characteristics of would-be entrepreneurs catch the eye of Ivy League admissions officers?As a former Columbia University admissions member, I can confidently say that the answer lies in a distinct set of qualities that transcends academic excellence. Here are the three traits actively sought by Ivy League schools in future entrepreneurs.



Related: 5 Books That Paved My Path to Entrepreneurial Success1. Ephemeral and genuine leadershipBeing an entrepreneur requires you to be a leader. In fact, leadership is a criterion most colleges want to see in their applicants, and most students will weave it one way or the other into their college essays. However, colleges can recognize when leadership is genuine.


Getting accepted into an elite school shouldn't be the sole driver behind your desire to be a leader because admissions officers will see through that. Instead, leadership should be a vital part of your identity and narrative. You must understand that true leadership requires dedication and consistency; it's a demanding endeavor that may not even be suited to everyone.Ivy League enthusiasts should start thinking early on about what they admire in leaders and how they can imbibe those traits through their unique actions. Embracing the role of a leader in everyday life — whether that is through community service, starting a club in school with a purpose or leading a research project — will make it easier to join the dots in your application.Remember, true leadership is an arduous journey; it compels us to push creative boundaries, step outside our comfort zone and question ourselves objectively while embracing diverse perspectives and making tough calls. Think of real-life examples when you consistently demonstrate that and talk about them genuinely.2. A commitment to othersBeyond the allure of substantial profits and lucrative careers, Ivy League education is profoundly shifting towards championing change. The spotlight is now on sustainability and positive impact, with these esteemed institutions anticipating a new breed of entrepreneurs driven not merely by financial gain but by a desire to effect meaningful change.


Ivy League schools now seek more than just promises of change through new businesses; they demand a demonstrated commitment that precedes the exceptional resources they can provide. It's about showcasing your dedication to impact, substantiated by tangible evidence of your proactive efforts even before your Ivy League journey begins. Whether through internships at similar businesses, starting and leading initiatives or engaging in relevant extracurricular activities, applicants are expected to embody a true commitment to effecting real-world change.So, the expectation is clear: demonstrate a track record of initiating change. While an Ivy League education can amplify your impact, it cannot instill the desire for change; that fire must already be within you. Ivy League applicants have long been promising to make real change in the world but are now holding our students accountable to these promises and asking how they've already begun to uphold them.Related: 4 Traits Every Leadership Team Should Invest In3. Diversity, equity and inclusionStudents hoping to join Ivy League business programs such as an MBA should be ready to lead in a new cultural environment with a genuine focus on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Despite facing some criticism, DEI is widely acknowledged as a crucial element of a thriving business, a principle strongly emphasized by esteemed MBA programs. Harvard Business School (HBS) educators assert that DEI is so integral to business success that they instruct students on ""how to negotiate the difference"" when organizations fall short in this regard. This commitment to DEI extends across all disciplines at HBS, including entrepreneurship, underscoring the importance of fostering more effective leadership through collaboration around diverse perspectives and experiences.


Similarly, Wharton is actively incorporating a focus on DEI and ESG, recognizing their significance across all business levels. Deputy Dean Nancy Rothbard proudly announced two new courses, DEI and ESG, at the undergrad and MBA levels in response to a student challenge to ""do more."" The new MBA mantra centers on preparing leaders for creating diverse, equitable and inclusive organizations. Stanford has always had a vibrant MBA focused on entrepreneurship and is at the forefront of implementing the DEI, socially responsible business model, including having dedicated centers for Black and Hispanic businesses. Columbia Business School, through the Eugene M. Lang Entrepreneurship Center, is adopting a green approach, encouraging students to explore the ""interface between business and society."" A new Climate Change and Business Program also reflects CBS' growing humanistic value.Suffice it to say, change is on the horizon, regardless of a small segment of society opposing the emphasis on DEI and socially responsible businesses in collegiate and corporate settings. The success of businesses and entrepreneurship hinges on aligning with the demographic makeup of their surroundings. Consequently, aspiring Ivy League MBA students must showcase their dedication to DEI, convey enthusiasm and articulate strategies for fostering inclusivity in their future enterprises.Final thoughtsAn Ivy League education can catapult your entrepreneurial journey to unprecedented heights. But gaining entry into these esteemed institutions demands more than mere lofty sentiments and ""someday"" assurances. Admissions officers expect to see authentic leadership and a demonstrated commitment to change, sustainability and DEI in the new generation of entrepreneurs. Ensure you genuinely embody these traits before stepping into the fiercely competitive league of the Ivies.

103,Interest Rates Are Going to Drop This Year. Here Are 6 Ways Businesses Can Take Advantage When the Time Comes.,"Feb 9, 2024",Daniel Altman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/6-ways-for-businesses-to-be-ready-when-interest-rates-fall/469009,"
If there's one thing economists are sure about this year, it's that interest rates are coming down. Even the Federal Reserve's officials have been upfront about their plans to lower short-term rates by at least three-quarters of a percentage point. Financing and credit will be easier to come by, but how can you take advantage? As the chief economist at Instawork, here are some of my tips to prepare:Distinguish between short-term and long-term rates. Short-term interest rates have been coming down in anticipation of the Fed's moves, but long-term rates actually started to increase at the end of 2023. With the Treasury borrowing more and more to finance the federal government's debts, there's a lot of demand for long-term credit. Moreover, the Fed has been selling off its own long-term assets, which drains the supply of money from that side of the market.These moves have direct repercussions for businesses since long-term rates are the ones that determine the cost of borrowing for capital expenditures. So if you're planning to seek funding for a new factory, an overhaul of your offices or expansion into a new market, keep your eye on the rates that correspond to the time after which you'll repay.



Related: Where Will the Economy Go Next? What to Watch For in 2024Pick the right moment to raise money. If you've been thinking about an initial public offering (IPO) or tapping another source of funding, two things will affect the optimal timing: the growth of your business and the competing options for returns. The best moment usually arrives when growth is high and other possible investments are paying low rates.


The economy has been growing fairly rapidly, and expectations are for continued moderate growth this year. But it may take a couple of years for interest rates to fall to the ""easy money"" levels from before the Covid-19 pandemic, if they do at all. What will happen after the elections in November is anyone's guess, but companies considering an IPO may well be rewarded for waiting.Refinance debt when possible. Just as homeowners flock to refinance their mortgages when rates drop, so should businesses seek out lower rates for their outstanding debts. As the supply of credit grows, lenders are typically more willing to consider refinancing.The key is to calculate the true value of a refinancing deal — not just after paying fees, but also when considering the difference between the refinancing rate and the interest rates in the market. A lender might offer a no-fee refinancing, but it's not necessarily a bargain if the rate is higher than what other lenders would agree. The same goes for refinancing deals that ""reset the clock"" for a loan, implying a longer series of repayments in the future.Be aware of fluctuating exchange rates. Big institutional investors move markets, and today's institutional investors like to take advantage of international differences in interest rates. If they can borrow at 4% in Europe and earn 5% in the United States, even for a short time, they will. But if rates fall more quickly in the United States than in Europe, some of that money could go in the opposite direction, weakening the dollar along the way.


If you're negotiating contracts with international suppliers or if you're selling into markets abroad, then these exchange rates have a direct effect on your bottom line. In fact, given the volatility that could result in foreign exchange markets this year, you might want to consider long-term deals that lock in rates for several months or more.Related: Small Businesses Are Facing Higher Costs and Interest Rates. Here Are 6 Steps to Stave Off a Crisis.Use caution when hiring. The labor market is still tight by historical standards, and the economy is growing fairly quickly. If anything, economists are concerned that the Fed won't lower rates fast enough to stave off higher unemployment. Yet with lower inventories in retail and an uptick in some manufacturing industries, as well as sustained demand for services, things could also heat up again. After all, the unemployment rate was even lower than it is now for long spells in the past couple of years.This atmosphere of uncertainty means businesses ought to be careful in the labor market. Hiring — and sometimes firing as well — carries a fixed cost that can't be recouped. As an alternative, employers may want to consider using flexible workers, either on a recurring basis or even on long-term contracts. When the uncertainty clears and demand is steady, these workers will also be great candidates for permanent hires.


As a final note, consider your customers and suppliers. For small businesses that run on cash from day to day, interest rates may not seem too important. But they affect your customers' ability to buy your goods and services. They also determine how much rent your landlord needs to charge and where your insurance premium might go next. Once you know how these things are connected, you'll be in a better position to prepare for the trends to come.

105,Terminating an Employee? These Are the Legal Ins and Outs You Need to Know,"Feb 7, 2024",Mital Makadia,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/terminating-an-employee-dont-make-these-legal-mistakes/468746,"
Insubordination. IP disclosure. Misconduct. Breach of restrictive covenant.All of these are legitimate reasons to fire someone, but what do HR managers and business owners need to know about the legal technicalities surrounding employment termination?Components of a legal terminationTo avoid legal issues post-termination, it's important to understand the main components of a lawful employment termination.



Make sure you identify any required paperwork to provide to the employee under state or local law. For example, in California, employees must be provided a certain form of Notice of Change in Employment Relationship as well as a pamphlet about unemployment benefits at the time of termination.Check your state's termination paycheck rules. You might have to pay your employee on the date of termination or within a certain time thereafter, despite your normal payroll cycle.Identify any legal risks in connection with the termination. For example, is the employee a member of a protected class? Have they been a whistleblower?If the termination is for performance or other ""cause"" termination, have you documented the performance issues? Has there been progressive discipline of some sort, or will this be a surprise to the employee? These are important questions because firings for performance should not be a surprise to the employee; an employee should be on notice of the performance issues and be given a chance to improve. This protects the company if the employee alleges wrongful termination. It also helps with morale; employees won't want to stay if they think they may be terminated out of the blue.Always have a witness in a termination meeting, which may benefit the company in the event of litigation. In most cases, the witness should not be a lawyer. This is to prevent that lawyer from becoming a witness in the lawsuit, which could present an issue for attorney-client privilege reasons.Related: How to Fire an Employee: 4 Ways to Make the Process KinderWhat not to say during a terminationWhile there's no guidebook for all of the things to say — and not to say — during a termination, there are some guidelines that an HR manager or business owner should heed.


Termination discussions should be short. Less is more in this case.Don't ramble on about the reasons for the termination. Don't talk about other employees; if the termination is a layoff, don't explain whose employment status is safe or why. Don't get into an argument or long exchange. Be respectful but firm.The gray areas of legal terminationA broader, more objective viewHR and legal professionals can have a broader, more objective view of terminations that are important to the company, which can help to mitigate risk. For example, a hiring manager might opt for layoffs or otherwise terminate some employees because those employees are having a harder time adapting to new software. However, this can often end up in terminating mostly older employees. It's important to think about whether there's an age discrimination issue. It's also worth considering whether the manager needs to be counseled on how to better train these employees.


High-risk termination situationsIt behooves HR managers and business owners to protect themselves from getting into high-risk termination situations. Therefore, it's important to have policies in place for documenting employment issues and progressive discipline; this can serve as a written record to support termination. This is especially helpful in situations where an employee in a protected class or situation is to be terminated. For example, you need to terminate an employee who is going on maternity leave. If their performance issues are documented, and if there was a process of progressive discipline, a company will be better prepared for an employment claim.Effective and legal use of severance agreementsSeverance agreements can be invaluable in terms of mitigating the risk of lawsuits, but the law around them changes rapidly. Don't reuse forms, and do be sure to work with a lawyer who knows current employment law at both the state and federal levels.


Related: 11 Tips for Firing an EmployeeRepercussions of unlawful terminationFailure to comply with final paycheck laws can lead to wage claims and penalties.Failure to comply with proper paperwork required by state and local law can lead to fines.Failure to document employment performance issues and engage in progressive discipline can make the company vulnerable to wrongful termination lawsuits. For example, if someone who just asked for a disability accommodation has been terminated, but the HR manager claims it's for performance reasons, a jury is unlikely to believe the manager if those performance problems weren't previously documented.


Failure to identify whether there are risks to termination can lead to making nonoptimal termination decisions. If you see that there is a high chance of an employee bringing a wrongful termination claim, you can better prepare in terms of offering severance or perhaps delaying termination while establishing a better documentation process.The bottom lineAs a business owner or HR manager, it's inevitable that you will have to terminate employees. Keeping these considerations in mind can help to protect you and your company in the long run.

106,Sephora Hit $10 Billion in Revenue and Workers Aren't Happy That All They Got Was a 'Stale Cookie',"Feb 7, 2024",Jordan Hart,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/sephora-reaches-10b-in-sales-gives-workers-stale-cookie/469417,"
This article originally appeared on Business Insider.Beauty chain Sephora hit a big sales milestone in 2023, but the workers who helped to make it happen say all they got was a ""stale"" cookie as thanks.The company celebrated hitting $10 billion in revenue in North America last week, and some of its stores got cookies in the mail as a gift.



But, the sprinkled treats and an attached thank you note — which demanded confidentiality — didn't go over well with Sephora's employees, according to a slew of comments online and two workers who asked to remain anonymous.""They are always coaching us to meet our goals and expectations, and, of course, everyone goes above and beyond for the company and all they give us is a stale cookie and a letter thanking us,"" said one former employee whose last day coincided with the cookie delivery.


Another employee told Business Insider: ""When we got the cookies, we were like, 'Wait what?'""It's obvious they're not listening to us,"" he said. ""These are people who don't know how this actually works and how important we are to the operation.""In a statement to BI, Sephora said it ""had a great year thanks to our extraordinary team members who help create and build our incredible beauty community.""We are proud of all our employees across our stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices who contributed to this shared success in North America,"" the company said in the statement. ""As the leading prestige beauty retailer, it's success like this that allows us to continue to offer highly competitive benefits and pay, performance bonuses, education, brand perks, training product, gratis, and substantial product discounts to our employees.""


It's unclear if Sephora gave employees any additional compensation for hitting the milestone.Anonymous via Business InsiderSephora staff got the treats over the last week, workers said. The cookies came wrapped with a label saying ""We did it! $10 billion"" to celebrate the company raking in record-setting hauls.


Sephora's card — which BI has seen — said the company set records for Black Friday in stores, as well as new bests for its online traffic and warehouse fulfillment.""Inside this box, you will find a sweet treat to enjoy with your team,"" the card continued. ""We thank you for making it our greatest year ever. Cheers.""At the bottom of the card was a warning: ""The content of this card is confidential and should not be shared externally as it is a violation of our company policies.""But that didn't keep a subreddit dedicated to Sephora employees from trashing the presents. Let the unionization begin!byu/AdUnlucky9116 inSephoraWorkersReddit users called it the ""infamous cookie."" Some poked fun with reviews of how the pre-packaged goods tasted (one user gave it a 4 out of 10), but others said it made them feel like ""dirt on the bottom of their shoes.""Another user turned the cookie into a call to action: ""Let the unionization begin!"" they wrote.The employee who got the cookie on her last day said it was ""totally normal"" to see a confidentiality notice attached to gifts from Sephora.She said the gift left her disappointed, but not surprised.""They really don't reward us for the work and mental energy it takes to be a Sephora employee,"" she told BI. ""There's just so much more they could do and they chose to send stale cookies.""

107,3 Ways to Build a Culture of Radical Honesty (and How It Can Transform Your Business),"Feb 7, 2024",Andrew Schaap,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-build-a-culture-of-radical-honesty-and-why-you/468889,"
What keeps me up at night? Watermelons.As a CEO, my biggest fear is that the digital dashboards capturing my company's vital signs are the business equivalent of that tropical fruit — green and firm on the outside, but red and mushy underneath. At first glance, everything looks solid. Then one morning, I get a call from a client asking, ""What the hell is going on with A, B or C?""This concern isn't fair to my team, who consistently exceed my expectations. But the reality is that for many leaders, such nagging fears can persist. When there's a problem, the last thing you want is for people to give you the impression — intentionally or not — that things are better than they truly are. So, how do you avoid this?



For the past few years, I've led a company in an industry facing astronomical demand. One of the biggest lessons: The agility, operational excellence and innovation required to meet this challenge requires building a culture of radical honesty.Here are three ways that leaders and their teams can embrace radical honesty — and reap the benefits of better decision-making and a true picture of where the business stands.


Related: How to Employ Radical Candor in the Workplace With 5 Simple StepsEncourage your people to admit their weaknesses — and play to their strengthsA simple formula for business success: Do things consistently better than the competition, and those wins will compound over time. The key to pulling it off? Let people focus on their strengths and delegate everything else.That calls for honesty and transparency. ""Fake it till you make it"" doesn't always work in business, where pretending can have disastrous consequences. As a leader, I want people to do the opposite — by asking for help and saying, ""I don't know.""One way to do this is by empowering and trusting team members to be rock stars in their domain. That makes our company better at creating innovative technologies, tackling new markets and responding nimbly to changing conditions.


But at the same time, as I urge people to lean into their strengths, I give them permission to be less adept at other things. For example, if a member of my leadership team is no good at financial underwriting, I tell them to own it like a badge of honor.After all, that's what hiring is for. To make up for their lack of knowledge and expertise in a particular area, we can bring on someone to fill the gap. It's my job as CEO to explain that the goal isn't to undermine or replace them, but to help them focus on what they do best.There's a direct line between that mindset and business results. In one study, companies whose CEOs excelled at delegating grew more than twice as fast as those with a less skilled delegator at the helm.Don't default to the rulebookFor leaders, honesty is nearly always the best policy, even if it means ruffling a few feathers or going against convention.


Sometimes this requires poking holes in well-intentioned ideas that also happen to be intellectually lazy. This came up recently in a chat with my team about how we plan to meet the demand that AI is creating in our industry. While some of the ideas presented were sound, others needed more probing.Take the argument for keeping someone in a management role because they've done the job forever. Many companies default to this way of thinking, but what if they're overlooking a newer hire with a fresh perspective and a natural ability to inspire the team? To me, sticking with option A isn't an intellectually honest approach.As hard as it is, leaders can't escape making these kinds of tough decisions. Without abandoning all loyalty to people, they should consider what's best for the business and make pragmatic rather than emotional choices. Even if those decisions aren't always popular.In a broader sense, being intellectually honest means knowing when adhering to the rulebook is hurting the company, not helping it. For example, I'm a big believer in hiring top talent, telling them where our True North is, and then letting them figure out the best way forward. If somebody needs a course correction, that can be addressed. But expecting the entire team to follow every company rule to the letter? That will only slow us down.


Related: Stop Lying to Your Team — And Yourself. Try Radical Honesty Instead.Give the team a license to speed without getting a ticketLeading with radical honesty also requires getting real with yourself and your team about how willing you are to embrace failure.At our latest companywide offsite, I told people I want them to fail more. For a business, that isn't as risky as it might sound. Companies that are serious about innovation should be willing to try new things and pivot fast if they don't work.Take Airbnb, which didn't begin by building an elaborate home rental website. Instead, the founders tested the waters by renting out their own loft online. Google Glass — released by a company famous for its ""moonshots"" — is a good example of a failed experiment. When its smart glasses didn't catch fire with consumers, Google moved on.


Encouraging creative destruction means removing the fear of failure, a major cause of inaction. Within reason, people should be able to fail out loud without worrying they'll get fired.For me as a leader, there's little risk because I've hired talented people who are laser-focused on executing well. All they really need is a license to speed without getting a ticket.Unfortunately, many business leaders don't see things that way. Despite all the rhetoric around moving fast and breaking things, less than half of companies have a leadership team that regularly tolerates small-scale failures, according to a recent global survey of CEOs.Someone should explain to them that the rewards of letting people fail can be substantial. In a study of 120 tech startups, those committed to learning from failure produced greater scientific output, raised more capital and innovated more.


Of course, businesses must also know when to play it safe. For Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, there's a big difference between ""experimental failure"" (good) and ""operational failure"" (bad). It's the same at my company, where the mission-critical computer and electrical systems that power our facilities don't leave much room for error. But even there we get creative — for example, by finding innovative ways to keep the lights on during a blackout.Related: How to Allow Room for Failure and Create a Successful Work EnvironmentFor leaders and their teams, the biggest benefit of a culture of radical honesty is the elimination of fear: that employees will get into trouble for taking risks, that folks aren't good enough at their jobs or that the company is actually on shaky ground.Ultimately, ensuring that everyone knows where they and the organization stand is a competitive advantage, thanks to a more engaged workforce, a clear view of where the business needs to grow and iterate, and a culture where people feel as emboldened to innovate as they do to ask for help. When it comes to performance, what you see is what you get. So, here's to keeping watermelons where they belong — at the company picnic.

108,"Crisis at 30,000 Feet: Grading the CEO Responses to Boeing's Mid-Flight Blowout","Feb 7, 2024",Christopher Salvi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/crisis-management-lessons-from-boeings-mid-flight-blowout/469305,"
On January 5th, 2024, an alarming incident involving an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9 necessitated an emergency landing due to a cabin blowout. This placed Boeing and its airline partners United Airlines and Alaska Airlines under intense scrutiny. Company CEOs Dave Calhoun, Scott Kirby, and Ben Minicucci each navigated their companies through challenging times with distinct approaches, focusing on safety, quality, and strategic adaptation. In the following analysis, Miguel Aponte and I explore the actions taken in response to the crisis, highlighting their leadership in addressing immediate concerns while eyeing long-term objectives.Related: 10 Strategies for Businesses to Navigate and Thrive in Times of CrisisDave Calhoun, CEO of BoeingActions Taken:Engagement with U.S. Senators: Met with senators to discuss the 737 MAX 9 grounding and address regulatory concerns.Quality Assurance Stand-Down: Implemented a temporary pause in production to focus on quality checks and employee training.Public Commitment to Quality Improvements: Announced initiatives to enhance quality control processes at Boeing.Communication with Customers: Proactive outreach to airline customers to discuss issues and reassure them of Boeing's commitment to resolving problems.Internal Review and Employee Engagement: Solicited ideas from employees for quality improvements and initiated an internal review process. Sent a letter to staff saying, ""[he was] deeply sorry for the significant disruption and frustration for our customers.""Motivations and Impact:Calhoun's actions are geared towards damage control, restoring confidence in Boeing's aircraft, and addressing safety concerns from regulators, customers, and the public. The engagement with senators and quality assurance initiatives are aimed at demonstrating Boeing's proactive approach to resolving the issues. However, these actions have led to production delays and financial impacts but are crucial for long-term trust and reliability.Related: 4 Smart Strategies for Safeguarding Your Business and Brand Reputation in a CrisisScott Kirby, CEO of United AirlinesActions Taken:Public Criticism of Boeing: Voiced disappointment in Boeing's handling of the situation.Exploring Alternative Fleet Plans: Indicated openness to considering other manufacturers for future fleet needs.Internal Fleet Planning Adjustments: Removed Boeing MAX 10 jets from internal planning, indicating a shift in fleet strategy.Direct Communication with Boeing: Held discussions with Boeing's CEO to express frustration and seek solutions.Motivations and Impact:Kirby's primary goal is to ensure United Airlines' operational reliability and financial stability. His public criticism and consideration of alternatives signal a strategic shift and put pressure on Boeing to address the issues more effectively. These actions also safeguard United's interests, offering flexibility in fleet management and potentially leveraging better terms with Boeing or alternatives with competitors like Airbus.Ben Minicucci, CEO of Alaska AirlinesActions Taken:Blaming Boeing for Financial Losses: Publicly held Boeing responsible for the $150 million loss due to the grounding.Expressing Anger and Frustration: Voiced strong emotions about the blowout incident on Alaska Airlines flight.Future Fleet Planning Considerations: Suggested the possibility of reevaluating the airline's relationship with Boeing.Demanding Higher Quality Aircraft: Called for Boeing to produce better planes and address manufacturing challenges.Motivations and Impact:Minicucci is focused on mitigating financial losses and operational disruptions for Alaska Airlines. By publicly blaming Boeing, he seeks to hold the manufacturer accountable and potentially negotiate compensation or better terms. His actions also reflect a commitment to safety and operational excellence, signaling to both the public and Boeing the airline's priorities and expectations.Evaluating the ResponsesIn this intricate scenario, each CEO's actions reflect a strategic response to protect and advance their company's interests amid Boeing's 737 MAX 9 crisis. Dave Calhoun's focus is on restoring Boeing's reputation and ensuring long-term viability through quality improvements and regulatory compliance. Scott Kirby and Ben Minicucci are primarily concerned with maintaining operational stability, financial health, and safety standards, demonstrating a willingness to adapt their strategies, including considering alternatives to Boeing if necessary. These actions collectively underscore the intricate dynamics within the aviation industry, where safety, reliability, financial considerations, and strategic relationships play crucial roles in decision-making processes at the highest levels.Related: A Guide to Effective Crisis Leadership — Key Steps to Lead Your Team Through Turbulent TimesWhat Leaders Can LearnAll CEOs involved have shown commendable leadership amidst challenges. CEOs need to be publicly vocal and demonstrate they care about the companies and businesses they represent. That being said, there is room for improvement on every party's end. Dave Calhoun needs to focus on increasing transparency to rebuild trust more effectively. Prioritizing safety and proactive future planning could secure Boeing's competitive edge in the long term. Within the last two decades, Boeing has been in the spotlight for tragedies involving MAX 8 planes. Dave must ensure they build planes that are up to standard. Scott Kirby has shown a willingness to adapt to crises showing his interests are what is best for United. To build upon this, improving communication with customers about safety measures could further strengthen brand loyalty for customers. Additionally, diversifying United's fleet would mitigate any dependency on Boeing. Ben Minicucci too has shown adaptation in the crisis and was critical of Boeing. Continuing the conversation of building safer, better planes will lead to safer flying throughout the aviation industry. Re-evaluating the choice of planes for Alaska Airline's fleet is an important decision that can lead to more growth opportunities in the future.
