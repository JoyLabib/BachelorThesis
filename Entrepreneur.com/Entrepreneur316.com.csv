0,How Empathy-Based Leadership Can Transform Your Teams and Businesses,"Apr 25, 2024",Martin Rust,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-empathy-based-leadership-can-transform-your-team/472847,"
By now the expression ""the new normal"" should be familiar to us all. It's used to describe the profound changes in our daily lives, including where and how we work. It also describes the overall societal functioning that has settled into place following significant global events, such as the pandemic, ebbs and flows in the economy and geopolitical conflicts that seem to drop out of the sky.This term also includes adjustments in how we communicate, conduct business and interact personally and professionally. What was once considered one-off occurrences have now become expected, reflecting a shift in behaviors, expectations and norms that are accepted as the baseline for moving forward.This new normal complicates the business landscape, affecting supply chains, market accessibility and the behavior of employees and suppliers. Given these challenges, it's imperative for traditional strategic frameworks to undergo an overhaul to safeguard resilience and sustained prosperity.



The fallacy of strategic plansWork culture has undergone a seismic shift. The changing dynamics of workplace locations and the motivations behind work have rendered numerous conventional business models and strategies redundant. Today's workforce seeks more than just routine; they yearn for purpose and the chance to be part of growth and lifelong learning.Moreover, a glaring disconnect persists within many traditional strategic plans. Their extensive timelines and meticulous details often misalign with the fluid nature of real-world challenges, which are prone to abrupt changes. This dissonance makes it difficult for employees to envision their roles, widening the gap between executives, managers and their teams.


Extensive evidence highlights the shortcomings of strategic plans. A 2022 Harvard Business School study revealed that 60% of strategic plans fail to meet expectations, yielding poor outcomes. Moreover, 95% of employees questioned in the same study could not articulate or understand their organization's core strategies. Compounding these issues, a study conducted by McKinsey and Company found that only 30% of executives are convinced that their strategies are effective.And while many companies are beginning to see the light about the failure rate of strategic plans, many are unsure what to put in their place.Related: How to Be the Empathetic Leader Your Team NeedsAttrition is expensiveAccording to a 2022 Gallup survey, only 23% of U.S. employees feel engaged in their company's mission and see themselves as co-contributors to the company's successes. Because strategic plans tend to sideline the heart and soul of any organization — the employees expected to carry them out — it should be easy to see the correlation between failed strategic plans and disengaged employees.


Attrition is not just a line item on an HR report; it's a symptom of a deeper dysfunction within the organizational fabric. Also in 2022, Gallup published a survey revealing that disengaged employees cost the global economy $8.8 trillion annually, a testament to the high price of ignoring employee happiness. But what if I told you that the antidote isn't found in more rigorous performance management but in something as basic as empathy?Related: Does Empathy Have a Place in Your Workplace?The importance of an empathy-based approach to running a businessIn all that we encounter, from the significant to the seemingly inconsequential, it's crucial to acknowledge that at every turn, it's about the people. In my experience interacting with communities in conflict and post-conflict zones, understanding is vital, particularly when we're poised to make key decisions. Empathy ought to be the guiding force behind our every action, steering us through each decision we face.Navigating these pivotal moments requires a grasp of what matters. It might appear obvious, but amidst the chaos of daily challenges, this lucidity enables us to sift through the noise and distractions, honing in on what's essential: the well-being and consideration of those around us.


However, in my experience, true understanding extends beyond mere realization. It involves active listening—absorbing what others express and endeavoring to perceive the world from their perspective. This level of empathy sheds light on what's important and molds our decisions in a way that resonates with our deepest values.Empathy-based leadership, a concept I explore through various anecdotes in my book, From War Zones to Boardrooms: Optimize the Moment When Strategic Planning Fails, is about seeing beyond the immediate tasks and understanding the aspirations, challenges and emotions of those we work with. It's about creating an environment where employees feel genuinely seen and heard, which I've found to be a powerful motivator for loyalty and engagement.It's about hearing the unsaid, recognizing the effort behind the results and understanding the context of so-called failures. This approach has not only helped me build stronger connections with my team but has also fostered a culture of trust and openness in my consulting practice.Related: Try This Approach to Create an Enriching and Caring Workplace


Another key aspect of empathy-based leadership is adaptability. Recognizing that each team member is unique and may require different approaches to feel supported and motivated should be foundational. A common expression among young people is ""meeting people where they're at."" It speaks truth and wisdom. By adapting our leadership style to meet these diverse needs, we can create a more inclusive and supportive workplace environment.When we approach challenges from a place of understanding and compassion, we're more likely to uncover the root causes of issues rather than just addressing symptoms. This can lead to more sustainable outcomes and a stronger sense of collective ownership over them.Perhaps the most compelling argument for empathy-based leadership is its impact on business outcomes. Leaders who show more empathy toward their direct reports are viewed as better performers by their bosses. Empathetic leadership can lead to increased employee engagement, higher morale and improved productivity and innovation.

2,She Ditched Her Steady Job in Tech to Pursue Her Love of Food. Now She's a Food Network Champion and Celebrated Cookbook Author.,"Apr 25, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-she-went-from-tech-expert-to-celebrity-chef/473169,"
Breaking the mold is standard for Chef Priyanka Naik, whose leap from a secure tech job to the unpredictable culinary world showcases her recipe for turning passion into sustainable success.A self-taught vegan chef from Staten Island, New York, with roots in Indian culture, Priyanka didn't find her calling in the hallowed halls of culinary schools. Instead, a less likely setting ignited her passion for cooking—a thriving tech career. But it was her commitment to sustainability and a plant-based lifestyle that truly set her apart in the competitive culinary landscape. Listen to the Behind the Review episode below to hear directly from Chef Priyanka Naik.""Cooking was a form of expression, a nod to my heritage, and a way to advocate for the environment,"" Priyanka said, reflecting on her early influences. ""My parents immigrated here in the late '70s from India, so… food was key to staying in touch with our roots and our family.""



Priyanka's culinary philosophy is deeply rooted in sustainability, which she views not only as a personal choice but as a global imperative. ""What we eat impacts not just our health but our planet,"" she said, emphasizing the importance of choosing ingredients that promote environmental health.Whether cooking at home or live on TV, Priyanka rejects single-use plastics, opts for locally sourced ingredients to reduce carbon footprints, and focuses on whole, unprocessed foods to minimize waste. She crafts each dish with the goal of showcasing that vegan food can be both delicious and environmentally conscious.


Related: 'A Lobstrosity': Social Media Is Losing It Over Martha Stewart's Latest Meal PostingPriyanka's commitment to sustainable cooking and her vibrant culinary style earned her a spot—and subsequently a win—on a Food Network cooking show in 2017. This victory served as a launching pad for her broader mission to advocate for sustainable living through food.""Winning on Food Network was a validation, a way to show a large audience that sustainable cooking can be vibrant, diverse, and delicious,"" she said. It was the beginning of a larger dialogue about the intersection of cuisine and sustainability.Priyanka's victory catapulted her into the culinary spotlight, allowing her to further her mission of sustainable, vegan cooking and publish a cookbook, The Modern Tiffin.


Parallel to her success in publishing, Priyanka has built a robust presence on social media, where she extends her culinary influence beyond the printed page. Her Instagram, YouTube, and blog are not just showcases for her recipes but also platforms for education and engagement on sustainability in the kitchen. She regularly shares tips on reducing food waste, choosing sustainable ingredients, and preparing meals that are both delicious and environmentally friendly.""Social media has been an invaluable tool for connecting with like-minded individuals and spreading the message about sustainable living,"" Priyanka said.Related: Jon Taffer's 10% Rule Is the Productivity Hack That Could Change Your LifeHer posts, often accompanied by vibrant photos and engaging videos, attract a diverse audience eager to learn about eco-friendly cooking practices. Through these interactions, Priyanka has cultivated a community that is as passionate about sustainable living as they are about culinary arts.


Priyanka's approach to engagement extends beyond digital platforms. She participates in public speaking engagements and cooking demonstrations, where she shares her story and culinary philosophy in person. These interactions enhance her community connections, providing more opportunities to advocate for a sustainable lifestyle.""It's about more than just food,"" Priyanka said. ""It's about making a difference in the world through the choices we make in our kitchens.""With every dish and blog post, Chef Priyanka leverages her platform to connect with and educate her audience about sustainable practices. Whether it's through Instagram stories, detailed blog posts about reducing kitchen waste, or public speaking engagements, she emphasizes the impact of individual choices on global sustainability. Her ability to weave storytelling with practical culinary advice has launched her into a relatable and inspiring figure in the food community.For those looking to turn their culinary passions into careers, Priyanka advises embracing their unique journey.


""Believe in your unique path. The road less traveled can be daunting, but it is ripe with opportunities to carve out a niche that is authentically yours,"" she said. Resilience, self-promotion, and authenticity are her cornerstones for building a brand that resonates with personal and professional values.Since her breakthrough on Food Network, Chef Priyanka Naik has adhered to these powerful principles for success:Embrace your unique background to stand out in a crowded field. Chef Priyanka's path from tech to the kitchen underscores the importance of pursuing your passions, no matter how unconventional they may seem.Make your values a cornerstone of your business. Educate your audience about the impact of their purchasing choices, whether that be for environmental, social, or ethical issues. This commitment can transform customers into advocates for your brand.Leverage social media. Use platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn not just to showcase products but also to connect with and educate your audience.

6,How Close Is AI to Actually Stealing Your Dream Job?,"Apr 22, 2024",Ariel Shapira,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-close-is-ai-to-actually-stealing-my-job/472672,"
Consider you're a busy parent looking for ways to simplify your life. Putting your weekly schedule or grocery list into a generative AI chatbot like ChatGPT could be a saving grace, assisting in tasks like weekly meal planning or even helping your child with homework. This kind of automation via generative AI shows how it can be beneficial in streamlining a person's daily tasks and managing their affairs.But how dangerous is AI for the future of work?There has been a long-standing fear that machines will eventually replace human professions, alarming workers about the future of employment. Reports suggest that up to 300 million jobs could be replaced by AI, generating looming uncertainty over workforce dynamics and automation.



So, every working person's question is: Will AI take away my dream job? In short, the answer is likely yes, but it depends on what your dream job entails.However, it is worth highlighting the positive ways AI augments certain workforces. In high-stress or tedious positions, automation can enable workers to focus on more meaningful and high-value activities while relieving some job-related burdens.


While it's undeniable that AI will continue to reshape industries, there is substantial reason to believe it won't take over every job. Yes, AI does offer capabilities that lend a hand to productivity. However, its abilities have inherent limitations, especially falling short when replicating human intuition, empathy, and creativity.We also can't ignore that AI is limited to the information it's trained on. OpenAI touts ChatGPT's ability to pass numerous standardized tests, but did the model genuinely understand the tests, or was it just trained to reproduce the correct answers? AI machines are designed to ""think within the box,"" meaning that they can only function within the parameters of their given data, lacking a true creative or analytical nature that many professions require.Related: AI Is Taking Over These Freelancing Jobs the Most: ReportAI's thinking gapAI has been a game-changer for law by automating repetitive tasks, but integrating these technologies comes with challenges. The Law Society of British Columbia, for example, has warned lawyers about using AI automation to prepare legal documents, highlighting the potential ethical implications, biases, and glaring inaccuracies in materials produced by AI.


Likewise, the world of architecture is no stranger to technological advancements, with architects always looking for ways to harness innovation to improve their designs. But when AI tools can generate blueprints with relative ease, the fear of architects becoming redundant remains. While an AI model can create and analyze design options or predict how people can use a space, it cannot replace the vision and intuition an architect brings to their craft.Healthcare is another domain where complexities of human emotions and behaviors necessitate the expertise of trained professionals who offer empathy and deep understanding. AI can undoubtedly assist with administrative tasks like analyzing data or offering high-level insights, but it lacks the essential human qualities needed for effective counseling.AI enthusiasts in healthcare have long envisioned a future where doctors are aided by sophisticated algorithms, providing valuable suggestions to enhance patient care. However, despite a high level of optimism about physicians benefitting from AI, regulatory uncertainty and concerns about patient experience have slowed adoption. A recent study found that ChatGPT has a more than 80% diagnostic error rate when using AI in pediatric case diagnosis — an unacceptable figure that indicates no doctor could ever rely on its output now. But could the pieces of this puzzle come together to build physician and public confidence in AI?Related: Report: AI Will Take More Jobs Away from Women Than Men


Building trust with automationWhile successful AI implementation will likely positively impact patient outcomes, the consequences of errors would be severe. Even if a physician doesn't take a potentially harmful AI suggestion at face value, they will end up spending valuable time and resources rectifying the inaccuracies.AI's opaque decision-making processes also pose challenges for clinicians who cannot understand the rationale behind automated recommendations. This lack of transparency not only undermines trust in AI systems but complicates the process of integrating them into current healthcare infrastructures.That being said, some startups are working to make AI accountable in the field by rooting it in reality. Kahun, for instance, developed an evidence-based clinical reasoning engine for doctors that provides clinical decision support using explainable AI. It reasons like a physician and allows transparency in its output by providing evidence-based clinical insights cited in peer-reviewed medical literature alongside patient-specific information.Datapeople is another example of an AI-assisted tool designed to support professionals in the workforce. This program assists hiring teams in making recruitment decisions grounded in scientific principles and fairness.


Suppose professionals embraced the benefits of AI rather than fearing its encroachment on their jobs. In that case, they may be more inclined to integrate these tools into their practice, leading to potential improvements in the quality and efficiency of their work.Of course, not all jobs are safe from AI. But the truth is that many roles will always require human intervention, particularly those involving decision-making, emotional intelligence, and creativity. However, combining AI's strengths with human capabilities allows for an intertwined approach to problem-solving and innovation. By leveraging AI's efficiency with human intuition, we can continue to use automation to optimize tasks and address complex challenges more effectively.

23,4 Ways AI Startups Can Avoid Becoming Obsolete,"Apr 5, 2024",Yusuf Efe,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/4-tips-for-ai-startups-to-avoid-obsolescence/471819,"
The rapid progress in AI is intensifying uncertainties for startups and their founders. Each model release from big AI players poses a challenge, potentially rendering thousands of startups obsolete, including those who believed they had a defensible tech stack. Similarly, the release of new open-source models can negate years of effort by startups overnight. This evolving landscape underscores the critical need for careful ideation and business model formulation for AI entrepreneurs.To aid in this endeavor, I offer four key pitfalls to avoid, along with strategic recommendations, drawing from my extensive academic and industrial research.Related: 6 Ways AI Is Revolutionizing Startup Ecosystems



1. Develop an AI-embedded product with organic workflow integrations and strong user experienceImagine you've launched a startup that creates game assets for gaming companies using AI. Users upload images, specifying styles and providing textual descriptions for new designs, which your AI then brings to life, aligning with the users' visions and the initial style cues. However, this AI isn't integrated into the designers' daily workflows or fine-tuned based on their evolving needs, rendering it only an external aid that shines as long as its outputs surpass industry standards. Then the following question arises: what will keep your clients from switching to a competitor offering a superior solution?Therefore, your AI should integrate seamlessly into clients' workflows, adapt over time and provide an engaging experience. Consider Notion as an illustrative example. It may not be a giant player in AI, but its users like the intuitive note-taking experience enhanced by an AI assistant. Even with superior models available, users stick with Notion for its smooth, integrated AI experience, demonstrating the value of user-friendly design over raw power.


Related: 5 AI Hacks You Need to Know About in 20242. Ensure your AI product is finely tailored for niche marketsIf you are not creating the high-tech infrastructure from scratch yourself, then it might be overambitious to create an AI product with a focus that is too broad. There are mainly two reasons for this: Firstly, market leaders in these broad areas are swiftly incorporating state-of-the-art AI into their products, driven by the need to stay competitive and the ease of using foundational model APIs when developing in-house solutions isn't viable.Take, for instance, the initial rollout of APIs by OpenAI. Numerous ambitious entrepreneurs aimed to leverage these AI capabilities to challenge established players across various sectors. However, OpenAI's subsequent partnerships, through ChatGPT Plugins, with industry giants like Expedia, Instacart and Zapier showcased the rapid integration of AI into leading businesses, helping them preserve their positions. Notably, OpenAI's collaboration with Zapier presented a significant challenge to Adept AI, a startup formed by prominent AI researchers, since both companies aim to ease computer workflow automation via natural language commands. This scenario illustrates that opting for a broad focus in AI can be risky even for highly technical teams.Second, despite major AI firms' commitments to foundational technologies, they're branching into application layers to boost revenue, targeting areas where minimal effort yields a broad impact. This shift towards products with expansive objectives suggests a strategic pivot for smaller AI startups: focusing on a highly specialized niche. By crafting an exceptional AI experience in a specific domain, an emerging AI startup can establish a competitive edge, leveraging specialization as a strong strategy in a market dominated by broader initiatives.


Related: How to Find Your Startup's Niche3. Avoid confining your AI product solely as a plugin for existing software — opt for a standalone solution insteadThe emergence of generative AI APIs inspired numerous entrepreneurs to enhance everyday tools like Excel, PowerPoint and various software development platforms using AI. They crafted AI-enhanced plugins to augment user experiences within these applications. For instance, innovative tools enabled users to automate routine Excel tasks, significantly boosting productivity, particularly for finance professionals. Initially, these AI-enhanced solutions saw a surge in demand.However, the landscape shifted when major platforms began integrating their own AI solutions, such as Microsoft Copilot for Finance or Google's AI features in Gmail and Docs. These in-house developments rendered many third-party plugins nearly redundant. This evolution underscores a critical lesson for startups: relying excessively on a single platform can be risky. Ensuring your business's resilience means diversifying your dependency and continuously innovating to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving tech environment.4. Develop solutions that receive natural support from the AI ecosystemA strategic approach to selecting an AI startup idea is to focus on areas likely to receive ecosystem support. Major AI firms are continually advancing models with the capacity to revolutionize various industries and businesses of differing scales. Yet, integrating these models is not without its challenges. Businesses often hesitate to fully deploy these models in customer-facing applications due to uncertainties about outcomes' safety and concerns about data privacy, which could lead to the exposure of sensitive information.


Recognizing these hurdles, large AI corporations are particularly encouraging of startups dedicated to addressing these integration issues. These new ventures are working on solutions like conducting model evaluations, establishing data privacy safeguards and developing innovative security protocols. For example, OpenAI started grant programs to promote AI Safety and Security efforts. This support underscores the opportunities for startups to contribute value by facilitating the safe and effective adoption of AI technologies across various sectors.Related: The White House's AI Executive Order

24,How to Better Manage Your Brand's Reputation in the Digital Age,"Apr 5, 2024",Kevin King,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-better-manage-your-brands-reputation-in-the-digital/471895,"
It was a salutary tale of how not to do reputation management. The skincare brand Sunday Riley was forced to settle with the Federal Trade Commission after its leadership had directed employees to post fake reviews to the influential Sephora website and dislike negative reviews to have them taken down. Review manipulation is a growing phenomenon. In 2023, Amazon took 44 bad actors to court in Europe, and this year won a civil case in Milan against a review broker that had tried to facilitate five-star ratings on Amazon's Italian store. At a time when trust among consumers is precariously low, manipulating online ratings can destroy public confidence in a brand.For the past 30-plus years in the hospitality industry, perhaps the pioneer in online reviews, I have seen many scenarios of both good and bad reputation control. As social influence and social proof amplify traditional word of mouth and media influence, negative news and negative feedback can spiral out of control — and fast. However, with so many booking platforms and social channels today, it's nearly impossible to manually flag individual reviews. Companies need a more positive, ethical and proactive approach to lifting standards and addressing public concerns.Related: Don't Fall Victim to a Digital Hitman — Here Are 6 Ways to Protect Your Online Reputation From Fake Reviews



Strive for authenticityFor better or worse, the ""wisdom of the crowd"" is holding sway over where people are spending their money. After the Edelman Trust Barometer declared 2022 ""the cycle of distrust"" among consumers, things hardly improved last year as economic optimism at large collapsed. Online reviews have increasingly occupied this trust void, with Tripadvisor finding they are the biggest factor influencing buying decisions for 66% of U.S. consumers.The flip side for businesses like hotels is one negative review can set off a chain of complaints that drive down new bookings, customer loyalty and revenue; and drive up operational costs. Nor is consumer trust blind. Tripadvisor found that 49% of consumers worldwide believed brands manipulated reviews, while Boston University research concluded that people were more likely to trust four-star reviews because they were perceived as more thoughtful and accurate. A separate study found that purchases peak in the 4.0-4.7 ratings band and then declined the closer they got to 5.0.


All these findings constellate around the perception of brand authenticity, and in the sometimes fickle world of online reviews, this may be the most valuable currency of all.Become your own influencerOver the last few years, we have witnessed influencers reaching a massive audience when they review just about anything — hotels included. Cleanliness issues lead to live-streamed disputes with staff, making any real or imagined wrongdoing painfully public. Virality on apps like Instagram, X (formerly Twitter) or TikTok amplifies their disproportionate power.During Paris Fashion Week, influencers let the world know that local businesses, especially hotels, were infested with bedbugs. While the pest problem may have been growing well before the event, it was only when influencers posted about the issue that it gained traction. For retailers and brands, high-volume events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday or Amazon Prime Day represent both risk and opportunity. If their websites, supply chains and customer service are not prepared, even a few hours of downtime can do major damage to their reputation.The cost of negative publicity is staggering. Peloton saw almost $1.5bn wiped off its value after a backlash against its ill-advised Christmas advertisement went viral. There is a thin margin between success and failure, and according to internal research that I was shown by a leading reputation-management company in Europe, hotels can expect a 20% revenue drop if their online rating dips from 7.0 to 6.9 on Booking.com. The answer is to actively monitor customer feedback and take immediate steps to remedy negative sentiment.


Related: Being Attacked Online? Online Reputation Expert Shares How You Can Defend YourselfHow to better manage online reputationsWhile businesses are extremely sensitive to negative online reviews, the opposite is also true with positive online reviews leading to improved reputations. That is borne out by the ""Very Good 8+"" criteria being one of the most used search filters on Booking.com. To increase the likelihood of positive reviews, practice these four strategies:Implement service recovery: Asking for feedback at multiple touchpoints can help companies identify recurrent issues. In one internal study by a luxury hotel brand, a customer's satisfaction score went up by 13.8% when they were asked to complete both in-stay and post-stay surveys.Increase review volume: Invest in review generation programs that make it easy for customers to leave ratings and feedback immediately after an interaction or purchase.Create targeted team responses: Segment feedback data and ensure the right teams get actionable insights matching their roles and responsibilities.Stay away from review manipulations: The short-term increase in revenue and visibility might seem great, but the risk is too high. Even if competitors are involved in review manipulation, it is never worth the risk.Adopt data-breach response strategies: With retail and hospitality so dependent on tech, a response plan for data breaches is essential.

From investment to impactThe UK hospitality management company, RBH, uses a third-party solution that collates and analyzes thousands of reviews and post-stay surveys to identify weak spots and trends in feedback. With rich data at its disposal, the group found that just a one-point increase in Global Review Index (GRI) score could lead to a revenue increase of £3 million ($US3.8 million) across its 45-plus hotels.Reputation-management software helps brands understand what issues to address based on sentiment analysis in order to reduce negative ratings over time as this space continues to evolve. The review market share of Google, Yelp, Booking.com and Tripadvisor has shifted a lot over the past five years — and if Instagram added reviews to its functionality, it would change again overnight. Businesses dependent on public ratings cannot afford to stand still. A proactive approach that leverages the latest data tools can safeguard reputations as consumers continue to vote with their ratings.

27,4 Strategies to Help You Attract More Local Customers to Your Small Business,"Apr 4, 2024",Jason Hennessey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-attract-more-local-customers-to-your-small-business/471769,"
Want to increase foot traffic and attract local customers to your business? Whether you're a restaurant owner, hair stylist, lawyer or general contractor, you can benefit from local search marketing.Local search marketing is the practice of using geo-specific advertising strategies to increase your business's visibility in local search — namely, Google Search. This is an important and effective type of marketing for local business owners who want more website traffic and customers.Learn more about local search marketing and how to use it to increase your brand's visibility, traffic and sales.Related: Why Local SEO is the Key to Business SuccessClaim and optimize your Google Business ProfileGoogle Business Profile (previously known as Google For Business) is Google's free online listing tool that allows businesses to rank higher in Google Maps. It's prime real estate to get your business found by potential customers.



You might be surprised to find that there's already a listing for your business. Before creating a new profile, conduct a Google search of your business name. If you find an existing Google listing that appears to be your business, you can ""claim"" it to acquire ownership.If you don't see an existing Google Business Profile for your business, create a new one. You will first need to log into your Gmail account and then follow the steps Google provides to create a profile.Once claimed, be sure to optimize your profile to maximize your reach. To do this, be sure to:Fill out your listing completely with the correct business name, address, phone number, website URL, description, business hours and category.Add high-quality photos of your business (exterior and interior, if applicable), team members, products, logo or any other relevant images that showcase your business.Encourage past customers to leave positive reviews, and be sure to respond to all reviews (whether positive or negative) to show that you value your customers.Include relevant keywords (including location-based terms) in your listing description and posts, as this can improve your visibility.Add attributes to your business profile, such as ""Woman-Owned,"" ""Wheelchair accessible,"" ""Outdoor seating"" or whatever applies, to provide more helpful information to potential customers.Keep your listing up to date with your correct business hours, holiday hours, phone number, website URL, etc. Respond to new reviews in a timely manner.Optimize your website for local search termsThe key to attracting local customers is to rank for the terms (i.e., ""keywords"") they are using to find brands, services and products like yours.Use a keyword research tool like Semrush.com or Ahrefs.com to conduct a search for relevant keywords, using the combination ""[location][product or service]."" For example, if you have a family law firm in Los Angeles, some terms to search for could be ""LA family law,"" ""family lawyer Los Angeles,"" ""LA divorce lawyer,"" etc.Then, confirm that the terms you are searching for have: 1) search volume and 2) medium to low competition. This ensures that you are targeting terms that people are actually searching for.


Finally, apply these keywords to the respective pages of your website, creating individual landing pages for each product or service. For example, if you are a hair stylist in Seattle, you might have pages targeting ""Haircuts | Seattle,"" ""Hair Color Salon | Seattle,"" and ""Hair Treatments | Seattle.""To ""optimize"" your landing pages for your target keywords, use the respective keywords in the page title, in the headings (where fitting) and throughout the body copy naturally. Check out this complete guide on how to optimize your landing pages.Related: The 8 Best Free and Low-Cost SEO Tools for Small BusinessesUpdate your online directory listingsGoogle Business Profile is not the only listing available to help you boost your business.

A slow and/or poorly optimized website can lead to customer frustration and lost opportunities for your brand. Plus, Google's algorithm prioritizes mobile-friendly websites in the search results, so it's a must-have if you want to generate more traffic.Here are a few tips for implementing a fast and mobile-friendly design:


Build (or redesign) your website according to responsive design principles, allowing your site to adapt to various screen sizes and devices.Compress the images on your website to reduce file size, which can help speed up your website.Enable browser caching to reduce the bandwidth needed to load static resources like images, JavaScript and CSS.Test your website's performance with Google's PageSpeed Insights tool to identify issues and find recommendations for how to improve site speed.Simplify your site navigation with clear tabs and call-to-action buttons that are easy to see on smaller devices. Avoid long walls of text and small images.Related: Why Local Marketing Still Matters in the Digital AgeIf you want more local customers, implementing local search strategies is the way to go. Leverage the power of Google to get your business noticed, increase web traffic and drive more sales.

29,How to Use AI to Identify Much-Needed Solutions for Your Business,"Apr 3, 2024",Raghavan Muthuregunathan,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-to-use-ai-to-identify-much-needed-solutions-for-your/469610,"
Entrepreneurs are at the forefront of innovation and economic development. Researchers have started to use artificial intelligence (AI) to discover new proteins and develop new sorting algorithms. Following this lead, entrepreneurs can unlock new opportunities and identify innovative solutions using AI to solve problems in one field using ideas and solutions from unrelated fields. This cross-industry innovation is not new to entrepreneurs.Kanban from ToyotaOne of the well-known examples of inspiration from one field impacting another field is ""The Kanban methodology."" It is now essential for modern agile software development teams. However, this traces back over half a century to Toyota's innovation, inspired by supermarket stocking methods. As supermarkets optimize their inventory to meet consumer demand, Toyota adopted the model to optimize material inventory to meet production demands. The process involved using a card system, ""Kanban,"" to inform the need for materials to enable just-in-time manufacturing. The system has evolved over the years and is central to the Kanban board used in Software Development. This has improved collaboration and the overall software development process.Related: Beware the Duplicity of OpenAI — 4 Strategies to Safeguard Your Brand in the Age of AI



Checklists from the aviation industryAnother well-known example is the use of checklists to ensure safety in the aviation industry. Pilots and flight attendants use checklists for the completeness of pre-flight operations. This is adapted in healthcare. The most notable example is the World Health Organization's Surgical Safety Checklist. Introduced in 2008, it is a simple tool used in surgical operations to ensure everyone knows vital information such as patient's identity, planned procedure, etc.It also helps confirm that safety checks are completed before the procedure begins, fostering better communication among surgical staff. In both Aviation and Healthcare, checklists serve as a cognitive aid in complex, high-stress situations, so no critical step is missed due to human error.


Related: 4 Reasons Why Most Entrepreneurs Still Hesitate to Use ChatGPTMore examplesOther examples of such cross-industry innovation resulting in significant impact includeThe Six Sigma process from Motorola reduces defects and errors, minimizing variance.Randomized Control Trials from clinical research inspired A/B testing run by consumer internet companies to decide email marketing, product pricing, and many more.Engineers redesigned the Shinkansen bullet train based on how the Kingfisher birds can slice through the air to catch their prey.Fractal theory, which shows how to build complex shapes from simple repeating patterns, has inspired the construction of compact and complex antennas.We can see a combination of process adoptions and technical solutions from one field to solve the problems in another. There are various mechanisms through which such cross-industry inspiration and innovations happen. It could be individuals switching disciplines, bringing their knowledge, and applying the techniques to solve problems in the new field. In other cases, dedicated interdisciplinary teams seek inspiration from other industries to tackle a particular challenge. With the rise of the Internet and digital communication platforms, it's easier for experts to learn from each other and share best practices of their respective fields, enabling cross-pollination and accelerating cross-industry innovation.Leverage LLMs to identify opportunitiesLarge Language models (LLMs) trained on vast datasets across the internet are used for creative tasks such as poem writing and image creation. It is possible to fine-tune and train them to identify such cross-pollinated cross-industry innovations. This requires training in a large language model focusing on multidisciplinary understanding and analogical reasoning.


Until such an LLM is trained, a domain expert could leverage existing Large Language models by sharing key research papers and prompting them to identify a solution. Their domain expertise could later verify the viability and feasibility of the solution. For example, prompting GPT4 to read scholarly articles about ""Physics of Protein Self Assembly"" and ""Carbon Nanotube Fabrication (CNT): Challenges"" resulted in GPT4 proposing a solution to improve the CNT fabrication by potentially developing a solution to control the chirality and diameter of Carbon nanotubes. LLM tries to inspire the idea of designing anisotropic interactions between the catalyst particles and carbon precursors, guiding the directional growth of Carbon Nanotubes. Another inspiration is to leverage the patchiness and interaction specificity of proteins, then engineer to control the growth directions of Carbon Nanotubes.Related: How to Use AI to Amplify the Potential of Your TeamAfter repeating the experiment with Claude 3 Opus, we can see that the idea of anisotropy interaction was validated again. Below is the excerpt of the last paragraph generated by Anthropic Claude for the same prompt.""In summary, borrowing the concepts of interaction anisotropy and assembly kinetics from protein physics could point the way to rational catalyst design for controlled, efficient CNT growth. The protein physics article provides a useful framework for thinking about self-assembly that could translate productively to the CNT fabrication challenge with further research.""


Hallucination is not a bugIt is entirely possible that the solution is infeasible and that LLMs are hallucinating. Even if the LLM's proposed solution is not practically feasible, it might inspire experts. LLMs could act as copilots, analogous to Jarvis and Ironman. Hallucination is not a bug but a feature of forced cross-pollination to inspire innovation. Entrepreneurs should invest in learning how to leverage LLMs to identify groundbreaking zero-to-one cross-industry innovation.Retrieval Augmented Generation applications built on top of Large Language Models could be used to identify innovative solutions with humans in the loop to avoid hallucination and ensure practicality. Entrepreneurs are best positioned to do this by working with domain experts.

31,What's Blocking You From Adopting Generative AI in Your Business? It's Likely One of These Three Things,"Apr 3, 2024","Sahar Hashmi, MD-PhD",https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/whats-stopping-you-from-using-generative-ai-in-your/470921,"
Generative AI is catalyzing a significant paradigm shift in various business sectors, including coding, data science, content creation, virtual assistance, medical support, artistic innovation, media, marketing, game development, financial analysis and digital education, among others. This technology is enhancing business efficiencies broadly and transforming key industries such as healthcare, education and technology, as well as organizational workflows in numerous areas, thereby promising high returns. Consequently, generative AI is reshaping the future of work across a wide array of industries.MarketsandMarkets predicts substantial growth in the global AI industry, estimating it will reach $1,345.20 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.8% from 2023 to 2030. In alignment with these financial expectations, the Infosys Knowledge Institute has shown that ""firms that use AI well can increase enterprise profit by 38% and will help deliver $14 trillion of gross added value to corporations by 2035.""Yet, despite these promising financial forecasts, the actual deployment of AI technologies, particularly generative AI, falls short of expectations. Gartner survey results published in Harvard Business Review indicate a potential gap in AI adoption: While 70% of organizations were exploring generative AI as of March and April 2023, only 4% had fully implemented these technologies.



So why do business leaders hesitate to integrate generative AI solutions into their operations?The reasons experts have identified for the slow adoption of generative AI primarily center on high costs, data complexities and a shortage of skilled professionals, among other factors. Additionally, there is prevalent mistrust among recent startups and technology industries concerning the effectiveness of available solutions and worries about potential pitfalls.


Despite these numerous factors, here are three potential key reasons that stand out for their hesitancy to embrace AI, along with suggested strategies to address these challenges.Related: You Can Fear It and Still Use It — Why Are So Many American Workers Shy About AI?3 reasons business leaders hesitate to adopt generative AI1. Resistance to change and egoLeadership often hesitates to adopt new technologies, preferring traditional business methods. For example, surgeons at MGH only adopted the Da Vinci surgical robot after losing patients to hospitals using the technology, as they found it hard to leave established practices for new training methods. Similarly, many business leaders stick to conventional workflows, perceiving new changes like AI adoption as disruptive, resource-draining and costly. Their personal discomfort with AI may lead them to reject such innovations, claiming they are ""too busy"" to explore new technological advancements.


2. Lack of expertise in the field of AI applicationsThe problem of leadership resistance is further exacerbated by the shortage of specialized training or expertise, coupled with the challenge of retaining skilled professionals in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Despite the burgeoning enthusiasm for AI, there remains a critical need for specialized AI experts within business leadership teams. Although sourcing highly skilled individuals in the market is challenging, retaining them poses an additional hurdle, potentially leading businesses to shy away from considering AI solutions.3. The majority of generative AI solutions are still in the beta phaseWhile generative AI is transforming industries and businesses globally, most of its applications, including ChatGPT4, are still in the beta phase and continuously improving. The more these systems are used, the more data they gather to refine their responses.


However, they are not infallible; they can still experience ""hallucinations"" or produce errors, which might be detrimental depending on the context of use. Such inaccuracies or data security and privacy issues with generative AI applications can have serious implications, particularly in business settings, where they can affect clients or customers and potentially harm the business's reputation. These incidents can lead to distrust among business leaders, resulting in hesitation or outright refusal to adopt AI solutions.Related: This Is the New ChatGPT Trend That Will Enhance Your BusinessHow to thoughtfully adopt AI into your business1. Weigh the benefits and risks for business impactBusinesses that adapt swiftly to change often outperform their competitors, underscoring the importance for leadership to stay abreast of new trends using AI solutions and be ready to embrace them, even when the changes are challenging. A primary consideration is determining whether the AI trend is beneficial for the company's operations, specifically if it can enhance current processes or workflows efficiently and cost-effectively.


It's advisable to engage external expert advisors to assess the advantages and risks of new technological trends, as well as their potential impact on the business. This evaluation process might entail multiple discussions with external AI specialists, financial advisors and internal teams to reach an informed decision regarding the consideration to adopt an AI solution.2. Conduct in-depth technical evaluations of AI solutions before you choose and implement oneOnce the decision to adopt an AI solution has been made, the subsequent crucial step is to conduct an exhaustive market search for AI vendor offerings. It is vital to undertake comprehensive evaluations of AI technology solutions before adoption to minimize the risk of potential failures that could negatively impact a business.Investing in a meticulous and thorough due diligence process, which includes multiple rounds of assessment by different AI technology experts, is imperative. This method is more than a precautionary measure — it's a strategic investment that could save a business not just thousands, but potentially millions of dollars in the long run by ensuring that the selected AI solutions are well-aligned with the business's needs and are set up for successful integration.


3. Make time for ongoing specialized AI workshops and updates for leadership teamsIt is crucial for business leaders to allocate time to understand the basics of available AI business solutions in the market. A recommended approach is to organize regular lunch-hour workshops tailored toward specific AI solutions for leadership, led by AI industry experts. These workshops are an effective strategy to keep leaders engaged and informed about the latest developments in AI technology. By integrating customized learning/training into their schedules in an efficient and focused manner, leaders can stay abreast of advancements and better position their businesses to leverage AI innovations.Related: How Cutting Edge AI Tech Could Be Your Answer to Tackling StressAs we navigate the burgeoning era of generative AI solutions, which is finding its application across various business sectors, it's crucial for leadership to remain engaged and informed to avoid falling behind competitors. The dawn of this new generative AI era is upon us, escalating rapidly. To effectively leverage its advantages, business leaders need to be well-prepared and proactive, ensuring a deep understanding and strategic integration of these advanced technologies into their planning, doing so both efficiently and effectively to steer their business toward success.

40,More Than a Trend — 5 Crucial Ways This Untapped Service is Changing Marketing,"Mar 25, 2024",Dmitrii Khasanov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-ways-saas-is-changing-digital-marketing/471063,"
The SaaS industry is constantly evolving, making it imperative for digital marketing entities and enthusiasts to ride the wave of the latest trends. It's a business ecosystem that self-develops, expanding annually — in 2023, the SaaS market boasted a valuation of around 197 billion U.S. dollars, projected to surge to a whopping $232 billion by 2024. Meanwhile, the global cloud computing market is on the brink of crossing the $1 trillion mark by 2025. With figures of such magnitude, you can imagine how competitive this industry will be.Therefore, in 2024, the strategic focus should be developing marketing strategies using SaaS products to distinguish yourself from competitors and secure a larger market share by attracting potential customers. Let's delve deeper into the solutions provided by the SaaS market for those looking to enhance marketing performance through software and applications.Today, marketers can choose among software options that optimize marketing campaigns and related business processes. Here are just a few examples:



Customer Relationship Management (CRM)Resource planning for marketing campaignsEmail marketing softwareCustomer experience managementAnalytics and reportingSEO analysisOnline reputation managementSaaS presents a significant opportunity by providing businesses with access to efficient software that was costly and resource-intensive in an on-premises environment in the past. Let's zoom in on specific solutions tailored to the digital marketing niche.Related: 5 Ways to Boost Your B2B SaaS Content Marketing


1. New data-driven decision-making approachSaaS tools offer real-time data analytics, giving marketers valuable insights into customer behaviors and campaign effectiveness. Using this data for informed decision-making is a straightforward way to enhance marketing strategies. Some software offers real-time insights into user behavior, enabling users to make the right decisions. Analyzing metrics such as website traffic, conversion rates and demographics equips marketing teams with the information needed to refine and optimize marketing strategies.2. Improved personalization of campaignsUsing software, especially customer relationship management platforms and marketing automation, makes it easy to personalize campaigns on a large scale. As a result, individual preferences are forming increased engagement.Related: 7 Steps for Crafting a Seamless Marketing Campaign3. Efficient team collaborationThe transparent and open connection between employees and departments is key to the team's success, which is why SaaS platforms facilitate seamless communication and project management. With features like real-time messaging, file sharing and integrations with other business applications, these tools ensure that marketing teams stay connected and agile in response to dynamic market conditions.


4. AI-powered automationThis is not a sector in which artificial intelligence is a new trend for the next five years. SaaS platform developers integrated AI to automate data analysis, trend prediction and routine tasks — what else does a typical marketing specialist need? This allows marketers to focus on strategic aspects of campaigns while next-generation technology handles operational tasks.Related: Top B2B Marketing Strategies for SaaS Businesses5. Next-level cybersecurityModern software offers protection against cyber threats such as DDoS attacks and data breaches, ensuring the secure operation of marketing campaigns. SaaS platforms prioritize security features, safeguarding campaigns against potential attacks. Marketers can operate with confidence, knowing their data is secure.Based on my personal experience and working with numerous software providers and application developers, I can share the main reason why you should consider SaaS solutions important for your marketing campaigns.


SaaS provides accessibility from any device with an internet connection, which is crucial for today's hybrid environments and remote work scenarios.SaaS operates on a subscription model, eliminating expenses related to licenses, installation and infrastructure management.With a fixed fee, the SaaS vendor becomes responsible for ongoing maintenance. Server upgrades are not a surprise — scalability is made simple.No time wasted. SaaS skips the complexities of on-premises software, allowing immediate deployment once your subscription begins.Scale effortlessly as your business grows. Solutions accommodate additional services and storage without the need for costly infrastructure upgrades.Rely on SaaS vendors for robust cybersecurity and disaster recovery. Many assure 99% or higher uptime, requiring only a stable internet connection.SaaS providers regularly update software and security features.Its compatibility with other platforms and systems through APIs allows customization without incurring extra infrastructure costs.SaaS applications gather usage and performance data, providing dynamic analytics for strategic decision-making.Even better, SaaS takes the hassle out of keeping up with the latest software updates. The software vendors usually provide these updates automatically. So, businesses stay up-to-date without any extra effort. The main takeaway? Choosing SaaS for marketing improvement isn't just a trend; it's a practical choice that lets companies stay competitive, improve their marketing strategies, and stand out in the business world.

41,Why You Should Incorporate AI into Your Business — and How to Do It the Right Way,"Mar 25, 2024",Alex Goryachev,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/why-you-should-incorporate-ai-into-your-business-and/471318,"
Advancements in generative AI mean that disruptions that used to take decades, nowadays can happen in a span of a few months. This is promising an immense economic opportunity — PwC estimates that, by 2030, AI could pour $15.7 trillion into the global economy.Many think that these gains will come from tech giants like Apple and Microsoft, but that's simply not the case. I believe that more than half of the potential value created by AI in various sectors could come from entirely new businesses and applications that do not exist today.However, a common threat that stands in the way of entrepreneurial innovation is reducing the AI revolution to merely an IT problem. Entrepreneurs who want to play the long game should look at AI not as a question of technology, but as a fundamental shift in how they innovate and do business.



Related: How to Leverage AI to Supercharge Your BusinessAI should be a part of your business modelIf it's not, you are already failing and have some catching up to do. I'm not saying this for shock value, but because I can see the writings on the wall. In a competitive world where the slightest advantage in speed or innovativeness can mean the difference between surviving and thriving, it's hard to imagine that your competitors aren't already thinking about or leveraging AI.


In fact, any organization, regardless of the industry, could and should be embedding AI within their operations. No matter what function you look at — from operations and HR to IT and customer service — generative AI can and will transform the way we work.If you aren't convinced that you need to act now, just look at what happened during the early days of the internet. As I was evangelizing the World Wide Web, I saw many entrepreneurs and executives treat the internet as a new form of communication relevant only to their IT department. As a result, they were reluctant to quickly invest in online technologies and either failed or became obsolete.I am witnessing a similar thing happen with generative AI today. Those who think that it doesn't apply to them or just view it as another buzzword are simply missing the big picture. And they're bound to pay a hefty price.Related: The Secret to How Businesses Can Fully Harness the Power of AI


How to incorporate AI in your businessIt's one thing to acknowledge and accept the power of generative AI to transform business operations. It's another to harness this power in a responsible and constructive manner. While this technology can revolutionize any aspect of your business, there is definitely a wrong and a right way to implement it.Get AI-savvy and practice what you preach:For any AI initiative to take root, you need an organizational culture that's both receptive to its potential and aware of its pitfalls. I always urge leaders to go beyond the surface-level automation tasks and think deeper about the ways AI can shape future processes.I see too many leaders preaching AI but not really knowing how to use this technology themselves. Before you embed AI in your products and services, you need to apply this technology to your operations first. You can do this by building your own know-how around what makes a legitimate AI service provider and what are some of the potential pitfalls that can put your own data and operations at risk.This knowledge then needs to trickle down to your workforce. While many of these tools are free and accessible to all, your employees need to know how to assess and implement them in their workflows without inadvertently jeopardizing your business.


Get focused and execute in small measurable milestones:You've got to understand what you need AI to do for your business. Is it automating repetitive tasks, enhancing customer service through chatbots or analyzing sales data to predict future trends? By identifying specific, measurable goals, you can avoid the pitfall of implementing AI just for the sake of it and instead focus on solving real-world problems that directly impact your bottom line.Then, implement AI in small, manageable areas of your business where it can have an immediate impact. For instance, if your goal is to improve customer service, start by integrating a simple AI chatbot that can handle basic inquiries. This allows you to gauge both the effectiveness of AI in your operations and your team's ability to adapt.Last, set clear metrics for success before the AI solution is deployed, and regularly analyze its performance against these benchmarks. This could be an increase in customer satisfaction scores, a reduction in response times or a decrease in operational costs.Make the most of your data:Part of building an environment that enables the successful adoption of AI is growing an awareness around how you generate, store and use your data. When one process is updated or replaced by a new one, how is that data streamlined and incorporated within the rest of your ecosystem?


While most businesses sit on mountains of data, many don't make full use of it. AI gives you low-cost opportunities to change that. But first, you need to ensure that the data is of good enough quality to be used in decision-making. If you're sitting on poor or insufficient data, the first port of call should be addressing this problem. By ensuring your data is accurate and usable, you unlock AI's potential to transform underutilized data into strategic insights, driving efficiency and competitive advantage.Act responsibly and put guardrails in place:Sixty-three percent of organizations with an annual revenue of $50 million or more see the adoption of AI as a high or very high priority, yet 91% of them don't feel they're prepared to implement it in a responsible manner. That's because embedding AI within your business process and technical infrastructure makes you vulnerable to unforeseen threats.Regardless of the size of your organization, if you haven't already, now is the time to implement robust governance mechanisms that can uphold and ensure an ethical and responsible use of AI technologies.There are many areas which you need to consider here. How are you going to be transparent with your customers about using AI? What are your privacy policies? How are you protecting your own and customers' confidential data? Implementing any AI initiative before you've answered these questions exposes you to an unnecessary risk.


Related: The Barriers and Opportunities for Generative AI in Corporate WorkplacesJust because AI is ubiquitous, it doesn't mean that you have to rush into it. Implementing the technology without thinking through the strategy, business process and governance can be far more costly than not using AI at all.So, execute on the AI's potential with clear measurable milestones. Start small, and start today. Be smart about where you want your business to go and how you can leverage and innovate with AI. What are some of the problems, challenges and opportunities we're yet to see in this landscape that you can start working on today? This forward-looking mindset is what's going to distinguish the exceptional from the rest — and this is what's going to give you the ultimate edge in the long run.

42,Yelp Community Managers Share Their Best Tips for Black Shop Owners to Boost Business and Build Community,"Mar 25, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/tips-from-yelp-community-managers-for-boosting-business/471586,"
Telling your story is one of the most powerful ways to uplift your small business. When you share a piece of your life experience with customers, you open the door to authentic connections that can grow into long-term business relationships.Finding the right storytelling platform isn't always easy, but Yelp Community Managers are uniquely positioned to help. Stationed in regions across the country, Yelp employees like Erica Eubanks, B Busby, and Anitra Thomas serve as bridges between Yelp businesses and consumers, working with business owners in their local areas to launch events, social media promotions, and other opportunities for visibility.Related: The Counter Service at Yo' Mama's Is Just As Unique As Its Name. Here's Why People Come Back for the Experience as Much as the Food.



""For me, [the process] is: I know this really great business in this great area that might not get a lot of traffic to it. Let me start with bringing my own squad to this business,"" Anitra said. ""If it was a fun find, those people tell their social circle. And then those folks tell their folks, and now all the folks know about this great local business they wouldn't have known about otherwise.""As members of the Black community, promoting Black- and other minority-owned businesses is a priority for Erica, B, and Anitra. They know it's important for business owners to have someone in their corner who looks like them and understands the unique struggles they face.


Community Managers often work with Black-owned businesses to capitalize on marketing opportunities during Black History Month and on Juneteenth. Using holidays as a hook, Black-owned businesses can pitch timely stories to the media and create specialized content for their social media pages.If you aren't able to launch the initiative during the right day or month, Erica emphasizes to not let the idea go to waste. Supporting minority-owned businesses is a priority for many Yelp users, so don't be hesitant to champion yourself as a quality Black-owned business all year round.Related: The Little Coffee Shop That Asks Customers to Please Not to Be Quiet""Black History Month is 365 for us,"" she said. ""We don't take this skin off when we go to bed, when we go to events, or when we're writing reviews.""


This dedication means Community Managers are a valuable resource for Yelp consumers looking to support minority-owned businesses. While the Yelp website and mobile app make it easy to filter searches using identity attributes, like Black-owned, following your local Yelp social media page and keeping up with the Community blog can help you find even more local gems. Community Managers often hold—and post about—events in partnership with Black-owned businesses looking to gain more traction in neighborhoods where they are racially or culturally underrepresented.During these events, Community Managers handle attracting and engaging customers so business owners can focus on what they do best: providing authentic and quality customer experiences.The events are also a great way to network with your community. At one event, B recalled connecting a business owner who raised children with epilepsy with a clinic owner who works with epileptic patients. This interaction opened up an opportunity for the business owner to make custom macaroons for the patients and share her story with the clinic's community.Hearing first-hand about this kind of impact is one of the most rewarding parts of the job. Community Managers are passionate about creating lasting connections and encourage business owners to connect with customers on a personal level whenever possible.


""You never know where that string is going to really connect and attach to somebody, and that's where we really create momentum [for businesses],"" B added.Related: How This California Hot Spot Grew From Delivery-Only to Pop-Up Shop to StorefrontTo help businesses flourish in their communities, Erica always urges businesses to reach out to their local Community Manager, whether to host an event for Yelp Elites or score an Instagram feature on a Yelp-owned account. The Community team partners with entrepreneurs in a variety of areas, from restaurant owners to local artists, on initiatives that are entirely free to business owners. They've also taken the 15% pledge, dedicating at least 15% of their efforts to Black-owned businesses.In addition to the importance of building a strong small business community, Erica, B, and Anitra believe in:


Championing Black-owned businesses all year long. Don't feel like you need to restrict identity-related marketing initiatives to Black History Month. Many Yelp consumers are eager to support minority-owned businesses whenever they can.Having advocates you can see yourself in. Erica, B, and Anitra understand the opportunities and challenges that Black business owners have and are passionate about helping them navigate the small business landscape.Using Yelp to make connections. Reading and responding to customer reviews can help businesses improve engagement, customer service, and loyalty. Plus, critical feedback can be a valuable tool to help owners refine business practices and products.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Erica, B, and Anitra, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.Available on: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Pandora and Soundcloud.Editorial contributions by Callie Morgan and Kristi Lindahl

49,From $0 to $10 Million — Here's How to Build a Winning Prop Trading Team,"Mar 15, 2024",Blake Olson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-build-a-winning-prop-trading-team/470675,"
Some issues in prop trading are the same as those faced in any niche, but some are unique to this constantly evolving segment. When I look at the structure, staff and technology from 12 months ago, my company is almost unrecognizable.Without the right mindset, keeping a handle on growth can be a bit like juggling chainsaws.The pivotal role of technologyTechnology is the lifeblood of the trading industry. By definition, our business only exists online. The rapid evolution of tools and platforms can dramatically alter the landscape overnight. We've seen this firsthand.



Leaders in this sector must exhibit an exceptional degree of technological savvy and an ""anticipatory"" vision to foresee and adapt to these changes. The adoption of new technologies forces a culture of continuous learning and innovation within the team. There is no such thing as the status quo!Team members who are slow to pursue ongoing education, experiment with new tools and dedicate time to strategic thinking don't last long. The desire to adapt is required for growth and competitive advantage.


Related: Earn Through a Recession by Learning Stock Trading StrategiesHarnessing diversityThe global nature of trading today means teams contain a variety of cultural and professional backgrounds. Our current team is spread over five different countries. This diversity, while a tremendous asset, also presents unique leadership challenges.Effective leaders must promote a cohesive team environment where every member feels valued and understood regardless of background and location. Solutions to lessen the ""artificial isolation"" team members from other parts of the world can experience are essential. This involves using technology to facilitate communication across different time zones, fostering an inclusive culture and seeing it as a strength rather than an obstacle.One example is having occasional video conferences that are not business-specific. They allow time for team members to speak freely about their lives, making a connection that business-only video calls don't allow for. You'd be amazed at the personal details that have come out of these calls. Everyone enjoys these moments. (And yes, everyone's camera must be on!)


Invariably, we see innovation and closer collaboration as a welcome result.Balancing the dynamics of contractors and full-time employeesProp trading is no different than every other company out there. Our team faces the ""contractors and full-time employees"" issue. We all know companies that failed to handle this properly and paid dearly.This mix can enrich the team with flexibility and specialized skills. Still, it also requires careful management to ensure everyone is on the same page and working steadily toward the company's goals.During a growth phase, when certain roles expand while others vanish, it's vital to constantly ask the question, ""Is this best handled internally, or will we outgrow this need in 6 months?""


Leaders must integrate these contributors, ensure clear communication and set firm expectations. Verbalizing clear expectations saves a lot of headaches. This issue mirrors the geographic challenge just mentioned. Promoting an environment where contracts feel ""vested"" in the company vision.There's another concept in play here. The principle of ""fire fast, hire slow"". I don't mean this in a purely ruthless sense. But having the readiness to make tough decisions is a spark for growth.Ensure that every member's presence is not just warranted but beneficial for the collective goal. Again, this philosophy is not rooted in a lack of compassion but in a commitment to excellence and the team's long-term success.Upholding integrity as a core valuesThe temptation for quick gains in the prop industry can lead to ethical quandaries with clients and business entities alike. Integrity is non-negotiable.


Bad actors exist in every niche. Unfortunately, prop trading is not immune from this. This makes it even more important for leaders to adhere to the highest ethical standards themselves and to instill these values in their teams.This involves creating a culture where ethical behavior is recognized and rewarded and where team members feel comfortable voicing concerns. Customer service sees different behaviors from clients than the tech team on the back end.As a rule, whenever cash changes hands or profits are on the line, someone will create a way to skirt the rules. By prioritizing integrity, leaders build a team that not only achieves success but also does so respectfully and legally. And in line with the company's long-term vision.Adapting team composition for future challengesThe skill sets and mindsets that contributed to initial successes may not indicate future success. Leaders must be vigilant in assessing the team's capabilities and ready to make adjustments as needed.


This might involve seeking out new talents with specific expertise or redefining roles within the team to better align with strategic goals. The same talent pool that gets a company $0 to $1 million in annual revenue is unlikely to be the one in place from $10 million to $50 million. Spotting ""talent bottlenecks"" is an acquired skill. But it is very necessary.Related: Learn Candlestick Trading: This E-learning Bundle Is $25 This Week OnlyThe art of leading a trading team to successLeading any team to success is an art that requires a blend of strategic foresight, technological proficiency and evolving interpersonal skills.Short version: If I had to pick a trait that pinpoints someone likely to stick with you through growth and challenge, I'd likely go with a desire for continuous learning.


By embracing these principles, leaders can build resilient, adaptable teams capable of sustained growth and even friendship. The journey is demanding, but I've found the rewards of cultivating a high-performing, ethically grounded team immeasurable.

50,"I Made Over $250,000 in One Year as a Content Creator — Here's Why I'll Never Rely on It as My Main Income","Mar 15, 2024",Andrea Casanova,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-i-made-250000-in-one-year-as-a-content-creator/470849,"
Since 2016, I've built a career by strategizing and producing content for creators, brands and influential figures alike. Back then, breaking into this industry carried a weighty price tag, both financially and creatively. In those early days, aspiring to become an influencer felt like striving for a rarefied form of celebrity.The learning curve was steep, and success demanded a meticulous curation of content. It was an era characterized by exclusivity.Then came TikTok. Suddenly, the barriers crumbled, and the entry point became accessible to all. With just a smartphone and an idea, anyone could step into the spotlight and share their creativity with the world. From overnight 'It Girls' to ordinary individuals transitioning from 9-5 jobs to full-time creators, TikTok has revolutionized how people achieve financial independence.



Personally, I found myself swept up in this wave of democratization, seizing the opportunity to share my knowledge and insights on marketing and entrepreneurship through my own content as ""latinapreneur"" and leveraging the platform to promote my services as a marketing strategist.Not only was I able to quickly scale my service-based business, but I also started working with some of my favorite brands. In 2023, I made over $250,000 in branded content, solidifying my position as a successful content creator with the ability to go full-time if I wanted.


However, this spontaneous rise to fame and fortune is not a universal experience for every content creator. In fact, even for seasoned creators, there's usually a drought season, with brand deals falling through and algorithm changes limiting content reach. I know the struggle all too well.Related: I Made $389,822 In One Year On YouTube. Here's How I Did ItOne moment, you're riding the virality wave, and the next, you're refreshing your email, hoping that a brand rep is not actually ghosting you. The truth is, in this realm, nothing is guaranteed. Deals can fall through, campaigns can be canceled, and budgets can dry up in an instant.So, to creatorpreneurs who are tired of being at the mercy of quarterly marketing budgets and enduring 90-days+ payment terms, here's a roadmap for transitioning from working with brands to becoming the brand.


1. Redefine your identityThe way you speak about yourself will dictate the opportunities you get. Think beyond your current role and envision where you want to be. Start branding yourself accordingly, making your platform an added advantage rather than the sole focus.Related: How to Create Consistent Branding That Sticks2. Mobilize your audienceWhile you might be tired of hearing about it, building an email list is crucial for owning your audience. If emails aren't your thing, consider communities like WhatsApp or Discord. Don't wait for another potential platform ban to take action.3. Identify winning conceptsWhat content of yours has generated social buzz? What are your followers constantly asking for? These are your winning concepts. Explore how you can further develop and monetize them.


Related: 4 Ways to Leverage TikTok for Startup Growth4. Start small, scale upYou don't have to jump straight into high-ticket offers. Begin with something simple, like lead magnets or low-ticket mini-courses. The goal is to create a product with minimal investment required. I recently launched a vision board mini-course, which generated over $8,000 in the first month. It took just four hours from ideation to publishing, including batching content for promotion.5. Expand your horizonsWhile creators often focus on diversifying content types and pivoting to long-form, I believe the conversation about diversification should be broader. For instance, I recently took on a role at an entertainment company as an executive and creative mind. This move has opened up opportunities for professional growth in a whole new arena.The creator economy may be booming, but questions linger about its long-term sustainability and fair compensation for influencers and content creators.


Most content seems to be positioning brand partnerships as this abundant and definitive marker of success in the creator economy. However, while brand partnerships can be lucrative and valuable, they are just one piece of the larger puzzle.It's time to broaden the conversation and recognize the multitude of pathways to success for content creators, emphasizing the importance of creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship beyond traditional brand collaborations.

51,6 Practical Ways Entrepreneurs Can Supercharge Their Business With Technology in 2024,"Mar 13, 2024",Nicholas Leighton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-to-supercharge-your-business-with-technology-in-2024/470749,"
Technology is moving at an incredible and almost overwhelming pace. Technology has the potential to disrupt industries and create real threats to existing businesses. To avoid becoming obsolete and falling behind, entrepreneurs should have a strategy to aggressively embrace and utilize technology to their advantage.The challenge is that there seems to be an unending stream of advice and recommendations for entrepreneurs to leverage these cutting-edge technologies, but very little explains specifically what entrepreneurs should be doing to implement these tools. Here are some practical ways that entrepreneurs can start embracing new technologies today.Related: 3 Ways Embracing Automation and Technology Can Turbocharge Your Entrepreneurial Quest



1. Stay up-to-date on new technology and trendsPart of the reason why many small business owners struggle to implement new technology is because they don't take the time to really understand what these technologies do, how they work and what trends are emerging in the technology industry. As a business leader, it's important to start regularly consuming information on emerging technologies. This can be as simple as committing to reading one article on technology each day or attending technology conferences that are focused on your industry.If you aren't technologically savvy, that's perfectly fine. You can also ask someone on your team to take ownership of researching and recommending ways you can incorporate technology into your business.


2. Implement off-the-shelf solutions firstToo many small business owners and entrepreneurs shy away from innovative solutions because they have the misconception that advanced technology is only available to large corporations that have billions of dollars to invest in R&D. This might have been true 20 years ago. Today, there are numerous inexpensive and free technology solutions that are available to small business owners.While there is an opportunity to create customized tools and technology platforms, small business owners should always look for off-the-shelf solutions first. Not only can you implement these faster, but they have been through extensive testing and are often backed with a team of technical experts to support your business.3. Leverage generative AIGenerative AI is a technology that leverages artificial intelligence to create visual and language-based outputs such as text, music, images and even entire conversations. Companies like ChatGPT have revolutionized this space and brought this technology to the masses.Small business owners who are new to generative AI should focus on two key areas — content creation and customer interaction. AI can easily create content for your blogs, marketing materials and email campaigns rather than having someone on your team go through the painstaking creative process. Also, generative AI can streamline and automate how you interact with your customers through tools like chatbots or auto-email replies.


Related: Small Business Owners, Don't Run From Technology — Embrace It. Here Are 5 Strategies to Succeed.4. Streamline processes and tools with automationOne of the biggest challenges for entrepreneurs is the limited number of resources as they work solo or with extremely small teams. There are only so many hours in the day to get all the work done. Technology can help streamline your workflow, allowing you and your team to get more done through automation.The good news is that you probably have access to a number of automations within their existing tools. For example, your CMS may have automations built in that your team can leverage without implementing any new systems.As you implement automation, it's important to quell the fear employees have that their jobs will be eliminated. While that may be true in some cases, as an entrepreneur, you can leverage automation to free up your team's time to work on more valuable tasks like creating a new product offering or face-to-face relationship-building with your customers.


5. Focus on data and smart analyticsData analytics is another area where technology offers huge benefits. Tools like AI and machine learning (ML) can help small businesses quickly and efficiently leverage data to identify new opportunities and trends to better understand their customers, what products and services need improvement and what is happening within the marketplace.Entrepreneurs should start by evaluating their data collection process. If you don't have a good process for collecting data on your customers, their buying habits and preferences, analytic tools will be useless. Fortunately, many of the tools that businesses use today collect data; you just have to know where to find and access this information.Once you have a good process in place for data collection, businesses can leverage tools like Domo or Google Analytics to help interpret the data and highlight opportunities.6. Personalize customer interactionsConsumers no longer want to be treated as a number. Instead, they want personalized experiences that are unique and built around their needs, preferences and interests. This is where small businesses still have a small advantage over large companies.


Small businesses should focus on leveraging technology to help provide a customized experience for each of their customers. For example, email marketing tools can segment your contact list to allow you to reach different audiences with different messages. You can take this a step further by offering personalized recommendations and information based on their past purchases and behaviors.New technologies create unique experiences and ways of interacting with your brand. It's up to each entrepreneur to determine how they want to implement technology into their business. We're at a pivotal moment where embracing technology can differentiate your company and create unprecedented opportunities.Related: 6 Ways to Leverage Technology to Rock Your Digital Relevance

52,Struggling to Get a Bank Loan for Your Small Business? Try This Flexible Financing Option Instead.,"Mar 13, 2024",Joseph Camberato,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/cant-get-a-bank-loan-for-your-small-business-try-this/470462,"
Increasingly, small businesses are turning to private credit to fund business expansions or ongoing operational costs. Private credit accounted for roughly 30% of the credit market in 2021, growing from $400 billion in assets to over $1 trillion since 2012.This type of financing usually comes with flexible terms, customized solutions and fast access to capital. So, if your company needs funding but you don't want to apply for a traditional bank loan, here's how private credit works and how you can access it.Related: How Alternative Funding Solutions Can Help Your Business Navigate The Ongoing Financial Storm



What is private credit?The term private credit usually refers to non-bank loans issued to businesses — peer-to-peer lenders, online lenders and financing marketplaces are all examples of this. This financing option has been especially helpful for small businesses recently, considering banks aren't lending to businesses due to market conditions and their notorious risk-averse behavior.Private credit gives companies access to various short-term and long-term financing options. Your company can then use this financing to fund startup costs, a business expansion or working capital.


Benefits of private creditHere are the biggest benefits of private credit for small businesses:Fast access to capital: When you apply for a bank loan, the application process can take weeks to months to process. In comparison, loans from non-bank lenders typically take less than a week. Some lenders even offer same-day financing. This is a huge advantage for businesses that need to act quickly on a business opportunity.Flexible financing: Private credit is also more flexible when it comes to the collateral requirements and repayment terms.High approval rate: Banks prefer lending to larger, more established companies. Non-bank loans have a much higher rate of approval for small and medium-sized businesses.Custom solutions: Since non-bank lenders have experience working with small businesses, they can provide custom financing solutions to meet your company's needs. For example, some lenders offer asset-based financing where the loan is secured by the company's assets.Related: This Non-Traditional Financing Solution Lends Money to People Rejected By BanksHow small businesses can access private creditHere are the steps you'll take to evaluate your situation, find the right lender and successfully access financing.Determine your needs:Start by determining why you need financing and what you plan to use the funds for. For example, are you taking out a loan to cover daily expenses, like payroll or inventory? Or do you want to purchase new equipment to increase your production or improve efficiency?


Evaluating your current and future lending needs will help you determine the type of financing you're looking for. For example, if you have a good idea of how much you're looking to spend, taking out a loan might make sense. But if you're unsure how much money you'll need, you may want to opt for a line of credit.Prepare the necessary documentsIt's a good idea to gather the necessary paperwork before applying for private credit. The specific requirements will vary depending on your lenders, but most will want to see the following information:Business information: Not all lenders require a business plan, but you'll have to provide some basic information about your business. At the very least, you'll need to provide your company's name, address and employer identification number (EIN).Financial statements: You'll also need to provide financial statements like a profit and loss statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement. This information helps your lender understand the financial health of your business.Tax returns: Most lenders will want to see at least one year of personal and business tax returns. Tax returns help your lender evaluate your financial situation and your ability to repay the loan.Bank statements: You'll also need to provide at least six months of bank statements.Business documents: Your lender will also want to see your business's articles of incorporation and any relevant business licenses.Compare your offersIt's always a good idea to get pre-approved with several different lenders before selecting the one you want to go with. Applying with a minimum of three different lenders lets you compare the potential interest rates, fees and repayment terms. It also gives you more negotiation power because you're not putting yourself in a situation where you have to take the first offer that comes your way.


Of course, submitting multiple loan applications can become tedious and take up quite a bit of your time. If you need a quicker solution, consider using an online lending marketplace. When you use a lending marketplace, you'll apply once and receive offers from multiple lenders.Related: 4 Reasons Small Businesses Need Nonbank Lenders More Than EverIf you're looking for alternatives to bank loans, private credit is an excellent option. These loans are more accessible and give your company the resources it needs to continue growing.When you take out private credit, you may gain access to support that goes beyond the application process. But it's important to look for the right non-bank lenders. National Business Capital has been working in private credit for 15 years; We're already an expert in this market.

53,Struggling to Find Content Ideas for Your Business? Use This Effective Strategy to Unlock Endless Inspiration.,"Mar 12, 2024",Evgeniya Zaslavskaya,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/use-this-effective-strategy-to-unlock-endless-content-ideas/470451,"
Many clients who approach my PR agency claim they lack topics to cover. I assure them that this is not the issue as every specialist, just as every company, has valuable expertise to share. And one effective strategy to unveil it, which I previously mentioned in an article on pitching stories to journalists, is what I refer to as the ""Rubik's Cube Principle.""The concept is akin to a Rubik's Cube. Much like the cube's various colors, your knowledge and experience can be examined and presented from multiple perspectives tailored to your audience: be it different segments of B2B or B2C clients, investors, business partners or potential employees.Related: How to Never Run Out of Content Ideas Again



Begin with goal-settingBefore delving into creation and applying the Rubik's Cube Principle, it's crucial to establish clear objectives. What outcomes do you seek to achieve through your articles? Here are a few illustrative examples:Inform clients about a new product featureDraw in new users who are currently unaware of your solutionFoster community engagement and loyaltyEnhance brand visibilityEducate the audience to broaden the target marketReinforce the personal brand of the company's founderSeek investment opportunities at a specific stage of developmentAttract top-tier professionals to join the teamDifferentiate your brand from competitorsOnce you've defined your goals, you'll need to maneuver your Rubik's Cube to reveal different facets depending on the objective. For example, if your aim is to build trust and credibility among customers, your content might include case studies with client testimonials. And if you've established the aim of attracting top-tier professionals, consider writing informative articles focusing on your company culture and the keys to effective management.Know your audienceAnother crucial aspect of creating content is understanding its intended audience. Suppose you run a cybersecurity startup that offers business solutions. Providing personal user recommendations on data protection in the AI era helps to attract B2C clients, but not B2B. Use Rubik's Cube again to understand how you can present your content to make it appealing to companies. You may share best practices for preventing data breaches for business, for example.Finding different sides of your expertise helps to attract more media as well. I notice that B2B content often garners attention from niche media. At the same time, topics targeting a wider audience can contribute to a positive brand image as they are often featured in top media outlets with broad reach, such as Forbes, Fortune, TechCrunch or Entrepreneur, to name a few. Finding the right balance is crucial while prioritizing based on your goals, as mentioned earlier.Related: These Tools Guarantee You Never Run Out of the Content Your Audience Craves


Tap into recent events and industry trendsThere's no doubt that finding a fresh angle can be as tough as solving a Rubik's Cube. To make this task easier, it's helpful to stay updated on industry trends and events, such as M&As, funding rounds, innovative product launches, analytical reports, surveys and more.Let's revisit the cybersecurity startup scenario. Cyber defense significance grows annually, accompanied by the emergence of new attack vectors. Just one example: Among business and tech leaders, 52% currently expect GenAI to lead to catastrophic cyber attacks in the next 12 months. So, what's your take on this topic, and how would you advise companies to brace themselves for the impending crisis?Alternatively, consider forecasting the impact of upcoming events on your industry. Take, for instance, the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. If you've created a marketplace for airline tickets and accommodations, you could anticipate market reactions, identify optimal ticket purchase times, offer tips for cost-effective lodging, provide guidance for property owners on renting out apartments and more — all tailored to your target audience's needs.Keep tabs on journalists covering your industry, as well as your competitorsStay abreast of industry discussions by monitoring both journalists' and competitors' coverage of your topic. By observing what they are writing about, you can glean inspiration. Additionally, even seemingly saturated topics can be reframed from a fresh perspective, offering readers a new angle on the Rubik's Cube.


One effective strategy is to set up Google Alerts for timely notifications on the chosen theme. This allows you to stay informed about the latest developments in your field. You may uncover opportunities where journalists haven't fully explored a related subject, or where their perspectives differ from yours — both potential avenues for contributing an expert column.A couple of examples: While journalists may extensively cover the financial sector's embrace of blockchain technology, they might have missed its potential advantages in improving voting systems or managing intellectual property rights, particularly when integrated with AI. Or maybe your competitors have overlooked the applications of digital avatars in personalized healthcare, rather than their more common use in influencer marketing and entertainment.Related: 11 Things To Write About When You Don't Know What to Write AboutUse data-driven storytellingA more sophisticated yet effective approach involves leveraging the data at your disposal. Let's say you are developing an AI solution for the healthcare industry. So, maybe you could ask your clients about the pressing questions they have regarding the implications of GenAI and then mold your findings into newsworthy content. This research has the potential to garner media attention and, at the very least, bolster your brand's market recognition.


Moreover, it may spark inspiration for new topics. For example, your clients' concerns about the ethical use of GenAI in patient care could lead to a research-driven article addressing these issues, which could be picked up by relevant industry media outlets. Still, it's crucial that the use of data is grounded in ethical principles.By the way, tapping into AI to beat so-called writer's block is also a smart move. Research worldwide suggests that about half of marketing and advertising pros are already using AI to brainstorm, making it a worthy tool to ignite fresh ideas.Above all, take actionRecently, I came across a LinkedIn poll that discussed the most effective communication strategy for B2C projects. In my opinion, there isn't a single definitive strategy; otherwise, everyone would adopt it. However, a fundamental rule does exist: Take action. Begin with small steps, like publishing one article, and gradually expand your media coverage.Ideally, strive to produce content consistently within your niche. Public relations resembles sports: While running a marathon may seem daunting at first, consistent training makes it achievable. Similarly, excelling in PR is like crossing a finish line — it demands dedication and perseverance.


It's worth noting that if you struggle to devise compelling content ideas, try to seek guidance from a proficient PR specialist or agency. Sometimes, putting your trust in an expert is the most effective approach.

54,Here's the SEO Combination You Need to Win Google's Algorithm,"Mar 12, 2024",Summit Ghimire,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/heres-the-seo-combination-you-need-to-win-googles/469814,"
When focusing on search engine optimization (SEO) for the first time, it's tempting to focus on one or two ranking factors, in particular keywords, in hopes of a quick ranking fix. However, improving search ranking is a much more comprehensive and necessarily long-term practice. Keyword research is an excellent starting place for SEO, but simply scattering keywords throughout content will not be effective. If your online presence does not successfully also meet E-E-A-T guidelines, having the right amount of keywords or an optimized website will be, in some ways, a wasted effort.E-E-A-T is a Google quality search guideline that stands for Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trust. Ultimately, neither SEO best practices nor E-E-A-T quality guidelines will be as successful without the other. Combining E-E-A-T guidelines with SEO practices is a helpful approach to make sure that no key criteria for excellent search rankings are being neglected.Related: 4 Ways This SEO Expert Uses AI to Create Content — and How You Can, Too



Use keywords to develop E-E-A-TOnce you've established what words to focus on in your content, consider how you can demonstrate your experience, expertise, trustworthiness and authority in the context of those topics. Your website might have increased traffic with the right keywords for popular searches, but to turn traffic into clients, it needs to do more than meet keyword metrics.There are multiple ways to combine keyword usage with E-E-A-T. Don't just advertise your services; demonstrate your product knowledge or successful case studies to establish authority in your field. Adding internal links to related pages on your site can also help to demonstrate your expertise and authority. Any visual content that establishes expertise, such as photos of jobs completed or infographics, should be optimized to enhance user experience and have keywords in the caption and alt text.


Connect teams to combine strategiesOne of the difficulties of paying attention to SEO and E-E-A-T is that it means applying more standards to the same content. For example, for SEO content to establish E-E-A-T, it has to be well-written to effectively demonstrate expertise and accuracy. To make this happen, everyone working on the content needs to be on the same page.Implementing SEO best practices and E-E-A-T quality guidelines simultaneously may mean making changes to how your content is created and who is working together. At Outpace SEO, the content and SEO teams work closely together to create content that follows SEO best practices while also being accurate, creative and well-written.Content and SEO processes can be integrated at several levels. New team members should be given clear training on how content is created, optimized and edited and where they fit into the process. Loop in the content team when SEO practices need to change and keep the SEO team updated about editing standards. Rather than pigeonholing team members to one area of expertise, encourage them to understand the processes and goals of the team as a whole. If another company handles your SEO and content creation, establish a clear workflow so that content is seen by the right people at the right phase. Efficient, consistent communication will help guarantee that the content being optimized is completely accurate and representative of your expertise.Related: Writing Content With AI Won't Help You Win Against Google Search Rankings. Here's Why.


Use SEO to build trustIt may be helpful to think of E-E-A-T as a way to evaluate optimized content. If your business falls into a YMYL category, meaning Your Money or Your Life, E-E-A-T standards are applied even more carefully by Google's quality raters. The tone of the writing, the knowledge demonstrated and the authority of the author are all important ways to build trust — the most important of these four.Successfully combining SEO and E-E-A-T practices involves considering every aspect of content creation. Trust does not just involve content but user experience. Enhancing the speed of your website, optimizing URLs and avoiding or optimizing 404 pages are all part of technical SEO. All of these contribute not only to a positive user experience of your website but also to how much searchers will believe in your authority and expertise after interacting only with your online presence.Rather than distracting from SEO, E-E-A-T will be more effective when combined with strong SEO practices. For an online presence that delivers results and high rankings long term, create a strategy that focuses on combining SEO best practices and E-E-A-T guidelines. This may involve overhauling your content creation and SEO process, promoting communication between teams or reconsidering who handles your website optimization and content development. Together, SEO and E-E-A-T are a winning combination to continuously develop an online presence that ranks high and generates more business.

57,I've Worked Remotely For Over 20 Years — 5 Common Mistakes Companies Make When It Comes to Remote Operations,"Mar 7, 2024",Lesley Pyle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-common-mistakes-companies-make-with-remote-sops/467326,"
SOPs, or standard operating procedures, are a must for any company — remote or otherwise. However, when working with an entirely remote team, some special considerations need to be put in place. Directing and working remotely for over 20 years, I have a unique perspective on this that I would like to share.1. Out of sight, out of mindIt is common practice to share standard operating procedures during onboarding with new hires, but past that, most companies never mention operating procedures again — unless, of course, there is a change that needs to be made. It is a good idea to have employees review procedures regularly, even if no edits have been made. I recommend reviewing them quarterly in a meeting, or perhaps you could send a survey out a couple of times each year that requires employees to review standard operating procedures and provide feedback on areas they believe can be improved.I once worked with a team that sent out a survey once a year to employees, and to encourage participation every employee received a $50 gift card for completing the survey. Not only did all the employees fill out the survey, but that team had the best standard operating procedures because they were consistently updated and reviewed. Get your team involved, and don't just put operating procedures out of sight and out of mind after onboarding.



Related: I've Managed Remote Teams For 15 Years — Here Are My 3 Most Important Leadership Lessons.2. Ignoring the need for flexibilityRemote work allows employees to have more control over their schedules and work environments, but many companies still adhere to rigid structures that don't accommodate this flexibility. This lack of flexibility can hinder productivity and creativity, as employees may feel restricted and unable to adapt to their unique circumstances. Common working hours are a good start to establish, but keep in mind this is not meant to be the typical 9 to 5 where an employee is at their desk all day.


In my opinion, it is crucial to include in your operating procedures when you expect someone to work. You can mention a time limit such as a minimum of five hours daily, or you can offer specific hours such as 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. The best way to do this is to outline a set of hours that everyone needs to be working at the same time, regardless of time zone — and be sure to let everyone know what time zone they should be referring to! A default zone should be used for everyone, like central standard time.3. Inadequate communication proceduresWithout clear and efficient communication channels, remote teams can struggle to stay connected and aligned. This can lead to misunderstandings, delays and decreased productivity. It's important for companies to establish effective communication protocols, such as regular check-ins, team meetings and utilizing communication tools like video conferencing or messaging platforms. Additionally, providing guidelines on expected response times and communication etiquette can help remote workers feel supported and connected.Another company I worked with offered incentives for those who responded faster than the required time on a regular basis. This ranged from a special bonus to extra time off, and it applied to both internal and external communications. This was outlined in their operating procedures so everyone knew how long they had to respond to messages for coworkers and customers alike. It created a very collaborative environment where everyone was connected and stayed on top of things. It was highlighted in the procedures that everyone would use a single platform to communicate (which, for this particular company, was Slack).4. Failure to address technical challengesFrom unstable internet connections to outdated software, these issues can severely impact productivity and hinder remote workers from performing their tasks effectively. Failing to address these technical challenges not only frustrates employees but also prevents them from reaching their full potential. A good procedure to have in place is what to do when technology does not work — should employees call someone? Send a text? What steps should be taken to let the rest of the team know when something is not working?


The best way to tackle this issue is to include contact information in your operating procedures. That way if someone's computer crashes before a meeting, they can call/text/email the right person to let them know what is happening and ask for what the next steps should be. Include a grace period too; for example, let your employees know that if they are not able to get their computers up and running 10 minutes before a meeting they should reach out to their manager.Related: Remote Work Is the Great Equalizer in the Workplace. Here's How It Will Make Your Business a Better Place to Work.5. Insufficient training and onboarding proceduresMany remote companies tend to throw their new employees into the metaphorical deep end and hope they learn how to swim on their own. While some personalities can handle this, it is extremely difficult and stressful for any person to try to figure out how to operate within a company like that. It is incredibly important to have standard operating procedures for how to onboard a new member to the team from getting them logins to training them on how to use the software given to them to do their job.Your procedures do not have to be overly detailed here, just a general outline for everyone to follow. For example, step one for remote workers should be getting your new team members all the logins they need. Step two should be training on how to use the systems they will work in daily such as instant messaging software and time tracking software. From there your company can customize the steps as needed.


Standard operating procedures unite employees and give them direction within a company, and when working remotely, it is extra important to keep them up to date and in front of everyone so that your employees know what is expected of them and how to handle problems.

58,Conventional Business Models Weren't Cutting It — See How Innovating With AI is Changing the Game for Startups,"Mar 7, 2024",Doug Villhard,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/4-strategies-for-harnessing-new-technologies-as-a-growing/470357,"
Facing the stark reality of startup funding plunging to a five-year low in the final quarter of 2023, entrepreneurs are at a crossroads. This year demands a revolution in their business strategies, where AI emerges not just as a tool but as a necessity for planning, launching and expanding their ventures right from the outset.The McKinsey State of AI report highlights how the use of generative AI is growing across different business areas. This surge in AI adoption isn't merely a trend; it's a testament to its effectiveness in streamlining business processes, enhancing efficiency and driving growth. It signals a future where integrating AI could become not just advantageous for startups but essential for their survival, success and fundraising efforts.Related: How to Leverage AI to Supercharge Your Business



What are the biggest benefits of AI for startups?The first major benefit of using AI solutions in startups is strategic automation. By automating routine tasks such as data entry, scheduling and report generation, startups can significantly improve their operational efficiency. This automation frees up employees' time and energy for more strategic and creative tasks, thereby boosting overall productivity and efficiency. This strategic implementation of AI in workflow automation is revolutionizing startup operations, establishing a new benchmark for efficiency in the entrepreneurial landscape.You may already be aware of AI's ability to automate tasks, but it's also incredibly valuable during the early stages of brainstorming or prototyping. Generative AI tools are adept at quickly generating a wide range of ideas for products, marketing campaigns and business models.


Take, for example, Virgin Voyages' Jen AI, a cutting-edge AI tool that lets users collaborate with Jennifer Lopez to create customized invitations. This process, which involves a brief interactive session using augmented reality technology, simplifies the creation of personalized invitations ready for distribution to friends and family. Similarly, the World Wildlife Fund's #WorldWithoutNature campaign leveraged AI to create visuals of a world without nature, in partnership with over 200 companies, to underscore the dire consequences of environmental neglect. These instances illustrate how AI can streamline creative processes. By using AI for campaign and product development, startups can alleviate the creative burden on their teams, enabling a focus on growth and other business priorities.Related: How to Use AI and Automation to Boost Your Business Goals4 strategies for harnessing new technologies as a growing startupThis rapid innovation enabled by AI allows entrepreneurs to explore more possibilities efficiently. Here are four strategies for startups to integrate AI for business success.1. Begin with your business problem, not just the technology:


As you explore AI solutions for your startup, focus on those that address your unique business challenges. Avoid the temptation to choose a cutting-edge tool simply because it's popular; such choices can lead to wasted investments. An IBM study surveying 2,500 global executives reveals that top-performing companies achieve a 13% return on investment from AI projects, which is over double the average ROI of 5.9%. This statistic underscores the importance of strategic selection and application of AI technologies.Start by identifying the core issues your business faces. Don't let the allure of new technologies distract you from your actual needs. Know your purpose, and pinpoint specific challenges or inefficiencies in your business that AI or other technological tools could effectively address. When investing in these tools, prioritize them based on their potential impact on your profit and team productivity.2. Test new technologies with a pilot project before full-scale implementation:Rushing to adopt new technologies without fully understanding their impact on your team's productivity or customer perception could be detrimental. Therefore, you should consider introducing new technologies through small, low-risk pilot projects. This method allows you to evaluate the technology's effectiveness, pinpoint any potential issues and adjust as needed before investing heavily. Gathering data and feedback from your team during this pilot phase is vital in forming a comprehensive and effective technology implementation plan.


3. Empower your team with smart technology integration:The impact of technology in your startup hinges on how adeptly your team uses it. In developing your technology implementation plan, make education and skill development a priority. By investing in training, you ensure that your team members are skilled in using new tools, which helps streamline their workflows.Encourage a culture of curiosity and experimentation with technology, as this can spur greater innovation and efficiency. Additionally, consider how AI can directly benefit your employees and alleviate stress. Incorporating AI into your wellness initiatives is essential to prevent employee burnout due to the adoption of new technologies, especially as stress levels continue to escalate. For instance, if your startup uses AI to create 3D-printed objects, could you also use it to design ergonomic furniture for your remote workers? Or if AI is automating tasks and saving time, could this saved time be converted into paid breaks for your team? Implementing such strategies can significantly boost employee satisfaction and productivity.Related: Collaboration Is the Key to Super-Fast Growth (Along With a Little Help From A.I.)4. Avoid innovating in isolation:As you embark on your startup journey, often as a solo entrepreneur handling every aspect of your business, remember that AI can be your invaluable ally, almost like a deputy. However, your entrepreneurial path doesn't have to be a solitary one. Use AI to help you seek out collaborations and tap into external expertise.Consider forming partnerships with technology providers, consultants or local universities to gain additional technical knowledge and guidance. Actively participate in communities or networks of entrepreneurs, particularly those with a focus on technology adoption. These connections can offer you valuable peer support and a wealth of shared best practices, significantly enriching your startup experience and reducing the sense of isolation often felt in solo entrepreneurship.AI is transforming the way entrepreneurs approach business challenges and opportunities, offering diverse applications tailored to their specific needs. This adaptability makes AI a vital tool for entrepreneurs navigating the complexities of starting and developing their businesses.

63,This Data Security Consultant Explains Why Businesses Should Embrace Web3 — But Do It Cautiously,"Mar 6, 2024",Ralph Tkatchuk,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/businesses-should-embrace-web3-but-do-it-cautiously/469900,"
After much initial skepticism and doubt, Web3 has emerged as a real source of value, paving the way for a new generation of decentralized applications (dApps) built on blockchain. These dApps provide fantastic opportunities for forward-thinking companies to transform their business operations and enhance their efficiency.A 2023 survey of 600 enterprise decision-makers in the U.S., U.K. and China found that nearly 90% of them deploy blockchain technology in some capacity, with 87% saying they planned to invest in blockchain in the next year. This reflects businesses' fear of being left behind as blockchain developments accelerate globally. According to Deloitte, 73% of financial executives believe their organization will lose an opportunity for competitive advantage if they don't adopt blockchain and digital assets.Advocates of Web3 laud the decentralized web's greater resilience and security compared to its predecessor, as blockchain ensures that every transaction is public and verifiable, improving record-keeping and data integrity.



However, despite the promise of blockchain's greater security, the increasing adoption of Web3 technologies has not eradicated security risks, merely changed them: The 2023 Web3 Security Landscape report by Salus shows that cyberattacks on the Web3 industry resulted in losses in excess of $1.7 billion last year, highlighting the extensive range of threats within the decentralized world.Related: Confused About Web3? Steve Aoki Dissects His Business to Show How You Can Make Money.


New security challengesWeb3 avoids some of the security headaches of Web 2.0 but introduces several new ones, almost all unique to the industry.Some of the biggest attacks of the year included the $200 million attack on the cloud-based blockchain services provider Mixin Network; the $197 million attack on Euler Finance; the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group attack on both the Poloniex cryptocurrency exchange and Atomic Waller, stealing more than $126 million from the former and more than $100 million from the latter.The majority of Web2 attacks target users. Most threats faced by the Web3 industry, however, take advantage of code vulnerabilities of decentralized applications and protocols. Access control issues accounted for 39% of all Web3 attacks, whereas flash loan protocols, where flash loans are used to maximize the impact of another form of attack like the exploitation of smart contract bugs or the manipulation of cryptocurrency asset prices on an exchange, contributed to more than 16% of attacks.User-targeted attacks, as mentioned, are ""less popular"" in Web3. Phishing attacks, which use social engineering tricks to manipulate unsuspecting users into exposing data, spreading malware infections or giving access to restricted systems accounted for a mere 4% of all attacks.


Besides software vulnerabilities, retail investors continue to fall for exit scams and ""rugpulls:"" fraudulent crypto projects that convince the community to back them before fleeing with the funds they've raised.Mitigation is possibleReassuringly, there are concrete steps that businesses can take to reduce the likelihood of falling victim to each of these threats. With appropriate caution and due diligence, there is no reason to pass up the many potential benefits of Web3.Related: 5 Essential Tips for Starting a Successful Web 3.0 VentureEnhance authenticationIntroducing more robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, like decentralized identifiers (DIDs), access tokens or biometric and multi-factor authentication, will mitigate many security threats such as access control-based vulnerabilities and phishing attacks. Companies should make sure they always adhere to the principle of least privilege, a crucial step for remaining secure online across both Web2 and Web3.


Increase complexityAs in real life, cyber attackers like to get in and out quickly to avoid detection, so increasing the complexity of participation in Web3 projects will make attacks less likely. DeFi protocols offering flash loans can safeguard themselves against threats by introducing minimum borrowing amounts and time limits, as well as additional fees to raise the costs for attackers. In a similar vein, attacks on oracles can be reduced in a number of ways, such as by avoiding the use of markets with shallow liquidity for price predictions, and by increasing manipulation costs for attackers through the use of TWAP (time-weighted average price) mechanisms.Hardware wallets — the use of physical technology to store private cryptographic keys online until they are needed — can also help to avoid hacks. Short of physically stealing the hardware wallet itself, which resembles a USB drive, they are virtually impossible for cybercriminals to access.Implement checksAs with Web2, businesses should regularly update their access permissions to avoid chinks in their security armor. In addition, they should conduct thorough audits of all smart contract code, as this often falls prey to re-entry vulnerabilities. They should also adhere to the check-effect-interaction model.Perform due diligenceOrganizations can employ penetration testing to find and exploit their own vulnerabilities before attackers do. Extensive employee education is also crucial to enable individuals to identify and avoid phishing attacks and other threats.


Finally, make sure to research new projects and their teams carefully to ensure that they have a reliable track record, thus avoiding falling victim to rugpull scams. Prioritize projects that have undergone transparent security assessments by reputable auditors.Related: How to Own Your Online Narrative — Even When the Internet Owns YouEmbrace Web3, but do it cautiouslyThe high exposure to scams in Web3 is one of the major obstacles preventing mass adoption of decentralized technologies. However, though the amount of total losses in 2023 was very high, it was lower than the number for 2022. This suggests that the landscape's overall safety is improving, as more companies adopt the necessary precautionary measures.As Salus points out, $1.7 billion in losses is still an alarming number, and one that emphasizes the importance of improving security and educating users about the risks of Web3. The inherent vulnerabilities of the technology are distributed across multiple areas, demanding a multi-pronged approach to security, which can be enhanced by prioritizing those platforms and protocols that implement the strongest security measures.


My main takeaway from the report is that businesses need not shy away from embracing Web3 and all of the potential it offers. However, their adoption of the technology should be accompanied by extensive checks and research, and adherence to the same strict standards of security as they employ in their legacy technology systems.

In the words of Warren Buffett, ""It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently."" And with the ability to share personal experiences at the touch of a finger, those words have never been more true.This new age of connectivity has leveled the playing field for consumer opinions, empowering them to share their experiences far and wide. While this can bolster a business's reputation through positive feedback, it also means that a single negative review can have a disproportionate impact.Traditionally, reputation management has been reactive, a strategy employed to mitigate damage after the fact. However, in a world where information spreads at the speed of light, the most successful businesses are those that adopt a proactive stance on reputation management. This approach mitigates risks and builds a resilient brand capable of withstanding the inevitable challenges of the digital age.

This involves not just a well-designed website but an active and engaging presence across social media platforms, industry forums and professional networks. This is not merely about having a profile but actively engaging with your audience through regular updates, sharing valuable content and participating in industry conversations. The goal is to saturate the digital landscape with positive content about your business, making it the first thing potential customers see.


There's an old saying that you never get a second chance to make a first impression. In the world of online business, this adage rings particularly true. Early positive reviews and glowing testimonials can set a tone of trust and quality around your brand, influencing potential customers' perceptions and decisions from the get-go.Strategic advantages of early reputation managementSEO benefits: Search engines love fresh, positive content. By populating the internet with favorable articles, blog posts and customer reviews, businesses can enhance their visibility. A robust SEO strategy ensures that when potential customers search for your business, they are met with a chorus of positivity, drowning out any lone voices of dissent that may arise later.Building trust and credibility: Trust is the currency of the digital marketplace. Establishing a solid reputation early on fosters credibility with potential customers, making them more likely to choose your business over a competitor with a less established online presence. This trust, once built, becomes a shield against the impact of future negative reviews.Feedback and improvement loop: Engaging with customers for feedback before any negativity arises creates a culture of continuous improvement. By soliciting, listening to and acting on customer feedback, businesses can often preempt negative reviews, turning potentially dissatisfied customers into brand advocates.


Related: Why You Must Monitor Your Online Reputation Before it Hurts YouPreparing for a crisis before it hitsBeing prepared for a crisis before it emerges is integral to proactive reputation management. It involves detailed planning, team preparation and the development of protocols that allow a business to respond swiftly and effectively to potential reputation threats. Consider the following when preparing your proactive crisis plan:Establish a crisis monitoring team: Designate a team responsible for continuously monitoring online channels, news media and social platforms for any signs of emerging crises that could impact your brand.Develop early warning systems: Utilize social listening tools and set up specific alerts for increased volumes of mentions, sudden spikes in website traffic from forums or news sites, or patterns of negative sentiment that could indicate a brewing crisis.


Communication strategy: Create a comprehensive communication strategy that outlines how to communicate internally to employees and externally to customers, stakeholders and the media. This strategy should include key messages, tone of voice guidelines and the preferred channels for communication.Scenario planning: Prepare for various crisis scenarios by developing specific action plans. Scenarios might include data breaches, negative press, product recalls or customer service failures. For each scenario, outline the steps to mitigate the issue, including who needs to be informed, how to respond publicly and measures to resolve the situation.Rapid response framework: Develop a framework for rapid response that enables your team to act quickly once a crisis is identified. This includes templates for press releases, social media posts and FAQs that can be quickly adapted to the specific situation.Approval processes: Streamline approval processes for crisis communication to ensure that responses are timely but still maintain accuracy and adhere to your brand's values.


Identify key stakeholders: Map out your key stakeholders, including customers, employees, partners, investors and regulators. Understand their concerns and expectations during a crisis.Tailored communication plans: Develop tailored communication plans for each stakeholder group, addressing their specific needs and concerns. This ensures that all parties receive the right information at the right time, helping to maintain trust and mitigate negative impacts.Related: 9 Steps for Building a Reputation Management Plan That Wins Customers and Gives You an EdgeReputation management should not be an afterthought or a reactive measure. By adopting a proactive approach, businesses can build a strong, positive reputation that not only withstands the occasional negative review but also contributes to long-term success. While the strategies outlined above require time and effort, the return on investment is clear. A well-established and positive digital footprint enhances customer trust, attracts new business and builds a resilient brand capable of navigating the challenges of the digital marketplace.

66,Cyber Threats Are More Prevalent Than Ever — So Don't Leave Your Business Exposed. Here's How to Protect It.,"Mar 3, 2024",Randy Sadler,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-to-avoid-leaving-your-business-exposed-to-cyber-threats/469667,"
In the ever-evolving business landscape, a focus on risk management cannot be overstated. However, with the rapid pace of innovation, the rise of cyber threats, regulatory ambiguity and geopolitical complexities, the traditional one-size-fits-all approach to risk management is no longer sufficient. Today, businesses require a bespoke strategy that is tailored to their specific needs and challenges.Why protecting against risks is more complex than everThe modern business environment is characterized by rapid innovation and technological advancements. While these developments offer numerous opportunities for growth and expansion, they also bring a host of new risks. From data breaches to intellectual property theft, businesses are increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats posed by sophisticated and malicious actors.Furthermore, geopolitical tensions and political discord add another layer of complexity to the risk landscape. Supply chain disruptions caused by global conflicts can have far-reaching consequences for businesses, highlighting the interconnectedness of the global economy. Additionally, in a political year such as 2024, experts agree businesses face heightened risks due to uncertainty surrounding regulatory policies and government interventions.



Related: Cyber Attacks Are On the Rise — Here's How Your Business Can Continuously Prepare for ThreatsA bespoke approach to risk management is necessary — here's whyTraditional risk management frameworks often fail to adequately address the unique challenges faced by modern businesses. Utilizing standardized insurance policies or crisis response plans may provide a false sense of security, as these generic solutions do not consider the specific operational context and risk profile of each organization.


Let's use a private medical practice as an example. In today's regulatory environment, remaining compliant with heightened and evolving regulations is harder than ever — particularly with HIPPA compliance in today's challenging cybersecurity landscape. If a private medical practice is hit with a ransomware attack that impacts patient data, it's unlikely traditional insurance or business interruption insurance, that are typically tied to physical damage, would cover the fallout. Also, a ransomware attack sets off a chain of negative impacts such as reputation damage, operational disruption, fines and the cost of an investigation. This is where a traditional business insurance policy would fall short on protection and a more specialized policy is necessary to cover the losses.A bespoke approach to risk management recognizes that every business is unique and requires a customized strategy to effectively mitigate risks. This approach involves conducting a comprehensive risk assessment to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities specific to the organization. By understanding the individual risk landscape, businesses can better prioritize resources and implement targeted risk mitigation measures.Related: 5 Trending Captive-Insurance Considerations for 2022How to tailor your protectionRisk assessment: Start by conducting a thorough assessment of your organization's risk profile. Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities across all areas of operation, including cybersecurity, supply chain management, regulatory compliance and geopolitical factors.Review insurance policies: Once risks have been identified, review your existing insurance policies to ensure they provide adequate coverage. Identify any gaps or areas where coverage may be insufficient based on the results of your risk assessment. Consider specialized insurance products tailored to specific risks, such as cyber insurance or political risk insurance.Develop a customized plan: Based on the findings of your risk assessment, develop a customized risk management plan that addresses the unique challenges facing your organization. This plan should outline specific mitigation strategies and contingency measures to minimize the impact of potential risks. Collaborate with key stakeholders across the organization to ensure buy-in and alignment with strategic objectives.Implement crisis management protocols: In addition to proactive risk mitigation measures, develop a comprehensive crisis management plan to guide your organization's response in the event of a major risk event. This plan should outline clear roles and responsibilities, communication protocols and escalation procedures to facilitate a swift and effective response.Related: Do You Have the Right Insurance for Your Business? Here's How to Understand Your Options


Using the example of the private medical practice, if this business had followed the above steps, it could have recognized a ransomware attack as a key risk, implemented heightened security measures and training and procured insurance policies tailored to address this threat. It also could have had a plan in place to address the aftermath, should it happen. Through this approach, the private practice would not only prevent significant losses that could potentially bankrupt the business, but it could even prevent the attack from coming to fruition in the first place. In this sense, a customized approach to risk management serves as not just the act of navigating risks, but as a financial strategy to strengthen the business and enable it to thrive.SummaryIn today's dynamic business environment, a tailored approach to risk management is essential for effectively navigating the complexities of the modern risk landscape. By conducting a comprehensive risk assessment, reviewing insurance policies and developing customized mitigation strategies, businesses can better protect themselves against the myriad of threats they face.

68,5 Strategies for Dealing with High Employee Turnover,"Mar 1, 2024",Dave Ragosa,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-strategies-to-reduce-employee-turnover/469939,"
Do you sometimes feel like your employees are on a fast-moving conveyor belt out the door, and you're on a sluggish treadmill as you try to hire and train their replacements? You're not imagining things, and you're not alone. Aways an unfortunate fact of business life, employee turnover has only gotten worse – as high as 24% above pre-pandemic levels, according to Gartner, Inc. But you can take steps to minimize it or at least lessen the harm it does.The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), citing a study by the Work Institute, says employee turnover adds up to some $680 billion in training costs and lost productivity. High turnover can also lead to decreased morale among remaining staff, inconsistency in service quality and, ultimately, a negative impact on the bottom line.Even more frustrating, SHRM believes three of four workers who quit could have been retained.



As a restaurant, Ford's Garage is certainly not immune to turnover problems. We employ various strategies to retain employees, including offering competitive wages and benefits, fostering a positive work environment, providing opportunities for advancement and skill development, implementing recognition and reward programs and actively soliciting employee feedback to address concerns and make improvements.Related: How Employee Retention is Impacted by Various Leadership StylesHere's what we've learned about the best ways to manage rising resignation rates and try to reduce them:1. Don't ignore itWhile some turnover is inevitable, excessively high turnover rates indicate underlying issues that must be addressed. Take a look at working conditions, compensation, staffing levels and other factors that may be leading team members to head for the door. You may be unable to fix everything, but ignoring the situation cannot be an option.Related: Here's Why So Many Companies Are Losing Employees Shortly After Onboarding2. Take care of your remaining employeesStaff members left behind will have higher workloads, at least temporarily, and may suffer from stress and low morale. It's crucial to prioritize communication, transparency and support for them. Providing opportunities for recognition, professional development and work-life balance can help mitigate the harmful effects of turnover. And don't forget your managers, especially those at mid-level. If you have a seven-day operation, as most retailers and restaurants do, think about rotating local managers so they can take off one or two weekends a month.


3. Remember, it's not always about the moneyPay and benefits undoubtedly play a significant role in employee resignations, but they're not the sole determinants. While competitive pay and benefits are essential for attracting and retaining talent, good working conditions, such as a positive company culture, opportunities for growth and development, and work-life balance, can compensate for slightly lower compensation in some cases. Bear in mind that while flexible work arrangements can be a valuable retention tool for businesses that can offer them, it's essential to balance flexibility with operational needs and ensure clear communication and accountability to maintain productivity and teamwork.4. Foster a culture of continuous improvementHigh-performing team members leave an even bigger hole than most of their colleagues, so they need special attention to keep them motivated. Are you offering them assignments that excite and challenge them? Does their work align with their career goals? Ask them what keeps them returning and how you can help them achieve their goals. They need to be driven and motivated to see the growth and how they contribute to it so they don't leave.Related: Attract Top Talent: Show Them You Have What They Want5. Stay positiveI'm not saying you should ""look on the bright side"" of losing longtime employees, which can have potentially harmful effects on everyone. However, employee turnover can have some positive outcomes. It's an opportunity for workers to step up and show what they can do, revealing talent you never knew your team had. It can also foster innovation and fresh perspectives. Just be careful how you present this attitude to your team; don't give the impression that you think it's great news.


Making work worthwhileIndividuals seek opportunities that align better with their personal and professional aspirations. However, other factors such as job dissatisfaction, lack of growth opportunities and workplace culture play significant roles, so make sure you address all of the above-mentioned to keep your employees motivated and keep them with your company.

70,5 Tips for Choosing an SEO Expert to Help Your Website Stand Out and Attract More Customers,"Feb 28, 2024",Nick Zviadadze,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-tips-for-choosing-an-seo-expert-to-boost-your-website/469930,"
A lack of search engine optimization (SEO) leaves many small business websites buried under an avalanche of online content, invisible to potential customers.Simply offering quality products or services isn't enough to make it in today's competitive market. Without a solid SEO strategy, your business will face major growth hurdles, missing out on potential customers and letting competitors take the lead.The good news is, there's a way to change this. The right SEO expert can help your website stand out from the competition and attract potential customers.In this article, I share five crucial tips for navigating the world of SEO professionals and finding the one who can truly make a difference for your business.Related: 10 Questions to Ask When Hiring an SEO Consultant



SEO is as important as everWhen your potential customers search for the products or services you offer online, you want to be at the top of search results. This is where SEO comes in handy.Using the right SEO techniques improves your search engine rankings and drives more visitors to your website. More importantly, it provides the best user experience, helping convert these visitors into customers.A strong SEO strategy builds credibility and trust in your brand. When your website ranks high on search engine result pages (SERPs), it's seen as more authoritative and reliable.However, ranking on your own is often difficult, and most entrepreneurs need help from SEO experts. Keep in mind that the market is flooded with SEO agencies promising sky-high results, but not all deliver. Some use outdated techniques or black-hat tactics that can do more harm than good.


Let's see how you can avoid that:How to choose the right SEO expert for your businessHere are the five SEO tips for small businesses that can help you find the right SEO expert:1. Niche relevanceWhen choosing an SEO expert, you should pick someone with specific experience in your niche. The reason behind this is simple — every industry has unique challenges, audience behaviors and SEO mistakes to avoid.For example, if you're running a SaaS company, you'll be up against different keywords, content strategies and competition than the tech or software world.


An SEO expert with a track record in the SaaS industry will understand your niche's nuances, from the technical jargon to the customer journey of a software buyer. They'll know what has worked in the past for similar companies and will be able to tailor their SEO strategy accordingly.In comparison, ecommerce SEO involves optimizing product pages, managing reviews and understanding how to navigate the complexities of various shopping platforms. An expert with ecommerce experience will understand these specifics and develop a strategy to ensure your products rank well on Google and attract the right customers.The same goes for every other niche out there.2. Proven track recordsA history of delivering solid results across multiple projects is a strong indicator of a skilled SEO expert. Remember, a single success story might be a stroke of luck, but consistent achievements across various campaigns suggest a deep understanding of SEO principles.


In addition to checking their track record, however, you also need to ensure these results are tangible. Some SEO professionals might boast about doubling a website's traffic in a few months, but these numbers can be misleading without context.For example, doubling a website's traffic from 200 to 400 visitors is significantly different than going from 20,000 to 40,000. The latter demonstrates the ability to operate and deliver larger-scale results, which is crucial for businesses aiming for substantial growth.Related: 7 Compelling Reasons Why You Need to Hire An SEO Expert for Your Business3. Clear scope and deliverablesA common issue when hiring SEO experts is presenting a vague work scope. Statements like ""We'll improve your technical SEO"" or ""We'll focus on your on-page SEO"" might sound promising, but they lack specificity.


As a business owner, even if you're unfamiliar with all the technicalities of SEO, you should expect a clear work scope and a detailed timeline from your SEO expert. This can include all the tasks they'll undertake, how they contribute to your overall SEO strategy and when you can expect them to be completed.It's also crucial to understand exactly what SEO services you're getting. For example, here are some questions you could ask:Is keyword research part of the package, and how extensive will it be?How many blog posts or articles are included, and what topics will they cover?How many guest posts from reputable sites can you expect, and over what timeframe?4. Reasonable outputSEO agencies sometimes prioritize the management aspect of their services, such as strategy planning and client communication, instead of actual deliverables like content and backlinks.Remember that content creation and link-building are the biggest needle-movers in the SEO game. So, receiving one blog post a week and a couple of backlinks a month just isn't enough to significantly impact your website's search engine rankings.For SEO efforts to be truly effective, you should expect at least a dozen or more high-quality, SEO content pieces each month. In addition, aim to request five to ten quality backlinks per month.


5. Regular reportingIt's important to know upfront what the agency's reporting structure looks like and how they plan to keep you informed about the developments and results of your SEO strategy. It needs to be clear, understandable and actionable, allowing you to see the return on your investment.Effective reporting should start with baseline metrics like website impressions. An increase in impressions indicates that more potential customers are seeing your website.Another critical metric is the increase in clicks to key pages on your website, as it indicates that content is relevant enough to encourage further engagement.Lastly, any reporting should cover ranking for your target keywords. Improving keyword rankings is a strong indicator of successful SEO, which means your website is becoming more authoritative.


Related: Don't Believe an SEO Expert Who Tells You Any of These 7 LiesPartnering with the right SEO expert is vital for improving your website's visibility and supporting business growth. Remember to seek someone with niche relevance, a proven track record, clear deliverables, reasonable output and regular reporting.Following these five tips ensures a personalized approach, transparent communication and tangible results, setting you up for guaranteed success.

Having spent many years building links and optimizing websites, this is perhaps the most crucial lesson that I've learned.But those in the know also realize what an arduous and time-consuming process link building is. This is why incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools into your processes can speed things up. As such, they should not be overlooked in the increasingly competitive space for search engine rankings.Below, that's exactly what I'll cover to give you a breakdown of the essentials you should master as you speed up your processes to faster and more powerful link building.

In short, when your site links to and gets links from other high domain ranking (DR) sites, it becomes more ""powerful"" in a sense and also more authoritative. Through the exchange of this so-called ""link juice"" between your site and other authoritative sites, you can enjoy a great many business advantages.Now, this process can be streamlined by incorporating AI in your link-building efforts. Let's explore this in more detail below.The role of AI in SEO and link buildingThose who are in the game already know that link building, until very recently, was a process that entailed long hard hours spent in front of your PC.Typically, link-building specialists had the unenviable task of searching for authoritative sites, studying the competition, looking for appropriate keywords, fixing broken links, doing roundups, sending cold outreach emails and follow-ups, commissioning the writing of guest articles, writing strong pitches for Help a Reporter Out (HARO), creating skyscraper content, designing infographics, publishing their own research and gathering data for publication, and the list goes on.


However, with the advent of AI tools, SEO and link building, which are inextricably linked, have become a streamlined process that can save you a lot of valuable time and resources through the automation of many of the tasks mentioned above. And with ML, algorithms get smarter and yield even better results for us.

This combination allows ChatGPT to crawl a website and suggest relevant topics. For example, if I want to publish a guest post on a specific website, I ask for 10 unique and engaging titles.


You can also specify the topic for more tailored suggestions. Here is my prompt: ""Suggest 10 catchy topics for [target website] that have not been covered yet. They must be SEO-related only.""Perplexity AI:After a topic is selected by the editors, I use Perplexity AI to pitch them an outline with the following prompt: ""Suggest a detailed outline for an article I'd like to publish as a guest contributor on [website name] about 'topic.'"" This forms the basis of my outline. Based on my experience, and the best articles on the topic, I can create an outstanding outline in 5-10 minutes.SEMrush:The SEMrush AI Writing Assistant can also help with my SEO and link-building efforts. Through its 75 tools, I really have my pick when it comes to content options. Entering prompts is easy, and the content I need can be generated in mere minutes.Some of its more impressive features relevant to my link-building efforts include: adding keywords, generating multiple ideas from one prompt, choosing creativity levels, adjusting the tone of voice, and many others.


PitchBox:The PitchBox AI Keyword Assistant helps you generate relevant keywords for your outreach campaigns. You can also find relevant websites for link building. What is more, the AI tool enables me to write better link-building emails through the AI Template Assistant.There are over 20 outreach prospecting options you can choose from. Among these include: blogger outreach, roundups, skyscraper outreach, product reviews, guest posting, competitor backlinks and a whole lot more.HARPA AI:And then there is HARPA AI, which is available as a Chrome extension and enables you to get AI insights on any webpage you may be on. Here, you start by opening a search engine and defining your anchor text and target URL. Type in the site followed by your keyword and then look for relevant articles where your keyword would fit naturally.Once you've identified a relevant article, open it to check for placement opportunities. If the anchor text doesn't exist in the article but the article is niche-relevant and the keyword can add value, suggest an edit. You can also use HARPA to type: ""Suggest a relevant place for my anchor text 'your keyword' in this article [[page]].""


Through these AI tools and techniques for link building, I can proudly share that my own website has reaped the rewards. What started out as a DR of 49 quickly rose to 62 within the space of just one month. The reason behind this? Publishing high-quality content that received numerous strong links naturally. What is more, our team saved a lot of time and resources, making our efforts more streamlined for the business while ensuring we optimized our processes.Related: 5 Link-Building Tips to Help You Rank on Page 1The future of link building with AI and machine learningAI and ML in SEO and link building are considered to still be in their infancy.

That's why it's good to look toward the future and see some of the predicted developments and AI advances we can look forward to.So, without further ado, here's what I think we can expect in the future from AI and ML tools in the link-building space:

72,How to Take the Stress Out of the Hiring Process,"Feb 27, 2024",Jonathan Small,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/new-ai-powered-video-platform-streamlines-the-hiring-process/469757,"
Recruiting is a stressful business—perhaps more now than ever before.A 2023 survey of 1,200 hiring managers conducted by Zogby Analytics found they're feeling the pressure big time, thanks to an overwhelming number of resumes to review, often from unqualified candidates, too many vacant positions, and a lengthy hiring processes.While AI on platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed and ZipRecruiter have made it much simpler for job seekers to apply for a position in mere seconds, it has, in turn, caused a massive traffic jam in HR departments across the country.



Many use AI software to screen for candidates, but even that isn't enough to slow the deluge.Related: 55 Small Business Ideas to Start in 2024


Entrepreneur Vinay Jatwani believes he has a solution that offers managers more a effective hiring strategy. His company, CandidateView, utilizes the sophisticated ad tech technology used for customer acquisition and applies it to the hiring process. Although the company is still in its nascent state, early data indicates that the service eliminated 65 percent of unwanted applications. ""We've brought our knowledge from ad tech to HR tech,"" he says.Video killed the resume starCandidateView is an online platform allowing hiring teams to filter candidates before they meet them and candidates to vet companies before they apply for a position.The platform takes the focus off the resume and cover letter, relying on video as the primary means of communication. Candidates can watch videos provided by the employer and submit videos of themselves answering custom-tailored interview questions.""Employers are just getting flooded with resumes, but if you look at it, a resume is just a checklist, it doesn't tell you anything about an individual,"" says Jatwani. ""We want good candidates to get greater visibility for themselves. Through video, they can sell themselves above and beyond just their resume.""


How it worksOn CandidateView, job applicants are first directed to the relevant job position at the organization where they can watch short videos about the company. This helps the organization sell itself beyond a blurb on a webpage that busy candidates often don't have the interest or time to seek out.Related: Avoid Costly Hiring Mistakes With These Five Essential Tips""Through video, the company can explain their culture, what the position is, and what they're looking for,"" Jatwani says. The videos can be produced directly by the company or by AI, using a series of actors with diverse ages, ethnicities, and genders.


CandidateView then allows hiring managers to pre-interview candidates by asking them a series of questions via video. The candidates can answer the questions on their own schedule and re-record as many times as they like.Related: 6 Steps to Getting Your Business Plan In Front of InvestorsThe platform has hundreds of interview questions based on various categories or employers can write their own, allowing users to customize the Q&A process. Again, the service allows the client to upload their own video questions, use a human actor, or use an AI-generated actor.AI's not replacing HRSome critics may see services like Candidate View as a threat to HR executives. If you can use AI avatars to interview job applicants, why do you need humans?


But Jatwani stresses the goal is not to replace one-on-one human interaction but to use video interviews as a tool to prescreen candidates. Once candidates pass through the initial filtering process, they're ready to meet their potential employer face-to-face.""We want good candidates to get greater visibility for themselves and sell themselves above and beyond just their resume,"" he explains. ""And we want to make it easier for employers to meet these good candidates.""Jatwani is so passionate about the technology that he's begun using it on a personal project near and dear to his heart. A few years ago, his sons began a foundation in honor of his wife, who died of brain cancer. This year, the foundation is hosting a conference offering scholarships for students, and they're using CandidateView to get to know the candidates.Related: AI in Recruitment: The Future of Work or the End of Recruitment Agencies?

79,How Taking Up Boxing Transformed My Outlook on Entrepreneurship,"Feb 20, 2024",Sam Saideman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/3-lessons-i-learned-about-entrepreneurship-from-boxing/469096,"
If you pursue anything hard in life, you've likely dealt with sacrifice, whether that's a sacrifice of personal health, mental health, relationships, time or finances. Likely while chasing that goal, one or more of those things have suffered. When asked what surprised him most about humanity, the Dalai Lama said, ""Man. Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health."" He goes on to get far more philosophical and far more depressing, but the above quote is a great testament to the power of chasing dreams without being mindful of what you need to not just survive, but thrive.Now, that's not to say making sacrifices in pursuit of goals isn't a good thing — it's usually necessary. But being intentional about what you're giving up for what you're trying to get is how one lives a life without regrets. This is something that has remained relevant in my daily work to become a better leader, and while I've grown over the years of running businesses and learned along the way, nothing has made me grow and learn more than getting in the ring.A little over a year ago, I was reconnecting with an old friend from college, and he mentioned his new fascination with boxing. I had been around it as a teenager with friends pursuing it, but it had never been something I actively took part in. He convinced me to go with him and retry it in my adulthood. New Year's resolution and all, I went, and the rest was history. That one day in Nashville's Fighters Boxing Gym hitting heavy bags sparked an obsession which has resulted in boxing becoming a large line item on my expenses, more than half my laundry and most of my personality.



Here are the three most important lessons I've learned so far from the squared circle.Related: Knockout Personal Branding Strategies From Mayweather and Pacquiao


1. Resiliency is mandatory for successWorking in a startup environment where every deal matters and sparring in boxing are more alike than you think. For one: You have to have thick skin. No matter how much we try to ""cut off the ring"" with better services and have the client ""on the ropes"" with making a purchase decision, sometimes the potential client changes their direction and hires someone else. Those punches, while they may not hurt as much if you focus on each individual hit, but over several rounds, they start to add up. Learning to keep fighting and not accept defeat is how you force the fight to a decision without getting KO'd. In other words, if you're not resilient and you didn't stumble on hidden treasure, you likely won't last long in business.As an entrepreneur of a startup that never took on investment, my back has been against the ropes more times than I can count. This key lesson of staying resilient and not taking ""no"" for an answer has allowed me to stay determined and motivate my team to develop new verticals without having to close shop or lay people off. I attribute my ability to pivot my company to offering influencer marketing campaigns to brands and musicians/labels in a large way to boxing. Staying adaptable and being unwilling to throw in the towel. Boxing took me there.2. Focused time spent learningFocusing on learning is necessary for all great battles. There are no cutting corners on this one. If you don't put the hours in, you won't prevail. That goes for the time in the ring or in the boardroom. You need to work on the basics of being a good leader as much as you need to work on the fundamentals in the gym. Muhammad Ali said, ""The fight is won or lost far away from witnesses — behind the lines, in the gym and out there on the road, long before I dance under those lights."" Muhammad Ali would've been great in any profession. If you don't carve out uninterrupted time to improve, you won't improve.In my years as an entrepreneur, I've struggled to find uninterrupted time for growth. Digging into redlines, a client calls me. Working on a proposal, an employee asks me a question. Learning the importance of unavoidable ""offline"" time has made me more demanding of that in the workplace. I am now able to whiteboard, learn about new lanes or do whatever else I need to without compromising or being half distracted. If you're distracted while boxing, you'll feel it (literally). If you're distracted at work, you'll feel it differently — but both are equally detrimental to winning.


Related: 7 Lessons From the Boxing Ring3. Your corner can make or break youA boxer is usually only as good as his corner. To be truly great, you need a great trainer and cut man, just like an entrepreneur needs great leaders within their business and advisors outside of their business. The people you surround yourself with in either realm must be people who can be supportive and are also not afraid to speak their minds when things need improving. I'm far deeper into my entrepreneurial journey than my boxing journey; however, the coaches I've spent my time learning from, hitting mitts with, and sparring at The Punch Club in Los Angeles and Fighters in Nashville, have been the same type of people I try to surround myself with in business. Don't be afraid to make changes if those people aren't the right fit.It's easy in the workplace to be okay with keeping things the way they are. Justifying actions that shouldn't be justified because of busyness. Boxing has taught me that every voice in the room can make or break winning or losing. It's helped me to be more proactive with making changes when things aren't working.So the next time you're exhausted, worried about staying on your feet and the bell rings — or the Google Calendar alarm dings — be ready to fight with everything you've got left. I know I will be.

80,Overcome Startup Growth Challenges in 2024 By Utilizing This Valuable Resource,"Feb 19, 2024",Julius Černiauskas,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/this-valuable-resource-can-solve-startup-growth-challenges/468932,"
The startup market peaked in 2021. After that, we had a couple of turbulent years. Even the AI boom, which attracted considerable investments, could not kickstart the markets hit by the banking crisis and unfavorable conditions across industries.The beginning of 2024 brings hope that the venture capital (VC) market will stabilize and the funding will start picking up. This is good news for startups, especially in the tech industry, as new opportunities to grow and raise funds arise. However, those windows of opportunity will not be wide enough to fit everyone, and competition will be fierce. Open-source intelligence (OSINT) might become the difference maker for those startups that will excel at utilizing it.Related: Think Like a Spy: How Open Source Intelligence Can Give You a Competitive Advantage



Challenges and opportunities for startupsIn the heyday of tech startups, the general public and investors were captivated by the visionary, relentless, move-fast-break-things type of CEOs, often dubbed ""genius"" in the media. At least for now, those days are over. The tough economic climate and shortage of available funding call for frugal entrepreneurs who can demonstrate the ability to cut spending and achieve sustainable growth at a lower cost.These startup founders and leaders will be met with both challenges and opportunities, and turning the first into the second without always having the funds for it will require creativity.


One opportunity is provided by the recent wave of layoffs in the tech industry that made far more talent available. However, competition among the tech startups will be fierce for everything this year, including the best talent. Additionally, plenty of well-established legacy companies will be more than happy to accommodate outcasts from Google or Meta.Another disruptive factor is that investors are paying more attention to European startups. For American companies, this means even more competitors for funding. On the other hand, entering the U.S. market is never easy. If firms from elsewhere want to reach U.S. audiences, they will have to invest in understanding them and master digital marketing.Furthermore, navigating the ever-evolving regulatory landscape on both sides of the pond will be challenging. The public and legal scrutiny of the IT sector is on the rise. Fintech is especially under the magnifying glass since one of its latest superstars is now, reportedly, trading canned mackerels in jail. On the one hand, regulation brings legitimacy and fair opportunity. On the other hand, having to deal with legal proceedings and their outcomes can severely curtail innovation.Finally, technological innovation is as rapid as ever. Startups can use this to implement better solutions and introduce fascinating new products. However, new developments can also make their products obsolete before they even go live. Additionally, possibly no one implements new solutions into their ""business"" faster than cybercriminals. And who is a better target than a promising new company with little to no money to spare for cybersecurity?


What is open-source intelligence (OSINT), and how can it help?Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is the gathering of information from publicly available sources to produce actionable insights. In other words, everything openly available, from books and archives to what one freely accesses on the internet, can be analyzed to answer intelligence questions. This resource is vast and potent beyond imagination. Furthermore, it is free to take as long as you have a way to extract and use it.Thus, this free resource can potentially reduce many headaches for frugal entrepreneurs. The following examples demonstrate how OSINT can help startups grow in a challenging market.Market research: You can learn a lot about consumers in particular markets by gathering OSINT on ecommerce — for example, which products sell fastest. Additionally, OSINT provides valuable competitive insights in those markets. For example, you can foretell competitors' plans by their job postings for particular specialists and in specific regions.Identifying opportunities in the labor market: Following labor market events through open web sources can also boost your headhunting activities. In this case, automated monitoring is the way to go. It allows learning about layoffs as soon as they are reported or even rumored.Adjusting marketing and pricing strategies: Digital commerce is extremely dynamic. Both customers and competitors might act and react in unexpected ways. OSINT allows you to gather real-time insights and immediately adjust your own practices. For example, you can change your pricing to offer better deals than your competitors.Navigating risks: OSINT helps you follow cyber attack and threat reports and improve your cybersecurity. Additionally, software tools can be used to keep track of international regulations and constantly check for data leaks that might affect you and your clients.Achieving all this without blowing up the costs will allow some startups to stand out when presenting their case to investors.Related: 3 Reasons You Should Spy on Your Competition


How to get OSINT effectively?The internet is the world's greatest resource for information. Gathering OSINT manually from the internet is possible, but it requires time and personnel to spare. Early-stage startups often have neither. Even if they decide to dedicate some labor hours to sift through websites and report on competitor prices or the newest tech developments, the results cannot be very thorough. Often, they will also come too late to be actionable.Thus, the most effective way to get OSINT is automated web data extraction. Known as web scraping, this method utilizes proxies and sophisticated software tools to instantly collect large volumes of publicly available data. Real-time data acquired on a budget is precisely what companies need to survive and thrive in the still quite turbulent and always fast-moving tech startup market.Related: How Web Scraping Brings Freedom to ResearchThe situation with big data today is sometimes compared with the gold rush of the nineteenth century. Gold was there in the public lands for anyone capable of finding and taking it. Another valuable commodity, data, is likewise there in the public domain, giving everyone an equal opportunity to make use of it.


Unlike gold, however, the same piece of information stays right where it is, even if someone extracts it. Yet, time is still of the essence because, unlike gold, data loses its value over time and can become worthless quickly. Thus, the race to get to the resource first and make the most of it is still on every day. The startups that consistently and effectively utilize OSINT will have a strong advantage when competing for growth opportunities in these times of prudent funding.

81,Why Blockchain Technology Hasn't Dominated the Supply Chain... Yet,"Feb 19, 2024",Asim Rais Siddiqui,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-blockchain-hasnt-dominated-the-supply-chain-yet/469395,"
Blockchain technology has garnered constant debate ever since its inception, and the interest does not look like it will die out anytime soon. A piece of technology that holds the power to revolutionize existing systems, with experts back in 2017 predicting that the transformative powers of blockchain will be the perfect fit for supply chain management.However, as we look at the supply chain landscape over the past couple of years, the results are very different from what was anticipated, and the question lingers — why hasn't blockchain taken over the supply chain yet?Let's go over why this is the case.Related: Disrupting Supply Chain With BlockchainThe promise of blockchain in supply chainImagine a supply chain where every step is recorded in a ledger that can't be altered and is accessible to all authorized parties. With this kind of transparency, businesses can expect to see a great reduction in fraud, improved efficiency, and streamlined operations.



With 2.8% of the world's population already on blockchain, the technology holds great potential for revolutionizing supply chains. Blockchain is a favorite among experts due to some of its core attributes. These include:DecentralizationA major reason for blockchain's popularity is its decentralized nature, a breath of fresh air from traditional hierarchical structures. Since the launch of Bitcoin, the world has been moving towards decentralization, and it could mean big things for the supply chain realm.Let's think about a network where all participants, from suppliers to manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, share equal authority, and no single entity holds disproportionate power. This balance of power may help cultivate trust among stakeholders, as each party can keep track of all transactions.Related: Decentralization Can Be Your Friend


TransparencyThe transparency that comes with blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize supply-chain networks. It ensures that every authorized party has access to the same real-time data, eradicating any data asymmetry.This may especially be crucial in industries where accountability is important, like the pharmaceutical industry, where drugs can be life-saving or life-threatening. Knowing the authenticity of medication and keeping track of its expiration can help hold the right people accountable in case something goes wrong. Not to mention that it also increases customer confidence in the product.UnchangeabilityAccording to the KPMG Global Fraud Survey, more than half of the frauds committed were aided by the business' own technology, with 24% of the frauds having used these technologies to create false or misleading information in accounting records.One of the biggest advantages blockchain brings to supply chains is the inability to alter or erase any data that has been recorded on the network. This means that records of transactions, shipments and certifications are permanently etched into the digital ledger, which brings a new level of integrity to the supply chain.


SecurityWith supply chain cyberattacks in the United States affecting 1743 entities in 2022 alone, security breaches and data leaks have been rampant in supply chains for years and are only on the rise. The security mechanisms of blockchain offer a potential solution to this extremely troubling problem.Within a blockchain, transactions are secured using cryptography, and once validated, they are linked to the previous transaction, creating an unbroken chain. This makes altering old records an extremely difficult task. Apart from that, the business data will be spread across the network instead of being stored in a single location, making any centralized data breaches futile.Related: How to Mitigate Cybersecurity Risks Associated With Supply Chain Partners and VendorsChallenges faced by blockchain in supply chainWhile blockchain technology in the supply chain shows incredible promise, the path to seamless integration is treacherous and fraught with Herculean challenges. Let's look at some of the challenges you might encounter:


1. Unfamiliarity with the chain. Understanding and successfully implementing blockchain is not everyone's cup of tea, especially if you're a supply chain professional accustomed to traditional systems. Blockchain consists of several technical intricacies, like consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, and cryptographic hashing, which require time and patience to learn. The learning curve can also be steep and often requires specialized training and expertise.2. Scalability issues. The lack of scalability is one of the biggest hurdles facing blockchains today. This is mainly due to the blockchain's consensus mechanism, which requires all participants in the network to agree on which transactions are valid. So the bigger the supply chain, the more difficult it will be to scale it with blockchain because, as transactions increase, the network's performance can degrade, leading to delays and congestion.3. Regulations and legal hurdles. The regulations and legalities that come with integrating blockchain can be daunting to many. There are many intricacies when it comes to data privacy and cross-border transactions in particular. The lack of knowledge available regarding these makes many business owners hesitate for fear that something might go wrong and they might encounter a legal pitfall instead.4. Costs and resources. I believe the most obvious reason why blockchain isn't as common in supply chains as people believed it would be is the heavy investment required to integrate it. Implementing and maintaining blockchain requires building the infrastructure for the chain, hiring blockchain experts, and incurring operational costs as well. This alone is enough to deter any small businesses considering investing in integrating blockchain into their supply chains.


Related: Mass Adoption of Blockchain Technology by Entrepreneurs? Major Challenges Are Involved.The future of blockchain in supply chainAlthough these challenges are unnerving enough to scare away many keen entrepreneurs, some solutions are emerging to address them. These hybrid solutions involve integration with IoT devices, AI algorithms, and cloud platforms to reduce scalability and complexity concerns, making blockchain integration less complex and more desirable.

83,How Asynchronous Work Can Help Battle and Eliminate Burnout,"Feb 16, 2024",Tom Medema,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-asynchronous-work-can-help-battle-burnout/469374,"
The overall change in workplace dynamics has been widely covered in recent years and for obvious reasons. Due to my professional focus, I have had my fair share of this coverage, but my perspective has mostly been on the positive end of the spectrum. I understand that the generally inquisitive nature of humankind can sometimes lead to heavy questioning and, thus, a naturally slow and tentative adoption of rapid change, but that is why I see it as crucial to highlight benefits that I believe can be massive and that largely arise from this adoption.My professional focus as the founder and CEO of Bubbles revolves around workplace dynamics, and more specifically, asynchronous work environments and the need for optimization of meeting calls that are deemed essential. It represents a quest to adopt revolutionary changes in both general working patterns and behavior, and the improving technology that facilitates it.Now, many view the continued stronghold of remote, asynchronous work negatively, but I am of the opinion that the majority of those holding this view have not fully considered the extent of the benefits. One of them is the impact of asynchronous work environments on burnout and how changing work patterns have impacted our perception and management of workplace stress. To clarify, burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged exposure to stress. Burnout is something that has been of growing concern in work settings, both traditional and (to some extent) modern. Nevertheless, we should all want to reduce or even eliminate burnout. I just specified that the lack of full extent for modern burnout is a concern because of the positive impact of asynchronous work habits.



Nevertheless, there remains a long way to go. To put some numbers to this claim, a 2022 study by Asana that quizzed over 10,000 knowledge workers across seven countries found that around 70% of respondents experienced burnout in the previous year. This is a crazy number, but as I mentioned, if we can all collaborate to increase our expertise and awareness of burnout, I know we can find ways to reduce it, improving our work individually and when working as a team. Let's now explore how this is possible by first gaining more of an understanding of the problem itself.Related: 6 Ways to Avoid Burnout While Working Remote


Understanding burnoutPer the World Health Organization, burnout is a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. Symptoms include energy depletion and increased mental distancing from the job at hand, which all combine to reduce the worker's efficiency. The roots of burnout can be vast but generally encompass excessive work, especially with a lack of control and a subsequent lack of fairness and conflict in values. Burnout can itself be a root of more serious health issues, such as depression, anxiety and cardiovascular issues. A Gallup study found that employees with regular feelings of burnout are 63% more susceptible to sick days and are 2.6 times more likely to be on the new job hunt.Of course, there are a variety of burnout types, from being overloaded to being under-challenged, and technological burnout is also more than possible in the digital age. Still, part of this journey is to recognize that entirely eradicating is unrealistic. Instead, we should see these startling health statistics as a trigger to reduce the prevalence of burnout as much as possible, which is what async working, in my view, has been doing.Related: 5 Tips to Build Mental Fitness Within Your TeamsThe rise of asynchronous workAsynchronous work is a flexible working style where tasks are completed without the need for real-time interaction, and it has gained popularity recently due to the desire to optimize remote working. Flexibility brings control, directly counteracting a root cause of burnout, but also retains or even increases the effectiveness of collaboration, as the async approach allows more deliberation time to communicate those thoughts effectively. Any team member succeeding in achieving this is bound to feel like they are constantly improving their teamwork and team success, which will increase morale and work-life balance, which is pivotal to reducing stress and preventing burnout.


Furthermore, these success stories are becoming ever more common with the rise in async adoption. Speaking from a position of experience with Bubbles, which is partially an asynchronous communication platform, I have heard that my own team, who all pioneer this technology, feel far more comfortable and happy in their collaborative efforts due to the reduced pressure of immediate responses, and flexibility to manage personal responsibilities.From my perspective, implementing asynchronous communication in your team can appeal to every member. Those who are shy and reserved in their input feel less stressed by everyday meetings and conversations, and those who are more boisterous can continue to be so but also have that added flexibility to communicate on their own time. In these instances, the former experiences less stress and, therefore, usually less burnout, and the latter feels less pinned down and restricted to tight timings, potentially, for example, meaning they can attend a gathering or meet with a friend while still ensuring they complete their work. The effect here is a boost in work-life balance and happiness, which hopefully has a mirrored effect.Related: Avoid These 3 Key Mistakes for Team Success in 2024To conclude, asynchronous work environments hold significant potential for reducing workplace burnout through revolutionary shifts in everyday communicative and collaborative patterns. This is not to say that async is a panacea, and the success of these environments in reducing burnout largely hinges on their implementation and management. Nevertheless, the risk of adoption and testing is minimal compared to the reward of unblocking your team from burnout and ensuring a healthy, productive work environment. Therefore, my final words are to move with the trends and explore how beneficial this can be for you and your team.

84,9 SEO Tips to Help You Rank No. 1 on Google in 2024,"Feb 16, 2024",Nick Zviadadze,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/9-seo-tips-to-help-you-rank-no-1-on-google-in-2024/468807,"
Many entrepreneurs and small business owners struggle to reach the top spot on Google after the Helpful Content Update. However, the consequences of not ranking well can be severe, from making your website hard to find to limiting your potential growth.Remember that, in 99% of cases, people click on the top results on Google. This means that if you're not positioned there, your competitors will get all the attention and you'll miss out on valuable customers.Thankfully, there's a way to navigate this challenge. In this article, I'll share nine SEO tips to help you avoid common SEO mistakes and catapult your business to the top position on Google.



Related: 5 Simple SEO Strategies to Improve Your RankingsWhy is SEO important?Search engine optimization (SEO) refers to optimizing your website and content to rank higher on search engines. When potential customers search for a service or product that you offer, SEO ensures you're their front-and-center option. It makes your website more visible, drives more traffic and gives you a chance to convert visitors into customers.


But it's not just about visibility — SEO helps build your online presence and credibility. It's a dynamic strategy that adapts to evolving customer needs, offering a cost-effective marketing approach and delivering measurable results.9 SEO tips to help you rank #1 on GoogleHere are the most important practices you need to follow to propel your website to the number one spot on Google:1. Do comprehensive keyword researchAlthough everybody understands how important keyword research is, not many people do a good job at it. They grab a handful of keywords and create content around it without diving deeper into the research.A better approach, however, is to find as many niche keywords as you can — let's say 200-300 keywords that are relevant to your business. If you identify 300 relevant keywords, you might uncover 20 excellent opportunities to rank first. If you settle for just 20 keywords, you'll get one or two opportunities at best. The math is simple — the more keywords you discover, the more chances there are to strike SEO gold.


2. Update old contentGoogle wants to provide its users with the most recent and relevant information. That's why it rewards up-to-date SEO content with high rankings.If you aim for that number one spot, you must ensure your content stays relevant and valuable. The best way to do that is to regularly update old content to keep it optimized and evergreen.Look at what your competitors are doing and one-up them. This will keep your audience hooked and signal to Google that your website provides quality content.3. Use the reverse outreach techniqueThe reverse outreach technique is a link-building strategy designed to attract a significant number of backlinks. The goal is to create quality content that earns backlinks naturally, making link-builders come to you instead of the other way around.


The best way to do that is to create content with original data that people can use as a source. Doing this makes your content a valuable resource that naturally attracts backlinks without the need for active link-building strategies such as guest posting.4. Optimize your content for EEATGoogle uses EEAT (experience, expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness) to determine whether search engine results display relevant information. Although it is not a ranking factor, it is a good indicator of the quality of your content.You can optimize your content for EEAT by:Including an author bioLinking to reputable sourcesShowcasing your social media presence, certifications and experienceInterlinking your contentRelated: Why Producing High-Quality Content Matters for Your Business


5. Steal competitor backlinksOne of the possible reasons why your competitors rank well on Google is because they have quality backlinks. In turn, what you can do is run their websites through Ahrefs, SEMrush or another SEO tool you prefer to find their backlinks.Reach out to the individuals or websites already linking to your competitors, and persuade them to link to your content. Your message should include some kind of incentive or value for their website to increase your chances of success.6. Make your content skimmableWe live in a world of information overload, which is why most people won't likely read your content from start to finish. Instead, they scan the text for specific information.That's why it's important to make your content skimmable. People who want to read the entire blog will do so, while the ones seeking information will be able to do that too.


Higher user retention on your site will then signal to Google that your content is valuable.To help make your content skimmable, you should break down your content into bite-size paragraphs, use many images, add bullet points and include other elements that improve readability and make your text user-friendly.7. Use optimal URL slugsOptimizing URL slugs can improve your click-through rates. A short, neat URL always gets more clicks than a long URL that copies your headline.For example, if your blog post talks about the best quick home workouts, www.example.com/best-quick-home-workouts is a better option than www.example.com/blog/best-home-workouts-to-lose-weight-quickly. It's short, relevant and invites more clicks.


8. Compress your imagesCompressing your website's images is like shedding unnecessary baggage for a smoother online experience. When you compress images, you reduce their file sizes, which makes your website load faster.Most visitors will leave your website if it loads slowly, which can hurt your rankings. So, this isn't just a technical tweak — it's a great way to improve the user experience.Related: How to Improve Your Website's Speed9. Use CTAs in your blog postsAlthough this isn't necessarily an SEO tip, many people forget to include calls to action (CTAs) in their content. Remember that the main goal of SEO for small businesses is to attract visitors and drive revenue.


So, including CTAs throughout your content serves as a roadmap, directing readers to the next steps in the buyer's journey. Whether it's exploring your products, signing up for newsletters or downloading a valuable resource, effective CTAs transform casual readers into active participants, guiding your SEO efforts.Navigating the SEO world after the Helpful Content Update can be challenging for small businesses. Although some traditional SEO techniques may not work, these nine SEO tips should help you turn things around and increase your chances of ranking first on Google.Use these tips to stay ahead of the competition in 2024, and watch your business thrive.

85,6 Instagram Story Strategies That Will Grow Your Following,"Feb 16, 2024",Dmitrii Khasanov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/6-instagram-strategies-that-can-grow-your-reach/469036,"
Instagram has become indispensable to any business's digital marketing strategy, boasting over 1.3 billion active users, 3.76 billion daily visits and 500 million daily story users. This platform provides a substantial opportunity for businesses to engage with their target audience and enhance their return on investment (ROI). Despite its popularity, the competitive environment on Instagram can make it challenging for brands to stand out and make a significant impact.As more retail brands seek attention on the platform, standing out and making a meaningful impact can be challenging. Social media managers and marketers can employ several strategies to scale reach and, consequently, enhance ROI on Instagram. How? Let's figure it out together.The initial crucial step is to establish clear goals for your business to maximize the return on investment of Instagram stories. Define what you aim to achieve with Stories — driving more traffic to your website, increasing brand engagement, or generating buzz around the brand. Understanding your objectives, target audience, and engagement strategy is paramount. Create specific and measurable goals for each campaign, breaking them down into manageable steps to track success.



For instance, if your goal is to gain more followers, set a realistic target, such as reaching 10,000 in the next six months, by targeting individuals interested in your business, brand, category, or industry. It's extremely important to set achievable goals, allowing you to celebrate milestones as you reach them.So, what is the magic behind maximizing your ROI? Unfortunately, there are no special secrets or hidden formulas; all a business can do is focus on producing quality content and continually test new approaches. However, these strategies might accelerate the performance of your stories.


Related: 3 Ways to Use Instagram Stories to Boost Your Brand1. Provide more informationInstagram provides a unique way to boost your brand and turn visitors into buyers effortlessly by using the ""swipe up"" feature. Simply add an attractive image and a call to action and invite your audience to visit a link. When people swipe up on your Instagram Story, they'll be directed to the page you want them to explore. It's a simple yet effective way to engage and potentially convert your audience.2. Show that you are liveLive stories have a unique appeal as they draw your audience in by sending automatic notifications to your followers. When you decide to go live, generating buzz and excitement around something happening at the moment is essential. In this case, your business may create a sense of urgency and encourage active participation from your audience.Related: How Instagram Stories and Instagram Live Help You Interact with Your Customers


3. Storytelling still rocksCreating visual stories on Instagram is powerful for building brand awareness. Visuals are more engaging than text, effectively reaching a broader audience. With its focus on visuals, storytelling on Instagram helps build an emotional connection with viewers and sparks their curiosity to learn more about your brand. Through this approach, you can convey your brand's story and values compellingly, strengthening your connection with the audience.4. Collaborate with influencersInfluencer marketing campaigns have the potential to boost brand awareness and drive sales growth significantly. While reaching out to influencers directly on Instagram is an option, I would recommend using an influencer marketplace for more efficient and timely discovery of the best influencers for your campaign. Remember that you do not need to collaborate with celebrities and Instagram superstars; instead, consider micro and nano influencers as they make waves in 2024.Related: How Many Followers Do You Need To Make Money on Instagram?5. Do not be afraid of paid advertisingInstagram's advertising platform is a potent tool for expanding your brand's reach and engagement on the platform. With the average user spending 30 minutes daily on Instagram and 63% of American users checking the platform at least once a day, it offers a strategic means to maximize your ROI and attract attention to your paid content. Consistent posting plays a crucial role in increasing visibility. The more frequently you post, the higher the likelihood of appearing in the Explore feed, being featured on other accounts, or ranking highly in searches for keywords and hashtags you commonly use. Establishing a regular posting cadence is essential to maintaining audience interest. Posting consistently every week has the potential to double your followers compared to those who post less frequently than once a week.


6. Ask your followers and get engagementRemember that marketing is about understanding your audience's likes and dislikes, and Instagram Stories can help you learn more about them. Creating polls and asking questions in your stories prompts users to interact by clicking on them. These interactions provide valuable insights that can improve your business and marketing strategies. You can also use these features to effectively advertise new products, making it a versatile tool for engaging with your audience and conducting market research.

Danielle Cohen-Shohet.When did you start your side hustle in the self-care industry, and what inspired it?



My interest began when I did freelance makeup artistry out of my Princeton University dorm room. I've always had a passion for design and art, and for as long as I can remember, I have been entrepreneurial. I have a tendency to want to become an expert at something I do, so when I became interested in makeup, I took it much further than most and started a side hustle in college. During that time, my twin sister and I also pursued a digital receipts payments venture. Those were both enriching experiences; however, I had no idea at the time that I'd later take a leap and combine those interests to start a software payments company now worth over $510 million.Related: These Sisters Started a Side Hustle After a 'Light Bulb' Moment Standing in Line for Coffee — Now Their Business Has Done $100 Million in Total Sales


What were some of the first steps you took to get that side hustle off the ground? I learned voraciously, strived to be the best and just rolled up my sleeves to start. Back when I was in college, makeup artistry tutorials were just starting to be democratized on YouTube, so I dove into them and just got my hands dirty practicing. I drilled college classmates and friends for feedback and just kept getting better from there. It sounds simple, but these first steps helped me succeed faster.Were there any challenges that came with running the side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those? Anything that you can grow from will have challenges. While doing makeup artistry, I experienced first-hand the pain points that many of our GlossGenius business customers face today: time management, coordinating schedules and growing a client base without the proper infrastructure, just to name a few. I dove headfirst into solving these challenges with manual spreadsheets and tools that I would hack together, which sparked the idea for what would later become GlossGenius. I wanted to provide other business owners with best-in-class technology and infrastructure that would make it easier to run a business.


How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue? On average, how much revenue did it bring in? For me, it was originally more so about satisfying a creative interest than revenue. It took several months before I started to earn real revenue, and it was meaningful enough to cover a lot of living expenses while in college.Related: She Spent Her Honeymoon Working on a Side Hustle. It Raised $35 Million and Counts Celebrities Among Its Investors.When did you decide to transition into startup mode and found GlossGenius, and what motivated that move?


After understanding the problems facing service-based self-care businesses, I decided to start a software company that would solve many of these problems with technology. I had graduated college and started a career in finance at Goldman Sachs, but I kept thinking about how to help self-care entrepreneurs run better businesses. It was really hard to manage a client-first business when there were so many scattered, disconnected systems.I had taught myself how to code, so I felt as if I could do anything. After getting a couple of years of experience at Goldman, I took a leap and left to start GlossGenius. Given the industry experience, my technical background and the digital receipts payments company I had pursued with my twin sister — who is my partner and chief business officer at GlossGenius — it just felt obvious to put all of this into a software payments company focused on the self-care industry.Image Credit: Courtesy of GlossGenius. Danielle Cohen-Shohet and Leah Cohen-Shohet.How have you approached scaling the company? 


Before we could even think about scaling the company, we first focused on solving a real problem that is a critical part of our customers' lives. There is so much opportunity to empower entrepreneurs to run, manage and scale their own local businesses. Our platform impacts customers' livelihoods, and our solutions are an important part of their everyday lives. That focus was foundational to have in place before scaling.With that in place, one of the things I did early on was learn everything about the business: Building products, launching products, recruiting, marketing, closing partnerships, handling customer support tickets and much more. Having a deep knowledge of all parts of the business has been important to scaling the company as it has helped me understand what excellence looks like in all parts of the business. With that type of understanding, I could surround myself with fantastic people and leaders to take teams even further.Related: The Sweet Side Hustle She Started 'On a Whim' Turned Into a $20,000-a-Month Income Stream: 'It's Simple, It's Affordable and It's Fun'Because there are so many problems to solve for businesses, we also had to remain disciplined in solving the most important problems for customers first. So as we've scaled, we have continued to flex discipline and only pursue initiatives that create value for our customers. We say no often and are thoughtful about how we sequence what we pursue. We obsess over our customers' needs and absorb their feedback like a sponge, as it plays a key role in driving GlossGenius' growth and new products. Keeping the connection with our customers as we've scaled is something I'm really proud of.


When you look to GlossGenius's future, what are you most excited about? We are creating a gateway for entrepreneurship, giving self-care business owners the infrastructure to scale their businesses and empower more entrepreneurship. While we've already built a platform that is mission-critical to our customers, there is still so much for us to do to achieve our mission. With the responsibility of serving over 65,000 businesses and powering billions of dollars of transaction activity, we are working to make our software products more intuitive and magical for customers.The recent launch of our GeniusAI, a generative AI-powered tool, is a good example of this. This tool helps beauty and wellness practitioners draft ready-made, personalized email marketing campaigns, enabling users to simply enter a few notes and receive messages tailored to their goals and brand. In an industry that has traditionally lagged in technological adoption, it is exciting that we get to be the company that puts this in customers' hands. Another recent GlossGenius product launch is Genius Loans — fast, flexible financing that helps customers grow their businesses. Products like this underscore our support of customers with what they need, when they need it — well beyond what's typically expected from SaaS platforms.What are some of the biggest lessons you've learned over the course of your entrepreneurial journey? 


I've learned that true success means helping others succeed. I am fortunate to lead a company that's so tightly aligned with our customers' success. With the opportunity to build and lead GlossGenius, I've had a masterclass in learning the special framework of how to make decisions that build long-term value for customers.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill. It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.Do you have any advice for people interested in starting a side hustle or business of their own? Be fearless. Don't take no for an answer. And importantly, surround yourself with like-minded people. You might find this through a community like the one we've created for entrepreneurs with GlossGenius, or you might look to people closest to you. I've had many close supporters along the way, but my strongest collaborator is my twin sister, Leah. She has been a thought partner from day one and has played an invaluable role in expanding the company into what it is today. So surround yourself with people who get you.

89,Why You Should Live with Empathy Every Day — Not Just on Valentine's Day.,"Feb 12, 2024",Scott Deming,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/a-leaders-valentines-day-thoughts-on-empathy-in-the/468511,"
Valentine's Day, traditionally dedicated to expressing love and affection, often sees us scrambling on that special day to show appreciation for those in our lives. But why limit this sentiment to just one day? And why limit it to just our personal lives? Consistent consideration and empathy can forge stronger, more meaningful connections in both our personal and professional spheres. This article explores the profound impact of empathy and making every day a chance to show we care.Several years ago, I was preparing for a keynote speech at a manager's meeting for a utility company deep in the heart of Texas. Ahead of the event, we had a prep call to align my presentation with their goals. The CEO chimed in during the call, saying, ""Scott, our managers lead teams across diverse roles, from internal ops to customer service and field support. It's crucial that your talk emphasizes customer service.""Now, this caught me off guard. My presentation focused on leadership, and though I planned to weave in customer service elements, the CEO's emphasis on this aspect was unexpected, especially for a leadership presentation. I knew that this utility company owned its footprint or service area — meaning they had no competition.



Knowing this, I asked him, ""Without competition in your service area, why is there a strong focus on customer service?"" His response was music to my ears. ""Because treating people well is the right thing to do…all the time. Not just when you're facing competition."" Bingo!For this CEO and his organization, it wasn't just about customer service; it was about empathy, making every interaction count, and treating every day as if it were Valentine's Day — with care, attention, and genuine concern for others. That's the essence of true service, extending beyond mere transactions to heartfelt connections.


Related: 6 Exceptional Examples of Brands Showing Their Customer AppreciationLet's talk about empathySimply put, empathy is the ability to understand and share another person's feelings. It's about stepping into someone else's shoes to see the world from their perspective and feel what they feel. Empathy goes beyond sympathy, which is feeling compassion for others — empathy is more about directly connecting with their emotions. It's a crucial skill, especially in leadership and customer relations, as it allows for a better understanding of others' needs, concerns, and experiences. This connection fosters better communication and can lead to more effective problem-solving as you address issues with a deeper understanding of the human element involved.There's good news and bad news regarding empathy. The good news is that we're all wired for empathy to some degree, but it's a bit more nuanced. It's partly physiological, as our brains are equipped with mirror neurons. These neurons fire both when we perform an action and when we see someone else perform the same action, helping us understand and mirror others' feelings. This is a fundamental part of empathy.However, the extent and manner in which people experience empathy can vary widely. Some individuals might naturally be more empathetic due to their brain wiring or upbringing, while others may find it more challenging to empathize. Factors like environment, education, personal experiences, and even cultural norms significantly shape our empathetic abilities.


While it's true that various factors might influence our initial capacity for empathy, the good news is that this isn't the end of the story. Empathy, much like any other skill, can be nurtured and strengthened over time through deliberate practice and learning. Activities like active listening, engaging with diverse perspectives, and emotional intelligence training can bolster our ability to empathize with others. It's not just a static trait; it's a skill that can be cultivated and improved over time. This is particularly relevant in professional and personal development, where understanding and connecting with people is key.The power of empathy in the workplaceIn business, showing genuine concern and understanding toward clients and colleagues isn't just good ethics; it's a smart strategy. Empathy can transform customer interactions, turning a one-time buyer into a lifelong advocate. It's about seeing things from their perspective, addressing their needs, and going the extra mile.Case in Point: Consider a scenario where a customer faces an issue. A company that listens and responds with genuine concern and a willingness to resolve the problem retains that customer and earns their trust and loyalty.Related: 3 Ways Gratitude Can Set You Up for Business Success


Empathy goes beyond the bottom lineEmployees thrive in environments where they feel valued and understood, especially for remote workers. When leaders practice empathy and show appreciation regularly, it creates a culture of loyalty and dedication that transcends physical office spaces. For remote employees, who may feel isolated or disconnected, regular check-ins and recognition of their challenges and achievements can significantly boost their morale and performance. It's not about grand gestures; sometimes, simply acknowledging their hard work, being flexible with their unique situations, or offering support during tough personal times makes all the difference. This approach enhances their productivity and strengthens your relationship with them, fostering a sense of belonging and team unity despite the physical distance.The Ripple Effect: Happy employees are more productive, creative, and inclined to go above and beyond. This positivity radiates, improving the workplace atmosphere and positively impacting customer experiences.Strengthening personal bondsIn our personal lives, showing love and appreciation shouldn't be reserved for special occasions. Regular acts of kindness and understanding strengthen bonds with friends and family. It's about being there, listening, and showing that you value them not just on Valentine's Day but every day.People remember how you make them feel. When you consistently show that you genuinely care, they're more likely to be there for you in your times of need, creating a mutual support system.


Related: Why Entrepreneurs Should Always Express GratitudeMaking every day Valentine's DayValentine's Day serves as a reminder to express our feelings. However, integrating this ethos into our daily lives can lead to more fulfilling personal relationships, a more supportive work environment, and a customer base that feels valued and understood. Let's not wait for a special day to show people we care. After all, every day can be a day of appreciation and empathy in both personal and professional life.As we approach Valentine's Day, let's challenge ourselves to carry this spirit throughout the year.

94,3 Reasons to Increase Your Cybersecurity Protocols in 2024,"Feb 8, 2024",Sebastian Huelck,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-reasons-to-increase-your-cybersecurity-protocols-in-2024/468996,"
Cybersecurity is one of the biggest challenges facing businesses today. With the rise of technology and increasing connectivity, the threat of cyberattacks has become more prevalent than ever before. In fact, there are 2,220 cyber attacks each day, adding up to more than 800,000 attacks each year.That works out as a cyber attack every 39 seconds.The World Economic Forum has also highlighted the growing concern about cybersecurity, stating that cyberattacks are one of the top risks facing businesses in 2024. This was further emphasized at the recent Davos sessions, where experts discussed the need for stronger cybersecurity protocols to protect businesses and economies.



As the CEO of an 8-figure subsidiary of a publicly traded company, tec5USA, I understand the importance of prioritizing cybersecurity measures to protect our proprietary materials while growing our business. Cybersecurity is no longer just a concern for big corporations; small and medium-sized businesses are also at risk. Therefore, it is crucial for every business to have an effective cybersecurity strategy in place.In this article, I will discuss three key reasons why businesses should prioritize increasing their cybersecurity protocols in 2024.Related: Why Is Cybersecurity Important for Your Business? Neglecting It Could Be Your Downfall.1. Protect your business from costly data breachesAccording to Accenture, the average cost of a cyber attack for a business is $13 million. This includes not only the financial loss from theft or damage of assets but also the cost of downtime, lost productivity and recovery efforts. These costs can cripple a business, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises that may not have the resources to bounce back quickly from a cyber attack.Google Bard, an AI-generated tool, says cyber threats are increasing at an alarming rate. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, the global cost of cybercrime is expected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, a significant increase from $3 trillion in 2015.Furthermore, failure to protect sensitive customer data can result in legal ramifications and damage to your business's reputation. In today's digital age, customers are more aware of their privacy rights and expect businesses to handle their data securely. One data breach can lead to a loss of trust from customers and ultimately impact the bottom line. For our client in Silicon Valley dealing in semiconductor manufacturing, it is mandatory.


There is also the prospective litigation cost if you are found to have fallen short of the cybersecurity protocols set out by regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act). These regulations set out a number of potential penalties for businesses that fail to protect personal data, including fines of up to 4% of annual global turnover or €20 million, whichever is higher.Implementing ISO 27001, an internationally recognized standard for information security management systems (ISMS), plays a pivotal role in enhancing cybersecurity within enterprises. By providing a systematic framework for managing information security risks, ISO 27001 assists organizations in safeguarding sensitive data and mitigating potential cyber threats. Central to ISO 27001 is the implementation of a set of controls tailored to address specific security risks faced by the organization. These controls encompass various aspects of information security, including access control, encryption, incident management and business continuity planning.Through the adoption of ISO 27001 controls, enterprises establish robust mechanisms for protecting their information assets, ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability. By conducting comprehensive risk assessments and implementing appropriate controls, organizations can identify vulnerabilities, proactively address security gaps and strengthen their cybersecurity posture. ISO 27001 fosters a culture of continuous improvement, prompting organizations to regularly review and update their security measures in response to emerging threats and evolving business needs.It provides a competitive advantage by differentiating the organization as a trusted custodian of sensitive information. Furthermore, ISO 27001 facilitates compliance with regulatory requirements and legal obligations, reducing the risk of non-compliance penalties and reputational damage.2. Safeguard your intellectual propertyIn today's highly competitive market, intellectual property is one of the most valuable assets a business can possess. Without proper cybersecurity protocols in place, your company's sensitive data and trade secrets are at risk of being stolen or compromised by cybercriminals. This not only damages your competitive advantage but also puts the future success and growth of your business at stake.


Effective cybersecurity protocols are a prerequisite for high-tech customers in protecting data integrity, and generally for data protection. In our case, working with clients in law enforcement, if you deal with sensitive data, and if it's construction or high-tech devices related, you need to make sure there are no data leaks out to competition, but also any other areas in the world that might be interested in that technology and want to copy it.Implementing strong cybersecurity measures, such as firewalls, encryption and regular data backups, can help safeguard your intellectual property from cyber attacks. It also gives you a competitive edge by assuring customers and partners that their confidential information is safe.Related: Cyber Attacks Are On the Rise — Here's How Your Business Can Continuously Prepare for Threats3. Ensure business continuity during geopolitical unrestA cyber attack can bring your business operations to a halt, resulting in significant financial losses and reputational damage. In some cases, businesses may even have to shut down permanently due to the severity of a cyber attack. Therefore, having effective cybersecurity protocols in place is crucial for ensuring business continuity.


The rapid rise in ransomware attacks, where cybercriminals hold a company's data hostage until a ransom is paid, highlights the importance of being prepared for potential cybersecurity threats.If you look at the global or geopolitical situation, we have growing tension between the U.S. and China and two wars going on in Ukraine and the Middle East. Whenever wars are happening, there's an increasing amount of cyber warfare. So the amount of hack attacks, denial of service attacks, viruses and ransomware is growing.In that environment, it's almost a necessity to have any kind of quality assurance framework — such as a cybersecurity framework — in this case, protecting you from these threats. It's become far more vital because of that changing business environment and the growing global threats we have to deal with.Regularly updating and maintaining your cybersecurity measures can minimize the risk of successful cyber attacks and prevent disruptions to your business operations. This not only prevents potential financial losses but also protects your reputation and maintains customer trust.


Related: 4 Top Cyber Threats Entrepreneurs Need to Know About in 2024Cyber attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and hackers are always finding new ways to exploit vulnerabilities in systems. This is why it's essential to continuously update and improve cybersecurity protocols to stay ahead of emerging threats.It's predicted that there will be more than 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs worldwide in 2024. This means that businesses need to invest in training and hiring cybersecurity professionals to stay ahead of potential threats.As the CEO of tec5USA, I understand firsthand the importance of prioritizing cybersecurity protocols. By taking proactive measures to protect our business, we can continue to grow and scale without fear of falling victim to a cyber attack. As the threat landscape continues to evolve, it's crucial for businesses of all sizes to stay vigilant and prioritize cybersecurity in 2024 and beyond!

99,Many Employees Fear Being Replaced by AI — Here's How to Integrate It Into Your Business Without Scaring Them.,"Feb 3, 2024",Daniel Todd,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/many-employees-fear-being-replaced-by-ai-heres-how-to/467661,"
It is understandable that people are generally concerned about automation replacing jobs, but gaining buy-in for the integration of AI is not just about alleviating fears. Instead, the job of leadership is to build confidence that this tech can help us meet our goals faster and with a larger upside. If companies are to successfully navigate this transition, people need to know that leadership is incorporating AI in a way that improves and maximizes their contributions and optimizes company growth, ultimately leading to increased experience and compensation for the team.We have a curated list of projects for the next year and people have already dedicated many months of their time to prioritize them. So, I am very transparent about what we can gain from AI and machine learning, which is building upon our existing roadmap with the end result of a more robust and powerful suite of products. This will not happen all at once. A staged approach to integrating AI into workflows and products emphasizes strategic resource allocation and a commitment to continuous learning. Leaders are on a journey with AI as much as anyone else, so it starts at the top.Related: Building an AI-Augmented Workforce While Remaining Human-Centric



Integration: A staged approachThe first goal of integrating AI should be understanding the quickest way for it to start having a positive monetary benefit. While our AI project is still a work in progress, we are expecting to increase revenue anywhere from $2 million to $20 million as a result of a first round of investment of under $100,000. But to achieve that type of result, leaders need to get comfortable with AI and figure out the challenges and complexities they might encounter.I am hiring outsourced firms to build the smallest prototype possible so I can be part of an ongoing conversation about the most feasible way to integrate AI. It was similar to when I would meet with my CTO every morning to talk about building the main product of our business today. We would combine his knowledge of programming and my knowledge of our business goals to make daily improvements and get a minimal viable product out to the market for testing as quickly as possible. Getting real-world feedback and seeing real work performance is when you truly start to improve and refine your product.


My initial goal with testing AI is to increase our push messaging system. We send millions of messages daily with just one person handling the creation, scheduling and optimizations of hundreds of different messages. With AI, we can customize them to a previously unthinkable degree, leading to meaningful performance optimizations that AI can handle automatically. We also have other products that should have a machine-learning component at their center. By exposing my product and dev teams, as well as myself, to the potential of AI, we won't waste resources without seeing a solid increase in performance. And for all that to work, communication must be consistent throughout the process.Related: 3 Practical Ways to Let Artificial Intelligence Work for YouCommunicating our directionI am a huge proponent of transparency in all facets of business. I want employees to know how any changes we consider will impact them. But if I am not articulating my goals clearly, misconceptions can take root. It's important for leaders to express certainty about their direction with AI integration and provide a clear vision for where their investments are leading the company.As a company scales and more people's ideas are competing for limited resources, leaders need to be as accurate as possible in how they prioritize. For example, spending $1 to make $14 should be prioritized over projects that cost $1 for a $3 return. That may seem obvious but a threefold return on investment is persuasive. Prioritizing the project with the better yield first will then fund building many more of the product with the smaller return.


When people see that we are risking the least money to get positive results the quickest, we are more likely to get buy-in from everybody. Start small and build from there. If we can increase our marketing message response rates by 2%, then we will have more confidence applying the prototype to our external products. It is also an opportunity to reinforce our messaging.Paying attention to red flagsAs leaders socialize ideas for AI integration across a wide range of people, they may come across major red flags of what you are missing. Everybody has different perspectives. If you are a glass-half-full kind of person, listening to the glass-half-empty kind of person offers a complementary point of view.Whenever I have ideas to really move the numbers, I tend to act fast. It is crucial that people understand that I am not fast-tracking AI integration because I am unhappy with our current process or people. It is because I am happy that I will not risk what we already have unless I am fully sold on the range of the upside — and I want to expedite the learning process to get to those benefits faster.I still want to talk to as many people as I can — employees, developers, marketing folks, product managers, external investors — both for the tone of responses and any major issues. Those red flags may be great things to consider or I need to give people more information. Either way, my response can alleviate their concerns.


Related: I Transformed My Company Through AI 15 Years Ago — Here's What I've LearnedAI and human: Complementary growthI believe people should embrace AI in much the same way they embraced computers 20 years ago. Computers opened the door for more new jobs and greater diversity than they replaced, so leaders need to emphasize that AI represents a major opportunity for employees with a growth mindset — while balancing efficiency and capability gains with the human elements of creativity, empathy and ethical judgment. Think about ways to engage curious employees through workshops, courses, webinars and industry conferences. With transparent communication and a commitment to continuous learning, people will come to see AI as a complement to our human endeavors.

Businesses that learn to embrace AI — in the right ways — will leverage the benefits regardless of the external economic environment.Related: How to Leverage AI to Supercharge Your Business



Tech booms and bustsDuring the dot-com boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s, numerous internet service providers (ISPs) and search engines emerged, but not all survived the eventual market correction. Engines like Infoseek, Lycos, WebCrawler and Ask Jeeves didn't make the cut. Google did, which today accounts for around 90% of the global search engine market share.The dot-com bust led to the downfall of many of these companies. Poor business models, the inability to monetize effectively, failure to be adaptable and intense competition were common reasons for their decline or disappearance.


The same thing happened with social media. Sites like Friendster and MySpace, which were popular initially, lost momentum after the boom faded.Historically, first you see a boom, then consolidation. Today, AI is still in that early boom stage. It would thus be irresponsible for most businesses to tie their systems to a single AI platform quite yet.While some believe AI represents the biggest risk to workers, that risk remains undefined and uncertain. AI can be a great copilot and resource for businesses. If it's used wisely, it's not necessarily going to displace millions of workers. Over the years, every major technological innovation (such as the steam engine, the internet and social media) expanded demand for work. Workers who understand how businesses can best optimize technologies, improve workflows and grow profitability will always be in demand.Related: Why Every Company Should Be Thinking About Artificial Intelligence


5 tips to integrate AI effectivelyWhile AI's future remains uncertain, we know that it's here to stay. Organizations need to start considering how to incorporate AI effectively and what their processes might look like in an AI-driven future. Here are a few suggestions for small businesses looking to successfully integrate AI:1. Create clear objectivesFirst, understand exactly why you're using AI and what you're trying to achieve. What problem is it solving? For example, you may want to enhance customer service with a 24/7 customer chatbot or generate content ideas for faster outlining. Think about what clear value AI creates for you. Don't just integrate it because it's the latest, coolest technology.2. Align your focus with hiring


Depending on where you're using AI and what your objectives are, you may want to hire a dedicated AI resource. AI is a broad and rapidly evolving field. Invest in someone who actively follows the trends and can work with department leaders to leverage them effectively. You need clear use cases and data points to prove it's worth the investment. An AI expert can provide that information, updating strategy as the technology changes.3. Start small You don't have to use AI to completely revamp your business. Not yet. Begin with a small project or pilot program. Regularly assess the impact of AI on one workflow. Collect feedback, monitor performance metrics, and adjust your approach as necessary. These smaller projects will ensure you're not throwing everything into a technology that is still in its early boom phase.4. Connect your AI tools with business needs


There are many AI tools and platforms tailored for small businesses — more enter the market every day. Conduct ample research, and select programs that align with your business needs and budget. Working with an AI professional can ensure you're making the right early moves.5. Prioritize privacyStay mindful of AI's ethical concerns, such as data privacy, bias in AI algorithms and transparency in AI-driven decisions. Privacy is currently a major issue. Many businesses are putting client and business information into these learning models, and it's not completely clear what the privacy protocols are and what will happen next. Train your team to use AI tools to avoid creating additional risk.Related: 3 Ways You Can Actually Use AI in Your Business (and Why You Should Still Be Careful With It)


Embrace AI with open eyesEvery new technology becomes powerful while it's booming. We still don't know the implications of new AI platforms. Businesses need to set clear goals, follow trends and updates, evaluate it on small projects and measure results regularly. Invest where you see progress, and avoid full-scale implementation until AI is fully understood. Carefully consider the information you're feeding into the learning models.The best use case for AI is using it in tandem with human expertise, which just can't be replaced. Businesses that are committed to staying informed about AI's development and working strategically will win the game.

105,Most Websites Fail — And Yours Could Be One of Them If You Don't Follow These Expert-Backed Lessons,"Jan 31, 2024",Anat El Hashahar (Anne Moss),https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-persisting-through-failure-fuels-success/468610,"
Web publishing is a long-term effort. As someone who has been a web publisher for over 20 years with many projects under my belt, I know that getting a site to be successful often takes years of perseverance.My most successful sites have taken anything from two to five years to take off and become profitable. During these years, I have had to keep investing time, money and effort to keep pushing through.And it isn't just about the resources. Throughout these years, I have had to deal with bouts of fear, uncertainty and doubt as well. Wondering whether or not I should keep trudging along with a project is probably something all entrepreneurs go through, and I was no exception.



In this article, I want to share some insights about the process, not only to share the difficulties but also to convince you that pushing through the grind is worth it. It's the only way to success and may be the single most important thing that separates successful entrepreneurs from those who give up.Related: 9 Best Practices for Managing a Multi-Site Web Publishing Business


The journey from vision to viable websiteThe initial phase of ideating a website is often exciting as ideas flow freely. Then comes the long slog of securing the domain, hosting, installing WordPress and populating the site with initial content. With some website ideas, you may realize the concept wasn't viable after all. Knowing when to halt projects that aren't panning out is crucial.The slow build of organic traffic can also be disheartening. Most web publishers aim to generate traffic organically through search engines rather than pay for ads. This organic growth is steady but slow, as search engines can take months to crawl, index and rank newly published content.Many articles never rank well, and even those that do often take a while to appear in search results. Website owners must persistently publish content without certainty that it will ever drive traffic.Platforms like Facebook can drive website traffic faster than search engines. You typically know within hours whether a social media post resonates with your audience. However, it takes most publishers weeks or months to discover what content succeeds on social platforms. The formula is often elusive.


Taking the leap of faithNo matter how experienced you might be, launching a website requires a leap of faith. Success lies on the other side, but summoning the courage to step out with a new idea rests on the hope that your efforts will carry you across.Website owners must overcome fears and trust their commitment will lead somewhere good. Resources like mental resilience help make the leap possible when results aren't immediate.Related: 5 Quotes to Help You Maintain Entrepreneurial PersistenceSticking it through can pay off big timeOver the years, I have seen many web projects take off later than expected. I have had websites I had deemed ""dead in the water,"" only to see an influx of traffic hit the site later on.


Sometimes it's a question of continuing with the same effort, digging in and waiting out those initial months. Other times, you have to keep on experimenting and trying out new ways to drive traffic.For example, I have recently created a Facebook page for one of our sites. It has taken me months to figure out how to create content that page followers would find enticing enough to click through and visit the site.Going back to the site stats dashboard every day only to be disappointed by the lack of traffic wasn't easy. But I knew persistence was key in figuring out how to engage the attention of Facebook followers, so I kept it.And it worked. Facebook traffic from that page ended up increasing that site's traffic by more than 50%. Had I quit earlier, I would have missed out on an important asset for my business.


Knowing when to let goThe sad truth is most websites fail. As entrepreneurs, we must know when further efforts are futile. Ending a project at the right time enables pivoting energy into ideas with greater traction. However, giving up too easily results in missed opportunities. Determining the line between persistence and futility is key.So, how do you know when to quit? Sometimes, a good method to follow is to gather intelligence from others in your field. This information would serve as a benchmark for your project.For example, when I wasn't sure if my Facebook page would work, I contacted successful publishers in my network and discussed this with them. They provided me with important tips, but more importantly, they encouraged me to keep trying.And other times, you just have to trust your instincts as an entrepreneur. This gets easier as the years go by and you gain experience. And remember, it's okay to make mistakes until you reach that point. It's all part of the journey.


Related: How to Know When to Give Up, When to Pivot and When to PersistLessons for all entrepreneursAfter over 20 years as a web publisher, I have learned that success comes to those who persist. My most rewarding website journeys have been the ones that took years to gain traction.There were certainly moments when I wondered whether it was time to change course or give up entirely. Yet ultimately, my willingness to push through months or even years of uncertainty, regularly adapting my approaches without losing sight of the end goal, is what breathed life into my visions.My advice for fellow entrepreneurs would be this: Remember that business success is a marathon, not a sprint.Allow your ideas the time and care needed to find their footing. Not everything will succeed, but pulling the plug too swiftly guarantees failure.Perseverance in the face of doubt is the quality that will carry you across the invisible bridge. With a commitment to refining your efforts, visionary ideas can and will transform into thriving endeavors.

108,How Can Tech Leaders Help Shape a Better World? By Doing These 3 Things,"Dec 14, 2023",Lirone Glikman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-do-tech-leaders-have-power-in-shaping-a-better-future/464477,"
In a world where technology shapes every aspect of our lives, the role of tech leaders has never been more crucial. The choices they make, the values they live by and the principles they follow can shape not only the future of business, but the direction of our society.As their products and brands reach so many people, tech leaders have the power to influence the tech world, the business world and even the entire global community.Who is considered a ""tech leader?"" Anyone who's a founder or a senior manager in a small startup up to the biggest tech corporations who wishes to change people's lives through technology. This article explores the significance of tech leaders embracing ethical values and making choices that contribute to a better world.



Related: How to Navigate Ethical Considerations In Your Decision-Making1. Values conveyed through tech""Actions speak louder than words,"" as the saying goes, and this principle was vividly demonstrated during the 2023 Web Summit controversy. CEO Paddy Cosgrave made remarks concerning the West's support for Israel's right to defend itself against the terror group Hamas, in response to the Oct. 7 terror attack and the massacre of over a thousand civilians in their own homes. This event resulted in a profound loss of innocent lives. In response to Cosgrave's comments, several prominent sponsors, including Google, Amazon, Intel, Stripe, TikTok and other high-profile speakers chose to withdraw from the conference.


Their choice to depart sends a powerful message about the significant importance of ethical values. These actions by tech giants demonstrated a commitment to humanity, as well as an understanding of the long-term impact their actions will have on their brands, revenue and global influence. It showcased a sense of maturity and responsibility in the often capitalistic business world. Tech leaders should use this example as a guiding light to influence the global business world positively.Action steps for tech leaders:Establish clear policies that underline your commitment to ethical values and human rights.Create decision-making frameworks that prioritize ethical considerations in all business decisions, same as sponsorships and collaborations.Ensure transparent communication with stakeholders about your ethical policies and practices.Take swift action in situations that challenge your company's ethical values.2. Embracing notions you care aboutTech leaders, whether small or large, must realize that their choices and values can either contribute to the growth of a just and inclusive society or lead to discrimination and divisiveness. The business world has witnessed numerous instances where leaders' decisions have significantly impacted.For instance, Patagonia's founder, Yvon Chouinard, chose environmental activism for the company, known for its outdoor clothing and gear. Chouinard has prioritized sustainability, and the company actively works to reduce its environmental footprint.


Patagonia donates a percentage of its profits to grassroots environmental organizations and has even taken legal action against the U.S. government over environmental issues. This commitment to ethical and environmental values sets an example for other businesses to follow.Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, is a staunch advocate for diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. Under his leadership, Intel has set ambitious diversity goals and allocated significant resources to promote these values, both within the company and across the tech sector. Gelsinger's vision is best summarized by his statement: ""Diversity, equity and inclusion accelerate innovation, attract top talent, deepen employee engagement and improve the bottom line.""Related: Why This One Leadership Trait is Crucial for Tough Decisions — and 3 Ways to Cultivate ItAction steps for tech leaders:


Choose notions you care about and commit to leading by example of how you apply them in and out of your business activity.Implement periodic audits to evaluate your company's adherence to these notions and share these findings publicly to maintain transparency and accountability.Dedicate a portion of your profits to support your notions or related causes, enhancing your company's impact on society.Actively participate in community-oriented projects to strengthen your company's ties with society and demonstrate your commitment to ethical values.3. Be a guardian of ethical values in the artificial intelligence eraTech leaders bear the responsibility of shaping and adapting values in response to the ever-evolving tech landscape, especially through the era of AI, which can do much good — yet also much harm — if not managed properly.For example, take IBM's CEO Arvind Krishna, who focused on Responsible AI Development IBM and has emphasized the responsible development and use of artificial intelligence. The company, like many others these days, is actively engaged in creating AI systems that are transparent, fair and accountable. IBM's AI Fairness 360 toolkit and AI Ethics Board are initiatives that aim to address bias and promote ethical AI. Krishna's commitment to ethical AI aligns with the company's long-standing values, emphasizing the importance of responsible technology.Action steps for tech leaders:Develop ethical guidelines for AI to prioritize the creation of ethical frameworks for AI technologies.Allocate resources to research aimed at understanding and reducing biases in AI systems.Foster industry collaboration with other industry leaders to develop and promote industry-wide standards for responsible AI development.Related: Are You an Ethical Entrepreneur? Here's How Business Leaders Can Embrace Social and Environmental Responsibilities


Tech leaders' actions and decisions can have a ripple effect throughout the business world, inspiring a collective shift towards more ethical and responsible practices.In conclusion, tech leaders possess the power to shape a better world by setting an example of ethical values and contributing to a more just and inclusive society. By embracing values that prioritize humanity and long-term impact over short-term gain, tech leaders can pave the way for a brighter future where technology serves as a force for good rather than discrimination or divisiveness. The world is watching, and there is no better time for tech leaders to lead with their values.

109,Don't Waste Money on AI. Unlock Its True Potential By Treating It Like a New Hire.,"Dec 6, 2023",Mike Murchison,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/ai-disappointment-treating-it-like-an-employee-could-fix/465112,"
I call it the AI merry-go-round. So many businesses have embraced artificial intelligence tools as a way to improve productivity and performance. But as the weeks and months go by, the promise gives way to frustration. In a recent survey of tech executives, more than eight out of 10 execs said they're struggling to realize value from investments in AI and other new technology.Lurking behind this disappointment, however, is a critical misunderstanding — one that I see play out far too frequently. The No. 1 mistake companies make when they start working with AI? They set it and forget it.Most businesses treat a new AI agent as a tool that should just work ""out of the box"" and run on its own, like a fancy version of Microsoft Office or Photoshop. In reality, what companies need to do is approach AI less like a piece of software and more like any new employee.Onboard it. Set and monitor goals. Coach it. No different than any other staff member. Only then do you truly start to experience the benefits.



I know, calling AI an ""employee"" can sound like a stretch. We're talking about zeroes and ones, after all. But we're fast approaching a time when, for many managers, the first team member they oversee will be an AI.As the leader of a company that specializes in AI customer service, I've seen firsthand the return that businesses get by treating an AI agent like a member of the team — greater productivity, cost savings and happier team members, to name a few.


So, how do you treat AI like an employee? To me, it comes down to three steps.Related: AI Is Coming For Your Jobs — Anyone Who Says Otherwise Is In Denial. Here's How You Can Embrace AI to Avoid Being Left Behind.1. Onboard your new hireThe typical AI arrives at a company as a really keen intern, with solid foundational skills but new to the world of work and your industry. As a first step, that intern needs onboarding so they can start learning about the organization and their role.For most people, day one on the new job involves that obligatory slog through the company manual. No free pass for AI here. For an AI customer service agent, that reading might include absorbing every single article in your customer support center, studying your standard operating procedures and reviewing your marketing team's brand guidelines.


Whether it's a new email address or a Salesforce login, every employee needs to be connected with company systems — after all, that's how work actually gets done. The same goes for an AI agent. Real productivity happens when smart tools are fully integrated with other company platforms, like Zendesk for customer support ticketing or Shopify for processing ecommerce refunds.Meeting fellow team members for lunch or drinks after work is a rite of passage for new hires. With AI, making introductions is just as important. Often, this means sending out a link so everyone can chat with the new agent and start to understand its capabilities. I've noticed that people often even give their new AI workmate a name.2. Set goals and measure performanceAt the start of a new job, many of us can remember a boss taking us aside to explain, ""These are your goals and this is how you'll be measured against them"" — the classic objectives and key results (OKRs) talk. In the weeks and months ahead, those goals probably got tracked through regular check-ins and performance reviews.For an AI agent to thrive, it needs something comparable. Take the world of customer service. For an AI employee, the two goals that really matter are business impact and quality of customer experience. Both move up and to the right with what's known as automated resolution.


Automated resolution doesn't mean shunting callers off to bots, leaving them frustrated and annoyed. It means the customer actually gets what they're looking for — an accurate, safe, relevant experience that solves their problem.Likewise, it's important to continually ""check in"" and assess the quality of their interactions. Fortunately, AI can help here, too: Rather than sifting manually through recordings of calls, for example, the latest tools can gauge performance and suggest fixes nearly in real-time — less nerve-wracking than that quarterly performance review with the boss, and a lot more productive.Related: Is All This AI Hype Worth It? Here's What Leaders Can Do to Capitalize on AI3. Coach your AI employeeWe probably all fondly remember that one manager who took us under their wing in our early days. Coaching is a key step for bringing any new recruit into the fold. Traditionally, this might take the form of regular one-on-one meetings. For each of my direct reports, for instance, I keep a running document where we can flag things to discuss, highlight urgent topics and track the progress of their career.


With AI, it's much the same. Coaching and improvement are directly correlated. A manager coaches an AI agent on how to improve by sharing guidance. If an AI customer service agent achieves a 30% resolution rate in the first week, the manager might guide their AI agent to offer customers a new plan or better respond to refund issues.All of this might sound complicated and time-consuming. But good managers know that coaching even a single employee is time well spent. Now, imagine if that same effort could translate to improvements across hundreds or even thousands of employees, simultaneously. Plus, AI agents are getting better and better at self-learning — just like the most capable human employees — so managing them will become less prescriptive and more strategic.For any manager, there's that magic moment when you trust a new hire enough to start delegating things to them. Once they've come to you with three good ideas, you won't question them on the fourth. Ultimately, that's the goal with AI: building enough trust between the business and the agent that it's able to continually improve on its own.Related: Why Entrepreneurs Still Need To Leverage People (Even With AI)


The payoff for companies that make the effort to develop an AI employee? Consider these success stories. Retailer H&M reduced response times by up to 70% versus human employees. Renewable electricity provider Octopus Energy saw AI-drafted emails yield almost 20% higher customer happiness scores. And when Slush used an AI agent for its annual startup conference, it saw 55% more conversations with participants than the previous year.Ultimately, there's nothing like watching a bright intern grow into an outstanding team member who exceeds your expectations. For companies incorporating AI today, it's important to remember that fundamental HR truth — what you get out of your new employees is directly related to what you put in.
