1,How Close Is AI to Actually Stealing Your Dream Job?,"Apr 22, 2024",Ariel Shapira,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-close-is-ai-to-actually-stealing-my-job/472672,"
Consider you're a busy parent looking for ways to simplify your life. Putting your weekly schedule or grocery list into a generative AI chatbot like ChatGPT could be a saving grace, assisting in tasks like weekly meal planning or even helping your child with homework. This kind of automation via generative AI shows how it can be beneficial in streamlining a person's daily tasks and managing their affairs.But how dangerous is AI for the future of work?There has been a long-standing fear that machines will eventually replace human professions, alarming workers about the future of employment. Reports suggest that up to 300 million jobs could be replaced by AI, generating looming uncertainty over workforce dynamics and automation.



So, every working person's question is: Will AI take away my dream job? In short, the answer is likely yes, but it depends on what your dream job entails.However, it is worth highlighting the positive ways AI augments certain workforces. In high-stress or tedious positions, automation can enable workers to focus on more meaningful and high-value activities while relieving some job-related burdens.


While it's undeniable that AI will continue to reshape industries, there is substantial reason to believe it won't take over every job. Yes, AI does offer capabilities that lend a hand to productivity. However, its abilities have inherent limitations, especially falling short when replicating human intuition, empathy, and creativity.We also can't ignore that AI is limited to the information it's trained on. OpenAI touts ChatGPT's ability to pass numerous standardized tests, but did the model genuinely understand the tests, or was it just trained to reproduce the correct answers? AI machines are designed to ""think within the box,"" meaning that they can only function within the parameters of their given data, lacking a true creative or analytical nature that many professions require.Related: AI Is Taking Over These Freelancing Jobs the Most: ReportAI's thinking gapAI has been a game-changer for law by automating repetitive tasks, but integrating these technologies comes with challenges. The Law Society of British Columbia, for example, has warned lawyers about using AI automation to prepare legal documents, highlighting the potential ethical implications, biases, and glaring inaccuracies in materials produced by AI.


Likewise, the world of architecture is no stranger to technological advancements, with architects always looking for ways to harness innovation to improve their designs. But when AI tools can generate blueprints with relative ease, the fear of architects becoming redundant remains. While an AI model can create and analyze design options or predict how people can use a space, it cannot replace the vision and intuition an architect brings to their craft.Healthcare is another domain where complexities of human emotions and behaviors necessitate the expertise of trained professionals who offer empathy and deep understanding. AI can undoubtedly assist with administrative tasks like analyzing data or offering high-level insights, but it lacks the essential human qualities needed for effective counseling.AI enthusiasts in healthcare have long envisioned a future where doctors are aided by sophisticated algorithms, providing valuable suggestions to enhance patient care. However, despite a high level of optimism about physicians benefitting from AI, regulatory uncertainty and concerns about patient experience have slowed adoption. A recent study found that ChatGPT has a more than 80% diagnostic error rate when using AI in pediatric case diagnosis — an unacceptable figure that indicates no doctor could ever rely on its output now. But could the pieces of this puzzle come together to build physician and public confidence in AI?Related: Report: AI Will Take More Jobs Away from Women Than Men


Building trust with automationWhile successful AI implementation will likely positively impact patient outcomes, the consequences of errors would be severe. Even if a physician doesn't take a potentially harmful AI suggestion at face value, they will end up spending valuable time and resources rectifying the inaccuracies.AI's opaque decision-making processes also pose challenges for clinicians who cannot understand the rationale behind automated recommendations. This lack of transparency not only undermines trust in AI systems but complicates the process of integrating them into current healthcare infrastructures.That being said, some startups are working to make AI accountable in the field by rooting it in reality. Kahun, for instance, developed an evidence-based clinical reasoning engine for doctors that provides clinical decision support using explainable AI. It reasons like a physician and allows transparency in its output by providing evidence-based clinical insights cited in peer-reviewed medical literature alongside patient-specific information.Datapeople is another example of an AI-assisted tool designed to support professionals in the workforce. This program assists hiring teams in making recruitment decisions grounded in scientific principles and fairness.


Suppose professionals embraced the benefits of AI rather than fearing its encroachment on their jobs. In that case, they may be more inclined to integrate these tools into their practice, leading to potential improvements in the quality and efficiency of their work.Of course, not all jobs are safe from AI. But the truth is that many roles will always require human intervention, particularly those involving decision-making, emotional intelligence, and creativity. However, combining AI's strengths with human capabilities allows for an intertwined approach to problem-solving and innovation. By leveraging AI's efficiency with human intuition, we can continue to use automation to optimize tasks and address complex challenges more effectively.

Chatbots have become popular for businesses, offering real-time customer support and enhancing user experience. Predictive analytics — another key feature of artificial intelligence — helps marketers anticipate consumer behavior and trends, enabling them to make data-driven strategies. Customer segmentation, a crucial aspect of marketing, has been greatly improved by AI's ability to process big data and identify specific customer profiles for targeted campaigns.


What to expect: AI, once complex, is becoming more accessible, providing advanced capabilities for businesses. Expect ongoing advancements in chatbots, predictive analytics and customer segmentation, driving digital marketing toward a dynamic and personalized future filled with innovation.2. VR & AR for businessVirtual and augmented reality technologies are reshaping digital marketing by creating immersive brand experiences, engaging content and interactive campaigns that captivate audiences in new and innovative ways.These innovations have revolutionized the user experience in online advertising and e-commerce, offering a level of interactivity and personalization previously unseen.

21,"I Made Over $250,000 in One Year as a Content Creator — Here's Why I'll Never Rely on It as My Main Income","Mar 15, 2024",Andrea Casanova,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-i-made-250000-in-one-year-as-a-content-creator/470849,"
Since 2016, I've built a career by strategizing and producing content for creators, brands and influential figures alike. Back then, breaking into this industry carried a weighty price tag, both financially and creatively. In those early days, aspiring to become an influencer felt like striving for a rarefied form of celebrity.The learning curve was steep, and success demanded a meticulous curation of content. It was an era characterized by exclusivity.Then came TikTok. Suddenly, the barriers crumbled, and the entry point became accessible to all. With just a smartphone and an idea, anyone could step into the spotlight and share their creativity with the world. From overnight 'It Girls' to ordinary individuals transitioning from 9-5 jobs to full-time creators, TikTok has revolutionized how people achieve financial independence.



Personally, I found myself swept up in this wave of democratization, seizing the opportunity to share my knowledge and insights on marketing and entrepreneurship through my own content as ""latinapreneur"" and leveraging the platform to promote my services as a marketing strategist.Not only was I able to quickly scale my service-based business, but I also started working with some of my favorite brands. In 2023, I made over $250,000 in branded content, solidifying my position as a successful content creator with the ability to go full-time if I wanted.


However, this spontaneous rise to fame and fortune is not a universal experience for every content creator. In fact, even for seasoned creators, there's usually a drought season, with brand deals falling through and algorithm changes limiting content reach. I know the struggle all too well.Related: I Made $389,822 In One Year On YouTube. Here's How I Did ItOne moment, you're riding the virality wave, and the next, you're refreshing your email, hoping that a brand rep is not actually ghosting you. The truth is, in this realm, nothing is guaranteed. Deals can fall through, campaigns can be canceled, and budgets can dry up in an instant.So, to creatorpreneurs who are tired of being at the mercy of quarterly marketing budgets and enduring 90-days+ payment terms, here's a roadmap for transitioning from working with brands to becoming the brand.


1. Redefine your identityThe way you speak about yourself will dictate the opportunities you get. Think beyond your current role and envision where you want to be. Start branding yourself accordingly, making your platform an added advantage rather than the sole focus.Related: How to Create Consistent Branding That Sticks2. Mobilize your audienceWhile you might be tired of hearing about it, building an email list is crucial for owning your audience. If emails aren't your thing, consider communities like WhatsApp or Discord. Don't wait for another potential platform ban to take action.3. Identify winning conceptsWhat content of yours has generated social buzz? What are your followers constantly asking for? These are your winning concepts. Explore how you can further develop and monetize them.


Related: 4 Ways to Leverage TikTok for Startup Growth4. Start small, scale upYou don't have to jump straight into high-ticket offers. Begin with something simple, like lead magnets or low-ticket mini-courses. The goal is to create a product with minimal investment required. I recently launched a vision board mini-course, which generated over $8,000 in the first month. It took just four hours from ideation to publishing, including batching content for promotion.5. Expand your horizonsWhile creators often focus on diversifying content types and pivoting to long-form, I believe the conversation about diversification should be broader. For instance, I recently took on a role at an entertainment company as an executive and creative mind. This move has opened up opportunities for professional growth in a whole new arena.The creator economy may be booming, but questions linger about its long-term sustainability and fair compensation for influencers and content creators.


Most content seems to be positioning brand partnerships as this abundant and definitive marker of success in the creator economy. However, while brand partnerships can be lucrative and valuable, they are just one piece of the larger puzzle.It's time to broaden the conversation and recognize the multitude of pathways to success for content creators, emphasizing the importance of creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship beyond traditional brand collaborations.

50,The Secret Weapon for Crushing Workplace Communication Barriers,"Nov 23, 2023",Gleb Tsipursky,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/the-secret-weapon-for-crushing-workplace-communication/465100,"
As enterprises adapt to the fluid landscape of remote and in-office work, technology continues to push boundaries. Augmented Reality (AR) glasses, often dismissed as futuristic gadgets, are increasingly emerging as practical instruments reshaping the hybrid work environment. While Apple's Vision Pro is something many heard about, but few experienced, other effective AR glasses exist and are growing increasingly widespread. But how exactly are they transforming our approach to professional tasks and team dynamics?AR glasses: A tool for practical problem-solvingThe real utility of AR glasses in a professional context goes far beyond the wow factor. Let's consider the core functionalities that make these devices stand out. For instance, real-time transcription and translation services through AR can be a breakthrough in cross-border team communications. No longer do professionals need to be stymied by language barriers or the delays of after-the-fact translation.The ability to view and manipulate 3D models or technical designs remotely takes collaboration to the next level. Troubleshooting equipment issues becomes far easier when off-site experts can visually guide on-site technicians through annotations and instructions. AR glasses allow for a rapid transfer of institutional knowledge that can greatly benefit training, onboarding and team coordination.



Related: 3 Communication Strategies for Entrepreneurs Wanting To Improve Their TeamsA new paradigm for remote collaborationWhile video conferencing tools have been indispensable for remote work, they have their limitations. AR glasses bring an added layer of interactivity to virtual meetings. The ability to annotate in real-time, view digital whiteboards, and even bring in data visualizations during a discussion enhances collaboration to a level that mimics in-person interaction. Shared augmented spaces allow for a sense of presence that 2D video conferencing lacks.


This leads to more focused and productive sessions where everyone is quite literally on the same page. From brainstorming to concrete problem-solving, the value of shared visualization and annotation cannot be overstated.Seamless transition between physical and virtual workspacesThe beauty of AR glasses lies in their ability to adapt to varying work environments seamlessly. This isn't just about making remote work more effective but also about transforming the way we interact in physical offices. Through real-time reminders, spatial orientation within an office building, or even health monitoring, these devices can take several administrative burdens off professionals, allowing them to focus on high-value tasks. They become an extension of the mind, reducing the need for extraneous notetaking and information lookup.Meetings can take place spontaneously, without the logistical hassles of room bookings and video conferencing links. Whether you're at home or in a meeting room, the experience stays consistent. This fluid integration between physical and virtual workspaces is where the technology really shines.Enhancing human interaction in a digital worldThe power of AR goes beyond digital utility; it has the potential to enrich human relationships in professional settings. Imagine receiving real-time, non-verbal cues from your audience during a presentation, thereby allowing you to adapt your approach and engage more effectively. It combines the best of digital data analytics with the nuance of human interaction. Having everyone's name and position appear before you in a meeting fosters deeper professional bonds.


The ability to discreetly access information about someone you've just met can be invaluable for introverts. AR glasses allow users to become socially smarter, transcending limits like forgetfulness and lack of context that often constrain human interaction.Integrating AI for context-aware assistanceA crucial aspect that can elevate the efficacy of AR glasses is the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI). By incorporating AI, these devices can become context-aware, offering data and suggestions based on real-time situations, thus making the user experience more dynamic and responsive.From smart scheduling assistants to provide talking points before an important meeting, to safety alerts if you're working in hazardous environments, an AI system tailored to your organizational needs can drastically boost both productivity and wellbeing. As AI capabilities grow more advanced, the possibilities for intuitive assistance become profound.Managing ethical and security challengesWhile the possibilities are vast, it's crucial to think about the ethical and security implications of incorporating such advanced technology into daily work life. The ability to record and analyze data in real-time inevitably raises questions about privacy and data security that organizations must address proactively. Strict access controls, encryption and transparency about how augmented data will be used and stored are vital.


There are also cultural challenges to consider, as some employees may feel pressure to adopt AR glasses while others prefer minimal use. Clear organizational policies and training around consent, harassment and inclusion will be essential. Handled carefully, these technologies can be implemented ethically in a way that respects both privacy and professional growth.Related: 10 Ways to Reimagine Retail and Virtual Shopping Since COVID-19Case study of applying AR glassesIn my role at Disaster Avoidance Experts, I've had the opportunity to guide companies through the integration of cutting-edge technologies to enhance hybrid and remote work. One case study involves a multinational company grappling with the challenges of fractured communication across its diversified teams — remote, in-office and hybrid.The corporation's primary hurdles were not uncommon: geographic, linguistic and cultural differences that often create significant barriers to seamless communication, leading to a host of inefficiencies and collaborative deficiencies. Recognizing the need for a tailored solution, we initiated a detailed analysis of the communication barriers within the company, followed by the development of a robust set of standards and norms to facilitate better communication practices.


An integral part of the solution was the introduction of customized AR glasses, incorporating cutting-edge features like real-time transcription and translation. This feature alone dramatically lowered language barriers, facilitating instant and clear communication between team members who spoke different languages. Spatial computing features added to the AR glasses allowed for a shared, interactive three-dimensional space for team members to collaborate on complex tasks and projects, enhancing the collective problem-solving capabilities.The impact of implementing AR technology was significant and measurable. Within three months, the company experienced a 23% improvement in team collaboration and communication effectiveness. This metric was likely derived from meticulous pre and post-implementation surveys that measured various aspects of team communication and collaboration.The positive outcome of this case study is twofold: It demonstrates the direct benefits of integrating AR glasses into corporate communication strategies and highlights the importance of a holistic approach that includes training and the establishment of new operational guidelines. The result was not just a technological upgrade but a cultural transformation that empowered employees to maximize the potential of AR for improved collaboration and productivity.Embracing game-changing innovationAs we navigate the complexities of a hybrid work environment, AR glasses present a transformative avenue that professionals and enterprises can't afford to overlook. They offer more than just digital augmentation; they have the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate, collaborate, and even relate to each other in a professional setting.


Of course, no technology is a panacea. But used judiciously, augmented reality promises to enhance productivity and connectivity in groundbreaking ways. In a world that's always in flux, adapting and adopting these technological innovations is less a matter of choice and more a requirement for staying ahead. Much like the internet and smartphones, what seems novel today may soon be an integral part of how business gets done. The future is here, and with the right vision, augmented reality can empower professionals for whatever lies ahead.

54,Why the Future of Mobile App Development Will Live on the Web,"Nov 6, 2023",Solo Ceesay,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-the-future-of-mobile-app-development-will-live-on-the/464424,"
Apple's introduction of its mobile software development kit (SDK) and App Store laid the foundations for the largest technological renaissance of the late 2000s - early 2010s. It gave builders the tools to expose iPhone users to endless utility backed by the innovation of the broader tech community. We have since come a long way. The innovations we witnessed in the earliest days of the app revolution included an optical illusion that made it look like users were drinking a beer from their phones.A decade and a half later, apps incorporate optical character recognition technology that enables users to take pictures of signs written in Mandarin to translate them to their language of choice. This is technology that is breaking down barriers between languages, enabling everyone to communicate and navigate the world more efficiently.Somewhere down the line, Apple's dependency on this outsourced innovation to push broader adoption of its iPhone quickly morphed into an insurmountable vortex of power, enforceable to no end and questioned by no one. With the economic stranglehold that's enforced on all in-app payments to the unquantifiable risk of being de-platformed, we're now approaching the point where mobile app builders might be better served forging a path of their own on the web.



Related: Apple Just Announced the iPhone 15 — Here Are the Key New Features and How to PreorderWhy app stores matterAlthough Apple and Google's control over their app store marketplaces has given them outsized oversight regarding what and how innovators build, the app store at inception introduced countless benefits to both developers and end-users. Perhaps most impactful was that App Stores created the public forum necessary for any healthy marketplace to exist. End-users could go to one central location to download new apps and discover new experiences. On the flip side, developers had a public square where they could acquire and monetize end-users without setting up a unique marketplace to encourage downloads.


Because of the rules and regulations imposed by Apple and Google, app stores, perhaps unintentionally, serve as a screening mechanism for the final product an end-user may end up receiving. You could even go as far as saying the app store introduced what could be seen as the most credible peer-review process; any end-user can view and gauge the credibility of an application before ever downloading it, given reviews from end-users are made available to everyone. Whether it's assessing the build quality of the app itself or just downside protection against nefarious activity, it's hard to ignore that it's because of the app store's original mission that mobile app development is where it is today.Related: I Downloaded Every App of the Day for 1 Year. Here Are the Traits That Set Them Apart From the Rest.Why things went wrongBelieve it or not, Steve Jobs was originally against creating open-source development tools as he did not feel that Apple had the resources to properly police app developers. Instead, Jobs was of the opinion that mobile app development should live on the web. Ironically, a little more than a decade later, it's becoming more clear that with the emergence of new technologies and trends, centralized control over app stores has, at times, stifled growth. What's more, it goes without saying that for apps that are at all a threat to the core businesses of either Apple or Google, there's an added risk that that app may never be approved. Perhaps, one of the more apparent industries at risk includes blockchain and crypto.Apple and Google have strong footholds in the world of payments. Therefore, it's improbable to think that web3 developers won't be met with complications when it comes to pushing products in the general marketplace. Most recently, we saw the brief removal of the leading crypto wallet, MetaMask, earlier this month, which sent the broader web3 community into uproar. Crypto influencer and TikTok star Mason Versluis swiftly commented on X, stating that Apple ""DO NOT belong in Web3"" and that the measure was likely taken because ""[Apple] can't take 30% of every transaction.""


As with all major enterprises, pursuing growth and protection of market share will always reign supreme over innovation.The path less traveledIn 1983, during a company trip to New York, Jobs was photographed flipping off the IBM logo outside the building. At the time, Jobs longed for a world where anything is possible and innovation is constant. A world that shunned stagnation and rewarded those who think differently. Fast forward 40 years later, and it seems that even his camp needs reminding of its own core principles.It might take some time for developers to feel comfortable taking the path less traveled and building outside the constraints laid out for all of us by the powers that be. We're probably a few dozen good use cases away from any material revolution, but given a little inspection, it's quite easy to see the writing on the wall.

64,Apple Incurs $200 Billion Loss in 2 Days as China's iPhone Bans Shakes Stock Market Confidence,"Sep 8, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/apple-faces-200-billion-loss-as-china-extends-iphone-ban/458770,"
In just two days, Apple incurred losses of approximately $200 billion, currently making it the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, CNN reported. The losses come after the tech giant's shares plummeted by 2.9% on Thursday following reports that China intends to expand its ban on iPhones to include government-backed entities and corporations.On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that China issued a directive order in recent weeks, telling officials at central government agencies to refrain from using Apple iPhones and other foreign-branded devices for work or bringing them into the office, part of a broader effort to reduce reliance on foreign technology and enhance cybersecurity.One day later, news broke that the government bans would be extended to government-backed agencies and state companies such as oil firm PetroChina, which employs millions of workers, Bloomberg reported.



Related: People Poured $10 Billion Into Apple's New Savings Accounts — But Goldman Sachs Wants to Pull the PlugThe stock drop signals that investors may be concerned about Apple's ability to operate effectively in China, the world's second-largest economy, CNN added. The bans are particularly worrisome for Apple since China is its largest foreign market, and accounted for about one-fifth of its total revenue last year, according to an SEC filing.


Analysts at Bank of America noted that the possibility of an iPhone ban coincides with the launch of a new top-tier flagship smartphone by the Chinese manufacturer Huawei, describing the timing as ""interesting,"" per CNN.The new smartphone is also under investigation by the U.S. government to discern whether it found a way around American rules on exporting to create the new chip, with national security adviser Jake Sullivan saying in a press briefing on Tuesday that the U.S. needs ""more information about precisely its character and composition.""Related: Why Is the U.S. Threatening to Ban TikTok?

73,From Luxury to Necessity — Why Your Business Can't Afford to Be Without a Mobile App,"Jul 3, 2023",Omar El Bahr,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-having-a-mobile-app-for-your-business-is-crucial/454330,"
Back in the day, having a website was all the craze; businesses that had a website were the big players and people who could afford to pay a huge sum of money. Fast-forward 20 years or so, and a business that doesn't have a website is considered to be the odd one out.Anybody with a laptop, an internet connection and basic technical knowledge can hop on the internet and create a very good-looking website. Jumping ahead another couple of decades, you see Steve Jobs on the stage introducing the iPhone, and people go mad. In less than a year, the app store was launched with 500 apps, and the journey began.Apps are generally viewed as a luxurious addition to the business — a ""We'd love to have one! But we have more important things to focus on right now"" type of addition. But it's proving more and more essential for a business to have a mobile application. The global mobile app development market size was valued at USD $197.2 billion in 2021. It is expected to reach around USD $583.03 billion growing at a CAGR of 12.8% during the forecast period (2022–2030).



The substantial growth of the mobile app market signifies a clear trend: Mobile apps are not merely luxury additions for businesses anymore, but rather critical tools for reaching and interacting with customers. Ignoring this trend could mean missing out on potential opportunities.So, if you want to get your fair share of this huge sum, developing a mobile application is no longer optional.Related: 6 Benefits of Having a Mobile App for Your BusinessBoosting client interactions: The power of increased customer engagement through mobile appsHow often is it that you open your browser on your smartphone and go to a website as opposed to opening your smartphone and just tapping on an app? The contrast is stark.Everybody is on their phones nowadays, specifically on various apps, and your business app could easily be one of those apps. I'm not going to ramble on about how push notifications opt-in rates on the Android OS range from 49% to 95%, with medium equal to 81% — and on the iOS side, they range from 29% to 73%, with medium equal to 51%.But I am going to tell you how an app could easily deliver personalized content to each and every user depending on their behavior: Someone added something to a cart and left without buying it? Send them a reminder to complete the checkout. User X's birthday is today? Send them a complementary discount. Someone expressed interest on several occasions in your posts on the northern lights in Iceland? Send them a trip recommendation this September.


Elevating your brand: The impact of mobile apps on visibility and recognitionHaving a mobile app is essentially free advertising. Every smartphone out there is considered a potential free spot to advertise your business. Think about it this way: Every time your client opens their smartphone, they will see your application. It's like you're psychologically stamping your business in their minds, and what is the result? In the first instance that they require a service that you provide or a product that you sell, you will be the one that they contact.Another aspect of visibility and brand recognition is your brand's colors, designs and even tone of voice. The use of these elements within the app reinforces your brand in the client's mind.And last but not least, if your app contains modern features, such as an easy-to-use interface, a messenger for instant customer support, the ability to personalize content and timely push notifications, your app and your business will be held in high esteem for delivering quality service and being a customer-centric company.Related: Here's Exactly What You Need to Do to Launch a Mobile App


Today's business landscape has evolved to such an extent that having a mobile app has shifted from a luxury to a necessity. Mobile apps are essential in enhancing customer engagement. Since they are more readily accessible than websites on a smartphone, and with features like push notifications and personalization, businesses can deliver tailored content directly to their consumers, leading to increased engagement.Having a mobile app provides a significant boost to a brand's visibility and recognition. The continual presence of the app on a user's device, combined with the consistent use of brand colors, design and voice within the app, imprints the brand in the user's mind. Incorporating modern features and a user-friendly interface into the app also positions the business as a quality service provider, elevating its standing in the minds of consumers.In the evolving digital era, having a mobile app is not just an optional add-on but a crucial business tool that offers significant benefits in terms of customer engagement, brand visibility and market share.

77,3 Effective Strategies to Help You Generate Revenue From Your App,"Jun 5, 2023",Omar El Bahr,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-effective-strategies-to-make-money-from-your-app/451789,"
The app market is booming, and with millions of apps available in different app stores, it's important to ensure that yours stands out from the rest. But how can you make money from your app?In this article, we'll discuss three app monetization strategies that can help you generate revenue from your app. We will particularly emphasize in-app purchases as they are now considered one of the main monetization strategies, with in-app purchase examples in popular applications.Related: How to Make Money With Your App: 5 Monetization Strategies To Try



In-app advertisingWhen it comes to in-app advertising, there are several different types to choose from. This includes banner ads, interstitial ads and native ads. However, it's important to consider using non-intrusive ads to maintain a positive user experience. These types of ads can include sponsored content such as texts, photos or videos. The content you post in your ad campaign must be visually appealing but not aggravating so that it doesn't cause any cases of user frustration. It is also important that you make sure that the ad you choose fits seamlessly within the app's interface and looks neat.Types of in-app advertising1. Banner ads:


Banner ads are the most common type of in-app advertising. It usually comes in a rectangular form and is placed at either the top or bottom of the screen. A banner ad usually doesn't contain many words or text; it depends instead on pictures and visuals that are able to deliver the ad's value.2. Native ads:Native ads function exactly as their name suggests. They are employed to be viewed natively so as to match and blend in with the app's interface. One of the benefits of native ads is that they tend to perform better than traditional banner ads. Users are more likely to interact with a native ad because it doesn't feel like an advertisement. Native ads are thought to be the least intrusive type of ads. They are also very efficient, as you can control where they appear to users and how frequently.3. Interstitial ads:


Interstitial ads are a common form of in-app advertising. They are full-screen ads that appear at natural breaks in the user's flow, such as when transitioning between different sections of an app. Unlike banner ads, which are small and can be easily ignored, interstitial ads are highly visible and require the user to interact with them in some way, either by clicking on the ad or by dismissing it. While interstitial ads can be effective at generating revenue for app developers, they can also be a source of frustration for users if they are too frequent or disruptive. To avoid this, developers need to carefully balance the frequency and placement of interstitial ads.Related: How Can App Makers Improve Revenue and Keep Users Engaged?Subscription modelsSubscription models have become increasingly popular among app developers as a monetization strategy for their services. These subscription models are designed to create a steady stream of recurring revenue for developers, enabling them to provide consistent updates and improvements to their apps. There are several different types of subscription models that developers can choose from, each with its own unique approach to generating revenue.Types of subscription models1. Freemium model:


The first and most popular model is the freemium model. With the freemium model, users can download and use the app for free, but they are limited in terms of features and functionality. To unlock the full range of features, users must pay for a subscription. An example of an app that uses such a model is Spotify. Spotify allows all users to access an unlimited library of music and podcasts. However, users of the free plan have some limited functionalities, such as limited skips per playlist and interrupting ads between songs.2. Tiered model:Another type is the tiered subscription model. This model offers users different levels of access to the app based on how much they pay. For example, a basic subscription might provide access to the app's core features. Meanwhile, a premium subscription might offer additional functionality and perks. A popular app that uses such a model is Flo.Related: Do You Want To Monetize Your App? Here's What You Need To Consider


In-app purchasesOne of the most popular and effective app monetization strategies nowadays is in-app purchases. This strategy has been gaining recognition and dominating the market. It is commonly used in ecommerce apps and gaming apps. In-app purchases are additional features or content that users can buy within an app. They can include virtual goods, additional or premium content, or extra functionality. In-app purchases are typically made through a user's app store account. They can purchase whatever the app's currency is and use it around the app for whatever they need.In-app purchases are a popular way for app developers to monetize their products. By offering additional features, content or functionality, developers can provide a high-quality user experience while generating revenue. Developers should make the costs and benefits of in-app purchases clear to customers while also providing them with relevant and useful solutions.In-app purchase examplesThere are several different types of in-app purchases that app developers can offer to their users. Here are a few in-app purchase examples:1. Consumables:


Consumables are virtual goods that users can use or consume. For example, in a game, a consumable might be a virtual currency that can be used to purchase items or upgrades within the game. Once the currency has been used up, the user must purchase more to continue using it.2. Non-consumables:Non-consumables are virtual goods that do not expire or get used up. For example, in a productivity app, a non-consumable in-app purchase might be a premium feature that unlocks additional functionality.3. Subscriptions:


Subscriptions are another in-app purchase example that provides users with access to premium content or features for a set period of time. For example, a news app like Forbes or BBC News might offer a subscription that provides access to exclusive articles. This subscription can be non-renewable or auto-renewable.Creating a successful app is not just about developing a great one; it's also about finding effective ways to monetize it. In-app advertising, in-app purchases, and the subscription model are three app monetization strategies that can help you generate revenue from your app. It's important to choose the strategy that best fits your app and your target audience.

78,How to Combat Robocalls and Scammers With Anti-Call Technology,"Jun 5, 2023",Scott Straub,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-use-new-technology-to-combat-phone-scammers/452540,"
In 2019, Congress passed the TRACED Act to give the Federal Communications Committee (FCC) additional tools to combat robocalls. It's a problem plaguing public sector call centers and constituents; people still receive millions of robocalls (automated or pre-recorded messages) and scam calls (made by criminals) every year in the U.S.It is incumbent that government agencies utilize the technological tools available today to combat fraudulent, phone-related activity, boosting public trust and the constituent experience.The not-so-smartphone problemThe household landline is steadily declining; roughly one-third (37%) of homes still have one. In an incredible technological revolution, smartphones have become the preferred telephone device for most homes and individuals. Smartphones are powerful, but their ability to root out scam calls is still decidedly inefficient. Today's smartphones don't pull caller ID data from a centralized registry of phone numbers. Instead, they rely on information from your contact list to identify incoming calls. Essentially, you tell your phone who's calling — not the other way around.



Most people don't realize cell phones lack a caller ID, causing problems for public agencies trying to reach beneficiaries or constituents. To deal with the over 3 billion spam calls received per month, most people simply ignore numbers they don't recognize.Due to this breakdown in public trust, many government agencies won't initiate contact via phone. Rather, they'll return calls from consumers who request help. However, if a recipient misses a call, they're faced with the daunting prospect of returning it — only to navigate endless menus and jump through hoops to reach a live person on the other end. The result is a further breakdown in trust and loss of confidence in the efficacy of public sector call centers.


Phone service providers have developed technical ways to alleviate the problem of eroded trust. Many major providers employ a certification system for phone numbers registered to customers. This development resulted from the STIR/SHAKEN caller identification framework set forth by Neustar Management and mandated by the FCC as part of the TRACED Act.With caller ID authentication standards like STIR/SHAKEN, phone service providers verify a caller's actual number matches the caller ID information, enabling higher trust for the receiver of the call. It's a small step, but it indicates how the public sector can better leverage technological tools to solve these problems. Unfortunately, the scammers have a vote in this process too, and they're not going away without a fight.Related: Rising AI Threat Sounds Like Your Loved One on the Phone — But It's Not Really ThemRobocalling isn't going anywhereRobocalls and scam calls aren't subsiding anytime soon — they're too lucrative for the fraudsters who perpetrate them. In 2021, fraudulent calls cost Americans over $29 billion. Without positive identification in the form of verified caller ID, the public is never sure they're talking to a legitimate service. The result is a concerning loss of trust in government call centers.


Fraud doesn't stop at government call centers. Law enforcement agencies have seen an alarming jump in a spoofing technique known as swatting. The basic concept is the same, but the agency is the initial victim of the scam — with potentially deadly consequences for those whom agencies are charged with protecting.Many government call centers have tried to combat spoofing practices by eliminating initial contact with customers via telephone, but millions of people fall for these scams every year. Some agencies send public reminders that they won't call about an issue, but scammers make their calls convincing enough to succeed.Related: How To Avoid Spam Calls And Focus On Important OnesHow technology can helpAll is not lost. Scam calls are a technical problem that requires a technical solution. There are many tools public agencies and private organizations can implement to rebuild trust with consumers. One example is emerging technology in providing better caller ID by applying a token to verified phone numbers or displaying a branded logo on the receiver's phone. Services like this allow organizations to ensure outbound calls aren't mislabeled as spam calls or blocked by the telephony system and that they actually originate from the correct entity.


It's similar to your fingerprint: difficult to fake and uniquely tied to your identity. Calls can be certified as they're routed by verifying the phone number belongs to the person (or call center) placing the call.Major cell phone providers often use each other's databases as trusted sources, too, so this tool isn't limited to a single provider. It can also stop spoofed outbound calls at the source and identify likely fraudulent calls so people can screen them appropriately.Another emerging caller ID technology has worked remarkably well for the Virginia Department of Health (VDH). During the height of COVID-19, the VDH reached out to patients and close contacts daily. When only an unidentified phone number was displayed, many calls went unanswered, wasting the department's time and resources.When the VDH branded the calls as they displayed on recipients' phone screens, presenting the department's logo and name on the recipient's smartphone, its first-time answer rate jumped 105% almost immediately.


Related: This Saas-Based Startup Is Disrupting Call Centre Market With AI-Based Voice BotsTools to repair trustScammers are constantly innovating, but the technology sector innovates alongside them. Call carriers, third-party service providers and the federal government continue to develop new anti-spoofing tools, processes and policies to protect consumers — and public sector agencies must be sure to use them. Through constant vigilance, they can combat fraudulent phone calls, bolster public trust and improve the customer service experience.

83,"Meet Naqi, the Company That's Making Hands-Free, Voice-Free Device Control a Reality","May 11, 2023",StackCommerce,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/meet-the-company-thats-making-hands-free-voice-free/451926,"
The next frontier of digital technology is finding a better way to interact and control the countless digital devices around us.We've already seen the beginnings of this with digital voice assistants, but the potential here is much bigger. A new technology, called Naqi, can now control digital devices without using hands, voice, or even screens.Their patented technology goes into an earbud and creates an invisible user interface that lets people control their devices with imperceptible movements called microgestures, like a blink of an eye or tilt of your head. If you see it in action, you might think that person has a superpower to control the machines around them.



Other companies valued at billions of dollars have been trying to achieve the same result using brain implants. That has earned big players in the space billion-dollar valuations even though their technology is still under development and their traction to market has remained fairly stagnant.But Naqi's simple earbuds are already doing the same thing — without brain surgery. And unlike large competitors in the space, which have yet to be tested on humans, Naqi is already allowing people to control robots, computers, video games, wheelchairs and more.


Everyday investors have the opportunity to own shares in Naqi.Here is how this company is able to give people hands-free, voice-free, screen-free control over their tech without implants, and why you should consider investing before the opportunity ends on 6/30.Naqi is a new era of technology.A lightbulb went off in 2013, when David Segal learned about the prosthetic limbs used by soldiers returning from war. He was inspired to use the potential of biosensors to help them interface with the devices around them. He invented a method to detect ""microgestures"" which are nearly-invisible movements that people make (like blinking or nodding your head, but sometimes even less noticeable) and turn them into commands.This gave Segal an idea: Why not extend the same capability beyond prosthetics? He then saw an opportunity to apply it to something people use every day: a way of reading facial microgestures and head movements using earbuds equipped with an array of sensors. Naqi was born, giving people the ability to control digital devices without having to touch or speak to them, or even use a computer screen.


The company is revolutionizing the way we interact with our digital devices and paving the way for a new era of hands-free, voice-free and screen-free technology.And they are already on a roll…Turning heads with 22 patents.Naqi's potential extends to several sectors, but due to Segal's interest in injured veterans, accessibility became his initial focus when the company launched in 2020.The team at Naqi says that one of the world's leading global mobility manufacturers has integrated Naqi into their wheelchairs, enabling people to control their chairs without a mouse, joystick or sip and puff straw technology. This is a groundbreaking development that gives greater autonomy to wheelchair users, allowing them to move around more freely and independently.


But that was only the start. Naqi has become the wearable tech that controls just about everything in the digital world.Harrisburg University's national e-sports champions are testing Naqi with video games, stretching the virtual and augmented reality capabilities of the device. It promises to change how we play video games — just look at the screen and control what you want.Naqi has also shown that commercial robots can be operated using their earbuds, opening exciting opportunities in the automation field. Imagine just looking at a robot and, with a blink of an eye making it do what you want. That's what Naqi does.A major auto parts manufacturer is exploring how Naqi's technology can be used in transportation, as well as aerospace and national security, the company says.


So far, Naqi has acquired 22 patents across the U.S., EU, Israel, Hong Kong, and more. These cover both the earbud and the user interface, and they could serve as strong barriers against any competition looking to create the same tools.Given Naqi's traction so far, and all of its potential applications in the future, Naqi's addressable market is enormous. Naqi's $2.46T market.The biggest representation of Naqi's addressable market is the Internet of Things (IoT). This is a rapidly-growing field projected to reach $2.46 trillion by 2029 – and about 414% growth over the next decade.IoT includes any devices that can be connected to the Internet (and therefore Naqi's wearables), including smartphones, TVs, cars, and more. The closer the world moves toward running on entire digital ecosystems, the greater the demand will be for a device like Naqi's that enables them to control their entire world.


Assisted mobility on its own is a $20 billion sector of that industry.Meanwhile, Naqi's potential video game market is worth $195 billion, with e-sports growing especially fast.This technology is all about more powerful connections between people and the machines that make our life better, allowing for more efficiency, convenience, and safety. And Naqi's earbuds offer a powerful tool to make it more accessible and user-friendly.And our readers can now join this company in paving the way for a better-connected future.


How to become a Naqi investor.The most obvious benefit to investing in new technology that promises disruption is that you can potentially make a significant return on your investment if the company takes off. But Naqi's investment opportunity is set apart for a couple of other key reasons as well.For one, Naqi says it is making history as one of the only companies giving people hands-free, voice-free, and screen-free control over their technology. The connected devices market is inevitably growing and ready to consume other markets, and Naqi could play a huge role in that as well as the AR/VR and Metaverse sectorsAnother major factor is that Naqi is a more affordable and accessible option for consumers than the competition. In other words, since surgical implants are expensive and pose a potential risk, Naqi has far greater potential to scale with a technology that can be given to partners to put into a simple-fit earbud that can be easily removed. No brain surgery needed!Naqi is poised to transform gaming, esports, accessibility, robotic control, smart homes and much more in everyday life. They are giving our readers a chance to become shareholders in their company as they do it.

84,This AI-Powered Feeder Takes Ridiculously Cool Photos of Birds in Your Backyard,"May 9, 2023",Jonathan Small,https://www.entrepreneur.com/green-entrepreneur/this-ai-powered-feeder-takes-selfies-of-birds-in-your/451841,"
A few years ago, a hardware designer named Kyle Buzzard watched a viral video of a seagull that had stolen a GoPro and taken photos of itself looking into the camera.""That started wonder and the questions, how can we do that and automate it?"" recalls Buzzard, who incidentally has the perfect name for his avian interests.Buzzard and his associates, Franci Zidar and Ziga Vrtacic, envisioned an AI-powered smart bird feeder that could identify and snap photos of 1000 bird species that might visit your backyard.



But there were two immediate hurdles they had to overcome.""First, to try and get up close and personal high-quality images of birds without disturbing them,"" explains Buzzard. ""Second, to be able to recognize the species easily. Both are very challenging to do and have the bird remain in place long enough. How many times have you reached for your camera or bird book only for the feathered friend to have flown off?""


Buzzard's design pedigree helped them accomplish their goals.Bird Buddy launched its first Kickstarter in November 2020, raising $5 million, which according to the company, put them in the top 1% of all Kickstarter campaigns and was the most-funded campaign in Kickstarter's gadget category.The result was an ingenious bird feeder that is sort of PokemonGo meets the Ring. How it works: A feathered friend flies to the feeder, and an AI-powered camera notifies you, identifies the species, takes photos, and organizes them into a collection.Related: People Keep Licking a Rare Toad in U.S. National Parks. The Reason Is a Real Trip.Nature callsBuzzard hopes the device helps people connect back to nature. ""Unfortunately, many of us have developed a passive relationship with the natural world,"" he says. With technology capturing most of our attention, we fail to look up and see the beauty surrounding us. He hopes Bird Buddy can help solve that by putting the natural world in the palm of your hands.

85,Google Just Unveiled Its New Phone — and It Might Take You Back to the '90s,"May 5, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/google-just-unveiled-its-new-90s-reminiscent-phone/451066,"
With its product launch only a few days away, Google revealed a sneak peek of its first-ever foldable smartphone.That's right: In a video posted to YouTube and Twitter, the company showed off the Pixel Fold phone with a vertical hinge that can be opened into a tablet-like format, CNN Business reported.Related: AI 'Godfather' Quits His Job at Google Warning of 'Scary' OutcomesFlip phones have been making a comeback in recent years. Samsung is already in the foldable phone game — it released two new fourth-generation flip models last year — and Apple's been rumored to be making one of its own, though that's never been confirmed, per CNET.At Google's annual developer conference at its Mountain View, California headquarters next week, the company is also expected to present a Pixel 7a budget phone, its newest Android operating system and developments to its AI-powered Bard chatbot.The Pixel Fold is expected to start at $1,700, though that— (and the phone's specs) — have yet to be confirmed either.Related: Ex-Google Employee Brutally Documents Mass Layoffs | EntrepreneurOverall, foldable devices account for just 1% of smartphone shipments, but their high price points mean major revenue: Though they're anticipated to make up just 4% of the market by 2027, that could amount to a $42 billion segment, according to Strategy Analytics and IDC data reported by Bloomberg.

86,Microsoft Wants to Make It Easier For You To Repair Your Devices. Here's Why That's a Big Deal.,"May 4, 2023",Maddie Stone,https://www.entrepreneur.com/green-entrepreneur/microsoft-wants-to-make-it-easier-for-you-to-repair-your/451025,"
In March, Irene Plenefisch, a senior director of government affairs at Microsoft, sent an email to the eight members of the Washington State Senate's Environment, Energy, and Technology Committee, which was about to hold a hearing to discuss a bill intended to facilitate the repair of consumer electronics.Typically, when consumer tech companies reach out to lawmakers concerning right-to-repair bills — which seek to make it easier for people to fix their devices, thus saving money and reducing electronic waste — it's because they want them killed.Plenefisch, however, wanted the committee to know that Microsoft, which is headquartered in Redmond, Washington, was on board with this one, which had already passed the Washington House.



""I am writing to state Microsoft's support for E2SHB 1392,"" also known as the Fair Repair Act, Plenefisch wrote in an email to the committee. ""This bill fairly balances the interests of manufacturers, customers, and independent repair shops and, in doing so, will provide more options for consumer device repair.""The Fair Repair Act stalled out a week later due to opposition from all three Republicans on the committee and Senator Lisa Wellman, a Democrat, and former Apple executive. (Apple frequently lobbies against right-to-repair bills, and during a hearing, Wellman defended the iPhone maker's position that it is already doing enough on repair.) But despite the bill's failure to launch this year, repair advocates say Microsoft's support — a notable first for a major U.S. tech company — is bringing other manufacturers to the table to negotiate the details of other right-to-repair bills for the first time.


""We are in the middle of more conversations with manufacturers being way more cooperative than before,"" Nathan Proctor, who heads the U.S. Public Research Interest Group's right-to-repair campaign, told Grist. ""And I think Microsoft's leadership and willingness to be first created that opportunity.""Across a wide range of sectors, from consumer electronics to farm equipment, manufacturers attempt to monopolize the repair of their devices by restricting access to spare parts, repair tools, and technical documentation. While manufacturers often claim that controlling the repair process limits cybersecurity and safety risks, they also financially benefit when consumers are forced to take their devices back to the manufacturer or upgrade due to limited repair options.Related: I Worked Closely With Bill Gates for 8 Years as an Executive at Microsoft. Here Are the 3 Lessons He Taught Me That I'll Never Forget.Why right to repair is better for the environmentRight-to-repair bills would compel manufactures to make spare parts and information available to everyone. Proponents argue that making repair more accessible will allow consumers to use older products for longer, saving them money and reducing the environmental impact of technology, including both electronic waste and the carbon emissions associated with manufacturing new products.


But despite dozens of state legislatures taking up right-to-repair bills in recent years, very few of those bills have passed due to staunch opposition from device makers and the trade associations representing them. New York state passed the first electronics right-to-repair law in the country last year, but before the governor signed it, tech lobbyists convinced her to water it down through a series of revisions.Like other consumer tech giants, Microsoft has historically fought right-to-repair bills while restricting access to spare parts, tools, and repair documentation to its network of ""authorized"" repair partners. In 2019, the company even helped kill a repair bill in Washington state. But in recent years the company has started changing its tune on the issue. In 2021, following pressure from shareholders, Microsoft agreed to take steps to facilitate the repair of its devices — a first for a U.S. company. Microsoft followed through on the agreement by expanding access to spare parts and service tools, including through a partnership with the repair guide site iFixit. The tech giant also commissioned a study that found repairing Microsoft products instead of replacing them can dramatically reduce both waste and carbon emissions.Microsoft has also started engaging more cooperatively with lawmakers over right-to-repair bills. In late 2021 and 2022, the company met with legislators in both Washington and New York to discuss each state's respective right-to-repair bill. In both cases, lawmakers and advocates involved in the bill negotiations described the meetings as productive. When the Washington state House introduced an electronics right-to-repair bill in January 2022, Microsoft's official position on it was neutral — something that state representative and bill sponsor Mia Gregerson, a Democrat, called ""a really big step forward"" at a committee hearing.Despite Microsoft's neutrality, last year's right-to-repair bill failed to pass the House amid opposition from groups like the Consumer Technology Association, a trade association representing numerous electronics manufacturers. Later that year, though, the right-to-repair movement scored some big wins. In June 2022, Colorado's governor signed the nation's first right-to-repair law, focused on wheelchairs. The very next day, New York's legislature passed the bill that would later become the nation's first electronics right-to-repair law.


When Washington lawmakers revived their right-to-repair bill for the 2023 legislative cycle, Microsoft once again came to the negotiating table. From state senator and bill sponsor Joe Nguyen's perspective, Microsoft's view was, ""We see this coming, we'd rather be part of the conversation than outside. And we want to make sure it is done in a thoughtful way.""Proctor, whose organization was also involved in negotiating the Washington bill, said that Microsoft had a few specific requests, including that the bill require repair shops to possess a third-party technical certification and carry insurance. It was also important to Microsoft that the bill only cover products manufactured after the bill's implementation date, and that manufacturers be required to provide the public only the same parts and documents that their authorized repair providers already receive. Some of the company's requests, Proctor said, were ""tough"" for advocates to concede on. ""But we did, because we thought what they were doing was in good faith.""In early March, just before the Fair Repair Act was put to a vote in the House, Microsoft decided to support it.""Microsoft has consistently supported expanding safe, reliable, and sustainable options for consumer device repair,"" Plenefisch told Grist in an emailed statement. ""We have, in the past, opposed specific pieces of legislation that did not fairly balance the interests of manufacturers, customers, and independent repair shops in achieving this goal. HB 1392, as considered on the House floor, achieved this balance.""


While the bill cleared the House by a vote of 58 to 38, it faced an uphill battle in the Senate, where either Wellman or one of the bill's Republican opponents on the Environment, Energy, and Technology Committee would have had to change their mind for the Fair Repair Act to move forward. Microsoft representatives held meetings with ""several legislators,"" Plenefisch said, ""to urge support for HB 1392.""""That's probably the first time any major company has been like, 'This is not bad,'"" Nguyen said. ""It certainly helped shift the tone.""Microsoft's engagement appears to have shifted the tone beyond Washington state as well. As other manufacturers became aware that the company was sitting down with lawmakers and repair advocates, ""they realized they couldn't just ignore us,"" Proctor said. His organization has since held meetings about proposed right-to-repair legislation in Minnesota with the Consumer Technology Association and TechNet, two large trade associations that frequently lobby against right-to-repair bills and rarely sit down with advocates.""A lot of conversations have been quite productive"" around the Minnesota bill, Proctor said. TechNet declined to comment on negotiations regarding the Minnesota right-to-repair bill, or whether Microsoft's support for a bill in Washington has impacted its engagement strategy. The Consumer Technology Association shared letters it sent to legislators outlining its reasons for opposing the bills in Washington and Minnesota, but it also declined to comment on specific meetings or on Microsoft.


While Minnesota's right-to-repair bill is still making its way through committees in the House and Senate, in Washington state, the Fair Repair Act's opponents were ultimately unmoved by Microsoft's support. Senator Drew MacEwen, one of the Republicans on the Energy, Environment, and Technology Committee who opposed the bill, said that Microsoft called his office to tell him the company supported the Fair Repair Act.""I asked why after years of opposition, and they said it was based on customer feedback,"" MacEwen told Grist. But that wasn't enough to convince MacEwen, who sees device repairability as a ""business choice,"" to vote yes.""Ultimately, I do believe there is a compromise path that can be reached but will take a lot more work,"" MacEwen said.Washington state representative and bill sponsor Mia Gregerson wonders if Microsoft could have had a greater impact by testifying publicly in support of the bill. While Gregerson credits the company with helping right-to-repair get further than ever in her state this year, Microsoft's support was entirely behind the scenes.


""They did a lot of meetings,"" Gregerson said. ""But if you're going to be first in the nation on this, you've got to do more.""Microsoft declined to say why it didn't testify in support of the Fair Repair Act, or whether that was a mistake. The company also didn't say whether it would support future iterations of the Washington state bill, or other state right-to-repair bills.But it signaled to Grist that it might. And in doing so, Microsoft appears to have taken its next small step out of the shadows.""We encourage all lawmakers considering right-to-repair legislation to look at HB 1392 as a model going forward due to its balanced approach,"" Plenefisch said.

This story originally appeared on Readwrite.com and Calendar. We live in a world where online calendars are a part of our daily lives. No matter how diligently you use an online calendar, you're still benefiting from it. For instance, you might be reminded to send a birthday card online, schedule events or business meetings, or block out your day.It is important to realize that online calendars are still a relatively new productivity tool that is rapidly developing. As a matter of fact, your online calendar is becoming more of a personal assistant that will advise you on how to spend your time best. But, there is so much more than calendars are capable of in the future, such as the following predictions and trends.



Solving scheduling problems""So far, it looks like the reinvention of the calendar will happen in two phases,"" notes David Pierce for Protocol. ""First, users will get access to a new set of tools, integrated with Google and Outlook calendars but opening up lots of new features.""After that, calendars will be turned into a standalone service if they prove successful. In the same way, Slack is to email, Zoom is to a desk phone, and Airtable is to Excel, all these companies hope to be to your Outlook calendar, he added. ""Time is money, all these calendar companies will argue to investors and customers, and we'll save you both.""


Related: 7 Tips for Managing Your Schedule Like a ProWe're only at the beginning of the first phase and still attacking the first problem worth solving: scheduling. How about one solution? It's as simple as speeding up the process.For example, Superhuman scans emails for dates like ""next Friday"" and lets users send invitations accordingly. Scheduling is, in essence, an email problem. As a result, it should be available as an email solution as well. In a similar vein, Vimcal, often referred to as ""Superhuman for calendars,"" is a new app that focuses on speed, and CEO John Li said most people want meeting creation to happen lightning fast.Calendar is another option if you want to speed up the scheduling process. The Find a Time feature in Calendar allows you to schedule with others quickly. Using multiple calendar users, create events based on their availability and see when they are busy.


Chatbots will be able to organize your meetingsProfessional life has become quite complicated following the pandemic. For example, working remotely from home isn't as straightforward as it seems. Many of us find it hard to keep up with the increasing demands on our time.At the same time, the number of American employees working remotely is expected to increase to 36.2 million by 2025. So, we will have to get used to these new working conditions.The majority of the time, work involves scheduling meetings and being on time. To make your life easier, you can use a chatbot to help you set up meetings. Chatbots, such as SharePoint calendars, can still be useful as an additional meeting planning tool.Related: Chatbots, their positive impact and how to take advantage of the customer experience


You can also schedule meetings using Messagely or TARS. It is also beneficial to manage teams remotely and track their time by using a time tracker. It is possible to balance work and life with the help of these chatbots.Chatbots and software powered by artificial intelligence also show great promise for helping businesses become more productive and profitable. For example, a phone validator app checks the validity, type of line, network carrier, location, etc., of the line to improve productivity.These chatbots can handle scheduling and organizing meetings while you focus on other important tasks.Calendars will become even more intelligentSmart or intelligent calendars collect every schedule or action to boost productivity and simplify management using intelligence or automation. Using an intelligent calendar will help you establish boundaries between your personal and professional life.


As well as blocking time, you can reduce the time spent on certain tasks manually. Your ideal workweek can be automatically scheduled and managed using a smart calendar. Besides scheduling tasks, you can use an intelligent calendar to increase efficiency and reduce human dependency.It goes without saying that an intelligent calendar can enhance productivity and save you time. In an effort to streamline meetings, increase event aggregation, and reduce time wastage, intelligent calendars have become a necessity due to the following:Notes can be jotted down in the calendar to help keep track of important information and deadlines.Synchronize your personal and work calendars.It is possible to get information from smart notes that will help you determine what actions to take.Organizes all your meeting invitationsFrom the app, you can get relevant information about the weather, traffic, and drive times.With Motion, for example, you can always know what to do next. It creates a day-by-day schedule based on meetings, giving you a minute-by-minute overview. Trevor AI is another AI calendar app that helps you organize your day by keeping track of your lists of tasks to do; this AI calendar app puts one task at a time so that you work more efficiently.Furthermore, Calendar can provide smart suggestions on when, where, and who to invite when scheduling meetings. It's not magic. With artificial intelligence and machine learning, Calendar can create a unique scheduling experience for you.


Finally, intelligent calendars can help you become less distracted and more productiveIf you block out 8:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. in your calendar for undisturbed work, quiet time is from 8:30 am to 11:30 am. Your calendar will automatically block out this time instead of creating a recurring event.During this time, you may find your calendar automatically disables distractions like email and social media notifications. It's possible that your calendar will determine when you're most productive as well. As such, if you fade out every 50 minutes, you'll be reminded to stretch and take a break.And, that's just scratching the surface. Considering that the size of the global artificial intelligence market was $136.55 billion in 2022 and is projected to increase by 37.3% from 2023 to 2030, calendars will continue to become more and more intelligent.The AR calendar will bring your calendar to lifeIt's true that some companies have been using augmented reality (AR) to make plain old paper calendars more interactive for the past several years.


As an example, once you download an app, you just need to point your phone at a calendar image and tap the screen. Using AR, Tengo Interactive created an airport calendar that provided users with a behind-the-scenes view. Other companies have created wall calendars that utilize augmented reality to explain their entire product range.By 2028, the AR market is expected to reach $97.76 billion. Due to this, augmented reality calendars and marketing opportunities will continue to expand rapidly.By using this technology, you will be able to walk through a property in virtual reality. From there, you might be able to make an appointment with the realtor if you like what you see.If you are planning a trip to the Grand Canyon, you could experience the destination before booking the trip. Or, you could view local restaurants, salons, or museums. You then have the option to make reservations or book tickets and have them automatically added to your calendar.


Use ChatGPT prompts to manage your timeOn November 30, 2022, ChatGPT was launched, which quickly sent the internet into a frenzy. Just one week after it was launched, OpenAI's chatbot reached 1 million users. It also gained 57 million users in its first month and is supported by Microsoft's $10 billion investment in Open AI.Still not impressed? After two months of launch, ChatGPT reached 100 million monthly active users, making it the world's fastest-growing consumer app. And some people have even dubbed it ""the best AI chatbot ever released to the general public.""But what link is there between ChatGPT and calendars?In particular, Chat GPT can help you locate open times on your calendar for dental appointments or team meetings. In order to fix this problem, you might write a prompt telling it what your schedule looks like for the week and ask for a reorganization.

""Today's top calendar apps can recognize and prevent double-bookings."" Others can adjust meetings across time zones.But, over the next decade or so, how much more will online calendars be capable of?


""While I wouldn't hold out for magically tackling your chores for you, there are many more online calendars will be able to do by 2030,"" Howie adds.

There were an estimated 26.6 million users of online dating services in the United States alone in 2020, with projected growth to reach 30.5 million users in 2024.Nowadays, this industry serves more diverse social groups with people of different backgrounds and interests by introducing new features in existing apps like ""Relationship Types"" or ""Incognito Mode"" by various competitors. Moreover, we see a rollout of new niche dating apps like Tinder Uni (Campus Dating), TapDat (Deliberate Casual Sex) and Kindred (Childfree Singles). And we can project further intense competition in this market to perfect users' experience or take over one niche or the other.In this article, we'll explore the latest trends in dating apps and examine how they're changing the landscape of modern dating. We'll also consider the importance of staying safe in the digital world.



Establishing genuine connections and relationshipsOne of the most significant trends in dating apps is the growing desire to build meaningful bonds, with two-thirds of Generation Z ready to switch to in-real-life (IRL) because they can't find ""true love"" online. Many users are tired of the superficial nature of online dating, where people often present a carefully curated version of themselves that doesn't reflect who they truly are. Instead, people seek ways to build genuine and meaningful relationships with others.This trend has led to the popularity of dating apps that focus on facilitating deeper connections rather than just swiping through endless profiles. These apps often include personality quizzes, in-depth profiles and advanced search filters, which help users find people who share their values, interests and lifestyles.

It started in the past, but it is ongoing: many people used dating apps to present an idealized version of themselves, carefully selecting their most flattering photos and crafting a personality that they think would be most attractive to others.Thus, as users increasingly value authenticity and transparency in their online interactions, they want to see more real, unfiltered photos and read profiles that reflect people's true personalities and interests. Some apps even encourage users to share more genuine content, such as videos and stories that showcase their daily lives and hobbies.Related: 7 Steps to Starting a Successful Online Dating Site


Innovative communication methods enhance the experienceIt becomes obvious these days that dating apps need to explore new mediums and ways for people to express themselves and add flair to their personalities. In the past, most dating apps relied on simple text messaging as the primary mode of communication between users.However, this approach is dated, so dating apps began incorporating new communication, starting with various video implementations introduced during the pandemic and continuing with mediums like voice, in-app games and quizzes and even virtual events. These features make it easier for users to connect and build rapport with potential matches, even when they can't meet in person. But of course, there is an opportunity for innovation or at least a big upgrade of the user experience.Upholding user safety in the digital ageUndoubtedly, with the rise of online dating comes concerns about online safety. Dating apps have faced a ton of criticism for failing to protect their users from harassment, catfishing scams and other forms of online abuse. A survey by Pew Research Center found that 10% of dating app users had experienced threats of violence, while 35% reported receiving unsolicited sexually explicit messages or images, 28% were subjected to offensive language, and 9% had been threatened with physical harm.Now investing in advanced safety features, such as photo verification, background checks, and AI-powered moderation tools, are full in the industry. Feels like we are on the verge of online dating becoming a much safer and more enjoyable environment for everyone.

Here's How to Protect Yourself.Personalization takes it to the next levelFinally, as anything online becomes a fingerprint of your life, personalizing a user experience is what many dating apps are in the chase for. Users want to feel that their app is tailored to their needs and preferences rather than providing a one-size-fits-all experience.Some dating apps really explore machine learning algorithms to personalize the user experience. For example, they might analyze a user's swiping behavior to suggest more relevant matches or use data from their profile to create personalized icebreakers and conversation starters.The world of dating apps is constantly evolving to meet users' changing needs and demands. Today, people seek ways to build genuine connections, access authentic content, communicate in new ways, stay safe online, and enjoy a personalized experience that meets their needs. By embracing these trends, dating apps can continue to evolve and thrive, providing a valuable service to millions worldwide.

94,I Downloaded Every App of the Day for 1 Year. Here Are the Traits That Set Them Apart From the Rest.,"Mar 6, 2023",Seth Radman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-i-learned-after-getting-every-app-of-the-day-for-1-year/446180,"
My app got 30,000 downloads in 24 hours as Apple's App of the Day. But I didn't learn how to get featured overnight.A few years ago, I decided to run an experiment to learn why some apps are big hits and others flop. I downloaded every single App of the Day for a year — 365 apps total. From free apps to paid apps, I went all in and spent 30 minutes studying the top apps every morning.I discovered the best apps have certain traits in common that set them apart from the rest. Since then, I've been featured on the App Store over 100 times and helped millions of users.



Here are eight common traits of the top apps (and how to apply them to your own product):Related: How To Make Your Mobile App Stand Out In A Crowd


1. No tutorialThe best apps are easy to use and simple to understand. They don't require a tutorial to get started because the app's design guides the user.Headspace, an app that helps users meditate, is a great example. The app's interface is clean, with intuitive navigation and lots of negative space. You feel calm simply by opening the app as you start your first meditation.2. FocusedNearly all top apps focus on doing one thing best. They could add a lot more features, but instead, they have a clear and specific purpose.Duolingo could teach you all kinds of new skills, but they focus exclusively on teaching language. FaceTune could provide a toolbox of photo effects, but instead, they focus solely on making your face look better in selfies.


What do you want to be known for? Focus on that one thing.3. Beautiful iconWhen searching for a new app, your first impression is the app icon — so make it beautiful. Most featured apps have a foreground icon with a solid or gradient background.Cramming text into a tiny icon doesn't work well. Vibrant colors make it pop and catch the eye. Make your app icon relevant and pleasant to draw users in.4. AccessibleThe best apps are user-friendly for people with different abilities, preferences and needs. Following the iPhone's global dark mode was a common trait, as well as changing contrast and text sizing based on iPhone Settings. Top apps also use icons instead of text whenever possible to communicate clearly across different languages and cultures.


Related: 4 Steps for Increasing Your App's User Engagement and Retention5. Full ecosystemApps on the App Store are more likely to get featured if they use the latest Apple features. Almost all featured apps included versions for iPad and Apple Watch, and many included iMessage and home screen widgets. These don't always improve the user experience, but Apple typically prefers them for using all their latest and greatest features.While this may increase your chances at getting featured, I personally discourage these add-ons when first launching. They take time to build and can be distracting if they don't serve a real purpose for users.6. Ask for reviewsThere's a simple reason why top apps have thousands of reviews: They ask for them. Featured apps are very intentional with asking users for ratings at specific times — completing a task, hitting a goal or reaching a milestone. At those times, users are in a positive mood and are more likely to leave a 5-star review.


Don't go overboard bombarding users for ratings right away. Instagram asks after you share your third post. SoundHound asks after you successfully identify a song. Find an elegant way to prompt them immediately after providing value.7. PersonalizationTop apps craft a unique experience for each user. People love products that feel good, and they generally don't want to work hard to find things.Spotify recommends new music based on your preferences. Snapchat suggests new filters you might enjoy. Todoist provides custom theme colors to make the app yours. Even your banking app probably greets you by name.Find ways to make the user feel special just by using your app.Related: 4 Exciting Mobile App Trends to Watch in 2023 And Beyond8. Variable rewardLast but not least, there's a magic category of top apps that keeps users coming back for more. They release frequent updates, add new features and keep content fresh. This encourages users to engage more often to see if there is something new.Netflix drops new content. Photomath supports new equations. Starbucks has new rewards specials. Keep things exciting for users so they keep coming back.Before we wrap up, there's one trait you might expect to be on this list but isn't: pretty design.


Most featured apps do indeed look beautiful. But that's not a requirement if your app solves a clear problem and is intuitive. WhatsApp, Reddit, and GroupMe are some of the ugliest apps with millions of users. Being pleasant to look at is not the same as being helpful and easy to use.If you're building an app and want to get featured on the App Store, know this: Getting featured by Apple is a wonderful side effect of building a product people love. Focus on helping customers, and things will fall into place.

97,6 Benefits of Having a Mobile App for Your Business,"Feb 13, 2023",Omar El Bahr,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/6-reasons-to-consider-making-a-mobile-app-for-your-business/443863,"
Ever look at a family that should be spending time together, but instead, everyone is on their phones scrolling while focused, bored or even excited? Well, because this is the age of technology, a smartphone could mean a person is checking the news, working, gaming, entertaining themselves through social media, shopping, chatting with a friend or maybe doing their school homework.Mobile app statistics for 2023 state that there are 1.96 million applications available on the Apple Store and 2.87 million on the Google Play Store. From schools to multinational companies, everyone is leaning towards building their own mobile application in order to be more connected globally and make it easier for people to reach anything they want through a quick tap on their smartphone's screen. In this article, we'll go over the advantages of mobile applications for your business.



There are many different benefits to having a mobile application for your business. Creating a mobile app that fits your vision could help you build brand loyalty, improve relationships with clients and stay relevant, up-to-date and on the cutting edge of new technology. What does it mean, though? How could an app strengthen customer or client relationships? Let's just say that people nowadays WANT to save time; time is a valuable asset, so finding ways to save it for people is important — and a business application could do that for them. For example, if you wanted to shop for groceries but had to go to work and had no time to do so, you could open your groceries app, tap on the products you wanted, add them to your cart, checkout and voila! You've just gone grocery shopping.So, let's break down the various benefits of having a mobile app for your business:Related: Does Your Business Really Need a Mobile App?1. Increases brand awarenessHaving a branded app allows you to spread the word about your business with a click. It allows people to get more acquainted with who you are and the services that you offer. Additionally, apps create an opportunity for brands to strengthen emotional connections with their customers. A branded app lets people know about your business and makes it easy for them to do business with you with just a few taps or clicks.2. Allows you to personalizeWith an app, you can personalize your services to cater specifically to your target market. For example, you can make a quiz to find out what your customers like so you can make their content and notifications more relevant to them. This makes it easier to make personalized experiences that keep customers coming back and get more people to use your app. It will also give you valuable information about how users act, which you can use to improve your marketing strategies and learn more about your customer base.3. It saves timeStudies have proven that an application was better than a website in terms of saving time. A website could take time to load or simply crash at some point in your process. An app could just save your customers' time by giving them fast, easy access to your business's services. When it comes to paying through an app, a study in 2019 found that payments on mobile applications are estimated to increase from 41.8% in 2019 to 52.2% in 2023.


Related: Here's Exactly What You Need to Do to Launch a Mobile App4. Better engagement ratesBusiness apps could also play a necessary role in raising people's engagement rates in your business. Creating app-only deals, offers or creative campaigns to increase people's engagement with your app and business is one way to do so. With an app, businesses are able to reach a wider target audience. An app can make people more aware of your business and make it easier for them to find you and use your products or services. You don't have to be limited by physical location; now you can reach a broader audience, no matter where they are in the world.5. Strengthens your businessA mobile business application could also help strengthen your business by building relevance, familiarity, trust and credibility through your business-customer relationship. You could use an app to help you manage your relationships with customers by keeping track of how they use it and learning more about it. The app would give you perfect and convenient customer insights. For example, you could make changes to your app by looking at which features your customers use the most and which ones are most popular. That could definitely help you plan and strategize your futuristic app growth. If your app were perfectly made, you could just create a marketing campaign by finding the best way to get information and feedback from your customers.6. Marketing assistanceIf you're a person who worries about marketing, then you should definitely be developing your own mobile app, as it could be an excellent marketing tool. A customized mobile app increases your communication needs. Contact information, specialized messaging and even engagement tools like deals, contests and campaigns can be managed from the app. You can stand out by branding them with your own colors, logos and taglines. Another benefit is that a mobile app is cost-effective in terms of marketing. This means you could be saving money internally through your business app, as it eliminates the need for tangible marketing goods and can cut down on live marketing campaign costs.


Apps could also be a booster for employee efficiency by increasing communication and engagement and cutting down on streamlining data. There is also the option of making money through your app with ads targeted at in-app purchases. There is also the ""effective frequency"" strategy that developers use as a marketing rate measurement: The more customers recognize your marketing message, participate in campaigns or engage with your app, the more likely they are to recognize it and have a long-term memory of your brand.Related: 5 Data-Driven Reasons You Should Build a Mobile App for Your BusinessTechnology is constantly evolving and updating, and so are customers' expectations and demands — hence the importance of keeping up with the competition in application marketing. It's more important than ever to keep your app competitive by meeting customer needs, growing your business and attracting potential customers. With the expansion of the digital landscape, you need to broaden your ideas and your way of looking at business development. Moreover, you need to be up to date on all the new app upgrades in order to stay on top of your brand and get the best results when developing an application for your business.

101,Your Mobile App Needs AI. Here Are 3 Ways to Harness Its Power (and Why It Matters).,"Jan 9, 2023",Andrew Amann,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-your-app-can-unleash-the-power-of-ai-and-why-it-should/439913,"
Machine learning-driven apps are a leading category among funded startups, and the reasons why are clear. Machine learning (ML) offers mobile app developers new tools for personalization, predicting user behavior, improving security and delivering better targeted ads. Adopting this technology provides startups and their development teams with the means to include compelling features able to attract and retain an audience.The inclusion of machine learning makes it easier to add functionality like personalization or even predicting user behavior. Additionally, the targeting of in-app advertising becomes more effective and potentially useful to an app's audience. Finally, leveraging ML models aimed at detecting nefarious online behavior improves an app's cybersecurity footprint.So if machine learning makes sense for your next mobile app development project, what are some of the best use cases for its inclusion? Here are a few insights on adding machine learning to a mobile app, applicable to both the iOS and Android platforms. Leverage these insights to give your next venture the best chance of making a true impact in the modern business world.



Related: 3 Ways Machine Learning Can Help EntrepreneursMachine learning for reasoning functionalityArtificial intelligence (AI) routines currently lurk within some of the most popular apps in the mobile market. Simply look at map software like Google Maps. Machine learning models take into account current traffic volume, road construction, real-time accidents and other considerations to plot a pathway that ultimately saves time.


Any mobile app using mapping features benefits from the application of reasoning functionality powered by machine learning and crowdsourcing data from user actions and inputs. In addition to both Google and Apple Maps, Uber's own app provides a similar feature for determining the most opportune path between two locations. Simply put, machine learning analyzes all this information in real time and calculates the optimal route much more quickly — and safely — than a human driver or passenger.Similar reasoning functionality remains a great rationale for incorporating machine learning into a mobile app. For example, this ML-powered route-finding logic also benefits the logistics and supply chain world, helping companies save money while shipping materials faster.However, these benefits go beyond apps using mapping. Google's virtual keyboard app, Gboard, uses AI in the form of predictive behavior to make word suggestions when typing. Even virtual chatbots used to optimize the customer service function in multiple business sectors benefit from AI reasoning. These use cases provide an obvious reason to include machine learning in any modern mobile app hoping to make an impact.Related: What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? Here Are Its Benefits, Uses and More


Machine learning for personalizationOne of the biggest capabilities of machine learning involves its ability to analyze massive amounts of data as quickly as possible. This functionality comes into play in a variety of streaming apps providing users with recommendations based on their viewing or listening history. Additionally, in a more controversial approach when considering data privacy, web browsing history also provides insights used for generating online advertising based on a specific user.Over-the-top television services and streaming providers leverage ML-powered recommendation engines on the web and in mobile apps. The apps used in streaming devices, such as Roku and Apple TV, also leverage this approach. This functionality adds a level of personalization to engage users, making them more likely to retain their service subscriptions over time.Like AI-based reasoning, recommendation functionality also makes sense for apps in a variety of use cases beyond entertainment. Shopping apps especially benefit from this approach, including grocery stores or most other retailers. A customer's previous shopping history — combined with online data and similar customer data profiles — provides fruitful data for machine learning models, with Amazon providing one obvious example on their website and mobile app.Related: Why Learn Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence?


Machine learning for behavioral analysisMachine learning also provides the ability to analyze how a user interacts with a mobile app. This level of analysis powers a myriad of useful features that at a glance might seem unrelated.One example involves a user of a financial company's mobile app. The app analyzes their transaction history and their methodology for saving and spending money. In a similar manner to a recommendation engine mentioned earlier, it uses this data to offer personalized savings or account recommendations to help optimize the customer's financial outlook. Thanks to behavior analysis, new users can even benefit from insights into how they might practice better spending habits based on their onboarding inputs and similar customer experiences.An even more critical use case reveals how behavioral analysis helps detect suspicious activity in the cybersecurity world. In fact, companies in the security operations space increasingly rely on AI and machine learning to fight the scourge of cybercrime. Using the financial app example, machine learning also provides the ability to detect abnormal behavior and block any potential fraudulent transaction as a result.This high-level overview hopefully provides some food for thought on the many possibilities for implementing machine learning in your next mobile app. Providing features like personalization, a recommendation engine and behavioral predictive analysis benefits any modern mobile app hoping to stand out from a growing pack. Expect your competition to consider adopting a similar machine learning-powered approach, as it's rapidly becoming a new standard.

102,5 Ways to Make Money Through a Mobile App for Your Business,"Jan 2, 2023",Andrew Amann,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/5-ways-to-make-money-with-a-mobile-app-for-your-business/439912,"
Mobile apps continue to grow in popularity, which offers little surprise when considering the ubiquitous nature of the smartphone. This scenario leads many companies to consider crafting their own app, likely targeting both Apple iOS and Android platforms. Sometimes their goal for the app involves generating publicity for their business or even driving engagement from their customer base.However, in many cases, businesses craft a mobile app simply as a source of revenue. In this situation, it becomes critical to fully understand the potential revenue models available to any app. This understanding then informs the process of evaluating which model makes the most sense for the business.So let's take a high-level overview of the different revenue models available to entrepreneurs building a mobile app and how to evaluate these models to help you decide on which one provides the best opportunity. Remember, this analysis needs to happen before you design any interface wireframes or write one line of code. In the end, a successful app launch likely depends on making this initial effort.



Related: How Can App Makers Improve Revenue and Keep Users Engaged?In-app advertisingEmbedded ads within a mobile app offer one obvious approach to generating revenue. However, this revenue stream really only applies to free apps, as displaying ads in a paid app likely hampers the growth of the app's user base. In fact, a common practice in mobile games or other apps involves using an in-app purchase to remove ads.


Notably, the market for in-app advertising continues to generate significant growth across the planet. According to Absolute Market Insights, the in-app ad market reached $66.78 billion in 2018 and is forecast to hit $472.64 billion by 2027. This growth shows a compound annual growth rate of 24.4% over that 10-year period. Again, any app needs a large user base to generate significant ad revenue, so consider making your app free to attract users.The ""freemium"" app approachSomewhat related to in-app advertising, a freemium app also serves to attract a large user base to a compelling app experience. Additional content or features then become unlocked after buying an in-app purchase. In fact, we just highlighted the fact that users take advantage of this approach to turn off in-app advertising.This revenue stream strategy is common in gaming apps as well as music production and instrument apps, with the latter niche more common on the iOS platform. A user might own a free beat-making app, and get access to new synthesizers or drum machines after buying an IAP. Some music app developers also use this revenue model to provide new sounds and synth patches to their user community.Related: How to Create an App for Your Business With Zero Coding Experience


Offering subscriptions to generate revenueAdditionally, other developers are using subscriptions to provide a repeatable revenue source for their mobile apps typically offered on a freemium basis. Not surprisingly, magazines and comic books sometimes leverage this revenue stream strategy. However, note that Apple and Google Play take a cut of any revenue generated using subscriptions; this also applies to any in-app purchase.The subscription model can also be very valuable for B2B apps. Creating a mobile app that integrates with a SaaS solution is a great way to expand the platform to a larger audience and deliver more value — which justifies monthly subscription fees.Monetize your mobile app dataDepending on the nature of your mobile app, its data potential potentially serves as a valuable revenue stream. Of course, this valuation ultimately depends on the size of the app's user base and the nature of the data. When leveraging data monetization as a revenue strategy, you need clearly note this in the app's Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.This is one of the best examples of why you need to determine your revenue model before developing your product. GasBuddy is an example of an app that generated a strong user base with a very sticky venture and zero plans for how to monetize their mobile app. They ended up secretly (i.e. illegally) selling user data and getting into trouble when users started noticing the extra drain on resources and battery from GasBuddy collecting location information.


While monetizing data isn't the most popular monetization strategy, it can work if it is done legally and you are completely transparent about it from the beginning.Related: Building an App? Follow These 4 Steps to See Things ThroughThe traditional paid app revenue modelOf course, actually charging for an app provides an easy way to generate revenue. Paid apps need to provide users with a top-shelf experience and compelling functionality. As such, these apps tend to be mobile games, music creation apps (including synthesizers) and productivity apps, like video editing or graphic design software. Leveraging the freemium model with certain features unlocked through an IAP also works, but paid apps also provide IAPs. Once again, this approach depends on the overall quality of the app and the functionality it provides.Make sure you fully understand the rules of the Apple Store and Play Store and how they will affect your revenue model. Last month, Apple updated their App Store rules to take 30% of sales on ""boosts"" for social media posts. This is the first time Apple has directly taxed advertising in iOS apps and is just one example of a recent change that could significantly impact your revenue.


What revenue model makes sense for your mobile app?As noted earlier, before one line of code gets written, you need to determine which revenue model works best for your company's mobile app. This analysis includes figuring out the potential size of the user community and the amount of revenue you'll need to break even. Those factors directly influence the potential of using in-app advertising and data monetization as revenue streams.If your app requires millions of users to become profitable, you need to set realistic goals for reaching those milestones. Personally, we've found more success with subscription-based app revenue models that require a lower number of users to reach profitability. But, charging high subscription fees doesn't work for every app.In the end, entrepreneurs need to take this analytical approach to ensure their mobile app truly makes an impact. Anything less simply won't generate enough interest — or revenue.

107,4 Exciting Mobile App Trends to Watch in 2023 And Beyond,"Dec 15, 2022",Max Kraynov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/4-exciting-mobile-app-trends-to-watch-in-2023/439751,"
Some fifteen years in the making, the mobile app economy has become an essential contributor to global GDP and a true force to be reckoned with for both technologists and advertisers alike. More than $320,000 flowed through app stores every minute of 2021, an increase of nearly 20% from the year earlier. In addition, consumers are downloading more than 435,000 apps per minute — a truly astonishing figure — according to Data.ai, and things don't seem to be slowing down.Given all the buzz, what should you be watching if you're set on capturing the hearts and minds of consumers, who are already spending a third of their waking hours consuming app content in an increasingly mobile-first world? Here is my list of top emerging mobile app trends as I take stock of 2022 and look ahead to the new year:1. Augmented Reality looks set to continue its meteoric riseMaybe it's because the reality of the state of the world is so grim, or because seeing a dystopian world we live in through colored lenses has always held a certain appeal, but for whatever reason, augmented reality (AR) is becoming more and more popular. An increasing number of apps are launching new AR-based features. Even IKEA has started leveraging AR technology to allow shoppers to virtually ""try on"" furniture, using 3D models of their homes within the IKEA Place app, before making a purchase.



Back in September, an iOS 16 release saw the cutout feature being added to iPhone photos, where people can take the subject of a photo out of an image and place that subject — be it a person or a particularly scenic tree or whatever else — in different backgrounds.Video background editing and even face-swapping tech are also growing in dominance, with these technologies becoming more advanced and easier to use as we're quickly moving away from the days of blurry backgrounds and superimposed people in TikToks. Popular meme communities are taking full advantage of AR-enabled face-swapping tools to facilitate quick, easy and fun meme editing. Various video editing apps have also hit the market, allowing people to use AR to place animated 3D models on their surroundings — something businesses can use to create fun and appealing videos of their products.


Thanks to the winning combination of accessibility for fast-improving AR technology and users' creative potential, we will likely see almost studio-quality content coming from lesser-known sources shortly. The democratization of content creation is well underway, and new developments on the AR front are likely to further this trend.Related: 6 Emerging Niche Applications to Boost Productivity and Efficiency2. Consumers are finding new ways to monetize their app-based activitiesThe idea of making extra cash is not new, but the cost-of-living crisis keenly felt across geographic and generational divides, and the rise of social networking is providing additional incentives for gamers, content creators and app users of all stripes to find new ways to monetize their activities.Meta's Instagram rolled out its 'subscription' features in August 2022 for creators to monetize exclusive content, and we're likely to see more mobile apps attempt this to help users make money as compensation for their creative efforts. In the memes niche, Yepp launched earlier this year and began offering to share its advertising revenues with its users for consuming and creating memes content within the app. Given the current economic situation, I would not be surprised if this revenue-share model gains popularity in the coming months.


We will also likely see more ecommerce or peer-to-peer sales being rolled into social media apps as digital marketing evolves - so people may buy more clothing, artwork and other goods and services outside of established ecommerce platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Etsy or Depop, which were specifically set up with buying and selling (and not content creation) in mind.3. Users are becoming an integral part of the mobile development processWith beta testing, app developers and companies are becoming increasingly focused on growing communities as there is a growing realization that a more diverse range of voices is essential for feedback and product tweaking.User-driven innovation has long been the holy grail for tech companies trying to guess the next big thing on the horizon. Increasingly, management and marketing gurus have been trying to map out what firms can purposefully do to generate consumer innovation efforts.I am betting that we will start to see more users and customers being brought in at the early stages of the app development process, resulting in products that are increasingly made by the people and for the people.

Mobile wallets and rewards are set to get bigger and better, both for customers and for the planetThe 2021 Mobile Wallet report claims that usage will increase by 74% from 2021 to 2025, reaching 4.8 billion mobile wallets by the end of 2025 — as comfort, security and responsiveness grow in importance for users while faith in traditional banks and financial systems erodes amid worrying and uncertainty-inducing financial headlines.We are already seeing consumers growing more careful with their finances, so 2023 might bring a renewed surge in wallets and apps that offer greater benefits and rewards to win over customers (just not crypto exchanges!).In this environment of budget consciousness, we are also likely to see more social and ESG-focused apps. These apps will likely inspire consumers to save or spend less while also benefiting their communities by promoting the greater social and environmental good. This trend of socially conscious, waste-reducing, economically and environmentally sound initiatives within app models will likely continue its upward trajectory in 2023 and beyond.

109,Is AI A Risk To Creativity? The Answer Is Not So Simple,"Dec 12, 2022",Devan Leos,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/is-ai-a-risk-to-creativity-the-answer-is-not-so-simple/439525,"
Before becoming a devoted entrepreneur, I was a full-time actor appearing on TV and in film. From my experience, the marks of excellent performance, cinematography and entertainment were the ability to be absolutely convincing and creative.Creativity is the ability to find new solutions to problems or challenges. Creative people are innovative and able to see things differently from others, which helps them come up with new ideas or solutions. Creative thinking typically involves making connections between things that might not appear related at first glance. This means being able to look at a problem from different angles and coming up with unexpected solutions. This thinking has led to some of the most ingenious inventions, creations and ideas we have today. One of the significant modern innovations in technology is artificial intelligence (AI). AI is a branch of computer science that deals with automated reasoning and intelligent machines. AI software simulates human intelligence processes like problem-solving and learning so that computer programs can perform these processes instead of humans.Related: 5 Ways Artificial Intelligence Is Radically Transforming Creativity in Business



What's the relationship between creativity and AI?Science tells us that there are major differences between our brain's right and left halves. We know that the left side focuses more on systematic and logical analysis, while the right is more creative.Computer programs developed by artificial intelligence are designed to be logical and systematic. This means that they cannot be impulsive or spontaneous like human creativity. AI is programmed to process information in a certain way and achieve a particular result. It cannot deviate from these instructions, and its actions are predictable.


On the other hand, human creativity is unpredictable and often cannot be explained. When you are inspired to create something new, there's no telling how your ideas will manifest or what you might come up with—it's an unexplained process.As such, AI and creativity are two concepts that are fundamentally different. Computer programs that use AI to analyze and interpret data are typically used in areas where accuracy is needed. These include medical research, engineering and finance. In creative fields, however, things aren't as cut-and-dried. Creativity is subjective, and it isn't easy to measure accuracy. In other words, creativity isn't something that can be reduced to a set of equations or a mathematical formula. It is a human process open to many interpretations and viewpoints.Related: Surprising Truths About the Left and Right Halves of Your Brain (Infographic)Why is AI bad for creativity?Although AI is excellent for precise tasks that require precision and accuracy, it's not very good at being creative. After all, the two concepts are opposites. AI is designed to be precise, to follow instructions, and to achieve specific goals. Because of this, AI is not very good at being creative. The main problem with AI is that it's focused on achieving the results you tell it to complete. This means it's not very good at deviating from its instructions or coming up with unexpected solutions to problems.


This is what creativity is all about — finding new solutions to problems that others may not have considered. AI cannot look at a problem from different perspectives or come up with unexpected solutions because it's programmed to do one thing and one thing only — achieve its goals. This means that AI won't be able to think outside the box and will focus on achieving the exact results you tell it to achieve. This is the opposite of creativity, which means that AI and creativity are two concepts that are fundamentally different.AI and artArtificial intelligence plays a key role in the modern art world. From programs that generate original art to AI-controlled robots that create paintings, AI has become a big part of contemporary art. Artificial intelligence is sometimes used in creative fields like art and design. This is often referred to as algorithmic art.Algorithmic art is created through computer software, algorithms and automated computer programs. Artificial intelligence is also used in design software and 3D modeling programs. AI-generated art and design created through algorithms are similar to computer-generated music: they are made by computer programs that follow instructions and produce certain types of results.Artificial intelligence is often used in advertising, marketing, and product design. AI-generated ads are computer-generated ads that are made by a computer program. These programs follow instructions and create a specific type of ad.


One might argue that because AI can create art, it is creative. But, art generated by AI is systematic, and it's important to remember that art is often a combination of architecture and the artist. The artist behind the art is oftentimes what gives art meaning and perspective (although many agree that art is indeed 'subjective')The benefits of AI in the creative processJust because AI can be bad for creativity doesn't mean it's terrible for all creative processes. As with every technology, AI has its benefits and drawbacks. Depending on your work type, you may want to add AI to your creative process. AI programs can help with repetitive tasks that involve analysis, information gathering and data processing.A creative process is often messy and intricate and requires a lot of back-and-forth between different departments. AI can automate certain tasks and make the creative process more efficient and effective. For example, AI can scour the internet for images and data to help with brainstorming.Related: These 5 Freelance Jobs Are Being Transformed by AI

It's designed to be precise, follow instructions and achieve specific goals.
