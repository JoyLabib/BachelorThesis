0,5 Ways to Move Forward After Shutting Down Your Business,"Apr 16, 2024",Philip Blackett,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-move-forward-after-shutting-down-your-business/472327,"
When entrepreneurs start a business, we envision it succeeding beyond our wildest dreams. But what happens when reality does not align with our goals and vision for our business? How do we recover and move forward after closing down our business?I experienced a similar nightmare when I shut down one of my businesses after battling the recent pandemic. Now, several months after making such a tough decision, I want to share five ways you can move forward from an unfortunate business failure.1. Give yourself time to grieveYour business may have been a labor of love or even your baby. It's hard to face the facts and move on. Be fair to yourself and give yourself time to grieve the loss, even if it is frustrating and heartbreaking to the point of tears. You cannot truly move on to the next chapter while still holding on to what could have been in the old chapter.

Reconnect with loved ones and recover from burnoutLeading up to the decision to close your business, you likely exhausted all possible options. You used all your physical, mental and emotional energy in the process. Now that it's over, give yourself the freedom to relax, recover and rejuvenate. It may mean taking a trip outside your city for a few days in a new setting.


Consider unwinding to movies you had meant to watch but had no time or picking up that hobby you abandoned while building your business. This is a great time to surround yourself with family and loved ones who love you beyond the business and can support you regarding the next steps.Related: The 10 Warning Signs of Employee Burnout and How to Handle It3. Reflect on your past journey and consider possible next stepsOnce you have had time to grieve and recover emotionally, now you are in a position to consider what's next in your life. Take inventory of the lessons you learned from your experience running your business beforehand. It may help to document them, so you can carry them into your next adventure. You can also share such lessons with other aspiring entrepreneurs or colleagues who are running businesses. Ask yourself what you can see yourself doing in the next chapter and start researching what that would look like and what the first few next steps to pursue.4. Consider getting a ""bridge job""Once an entrepreneur, always an entrepreneur, right? Well, running a business is not for the fainthearted. Some former entrepreneurs may desire the security of a paycheck and fewer responsibilities that they had as an owner accountable to everyone. While you consider the next steps, it may be a good idea to take a mental break from your previous responsibilities and get yourself back to work, even if it is working for someone else on a temporary basis. Doing work that provides a regular paycheck for you and your family can help you stay active, take down the mental workload you once had, and give you oxygen — and money — while you consider your next move.

Make a decision: stay an employee or launch out as an entrepreneur againNow that you have had some time to grieve, recover, reflect, and even work again, only you can make the decision whether you want to build a business again. You may be in a better position to consider collaborating with others to build again or consider building on your own. Give yourself a suitable timeline (ideally between 3-12 months) to decide your next steps and then commit to your next adventure all the way.Recovering from failure is never easy. Your dreams are broken. You may feel like a failure in the eyes of your family, friends, and fellow entrepreneur community. However, one of the biggest lessons I learned as an entrepreneur is that success does not happen in a straight line. Failure is part of the process. Depending on your mindset, you can view failure as a stepping stone to your subsequent success or as a barrier that dissuades you from ever trying again. Mental toughness and resilience are built not only through the ups and downs of running your own business but also when you have to make a tough decision to close down and move on with your life.The good news is that you are not alone in experiencing failure. You do not have to be an entrepreneur to know what failure feels like. You live long enough, and you realize that everyone has to respond to the failures and misfortunes they experience. It is not a question of whether or not you will fail. It is more a question of how you will respond when failure knocks on your door, even when you least expect it. I hope these five ways can help you recover from your business failure and build the courage to forge a new adventure on your entrepreneurial path.

Stefan Gehrig's side hustle was doing well — and that became a dilemma.The Melbourne, Australia-based entrepreneur had started a gym bag brand called Knkg, also known as King Kong Apparel, in 2011. It began as a side hustle that scratched an entrepreneurial itch untouched by his academic day job, then grew into his full-time business. But by 2021, he'd hit a wall: To scale up, he needed resources that he didn't have.Meanwhile, in Miami, investor and former PayPal executive Keith Rabois had just helped found a startup called OpenStore, which acquires Shopify stores with growth potential. Gehrig heard about OpenStore, but wasn't interested in selling Knkg. Then, in 2023, the startup launched another offering called OpenStore Drive, which lets Shopify owners retain ownership while handing off operations to OpenStore. That interested Gehrig a lot more.

2,AI-Generated Images or Stock Photography? Here's How Entrepreneurs Can Navigate the Dynamic Photography Industry,"Apr 10, 2024",Serban Enache,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-entrepreneurs-can-leverage-ai-for-gains-in-stock/469400,"
As an entrepreneur, you are familiar with the quest to build something that works financially, preferably in the long term. Stock photography, a market evaluated at $4 billion in 2023, has been a reliable passive income source for years. But with AI-generated content emerging, should you trade off your camera for a photoshop-like algorithm?The established powerhouse of stock photographyStock photography is a proven way to monetize your artistic vision. Platforms connect you to a vast marketplace of millions of potential buyers. You upload your work once and earn from it repeatedly and indefinitely. One image alone can earn you hundreds or thousands of dollars from royalty-free sales.Moreover, stock photo platforms provide licensing agreements, indemnification and a clear legal framework for your business, reducing subsequent legal risks for all parties involved.



Related: How Modern Entrepreneurs Can Capitalize on Image and Video SearchesThe legal and ethical considerations of AIAI-generated content is the new kid on the block, bringing opportunities and challenges. Many companies have started selling generative AI while needing to learn more about stock photography requirements.


As such, this new exciting frontier is not without its legal difficulties, particularly concerning copyright ownership, the risk of infringing on intellectual property rights and the necessity for consent from people or models — issues that traditionally created content doesn't raise.AI tools have been trained and are still mostly training on existing images, raising questions about authors' permissions. Without clear transparency and compensation mechanisms, most artists have not and still do not green-light their work for AI training or usage, on the contrary. So, how do you know how much or to what extent your AI-prompted image is derivative of another artist's intellectual property? And what, if any, are the liabilities for you? Can you safely and legally generate images of people? Any unauthorized commercial and even editorial use of an individual's likeness could have significant legal consequences for you and your clients.Furthermore, who does the copyright belong to: the AI developers, you, or someone else? A recent ruling says you can't copyright AI work, so creators using such tools are mere… tools. When using AI to generate content, you may find yourself in a less clear legal position: image prompter versus indisputable copyright owner.Real vs. GeneratedFor image entrepreneurs, success lies in creating distinctive visuals. Established industry names have signature styles perfected over the years. The AI mainly replicates techniques and styles in a hyper-realistic way, with results that dilute artistic trademark, perhaps to exhaustion, eventually failing to produce authentic, diverse imagery. The critical question arises: what becomes of creativity when the marketplace is flooded with too-similar-looking images due to the widespread use of AI? Market saturation affects sales, so taking a unique approach to your work becomes a matter of artistic integrity and a necessity for your commercial success.


AI could work for abstract concepts for image shoppers, but conveying authenticity through AI remains difficult. Audiences crave authenticity, and they need relatable visuals. Genuine authenticity comes from the nuanced perspectives of individuals who can understand and capture the broader context. Audiences can not only spot the real versus the fabricated but relying on AI-generated images can backfire heavily on brands or services.Many customers buy visuals with high SEO results in mind. Original photos with reliable metadata are a big win, and using natural-looking photos will boost user engagement. Because AI-generated content may lead to content removal, original stock photos save your clients from serious SEO headaches.AI-generated visuals often create ethical dilemmas about deception, misrepresentation and fake news in fields like journalism or historical documentation. Enhancing or modifying reality undermines credibility and authority and can harm your service.Related: I Tried 3 AI Headshot Generators, 1 Might Work for LinkedIn


Why you should work with ethical partners in visual storytellingWhether you are buying or selling imagery, stock photo platforms remain the most secure and reliable venue for high-quality and ethically sourced content. Stock photography is multifaceted, and AI has just started participating in this landscape.Explore different platforms, review their content acceptance policies and AI content approaches, and find the one that aligns with your goals and audience. Platforms usually prioritize ethical and legal content, ensure all uploaded images are original and copyright-protected, and review every photo before publication. You can be confident that you are licensing high-quality and ethically sound content.Moreover, these generative AI platforms are at the forefront of ethical discussions regarding content creation, especially in compensating copyright holders. By incorporating such content under clear ethical guidelines, they set a precedent for using AI and AI-generated content. Creators might be limited to using AI tools that provide full rights or be required to label AI visuals distinctively.Related: Deepfakes Are Lurking in 2024. Here's How to Navigate the Ever-growing AI Threat Landscape


The bigger pictureAI technology is about progress, and stock photography is ready to accept it, provided it benefits both creative communities and image shoppers. The industry's common understanding is that AI is a helping tool meant to enhance and enrich users' needs, whether in creating artwork or enhancing specific designs. AI is great for filling any voids left by photographed imagery, such as futuristic concepts, utopian landscapes, or envisioning hypothetical situations.However, the lack of an official regulatory system means image entrepreneurs, platforms and content users are still sailing uncharted waters. Before using AI for picture-perfect results, consider their benefits or drawbacks. Like content creation, content generation must be conducted responsibly, with informed judgment, and supported by legal foundations.Related: What's Stopping You From Using Generative AI in Your Business?Turn your passion into a thriving portfolioSo, is stock photography still relevant for entrepreneurial creators? Absolutely! AI-generated content is in demand, but quality, authenticity and legal security influence customers to favor stock photography. As technology evolves and legislation eventually introduces regulations, the choice might be up to personal preference, but uniqueness will remain a key differentiator.


Hang on to that camera, leverage platforms like Dreamstime, stay informed, and, most importantly, let your unique storytelling style shine through your lens. That's how you'll build a successful image business that thrives over the years and withstands technological advancement.

3,Want to Be the Next Apple? Here's the Secret Sauce Used By Steve Jobs to Build Consumer Trust.,"Apr 9, 2024",Jessica Wong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-do-marketing-and-branding-like-steve-jobs/470410,"
Take a look at any ranking of the world's leading brands, and one name appears toward the top of that list every single time: Steve Jobs' Apple. Like countless startups today, Steve Jobs began his journey in a garage with little more than a vision.So, how did he build one of the world's most recognizable and trusted brands? Steve Jobs relied on one simple philosophy to set his company apart from its competitor: He viewed Apple's branding as a bank account or a vault.Read on to discover how you and your team can replicate his strategy to grow your business.Depositing Credibility into Your Bank AccountA brand represents the intangible assets that entrepreneurs possess, while branding is the process of enhancing the brand by instilling credibility and trust. A good brand is one that consumers trust to create a high-quality product or deliver great service. Where that level of trust exists, there is room for errors. Great brands are not infallible, but they handle problems well, for example, by admitting to mistakes and taking care of their customers through difficult situations.



Make Deposits, Avoid WithdrawalsSteve Jobs' idea is simple: Every time a company does something good, it deposits something into its bank account or adds something to its vault. Launching a successful product is just as much a deposit as finding a mutually beneficial resolution when there has been a problem. Whenever your customers walk away feeling that they have been treated respectfully, trust in the brand increases.At my marketing company, we don't sell products, but we still find efficient ways to make deposits on a regular basis. Deposits can take a variety of forms: customer service, partnerships, feedback loop, etc. During this time, every single blog post prospect customers read and find useful, every leadership piece they enjoy and share is another small deposit into our ""brand bank account.""On the other hand, whenever someone has a negative experience with your business, a withdrawal is made from your vault. Launching an unsuccessful product would be a large withdrawal. But even an unfriendly interaction on a customer service hotline can cause your brand to lose a consumer's trust.How Do You Have a Healthy Brand Bank Balance?Just like your team works hard to maintain a positive balance in your company's actual bank accounts, every team member should understand the importance of maintaining a healthy brand bank balance. In theory, it is as simple as ensuring that deposits outnumber withdrawals. In practice, that is not always so easy, and no brand is immune to making mistakes or being unlucky.


Here's a good example of when Apple avoided a heavy withdrawal. When the company launched its then-revolutionary face recognition technology for iPhone X in 2017, the technology simply did not work. This temporary glitch put a dent in Apple's stock market value for some time. However, due to the company's well-established brand reputation and history of innovation, loyal customers and supporters remained steadfast. Apple swiftly addressed the technical issues, demonstrating its commitment to quality and customer satisfaction. As a result, trust in the brand was restored, and within a short period, Apple rebounded, showcasing the resilience of a robust brand bank account.Maintaining a healthy brand bank balance requires constant deposits, small and large. Withdrawals, even if they seem incredibly small, need to be taken seriously. A small issue can quickly snowball and create significant damage to a brand.Companies that Use Steve Jobs' Banking AnologyThe concept of brand bank balances is not just for large or well-established businesses. Every interaction, online or off, can lead to deposits or withdrawals.As a startup founder or a small business owner, you can look at businesses around you for examples and inspiration or consider these household name brands:The Ford Motor Company. In 2023, Ford noticed an issue with brake hoses and windshield wipers. Both could have endangered drivers, their passengers, and other road users, and the manufacturer decided to recall up to 1.5 million vehicles. Is that a deposit or a withdrawal? At face value, a recall would be a withdrawal. However, by being open with customers about the reasons for the recall, and streamlining the process to minimize the inconvenience for clients, Ford strengthened consumer relationships throughout the process.Peloton. Exercise equipment manufacturer Peloton did not fare so well when reports of potential safety issues started surfacing, including the death of a child. Rather than dealing with the reports proactively and initiating a recall, the company dragged its heels and eventually faced a $19 million fine.While that is a significant physical withdrawal from the company's bank account, it is arguably an even larger withdrawal from the company's brand bank account. Re-building consumer trust after being seen to be careless with the safety of users and their children will likely cost more time and investment than a timely recall would have done.Start Thinking Like Steve JobsPrioritizing consistent deposits into your brand bank account forms the basis of customer loyalty and significantly contributes to brand longevity. Even small deposits will add up over time like compound interest does in a real bank account. This concept is what makes this analogy so useful for businesses of any size and at any stage of their development. No matter whether your business is a very early-stage startup or you are working as a sole trader, Steve Jobs' 'secret sauce' can help you transform your business.In the next article, we discuss strategies for making better and smarter deposits into your brand bank account.

Everyone knows the exasperation of unnecessary friction.We've all navigated systems that create maddening ordeals rather than give us simple answers, services, or refunds. We've sat through endless meetings with blabbermouths and ill-defined agendas. We've pulled our hair out over rules, procedures, traditions, and technologies that once made sense, but are now antiquated, pointless, and inefficient. These are all soul-crushing forms of organizational friction that make it difficult to do simple things. And as professors at Stanford's School of Engineering and Graduate School of Business, we spent the last seven years researching the causes and cures for these problems.But one of our biggest discoveries surprised us. It turns out that friction isn't always a problem. In fact, sometimes it can be a solution.

7,What Big Brands Can Learn From Mom & Pop Shops to Connect With Their Customers,"Apr 3, 2024",Ben Crudo,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/what-big-brands-can-learn-from-mom-and-pop-stores-to/470830,"
For online retailers, the pandemic sales surge is officially ancient history.Direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands are filing for bankruptcy. Luxury retailers that raced online, like Louis Vuitton and Chanel, are licking their wounds. Globally, digital retail's share of total sales has flatlined at around 20%. If you're a big brand, the prognosis can look pretty grim unless, that is, you start thinking small. Online brands that are surviving and thriving are increasingly taking a page out of the playbook of much smaller retailers — especially when it comes to tech.As the founder of an agency that helps brands with ecommerce strategy, I've seen how smaller players are driven by the need to act fast and do more with less. That means adopting new and cost-effective tech before their larger peers. Resourceful and creative, retail small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are also intimately involved with their customers online. And unlike large companies, they don't have internal silos blocking their digital progress.



All of those strengths hold valuable lessons for big and growing retailers. Here's what they can learn from smaller brands when it comes to harnessing retail tech.Related: 4 Ways to Understand the Rise and Fall of DTC Brands


For your ecommerce platform, think speed and convenienceBecause they have to move fast, small retailers typically opt for an ecommerce platform that's robust, nimble and adaptable. The quicker they can stand up a site, and the less technical expertise required to sustain it, the better.Legacy enterprise platforms — costly, clunky and hard-to-customize — have long been the go-to for big brands. In the past, these were the only tools capable of reliably handling the volume of sales and SKUs of a major retailer. But that situation has changed.When the clothing retailer Banana Republic launched its furniture and home decor wing late last year, it went with an ecommerce platform originally known for serving small creators and entrepreneurs, Shopify.Why? At this point, every up-to-date platform has lots of bells and whistles. What actually matters isn't individual features as much as usability and flexibility. Does the platform have low barriers to launching a retail site? Does it have a robust app ecosystem that's integrated with its services? (Delivering on that front is Shopify, which has a marketplace of roughly 3,000 apps.) When it comes time to customize your site, does the platform have a host of agency and technology partners who can help get the job done?Think of choosing a platform like buying a car. You want something reliable, safe and easy to service — even if you may not know exactly how everything works under the hood.Outsource tech setup and customizationUnlike many other big retailers, Banana Republic also knew better than to build its own online platform. Major brands often fall into that trap, hiring huge engineering teams tasked with keeping ecommerce in-house.


News flash: Retailers aren't technology companies. They wouldn't rely on their in-house counsel to handle sensitive legal matters. So how is it any different for retail tech, a point of direct contact with customers?Retail SMBs are big fans of brand-new technology, with two-thirds saying they're open to embracing it. But startups know that the highest value comes from time spent on strategy, not getting in the weeds of implementation. That's why it's often better to outsource tech setup to an ecommerce agency.Because such firms typically deal with many different businesses, they have no shortage of tips and tricks to offer clients. They can also select the right platform, find the smart people a brand needs to compete online and play a key role in site customization.Related: 4 Ways Brands Can Educate Their Customers and Win Hearts


Invest in a direct line to customersSmaller online retailers also understand the power of using tech to connect directly with customers. This, after all, was the original promise of DTC commerce. Instead of sending your customers to a big box store or other middleman, you could cultivate a direct, personal relationship — providing better service and building lifetime loyalty in the process.To make the most of this pipeline, small retailers have long embraced tools that facilitate conversational commerce, i.e., one-on-one digital conversations with consumers. Way back in 2016, online clothing retailer Spring created its own live messaging and personal shopping service.Today, this trend continues. Because video, generative AI and other newer technologies for connecting with shoppers are affordable and accessible, smaller retailers have been first out of the gate with them, too. For example, energy drink startup EBoost is using shopper data to create ""digital twins"" of customers, then harnessing generative AI to chat with them, gaining insights into shoppers' future behavior.Small brands also excel at personalizing customer experiences and using technology to take this to the next level. This can take the form of everything from virtual appointments with in-store salespeople to fully personalized product recommendations based on customer history and preferences.Besides shrinking customer acquisition costs by as much as 50%, personalization can boost revenue by 5 to 15% and marketing ROI by 10 to 30%. Seven out of 10 consumers expect companies to offer personalized interactions, and three-quarters get frustrated when they don't deliver.Big brands are increasingly taking a page from this playbook. Through Nike By You, for instance, shoppers can create custom shoes by using a 3D model to choose colors and materials, plus their own ID.


Break down walls that hinder sales strategyBesides knowing their customers, small retailers have a clear, detailed picture of their ecommerce business itself — another strength that bigger players should strive to emulate.That's because their IT, customer service, merchandising and other departments are all — by necessity — in constant communication. So it's easier to see that the higher cost of drawing site traffic is hurting sales margins, for example, or that long shipping times are driving customers away. Smaller retailers can pounce on such problems and fix them.Big brands? Not so much. All of those business functions tend to be siloed, creating roadblocks that frustrate growth. In a recent survey by customer relationship management company Zendesk, only about one in five business leaders said their teams share data well.Here, too, choosing the right tools can help. Look for an ecommerce platform that gathers all of the crucial metrics — sales, conversion rate, visitor sessions — together in one place. It should also let retailers dig into and visualize that data with ease and then share it easily across the company.


For retail brands, technology is ultimately a means to an end: connecting with and serving customers. In a tough market, making smart tech choices can go a long way toward closing that gap.

9,The 3 Trusted Advisors Every Business Needs,"Mar 29, 2024",Frederick Royall III,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/3-advisors-every-business-owner-needs/471580,"
Entrepreneurs feel enormous pressure to meet ambitious goals and deliver for their customers, employees, investors and other stakeholders. The good news is that you don't have to go it alone.It's imperative to have a robust and strategically placed network of trusted partners, experts and advisors to lean on as you navigate challenges and reach new milestones. While there are numerous examples of external experts that business owners can benefit from and learn from, three stand out in my experience.1. A bankerBankers are at the center of the business ecosystem and are well-positioned to provide strategic guidance, facilitate connections and suggest comprehensive solutions to help you achieve your goals.



Over time, a banker could help provide:Expertise in capital structures and solutions: Your banker should be your go-to resource for assessing and optimizing your capital structure. They can provide deep knowledge on the types of solutions available to you — from something as simple as a line of credit to more complex offerings around debt and equity and tapping into the public and private markets. As you get up and running, you must establish a plan for managing cash flow and liquidity. They can help. Critically, a banker can also offer guidance on the best financial solutions to meet your operating needs today and achieve your long-term goals in the years to come.Strategic direction and guidance: Beyond traditional financial matters, a banker can provide insight into your overarching business strategy and help with goal setting. This may include reviewing your long-term plan, talking through your product set to determine if there are any gaps, and helping you consider domestic and global expansion.Expert network connections: Stemming from those strategic decisions, bankers can make introductions to essential partners, investors, and other industry experts to help you identify your next ample opportunity. In practice, this vital network can help guide you as you seek advice on more dynamic financial situations like navigating the supply chain, raising capital, entering new markets, structuring a governing board, implementing DEI practices, and so much more.In short, your banker should help you open doors and see around corners. They can help you tackle tough issues and solve pressing challenges and will be there to support you in the moments that matter.


Related: If You Want Your Clients to Truly Value You, You Need to Be Their Trusted Advisor. Here's How.2. An attorneyLike a banker, an attorney can advise your strategy and growth plans through a different but equally important lens. In my experience, in addition to legal counsel, attorneys bring exceptional industry knowledge and sound judgment and challenge you to think critically about your business.An attorney will focus on defining your business structure and can weigh in on the following:Contracts and agreements: Assistance crafting and negotiating documents such as contracts and non-disclosure agreements.Protecting what's yours: This includes protecting your intellectual property through patents, trademark registration and copyright protection.Implementing risk mitigation strategies: Identifying and navigating relevant laws, industry rules and regulations.Providing strategic counsel: Navigating complex legal landscapes, anticipating specific potential challenges and helping to safeguard your interests while promoting the long-term visibility of your business.When choosing an attorney, consider someone who specializes in your industry and the relevant area of law, has experience with your specific legal needs and has guided businesses through various growth stages. If you get it right, your attorney could bring a unique perspective to your company and pose questions you might not have considered.


Related: How to Find a Good Franchise Lawyer3. An accountantAn accountant is an essential member of your core team. They have a fiduciary responsibility to ensure the reporting, accounting and controls around your financial statement are reliable, timely and accurate. They can also provide significant value by implementing processes to prepare your business for key milestones.Working closely with the banking team, accountants can help:Simplify statements: An accountant will prepare and review statements to ensure accuracy and provide a clear overview of your business's financial health. They might conduct internal audits to ensure efficient financial processes or external audits for larger enterprises seeking outside funding.Maintain financial compliance: An accountant will work with you to ensure that your financial records are up to date, including tracking income, expenses and other financial transactions.Optimize administrative processes: Your internal accounting team will likely be responsible for all forms of process management, including, but not limited to, financial planning and forecasting, employee benefits, real estate and facilities, and physical and operational security. Engaging an external accountant can provide expertise around these tasks and help streamline processes and workflow.Related: 5 Tips for Finding a Great Advisor for Your Startup


A strong team for the long-termThroughout your entrepreneurial career, you will lean on and learn from many different experts. These three are just the beginning. Be methodical and diligent when searching for your trusted advisors, and don't be afraid to tap your network for referrals, seek out individuals at industry conferences, or reach out to other business owners whom you admire.Each person on your team should play an integral role, and the success of your business depends on your ability to fully trust them and their unique expertise. It takes time to build a team of trusted advisors, but if done right, I'm certain that this investment will pay dividends in the long term.

      Key Takeaways    



        Sarah Michelle Boes followed her passion for teaching into nursing school. 
      


        After passing her nurse practitioner's exam proved easier than expected, she wanted to instill confidence in others. 
      


        She put together her first course within a week of that exam — and became a millionaire within the year. 
      












This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sarah Michelle Boes, the founder of Sarah Michelle NP Reviews (SMNP), which was acquired by Blueprint Test Prep in 2022. Boes currently serves as the chief nursing officer for Blueprint Test Prep and hosts the podcast Becoming A Stress-Free Nurse Practitioner. She earned her BSN from the University of Kentucky, her MSN in Nursing Education from Western Governors University and her post-MSN-FNP from Eastern Kentucky University. The piece has been edited and condensed for clarity. Image Credit: Courtesy of Sarah Michelle BoesI grew up in rural Eastern Kentucky, and I always had this passion for being a teacher. I had my heart set on it. But my parents are teachers, and they're like, ""Absolutely not. You can't do that."" There are a lot of politics and bureaucracy within teaching. It's a lot more than just being an educator. Then, when I was a teenager, my grandmother was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. Without great access to premium healthcare in our area, we had to travel two hours to Lexington to get that diagnosis and receive a care plan that she could take back home. That was over the summer, so I went with her, and that was my first introduction to nursing at the Markey Cancer Center.



Those nurses were incredible. I feel like oncology nurses, in general, are kind of angels. Not only did they take care of her, but they also took care of me. It was just a great experience. So, knowing that I wasn't going to be able to be a teacher, I was like, Well, nursing — I feel like I could get something done. And there would be a teaching aspect because there's a lot of patient education, but I'd also get a human connection with people, which I thrive off of. So it was a no-brainer, and I attended the University of Kentucky, which guaranteed me admission to their program — and that's a really big deal.Related: This Nurse Turned $500 in Savings Into $100 Million in Sales After Sharing Her Hair Care Routine on YouTube. Now She's Revealing Her Secrets to Success.


I grappled with anxiety during nursing school. A class was notorious for weeding out people, and everyone dreaded taking it. I had a ton of anxiety in that class in particular, so much so that my instructor was like, ""I don't think nursing is for you. You're too anxious to be a safe nurse."" I had to choose to stay. The grading scale in nursing is also very different: In most programs, anything less than a 76 means you fail — and on the first exam in that class, I got a 74. I literally failed the first exam by one question. So I had to figure out how to contend with my anxiety, to think about the tools I could use.So, I started to figure out how to manage that class and my anxiety. Then, I began tutoring, ultimately quitting my full-time job as a manager to help students full-time. I taught them the skills that had helped me tackle that challenging class in a different way, and my anxiety didn't pick up again until I was a nurse practitioner — because it had been a long time since I'd taken a high-stakes exam. There was no one to turn to get perspective because I was the first nurse in my family, and I didn't know many people who were nurse practitioners.What's more, I took my nurse practitioner exam in the prime of Covid, May 2020. So it was chaos. Testing centers were down, and some places would let you take it online at home, but others wouldn't. By the time I took the exam in the middle of May, it had been canceled five times, three of which I'd already arrived at the testing center. So, there was a lot of anxiety involved. I was like, Am I ever going to take this test? My job is riding on this.Related: Nurse Makes $2 Million In One Year With Side Hustle Selling Class Notes Online


I was so stressed that I ended up breaking a tooth in my sleep because I was grinding them so hard. I was going to have to get a dental implant to the tune of $7,000; my hair was also falling out. But I finished the 175-question exam in less than an hour, and I passed. I was like, I can't believe I was stressing over this thing. This was so much easier than my nursing exam. All I needed was confidence in myself because I'd spent years in schools and hundreds of hours in clinical preparing. None of my reviews had given me that confidence.That realization — and the fact that I still had to pay for a $7,000 dental implant — motivated me to put together my first review course. I started my business because I was like, I can't afford this $7,000 implant. I figured if I put together a little review course and even just earned $500, that would help pay for it. And I started to think about how it could be done differently — how it could be less like someone lecturing you and more like studying with a friend. So, I came up with a Q&A approach, which I'd used as a tutor in nursing school and when I taught nursing students at the collegiate level.Within a week of passing the exam, I made my first three-hour course. I actually gave it out to all of my classmates for free. There were 30 of us, and I was like, ""Hey guys, I'll give you this course for free if you invite someone else into the group when I give it to you."" I gave the course to the first 100 people who came into the group. Then, not even a couple of days later, someone who had taken the course went on to pass, and it kind of exploded through word of mouth. It got wild really quickly. The first person I tried to sell it to for $25 got mad because her friend had gotten it for free, so she haggled me down to $15. Still, I made $1,000 on the first day I started selling, and I didn't even make $1,000 in a week as a nurse. I was like, What if I made $1,000 a day, every day? What would life look like?Related: Her 'Crude Prototype' and $50 Craigslist Purchase Launched a Side Hustle That Hit $1 Million in Sales — Now the Business Generates Up to $20 Million a Year


By the end of June and July, I'd surpassed what I used to make annually as a nurse. I told my nurse practitioner job I wouldn't be coming. I wanted to see how far I could take the business, but being reasonable and never having run a business before, I kept my full-time teaching job, just in case. But every spare hour I had, every weekend, was all about the business. Because I was so anxious about it being a startup, fragile and new, I waited to quit my teaching job until I made $1 million. We hit seven figures in seven months.About a year and a half in, I was still using third-party software to host my courses — nothing was in-house or really in unison. It got to the point where my students were literally breaking the software; I needed my own. We actually spent $100,000 trying to build an app that ended up completely falling apart. That was really hard, but we just kept running up against technology, and I realized I was the bottleneck to this thing. The business wanted to grow, so I started looking into other options.We considered a sale and put out some teasers, hoping to get constructive feedback. As it turned out, the test prep provider Blueprint had some internal meetings about the prospect before I even sent out the teaser. They had medical stuff, and they had LSAT stuff, but they didn't have any nursing material at the time. And I wanted to take some pressure off myself because a week into sending out the teasers, I found out I was pregnant. I never want people to think I sold because I was pregnant; it just coincided with the timing.Related: I Turned My Side Hustle Into a Passive Income Stream That's Earned More Than $1 Million — But Making Money Isn't Even the Best Part


We loved the Blueprint team, but the deal just wasn't right at first. My husband and I had decided on a number before we had a single conversation, and I'd recommend any entrepreneur do the same. Otherwise, it can be hard to navigate a deal when emotions are running high. So the first deal wasn't our number, and we walked away. Then they came back with our number, and we ended up selling around the two-year mark. That money has been life-changing.At 36 weeks pregnant, we found out that my daughter was going to have a congenital heart defect. We had no idea. So everything kind of flipped on its head really quickly. When I gave birth, the money gave us the flexibility and ability to be with our daughter when she needed it the very most. She had six surgeries in her first five months of life, two of which were open-heart surgeries. So, very crazy, chaotic times, and what a blessing to be able to have not only a maternity leave, but also a medical leave, and to be able to be fully present for that — and not only me but also my husband. We could be there together and support one another.Now, my daughter is 19 months old, and for the past year, we've been working to do a legacy gift to our local children's hospital, where they literally saved her life. Hopefully, next month, fingers crossed, everything's going to be finished, and they're actually going to dedicate the Norton Children's Heart Institute to my daughter. They are trying to build out a premier heart program there, and you have to have the funds to be able to do that. So the money gives us a lot of freedom and flexibility — my husband's also starting up his own business — but our work with the children's hospital is the most meaningful and impactful accomplishment.This article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of being a Young Entrepreneur®.

      Key Takeaways    



        Micro-home community South Park Cottages offers locals an affordable alternative to renting. 
      


        Homes in the community start at $190,000, and the typical monthly mortgage payment is around $1,500.

The interior of a home at South Park Cottages.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Booker Washington dreamed of building a community where everyday people could afford to buy a homeEnter South Park Cottages, a village of 29 tiny homes just outside Atlanta that opened in 2023 with prices from $190,000 to $230,000.Compare that to the typical home sold in Atlanta, which Redfin found cost $431,250 as of February 2024.The demand was clear: All 29 homes — one- and two-bedroom units ranging from 400 to 650 square feet — sold out over a year before they were even built and less than two months after hitting the market.



Washington, the 41-year-old owner and founder of micro-home-builder Techie Homes, wanted to offer locals an alternative to renting or buying a traditional single-family home.""Accessible homeownership is an issue in Atlanta,"" he said. ""Our goal is to provide homes at a price point where mortgages are equal to or less than the cost of renting a one-bedroom apartment.""Located in College Park, Georgia, South Park Cottages has been so successful that Washington is building a second community, Union Park Cottages, nearby. Sales for its 26 homes launch later this month.South Park Cottages is also the first Black-owned micro-home community in the Atlanta area. Take a look around.


In 2022, after being rejected by investors and banks, Washington crowdsourced $2 million for the development's construction.The first sketch of the South Park Cottages' layout. Courtesy of Techie Homes via BIWashington spread the word about his vision by word of mouth, garnering support from locals and Bianca Motley Broom, the mayor of College Park since 2020.""Because no one believed in my dream, we went to the people in order to build that community,"" Washington said.""I think there's pent-up anger in urban areas about capital equality. Even if it's a marginal investment return, people want to be a part of something good.""


Backers, who contributed amounts as low as $1,000, were promised a return on their investment once the homes were sold, Washington said.The average rate of return was 12%, he added.Techie Homes acquired the land for South Park Cottages for $150,000 in October 2021 and construction was completed 18 months later.Homes in construction at South Park Cottages. Courtesy of Techie Homes via BIHomes in the community range from 400 to 650 square feet and are two stories tall.Some homes have one bedroom and others have two. All homes have one bathroom, along with a complete kitchen, living room, and laundry.The 29 homes in South Park Cottages went up for presale in January 2022, and sold out within 50 days of hitting the market. Homes were sold on a first-come, first-served basis rather than via bidding wars.The community's homes have three different home layouts.A digital rendering of a home at South Park Cottages. Courtesy of Techie Homes via BIOne of the homes' three layouts features a 10-foot ceiling, an open loft, and floor-to-ceiling windows.The units also feature ""high-grade soundproofing insulation"" within the walls to keep utility bills low, Washington said.Washington wanted each home to feel both luxurious and comfortable.Homes at South Park Cottages.Courtesy of Techie HomesEach home is furnished with smart technology, including self-learning and programmable thermostats, Bluetooth surround-sound speakers, and smart refrigerators, Washington said.Their high ceilings and large windows provide ample natural light and a spacious feel.""We can provide what are called 'luxuries' in other new-construction builds,"" he added.The community covers two and a half acres.An aerial shot of South Park Cottages.Courtesy of Techie HomesSouth Park Cottages has some communal amenities, including a quarter-mile trail for bikers and pedestrians and a 2,000-square-foot fruit and vegetable garden.Residents enjoy gathering around the fire pit.The fire pit at South Park Cottages.Courtesy of Techie Homes


""We don't have a gym or a clubhouse because of the density of homes,"" Washington said. ""But we do have a lot of communal and connection touch points within the community.""A homeowners association, or HOA, governs the community.A walking path at South Park Cottages.Courtesy of Techie HomesThe homeowners association is made up of residents from various ages and walks of life.""Our demographics range from ages 25 to 65, with incomes ranging from $50,000 to millionaires,"" Washington said. ""We have entrepreneurs, teachers, and medical professionals. We also have people that work in blue-collar jobs.""It gives the community a homier feel than using a property management company, he added.South Park Cottages residents have the opportunity to build equity.Another angle of the homes at South Park Cottages.Courtesy of Techie HomesMany tiny-home villages in the US are geared toward renters, but South Park Cottages homes were available for purchase.Homeowners were allowed to choose their preferred lender, Washington said, and the typical monthly mortgage payment is about $1,500.The average rent in Atlanta is $2,100 a month, according to Zillow.Washington said he feels homeowners at South Park Cottages get good value for their money.A living room in a home at South Park Cottages.Courtesy of Techie Homes


Home prices in Atlanta have been steadily increasing. According to Redfin, the median home price in Atlanta of $431,250 is 12% higher than the same time in 2023.The high cost of housing in Atlanta is partly due to an influx of new residents attracted by the city's booming job market and relatively low home prices compared to cities like California and New York.Transplants often make housing more expensive, pricing out some locals.Washington said the community has made a profit for investors.A nighttime view of the homes at South Park Cottages.Courtesy of Techie HomesWashington declined to share how much it cost to build each home but hinted that it was low enough to make a profit.""We achieved somewhere between 30% and 40% of margin within our for-sale price and build-cost price,"" he said, adding that the lower price of construction is ""good for the business and homeowners"" because it allows Techie Homes to keep sale prices affordable.


According to Washington, the community is valued at $6.1 million.The popularity of South Park Cottages inspired Washington to develop a new community in nearby Union City.Washington, the founder and owner of Techie Homes.Courtesy of Techie HomesUnion City, another suburb of Atlanta, is just 15 minutes away from South Park.It will have 26 homes from 625 to 675 square feet, with prices from $230,000 to $250,000. All the units will have two bedrooms and one bathroom, but some will be one-story ranch-style houses and others will be two-story residences.Construction for the community, named Union Park Cottages, will begin on March 26.Homes at Union Park Cottages are scheduled for presale on March 28 and currently have a 3,000-person waitlist, Washington said.


Residents of Union Park Cottages will also have the chance to build equity through a commercial space in the community.Washington at a construction site. Courtesy of Techie Homes via BIA planned mixed-use commercial space at Union Park Cottages will feature a coffee shop, a lounge, and a coworking space.Residents of the community who are a part of the homeowners association will hold a 10% equity stake in the retail center, according to Washington.


""Every month when the proprietor pays into their lease, 10% of the proceeds will go to the homeowners association,"" Washington said. ""The association will disperse the proceeds from the retail center to the current homeowners on record.""

13,4 Vital Lessons This Tech Entrepreneur Learned To Build a $4 Billion Company,"Mar 18, 2024",Jon Bier,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-vital-lessons-this-tech-entrepreneur-learned-to-build-a/470909,"
When Will Ahmed launched his wearable tech company WHOOP, the odds of success were not in his favor. The iconic company Nike had just entered the space with its own wearable product, FuelBand. How could Ahmed's startup possibly compete with an international powerhouse whose name literally comes from the Greek goddess of victory?It turns out quite well. Nike discontinued the FuelBand in 2014, while WHOOP became a $4 billion company. How did Ahmed slay the swoosh—not to mention other competitors in the space, such as Microsoft, Google, Fitbit, and Jawbone? He credits his success to a combination of a well-defined strategy and a healthy dose of naivete.""I had an idea for a product that I thought should exist in the world. And it didn't make sense to me why that product didn't exist. I thought it should be there,"" he said on my podcast One day with Jon Bier.



 Here are four key takeaways from our lively conversation.


Learn from the greatsIronically, Ahmed's strategy for WHOOP took a page out of Nike's playbook of old. Back in the days of Air Jordans and ""Bo Knows,"" Nike had ""a deep obsession with creating a shoe that could make athletes run faster,"" recalls Ahmed. However, Nike didn't use the same strategy for FuelBand, which it raced out to market without consulting athletes.""If I were Nike, I would have [asked] how do we start at the tip of the pyramid? We need this to be something LeBron wears, Serena wears, and Tiger wears. Then we're going to tell that story and bring it to the masses,"" he says. They just skipped that whole step… They didn't validate it with their athletes.""Conversely, Ahmed did extensive market research before his launch, giving him an advantage over competitors.Related: The Extraordinary Career of Nike Founder Phil Knight - Biography


Make technology the servant, not the masterSometimes, you want a product that whispers instead of shouts. Ahmed rejects the idea that wearables should be a constant companion, always vying for our attention.""Technology should improve your life, not invade it,"" he says.That's why WHOOP quietly collects data without demanding the wearer's constant engagement.""We wanted to collect this information in the background and then say the right things at the right moments,"" he says. ""There's a certain principle behind that, which is to have the product disappear in the background on your behalf.""


Don't fear failure— but don't idealize it, eitherAhmed believes that the fear of failure has killed many great ideas before they've had a chance to become a reality. But he also thinks that in today's tech culture, ""failure has been romanticized as sort of an appropriate end state. There are a lot of these weird phrases in the technology industry, like, 'test, iterate, fail.'""Instead of focusing on our failures, he says we should embrace our successes.In building a WHOOP, there were a number of moments where we were on the razor's edge of failure, and what it took to overcome those moments was a profound level of focus, pain management, overcoming stress,"" Ahmed recalls. ""I have a lot of pride in that. I feel a connection to that younger self and the team around me that was able to pull through that darkness when the company almost failed.""Related: 10 Lessons About Failure That Every Entrepreneur Needs to Know


Lean into gratitudeAhmed says that many entrepreneurs chase dopamine by setting goals and reaching them. The problem is that success never feels as good as we think it will, so we keep moving the goalposts until we're numb to any real happiness.His solution is to inject some gratitude into his life.""I know this will sound a little woo-woo to some people, but gratitude releases serotonin. That's another way to make yourself feel happy,"" he says. ""Gratitude is appreciating where you are, and the team you're with, and that is the sort of happiness unlock to the hard-driving entrepreneur.""How does he practice gratitude? ""I meditate first thing in the morning, and as part of that, I actively think about things I'm grateful for,"" he says. ""I also have a journaling practice where I write down three things I'm grateful for.""


This can be as simple as his morning cup of coffee, a loving look from his wife, or maybe even beating out Nike in 2014.Related: Why Gratitude Makes Leaders More Effective

14,3 Ways Founders Can Connect With Their Customers to Drive Sales,"Mar 18, 2024",Thomas Strider,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-effective-ways-to-connect-with-your-customers/470871,"
In today's market, the bond between founders and customers is more than a transaction; it's the cornerstone of sustainable growth and brand loyalty. Modern consumers want authenticity more than ever. They find it difficult to connect with faceless entities and want to follow people rather than businesses.This shift towards personal connection in marketing stems from a saturated market where consumers are bombarded with choices and advertisements daily. Personal stories and authentic interactions cut through the noise in this crowded space, creating a memorable impression. Consumers crave realness and transparency at a time when these qualities are scarce in the world of business.So, how do you go about deepening your connection with your target audience? Here are three strategies that can turn your customer interactions into a powerful engine for sales growth.



1. Personalize your approach with behind-the-scenes storytellingIt's one thing to sell a product. It's another to tell a story and share fascinating details that resonate.Imagine a founder sharing their journey, the highs and lows, through a series of behind-the-scenes content. This narrative isn't about humanizing the brand; it's about creating a shared experience. When customers see the sweat and tears behind a product, they're not just buying an item; they're investing in a piece of your process and founder's story.


So, how do you start?Weekly emails or social media posts that peel back the curtain on your process make customers feel like they're part of your journey. To do this effectively, begin by mapping out key milestones in your company's history or product development process. For each milestone, identify a story or challenge you faced and how you overcame it. These stories form the basis of your content.Next, use visuals like photos, videos, or even simple sketches to bring these stories to life. Visual content not only increases engagement but also helps to humanize your brand further.In your communication, be transparent about the obstacles you've encountered and how you've addressed them. This transparency fosters trust and relatability. Moreover, invite your audience to contribute their thoughts or similar experiences through comments or direct messages, turning your storytelling into a two-way conversation.


Publicly tell people the ""why"" behind your products, services, and company by integrating customer testimonials or user-generated content that aligns with your narrative. This validates your claims and amplifies your community's voice, making your brand's story part of their own stories.Like successful pitch decks showcase the story behind your brand, so should your content marketing and advertisements. Bringing the ""real"" to your business breeds authenticity, and that authentic connection will drive your business's growth. Remember, the goal is to broadcast and engage in meaningful conversations that build long-term relationships.Related: 8 Effective Ways to Connect With Your Customers2. Leverage technology for personal connectionsAI tools are booming, so personal connection using automation seems like an oxymoron. Yet, technology can be the very tool that brings you closer to your ICP.


Consider implementing AI chatbots that do more than answer queries. Work with tools, consultants, and language model professionals to custom-tailor AI to chat with your customers.Implement these chatbots on your company website and train them to initiate conversations based on customer behavior. Offer personalized recommendations or even simply check in with website visitors. Sometimes, a simple ""How are things going?"" goes a long way, and this part of your customer experience can be automated.This approach won't replace human interaction, of course, but it will enhance it by making your brand present and proactive in your customer's lives.The key? Ensure these AI communications feel personal and specific, not just like another automated message in their inbox or as a popup. This takes a bit more effort to implement, but the investment is worth it for the long-term growth of your brand and business.

Create exclusive communitiesImagine a space where your customers can gather to discuss your product and share their stories, challenges and triumphs.There's a particular company on the rise called Skool, which enables businesses and personal brands alike to do just this. Other great platform choices, such as Circle, Mighty Networks or Kajabi, enable seamless community building. These platforms allow you to make posts and help your customers, but they also give users the flexibility to post and communicate with each other.An exclusive community for customer discussion could take many other forms as well: a Facebook group, a Slack channel or a dedicated forum on your website.


The goal for your community is to foster a sense of belonging and mutual support, turning your customer base into a tight-knit community. Offer insider access, sneak peeks, and the opportunity for feedback. The more valued and listened that customers feel, the more likely they are to advocate for your brand organically.Over the long term, these communities become a word-of-mouth marketing machine.

And I think they respect that and they understand that. Walking out that door is a moment I'll never forget and one I'll cherish forever.""


The meaning of his mantra ""Choose Hard""""It all started a couple of years ago when I was in the Notre Dame weight room and was working out as our players were being pushed hard. And I remember thinking that you can choose to go through the motions or you can choose to go as hard as you can. And that's when I came up with this thought of 'Choose Hard.' We put up a sign you see when you walk into this building that says 'Choose Hard.' Because when you walk into Notre Dame football, you've got to have that mindset. We're going to choose hard today in practice, choose hard today in meetings, choose hard today in the weight room. And for the players, you're going to be challenged in the classroom, right? You're going to be in class with some of the most intelligent people in this world. And it's difficult, but ultimately you've chosen to come here so choose hard, accept it, and know that the rewards from choosing hard every single day can't be found anywhere else.""Related: He Built a Personal Finance App That Manages $8 Billion for Half a Million Customers. Here Is the CEO of M1's Hard-Earned Advice for Future Founders.Problem-solving philosophy""When a team isn't winning, a lot of people say, trust the process. My mantra is: fix the process. I spend a lot of time evaluating everything we were doing. Why aren't we playing better? What are we doing schematically? Is there something our players don't understand? Losses happen and it's a part of life. But they hurt. As a leader, you don't want to have too many. Fix it with urgency.""Related: The CEO of Catholic Prayer and Meditation App Hallow Says Founders Need to Be Part of Something Bigger Than Themselves


Retaining players in the age of the transfer portal ""Look, if you're the CEO of a company, you got to pay your employees, right? Now if they can go somewhere else and make a lot more money, no matter what type of company you're running, they're going to probably leave. So we have to make sure that our players can maximize the opportunities of name, image and likeness. That's important, but what else keeps them at Notre Dame? What else attracts them here? And you've got to believe it's your culture. You've got to believe it's the way they're treated. Do they enjoy being part of your program? That's so important. And that's a message for myself and our other coaches. Let's make sure that as hard as we push them, as demanding as we are, we are not demeaning. We want them to enjoy being a part of this team and all of the opportunities that the University of Notre Dame provides.""Check out more profiles of innovative and impactful leaders by visiting The CEO Series archives.

16,From $0 to $10 Million — Here's How to Build a Winning Prop Trading Team,"Mar 15, 2024",Blake Olson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-build-a-winning-prop-trading-team/470675,"
Some issues in prop trading are the same as those faced in any niche, but some are unique to this constantly evolving segment. When I look at the structure, staff and technology from 12 months ago, my company is almost unrecognizable.Without the right mindset, keeping a handle on growth can be a bit like juggling chainsaws.The pivotal role of technologyTechnology is the lifeblood of the trading industry. By definition, our business only exists online. The rapid evolution of tools and platforms can dramatically alter the landscape overnight. We've seen this firsthand.



Leaders in this sector must exhibit an exceptional degree of technological savvy and an ""anticipatory"" vision to foresee and adapt to these changes. The adoption of new technologies forces a culture of continuous learning and innovation within the team. There is no such thing as the status quo!Team members who are slow to pursue ongoing education, experiment with new tools and dedicate time to strategic thinking don't last long. The desire to adapt is required for growth and competitive advantage.


Related: Earn Through a Recession by Learning Stock Trading StrategiesHarnessing diversityThe global nature of trading today means teams contain a variety of cultural and professional backgrounds. Our current team is spread over five different countries. This diversity, while a tremendous asset, also presents unique leadership challenges.Effective leaders must promote a cohesive team environment where every member feels valued and understood regardless of background and location. Solutions to lessen the ""artificial isolation"" team members from other parts of the world can experience are essential. This involves using technology to facilitate communication across different time zones, fostering an inclusive culture and seeing it as a strength rather than an obstacle.One example is having occasional video conferences that are not business-specific. They allow time for team members to speak freely about their lives, making a connection that business-only video calls don't allow for. You'd be amazed at the personal details that have come out of these calls. Everyone enjoys these moments. (And yes, everyone's camera must be on!)


Invariably, we see innovation and closer collaboration as a welcome result.Balancing the dynamics of contractors and full-time employeesProp trading is no different than every other company out there. Our team faces the ""contractors and full-time employees"" issue. We all know companies that failed to handle this properly and paid dearly.This mix can enrich the team with flexibility and specialized skills. Still, it also requires careful management to ensure everyone is on the same page and working steadily toward the company's goals.During a growth phase, when certain roles expand while others vanish, it's vital to constantly ask the question, ""Is this best handled internally, or will we outgrow this need in 6 months?""


Leaders must integrate these contributors, ensure clear communication and set firm expectations. Verbalizing clear expectations saves a lot of headaches. This issue mirrors the geographic challenge just mentioned. Promoting an environment where contracts feel ""vested"" in the company vision.There's another concept in play here. The principle of ""fire fast, hire slow"". I don't mean this in a purely ruthless sense. But having the readiness to make tough decisions is a spark for growth.Ensure that every member's presence is not just warranted but beneficial for the collective goal. Again, this philosophy is not rooted in a lack of compassion but in a commitment to excellence and the team's long-term success.Upholding integrity as a core valuesThe temptation for quick gains in the prop industry can lead to ethical quandaries with clients and business entities alike. Integrity is non-negotiable.


Bad actors exist in every niche. Unfortunately, prop trading is not immune from this. This makes it even more important for leaders to adhere to the highest ethical standards themselves and to instill these values in their teams.This involves creating a culture where ethical behavior is recognized and rewarded and where team members feel comfortable voicing concerns. Customer service sees different behaviors from clients than the tech team on the back end.As a rule, whenever cash changes hands or profits are on the line, someone will create a way to skirt the rules. By prioritizing integrity, leaders build a team that not only achieves success but also does so respectfully and legally. And in line with the company's long-term vision.Adapting team composition for future challengesThe skill sets and mindsets that contributed to initial successes may not indicate future success. Leaders must be vigilant in assessing the team's capabilities and ready to make adjustments as needed.


This might involve seeking out new talents with specific expertise or redefining roles within the team to better align with strategic goals. The same talent pool that gets a company $0 to $1 million in annual revenue is unlikely to be the one in place from $10 million to $50 million. Spotting ""talent bottlenecks"" is an acquired skill. But it is very necessary.Related: Learn Candlestick Trading: This E-learning Bundle Is $25 This Week OnlyThe art of leading a trading team to successLeading any team to success is an art that requires a blend of strategic foresight, technological proficiency and evolving interpersonal skills.Short version: If I had to pick a trait that pinpoints someone likely to stick with you through growth and challenge, I'd likely go with a desire for continuous learning.


By embracing these principles, leaders can build resilient, adaptable teams capable of sustained growth and even friendship. The journey is demanding, but I've found the rewards of cultivating a high-performing, ethically grounded team immeasurable.

      Key Takeaways    



        Small mistakes can lead to big setbacks in the future — make sure you have all your ducks in a row.
      


        Learn how to be comfortable with hearing a lot of ""no's"" before you finally hear a ""yes.""
      


        When starting a business, expand your thinking when it comes to how to fund it.
      












    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

""I didn't see myself reflected in the fragrance industry,"" says Brianna Arps, founder and CEO of MOODEAUX, on why she decided to start building her business back in 2017. ""I remember watching these commercials with a half naked man running across beaches and other advertising gimmicks that didn't always make sense.""Arps started her career as an investigative journalist covering beauty, fashion and lifestyle beats. In 2018, she found out she was let go when she opened her company laptop to discover her email access had been revoked. ""The pressure to make a name for myself in this industry had consumed me for years,"" says Arps. ""I didn't realize that my self-worth became tightly entangled with my career until it was too late.""She recalls the panicked train ride back to her apartment on the day of her layoff. The panic evolved into depression, which worsened the longer she spent unemployed. She credits her self-care rituals — finding comfort and healing with fragrance — which helped her through this difficult time and also became the moment MOODEAUX was born.



""The layoff redirected me to what I was meant to do next, and that was to build MOODEAUX,"" Arps says. ""And of course I had doubts along the way. What qualifies me to build and run a business? I had to quiet that inner critic and say, 'I am going to qualify myself to do this and build this.'""For Arps, buying and wearing fragrances has always been an affirming act that brings joy, excitement and comfort with each spritz. MOODEAUX leans into educating consumers and creating scents to help ""flaunt how you feel."" As a child, Arps recalls trying all the fragrances her mother and grandmother had on their dressers. ""I've been into fragrance since forever thanks to the most important and best-smelling women I know: my mom, Cynthia, and my late grandma, Minnie. They took tremendous pride in creating routines centered around their entire well-being.""


As she continues to grow and scale her company, here's the advice Arps has to share with other aspiring entrepreneurs.Related: She Maxed Out Her Credit Cards and Sold Her Engagement Ring to Start a Business. Now She Has $25 Million in Funding — and Smart Advice for Fellow Black Women Founders.Image Credit: Risa Dexter1. Understand that small mistakes can lead to big setbacks in the future""MOODEAUX wasn't always our company name. It used to be 'Moode Beaute,' until my previous trademark attorney shared some bad news,"" says Arps. ""When we went to file for registration in late 2019, she discovered another entity with similar spelling had beaten us to the punch by a mere few days. I cried like a baby — primarily because, by that point, I spent thousands of dollars on branding we could never use.""


Arps continued to spend more time brainstorming and working with her trademark attorney, before finally settling on the name MOODEAUX. It was an important reminder for her to not neglect the legal matters of your business. She reminds founders to make sure you can claim trademark rights by filing for them in a timely manner, and hiring a trademark attorney with expertise you may not have. ""Small mistakes or oversights, like not trademarking your name early on, can lead to big setbacks and challenges in the future if you're not careful.""2. Get comfortable receiving lots of no's, the yes will come""Be prepared to get more no's than the yes you are waiting for,"" Arps says. ""Out of hundreds of conversations, meetings and applications on the road to get more funding for MOODEAUX, I received about 10 yeses."" Arps encourages founders to build up their internal fortitude, lean on patience and persistence, and prepare for the potentially long road ahead. She also acknowledges that most women of color have to work harder than their peers to get that yes. And each no helped her to reflect and redirect her energies to reaching out to individuals who would believe in her, celebrate her and support her vision for MOODEAUX.""I would meet with venture capital funds who would say no for now, and say, 'Come back to us when you launch in this retailer, then we will invest,'"" Arps says. ""Then we would launch in that retailer, then they would say, 'Okay, come back again when you hit your sales target.' The goalpost they set kept changing, moving again and again. It was like I would never be good enough for them, and I had to work hard not to internalize that.""Related: This Black Founder Was Gaslit By Her Doctor During Pregnancy. The Experience Drove Her to Create a Community for Expectant Moms.


3. Expand your thinking when it comes to fundingArps reminds founders that there are so many different ways to fund and scale your business. While traditional venture capital funds were impressed with the trajectory of MOODEAUX, some weren't convinced. ""I was tired of feeling like I was on that hamster wheel, and needed to think about different ways to fund the business,"" Arps says. ""I didn't need that splashy press release to say we were working with some big fund, I needed cash to scale. I needed money in the bank.""Arps focused on raising money in an unconventional way: through accelerators and competitions where grants are given out. ""Accelerators are a great way to also learn and help you level up your business,"" Arps says. ""You not only get a cash infusion but you are also learning. When you are finished, you are undeniable."" She also encourages founders to consider a small bank loan and to not be ashamed or afraid to ask friends and family to invest in your business.""I don't feel inclined to chase that fancy headline and that spotlight,"" says Arps. ""I'm always going to go where I am celebrated, where people embrace Black ambition and understand the trajectory of MOODEAUX, plus our ability to bring forth positive change within the fragrance industry.""

      Key Takeaways    



        I make $125,000 working at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
      


        I own consulting agency Juntero Design, which began as a side hustle.
      


        I'm passionate about Juntero's new subscription-based model, which provides a range of services for a fixed rate.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Chisom Okwulehie, who started consulting agency Juntero as a side hustle when she was an employee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The piece has been edited for length and clarity. In 2017, I started working at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, where I design and manage infrastructure projects. At the height of the pandemic in 2020, I'd had my first child and was told we wouldn't receive a merit-based pay increase at work, so I wanted to find ways to supplement my income. My father always told me and my siblings that if your spouse dies, you have to be able to cover the mortgage and support your family. I'm a big advocate for diversified income.So, I started Juntero as a side hustle with my husband. Now, it's a corporation that we co-own, split into two subsidiary companies or studios: Juntero Design and Juntero Technology. My husband owns Juntero Technology; I own Juntero Design. Today, Juntero is a full-fledged design and technology business, but it all started with me taking on small projects on different platforms and charging as little as $20.



Back then, I watched a lot of YouTube tutorials to prepare and experimented with my different talents — web design, photo editing, graphic design, architecture design and interior design. People gravitated towards my architecture and interior design services. Initially, I kept my prices low to build a portfolio and accumulate strong testimonials. That credibility is the greatest currency and helped me increase my visibility; for every 10 pieces of positive feedback, I'd raise my hourly rate by $20. Eventually, I learned not to trade my time for money and switched to fixed rates.Related: At 23, She Started a Side Hustle for 'Quick Money.' Now the Business Brings in More Than $1 Million a Month — and Boasts Celebrity Fans.


I made about $55,000 that year, and over $200,000 the next. Then, in 2023, I exceeded $400,000.Then, near the end of 2021, I realized that I couldn't help as many clients as I wanted, so I had to put my ego aside and trust other people. I started hiring other designers on a project-based model. They're not employees; they're contractors. So, since 2022, I've outsourced more than 90% of the work. That helped me scale the business even more. I made about $55,000 that year and over $200,000 the next. Then, in 2023, I exceeded $400,000.At Port Authority, my salary is $125,000. The net profits at Juntero alone are higher than my 9-5 salary, but I plan to stay at Port Authority. Some people think I'm crazy, but I'm on a public student loan forgiveness program and have three years left. Also, I learn so much from my colleagues' expertise.Now that I'm not on the production side of Juntero, I spend more time on marketing and client management. We have two payment structures: a one-time payment model and a subscription-based model. I've spent a lot of time marketing the subscription model. It's an idea that came to me last year. One of my major clients is a developer, so with the subscription model, she can pay the monthly rate and access our services for a range of tasks.


Related: How to Go From Side Hustle to 7-Figure Business and Beyond, According to 3 Women Who Did ItA marketer could hire a designer at $100,000 a year or enroll with my service and see even more output. So it's a huge cost savings.I'm very passionate about the subscription model because it's a game changer: It's allowing companies that don't have creative teams to enroll in a membership program and access my creative team for a consistent flow of deliverables, whether it be drawings or 3D models. And it helps these businesses scale, too. One of my clients uses my renderings to consistently sell multimillion-dollar homes over the asking price. With the subscription model, these companies can have five people doing the work for the salary of one; for instance, a marketer could hire a designer at $100,000 a year or enroll with my service and see even more output. So it's a huge cost savings.Related: I Turned My Side Hustle Into a Passive Income Stream That's Earned More Than $1 Million — But Making Money Isn't Even the Best Part


It's essential to diversify your income, especially in this economy. You have to plan for your future and retirement, and you can't rely on your 9-5. If you have the patience, due diligence and organization skills, you should figure out ways to monetize your talents. Make the time to focus on your craft, but only do it if you love it — because you don't want to face burnout.This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

With people spending so much time on social media and the internet, consumers see more brands than ever, which means they also have a more finely tuned awareness of aesthetics and brand idententies. In a 2023 survey, market research firm Hanover found that 75% percent of companies have overhauled their visual identities since 2020, and Lucidpress found that 45% of customers ""expect great design across marketing and sales collateral."" In other words, an outdated aesethetic costs you money. At the same time, no company can afford to revamp their design every few years, so it's important to find a look that stands out, and stands the test of time. Here, we talked to six brands on how they found a look that sparkles while conveying their core values.Image Credit: Courtesy of Methodology

23,How to Know If Your Business Is Profitable This Very Second,"Feb 26, 2024",Jim Conroy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-to-know-if-your-business-is-profitable-this-very-second/469484,"
Here's an example: Alex owns a custom framing store with low prices — just above cost — to attract customers. Volume helped keep the cash coming in. One wall of the shop was devoted to artist's paintings, for which Alex received a percentage of the sale. Until a stationery store opened down the block, Alex was the only person in the area who offered custom framing. In addition to pens and printer paper, the stationery shop devoted a corner to custom framing at 20% less than what Alex charged. Alex quickly put a big sign in the window promoting the same price as the stationery shop — and finished the month in the red.You probably recognize Alex's mistake was changing his prices without assessing how it would affect profitability. It didn't help that Alex didn't know whether the framing shop was profitable to begin with.Alex's reactive pricing decision is one of many that a business finds itself needing to make every day. A contractor must decide on the number of workers to bring on board. A growing business may be offered a great deal on manufacturing equipment for cash today. In these cases, there may not be time to run the numbers to make a decision.



Related: Why This Metric Should Be Prioritized Over Growth for Startup SuccessHow is profit determined?Your profit is the amount you have left after accounting for the cost of operating your business. It's different from your revenue. Here it is expressed as a formula: total revenue - total expenses = profit.


Total revenue is all the money that comes into your business. For Alex's business, it's the money paid for framing plus the money received as a percentage of the paintings on the wall. If framing yielded $84,000 and the painting commissions yielded $24,000, Alex's revenue for the year is $108,000.Alex's total expenses include the materials needed for framing, the shop's rent, utilities and supplies. These add up to $96,000 for the year. Using the basic formula, $108,000 - $96,000 = $12,000 profit.That's not much wiggle room. A 20% drop in framing revenue means an annual revenue of $67,200; with the painting commissions, you're looking at $91,200. If expenses don't change, Alex's framing shop is now unprofitable to the tune of $4,800.What does knowing your profitability let you do?Before the new competition showed up, all Alex knew was that the framing business paid its bills with a little left over. When the market changed, Alex needed to determine how to react.


Knowing exactly where the shop stood might have changed Alex's decision. He might have chosen to reduce prices by only 10% — or not at all — or he may have looked for a way to reduce expenses, like finding a less expensive space to rent.Knowing the profitability of any business enables the owner to react quickly. That can be the difference between profit and loss, as in the case above, or it can add profit. For instance, knowing that there was a $1,000 profit every month might have prompted Alex to rent a stall at a farmer's market for $100 a month, which could have led to $500 worth of extra business, or he could have put more paintings in the shop for sale.Business circumstances change and gainful opportunities present themselves at any time. Not every decision needs to be made in a split-second. However, if you can make one quickly, it can make or break your business. This can also be important if you've taken a loan out for your business. If your profitability is different than what you'd presented to your bank, it might affect the loan terms or interest rate. If your profit is less than expected because of the cost of needed materials, you can find a new vendor.Related: Don't File and Forget: Use Your Receipts to Gain Insight on Business Spending


How do you know whether you're profitable?To get a full picture of your condition, consider using the following tools:Profit and loss statement (or income statement). The basic math for this was covered above, but there can be a large number of elements that go into your profit and loss statement. If you know these now, you can make a decision now.Cash flow statement. A cash flow statement focuses on liquidity. In the example of Alex's framing shop, suppose the commission on paintings was paid only once per year. Alex would be in the red most of the year. The essential formula is:Cash inflow - cash outflow = net cash flow. Cash inflow is any source of incoming cash; sales is the big one. Cash outflow is any source of outgoing cash such as rent, utilities, and taxes.Revenue vs. expenses analysis. Total your revenues and your expenses over a period (say, this month) and compare those to another period (for instance, the previous month or a year ago). You'll see whether your business is making progress and what effect expenses are having on your revenue.Real-time metrics for business healthThe only way to know whether your business is profitable at any moment is to keep on top of your bookkeeping. Alex wanted to frame art, but soon learned that keeping books was necessary. The old-school way to do this was by recording each transaction in a journal. A more modern way is a spreadsheet. Cloud-based storage can help, and there are storage options from all of the major digital players. The most modern way to track your business is a document management system (DMS), which can capture data in multiple ways and store it in the cloud for access from multiple places.Timeliness and accuracy are key. Decide when you will attend to your bookkeeping and don't deviate from your schedule. Be accurate; double-check your entries and your calculations (especially with a spreadsheet). You'll be glad you did when you're making a key decision. If you think you'll need data in an instant, then do your bookkeeping frequently.Related: Want Taxes to Be Easy?

24,"As a Black Woman CEO, I Built a Remote Company Not Just to Save Money — But to Mirror My Commitment to Diversity. Here's How.","Feb 23, 2024",Catherine Mandungu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/as-a-black-woman-ceo-i-built-a-remote-company-not-just-to/469043,"
In the tech industry, global diversity is more than a buzzword phrase — it is the engine of innovation and leadership. Launching my startup was a new beginning. It was fueled by my journey as a Black woman entrepreneur. I chose to be a remote operation not just to save money. It was also to craft a work culture that showcases my core values and the complexity of our global community. This decision was less about following trends and more about purposefully nurturing a diverse and connected environment.Diverse teams have an advantage in decision-making, task execution and innovation. This advantage is becoming increasingly logical. Diverse teams outperform groups that are not diverse. Robust data supports this. The benefits of diversity go beyond theory. They boost a team's innovation and finances. In 2023, about 16% of companies had gone fully remote and about 28% had gone hybrid. The importance of remote work and diversity is clearer than ever. These trends show that remote work is possible. They also highlight the key role of diversity in modern business success.Related: How to Build Team Culture in a Remote-Work World



Building a diverse and global teamOur strategy for building a diverse team is rooted in a deep dedication to diversity. It is a guiding principle and a daily practice. We've created a thorough remote onboarding process. It helps new team members join our culture and rhythms. The system has virtual meet-and-greets, in-depth project orientations and ongoing mentorship. It has been pivotal in building a unified team spirit. This spirit is undeterred by the lack of physical closeness.We tackle the challenges of distance. We do this by doing regular virtual team-building exercises. They are designed to build community and improve team dynamics. Twice-a-year in-person meetings at key locations have strengthened our team, as well.


Our global team is from the United Kingdom, France, Bulgaria, the Philippines and India. It brings together a rich mix of perspectives. These enrich our work and foster an environment ripe for innovation. It's a diversity of thought and culture. It doesn't just encourage creative problem-solving — it also bonds us as a team. It shows that distance is no barrier to building a strong, cohesive unit.Harnessing geographical diversityThe diversity of our team is among our most significant assets. We show commitment to being sensitive and inclusive. This is seen in our communication practices and in our scheduling and observance of local traditions. This respect for each team member's heritage enhances our output and experience. It embodies the essence of a globally connected team.We use our geographical diversity to be available to clients around the clock. We offer solutions based on a deep understanding of their unique needs and challenges. Using time zone differences well guarantees our responsiveness. It also brings rich ideas and views to our projects. This sparks innovation and a global approach to problem-solving.Diversity comes in many forms. It ranges from location to culture and language. It helps us handle challenges with many strategies. This boosts our problem-solving abilities a lot. Our ability to view issues from many angles has been key, helping us to secure pivotal clients. It lets us showcase the real benefits and value of our diverse views. This not only reaffirms the importance of cultural diversity, but also highlights it as an important driver of superior business performance.


Related: How Cultural Understanding and Adaptation Drives Business SuccessFostering innovation with global insightsCreating a diverse remote team has been a game-changer. It sparked unmatched innovation and a deep understanding of global markets. The array of perspectives in our team empowers us. It lets us address challenges with new solutions and creative thinking, improving our problem-solving abilities. Our global footprint provides insights into varied market dynamics. It includes consumer behaviors and business practices. This allows us to craft cutting-edge solutions with global relevance.Empowering transparency and developmentAt the heart of any thriving team is effective project management. By adopting online tools, we achieve transparency in every task and project, ensuring all team members are informed of their roles and responsibilities.

We provide access to online courses, webinars and virtual workshops. Tailored to our team's expertise. They equip our team to lead in industry innovations and practices. We focus on clarity in operations and on nurturing our team's development. This focus boosts our efficiency and drives our ongoing innovation and progress.Personal growthBuilding a remote team has been transformative. It has offered me substantial personal growth and the freedom to immerse myself in different cultures in Asia and Europe. Enriching my personal life on a day-to-day basis. It has also broadened my leadership in a multicultural setting. Learning from different cultures and business practices has been eye-opening; it's shown me the key role of diversity in success.


This change reflects a wider trend among remote workers. In particular, millennials show more engagement in workplaces that champion inclusivity. They highly value cognitive diversity and see the importance of solving business challenges through teamwork. For this generation, inclusion goes beyond representation. It's about fostering an environment where every voice is heard. All perspectives contribute to better business solutions.Related: Diverse Workplaces Generate 19% More Revenue Than Less Diverse CompetitorsConclusionBuilding a diverse remote team is a journey.

This approach drives groups to better achievements and creates a more inclusive and interconnected global work environment by embracing diversity in all its forms.

25,9 Hidden Reasons Your Customers Will Leave You,"Feb 23, 2024",Murali Nethi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/9-hidden-reasons-your-customers-are-leaving-you/469516,"
Losing customers without understanding why can be incredibly frustrating and damaging for a business. As much as we like to think we know our customers and have our fingers on the pulse of their needs, there are often hidden reasons behind losing customers that catch us by surprise.I want to shed light on subtle but common issues that cause customers to walk away, even when they seem satisfied on the surface. I aim to help you identify potential pitfalls early so you can course-correct before significant revenue and trust erosion occurs.Related: 5 Reasons Why Your Business Is Losing Customers



1. Poor product quality or featuresDelivering a quality product that meets customers' needs is necessary. If your product is buggy, flawed, or lacks key features your market expects, customers will quickly lose patience and go elsewhere.You may believe your product is great because no one complains. But a lack of complaints doesn't equal delight. You must proactively solicit customer feedback through surveys, user testing, and analysis of support logs to understand product weaknesses and prevent defections. Don't assume no news is good news.


2. Weak onboarding/implementationOnboarding is a make-or-break moment. Customers never gain value if your initial product setup and training are complex and frustrating.Study your analytics data — if few trial users convert, your onboarding needs improvement. Tasks should be simple and intuitive. Invest in guides, checklists, videos, and live coaching to ensure customers successfully adopt your product from day one.Related: Are You Guilty of Poor Onboarding? The Consequences Are Worse Than You Think.3. No value realizationCustomers buy for expected outcomes — not features. If clients don't achieve promised outcomes within your advertised timeline, they'll question the ROI and stop using you.


Set proper expectations upfront about realistic timeframes and customer effort required. Then, confirm value achievement through executive business reviews or outcomes-focused check-ins at 30/60/90 days. A little reassurance goes a long way.4. Account neglectThe adage ""The squeaky wheel gets the grease"" applies to customer success. You likely focus most of your attention on your newest and largest accounts. But neglecting existing customers is risky — without care, they defect.Review account usage data and reach out to languishing accounts. Small gestures like an email check-in or contract renewal call remind customers you care and make it easy to ask questions. This helps you diagnose issues before it's too late.5. Poor communicationOut of sight doesn't mean top of mind. Infrequent or overly formal communication causes customers to disengage. They may forget about your product altogether or question the partnership.


Create customer touch plans mapping out regular communications across multiple channels - email, social media, newsletters, and events. Tailor messaging to each audience segment's needs using demos, testimonials, debates, and research. Consistent, valuable engagement keeps you visible.Related: 7 Leadership Communication Blunders That Could Make or Break Your Company6. Unclear pricingHidden fees, complex pricing metrics, and surprise renewals with price hikes destroy trust quickly. Customers want pricing predictability and transparency around what they pay for.Audit your pricing structure and customer-facing contracts for clarity — bundle value-added offerings like premium support or training into editions. You can also offer pricing calculators and pre-purchase price estimates. Proactively notify customers of renewals and model options. Fair, clear, and flexible pricing increases retention.


7. Poor issue resolutionCustomers understand software has bugs. What frustrates them is a lack of responsiveness when issues arise. If clients encounter repeated problems and support tickets drag on for weeks without meaningful updates, they'll quit you fast.Empower support teams to escalate, diagnose, and patch priority issues rapidly. For chronic troubles, appoint technical account managers as a single point of contact. They can explain workaround steps and set expectations while engineering improves the product.Proactively inform customers about resolution timeframes, actions taken, and new releases addressing their problems. Transparency and accountability retain trust despite setbacks.Related: 8 Reasons Why We Need Entrepreneurs Now More Than Ever


8. Feature bloat and complexityIn SaaS products especially, featuritis is a real problem. Adding niche capabilities bloats interfaces, complicates user journeys, and slows system performance over time. Customers cannot achieve their goals efficiently when the UI becomes cluttered and confusing.Conduct feature pruning every few release cycles, sunsetting low-value functionality. Prioritize enhancements, delivering core outcomes for 80%+ of your users. Field support teams are an excellent source of input on areas of recurring complexity.9. Ignoring churn signalsEarly warning signs like contract renegotiation requests, skipped payments, and declined credit cards hint customers may quit you. But do you act on those signals? Customers assume you don't care or notice unless their actions trigger consequences.Build reports to track key churn indicators and credit trends. Establish a workflow to rapidly intervene when signals appear - friendly check-ins, need assessments, discounts, or free extensions show customers they aren't invisible.


The good news is that diagnosing and addressing these retention risks is achievable, especially if you systematically map your workflows and touchpoints from a consumer perspective.

  This Black Founder Was Denied a Business Loan and Set Out to Prove the 'Gatekeepers' Wrong. He's Made More Than $500,000 So Far — But It's Just the Beginning.
  
    Rob Gooljar, founder of IRIS blossom, started an Instagram account to share his love of floral arrangements — then the requests started rolling in.

      Key Takeaways    



        Gooljar began arranging the flowers his roommate brought home from Trader Joe's in 2020.
      


        He grew the IRIS blossom Instagram account to more than 40,000 followers and has made over $500,000 in just a few years. 
      


        Gooljar is on a mission to keep growing and lift up other diverse creators along the way.
      












""I've always been an artist,"" Rob Gooljar, founder of IRIS blossom, says. ""I've always been a creative person. I've done a lot of mixed media, painting, drawing, music, photography, but my medium shifted to floral.""In 2020, Gooljar was struggling with depression while working toward his Ph.D. in urban, social and economic geography, and he credits his then-roommate Becca Whittier as ""the catalyst"" for his new creative outlet. Whittier would bring flowers home from Trader Joe's, and Gooljar would arrange them.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom



Arranging flowers became a passion, and Gooljar decided to start an Instagram to bring others along on his artistic journey, especially those who might feel excluded from an industry known for lacking diversity. The average florist in the U.S. is 47 years old, and most of them are women (77.2%) and white (77.3%), according to data from Zippia.With his social media platform, Gooljar put out the kind of representation he wanted to see: ""Hey, I'm a queer Black florist — kind of, not really. I'm just playing with flowers, but watch me, and let's see what happens.""


What happened was IRIS blossom, named for Gooljar's rescue pitbull Iris, turned into a successful business.Related: For Years, This Black Founder Learned an Uncommon But Essential Craft on the Side. Now His Creations Are Beloved By Celebrity Chefs — and Can Sell for More Than $1,000.People saw Gooljar's posts on the Instagram account, which grew from zero to more than 40,000 followers, and began asking to buy arrangements. In the past three-and-a-half years, the self-funded company has fulfilled thousands of orders and made more than $500,000 — but it's just the beginning.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossomGooljar is expanding IRIS blossom to South Florida, where he moved last year, while Whittier and two employees continue to helm the company's operations in Greater Charlotte. Meanwhile, he's working with another business partner, Jihann Hanchell, to get IRIS blossom's sister business, island IRIS, off the ground in Turks and Caicos. The idea there is to offer ""full-scale design"" for luxury events.""He was really kind, but looked at me and was like, 'Well, you're not going to get a business loan.'""Gooljar isn't entering into these floral ventures ""blindly,"" he notes. He also has a holding company and a consulting firm. Still, despite Gooljar's entrepreneurial savvy and IRIS's track record of success and growth, its journey hasn't been without some serious challenges. Two of the biggest barriers, according to Gooljar? Funding and space. And in the floral industry, those tend to go hand in hand.


""It's very hard for small businesses to exist in Charlotte without being pre-existing,"" Gooljar says. ""Pre-existing meaning that A, you come from money or B, you have somebody to help you. So we worked out of our two-bedroom apartment [when] we were doing events that were $15,000-$16,000, and we were doing it on our kitchen island that was six-and-a-half feet long. We had buckets all over the house.""IRIS blossom has been ""100% self-funded"" from the start and able to accomplish all it has thanks to its supportive clients, Gooljar says. The revenue earned goes back into the company's growth, a strategy that's helped it achieve its milestone of $500,000 in revenue in just a few years. But in the early days, Gooljar did try to secure a business loan — and was turned away.Related: This Black Founder Stayed True to His Triple 'Win' Strategy to Build a $1 Billion Business""I had a white banker in Charlotte, and he was really kind, but looked at me and was like, 'Well, you're not going to get a business loan because you have to be in business for a few years,'"" Gooljar recalls. ""And then I would ask, 'Well, how are people who are just starting a business getting a loan?' 'Oh, they probably have an online presence, or they probably just go into it with money, and then they can put up their own money.' That kind of quasi, not-really-plausible explanation about funding and gatekeeping funding.""


Affording space in Charlotte remained a significant obstacle. Eventually, Gooljar and Whittier moved into a three-bedroom apartment. But there still wasn't enough room for the rapidly growing business, and Gooljar didn't want to spend all the money they made on rent. At one point in their search for a reliable place to store their expensive, perishable materials, someone offered to rent them an Airstream travel trailer for thousands of dollars a month sans air conditioning or running water.Now, Gooljar lives and works out of a house in Florida.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom


""It's cool when people look at me, and they're wondering if my business is working out: All I can do is smile and say, 'You know, it is.'""Throughout his time building IRIS blossom, Gooljar says he's ""stepped on a few toes"" within the gatekept industry and has had to field some pointed questions: ""Well, who are you?"" ""Is your business going to last?"" ""How's your little business going?"" ""How's your flower thing going?""But none of that has deterred Gooljar, who comes from a ""very long line of people working hard.""""My grandma cut sugar cane for 40 years in Trinidad,"" Gooljar says. ""My parents came here with nothing and worked and tried their best. And I'm trying to change that tide. So yeah, it's cool when people look at me, and they're wondering if my business is working out: All I can do is smile and say, 'You know, it is, and I'm putting in the work for it.'""

Now She Has $25 Million in Funding — and Smart Advice for Fellow Black Women Founders.Gooljar admits that ""there's still a long way to go"" in transforming the industry into a more inclusive space, but he's happy to report that other diverse floral businesses popped up in Charlotte after his own — because ""there's room for everybody.""""I see some of the landscape changing, especially when I go into the floral cooler, and I see somebody else that's Black, or I go into the floral cooler, and I see somebody that's young, or I go in there, and I see somebody with pink hair or something,"" Gooljar says.""You have to face those obstacles and keep pushing because there's always going to be people who are preying on your downfall.""Next, Gooljar plans to implement a national subscription program for IRIS, a sort of ""color-by-numbers"" approach. He'll ship the flowers nationwide, and customers can follow along with his arrangements via video. ""I want people who don't feel creative in their current jobs or current lives to get that creative outlet just the same way that I needed that outlet,"" he says.In the long-term, Gooljar's goal is to collaborate with a tech company to make it possible for people to order IRIS flowers on an app ""like they do an Uber."" But even though Gooljar envisions IRIS as a wide-scale service allowing employees to run ""little mini IRIS blossoms out of their own homes,"" quality remains a top priority.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom

It's not always easy, and Gooljar admits there have been ""plenty of times"" he wanted to give up, but he's always kept going — never wavering in his belief that great things are on the other side.""You can ask anyone that I know, and they will tell you that they don't know anybody that grinds the way that I do,"" Gooljar says. ""And I'm not saying that you just have to throw yourself into everything all the time. But I think a big part of this is that you have to face those obstacles and keep pushing because there's always going to be people who are preying on your downfall. There are always going to be roadblocks. There are always going to be obstacles. There are always going to be things to climb, but you have to just keep going.""

27,How to Regain Your Passion for Your Business — And How to Keep It Alive,"Feb 22, 2024",Nicholas Leighton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-keep-your-passion-alive-as-your-business-grows/469362,"
Behind every successful company is an entrepreneur who is deeply committed to their business and is passionate about their products and services. For new entrepreneurs, this passion is easy to sustain in the beginning when everything is new and exciting. There seems to be an endless flow of challenges, change, accomplishments and milestones that keep you going.Unfortunately, seasoned entrepreneurs know that once this ""new business smell"" wears off, it can be difficult to stay passionate about the work every single day. As the company grows and entrepreneurs are sucked into the complexities and routine of the business, they often find themselves struggling to maintain the initial passion that fueled their venture.This doesn't mean that you have a bad business. This is a natural cycle that every entrepreneur must overcome. Fortunately, there are ways that you can build a business model that centers around keeping that passion alive and well.



Related: 3 Ways to Stay as Passionate About Your Business as When You Started1. Set clear and ambitious goalsIn the early stages of building a business, entrepreneurs go through a whirlwind of quick accomplishments such as landing their first client or reaching profitability. Once the business stabilizes and has consistent operations, it's easy to fall into the trap of the day-to-day routine.


To keep the passion alive, entrepreneurs should always have clear objectives that they are working towards. It's important for these goals to be ambitious. If your goals aren't ambitious, there is a huge chance that you'll get bored and won't feel challenged. 2. Create a culture of innovation and improvementStagnation is the most common reason why people stop feeling motivated and passionate about their work. As a business owner, you can drive a culture of innovation and consistent improvement. It doesn't matter how passionate you are about the business, a lack of passion in your team will drag down the organization.By discovering new products, services or ways of doing things, you can keep yourself and your team engaged in the business. Take the time to listen to your customers and use that as an opportunity to refine your current products or services. Change is a great way to combat monotony and keep your team passionate about the business.Related: Path to Success: 4 Ways to Reignite Your Passion


3. Delegate thoughtfullyNothing kills passion faster than an entrepreneur spending three hours trying to find the typo in their accounting records because they wanted to do the bookkeeping themselves instead of hiring a professional. Running a business isn't always fun, but it can be more enjoyable if you allow yourself and your team to avoid tasks they hate or aren't good at.Instead of randomly assigning responsibilities, carefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of everyone on the team. By playing to everyone's strengths, you can delegate activities in a way that keeps people excited about their work every day.4. Permit creative outletsPart of the reason why new entrepreneurs can stay passionate about their venture is because they are doing new and exciting things. Keeping your passion alive may simply require allowing creative outlets, even if they aren't necessarily business-critical. Give yourself and the team the opportunity to learn new skills and cross-train in different roles. This will help strengthen the business and provide an opportunity to step back from the monotonous day-to-day activities.Related: 6 Surefire Ways to Stay Constantly Motivated


Sustaining passion over timeBuilding a culture and business model that is passion-centric is essential. However, despite all of these efforts, it can be challenging to maintain the excitement over many years. Here are some other routines and methods entrepreneurs can leverage to sustain their passion long-term.Unplug: Take time to recharge from time to time. You can't bring your best to your business or team if you are working around the clock for long periods of time.Network and connect: Taking the opportunity to collaborate and build relationships with other people in your industry is a great way to stay connected to your business purpose and stimulate innovation.Explore a greater purpose: Building a business is a huge accomplishment, but keeping the passion alive may require looking beyond the business to see what you can do to give back to the community through philanthropic endeavors.Stay healthy: People who exercise regularly are 13% more productive at work and have higher levels of happiness and satisfaction. No matter how busy you are in the business, take the time to stay in shape and eat healthy.Get a mentor: Having someone in your corner who is outside the business is a great way to keep your passion levels in check. A mentor can help guide you through periods of stagnation or challenges in a safe and productive way.Remember that passion is the reason you started your business in the first place. For this reason, it's the most important ingredient to keep your company moving forward and getting the most enjoyment out of your work.

28,Beware the Temptation of Dishonesty — How One Lie Could Sink Your Business,"Feb 22, 2024",Zamir Shukho,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-one-lie-could-destroy-your-business/469466,"
Many promising entrepreneurs and business owners seek investment, making it tough to convince someone to invest in their idea/startup. As a result, some individuals tend to exaggerate the quality of their ideas or products. If the venture succeeds and generates substantial profits, investors are usually satisfied. However, dissatisfaction may arise if things don't go as planned — and they do a lot of times!Fundraising is a long process that may take months before making any decision. Why months? Because every responsible fund conducts due diligence, delving deep into the startup and analyzing every aspect of it takes time. Some funds also attract external experts – we use this practice in Vibranium.VC.Related: The Importance Of Honesty And Integrity In Business



Why dishonesty is so temptingThe deceptive temptation to take shortcuts is often based on a desire to present the startup in the best light possible, attracting investors and customers with an idealized version of reality. However, this slippery slope can lead to potential pitfalls, where one small untruth snowballs into a catastrophic downfall for a startup.Back in fall 2023, we were considering one startup for potential investment, conducted analysis, and held interviews — standard procedures for every potential investment we make. The company was making about $2M in annual revenues, growing and positive. But we felt that there was something off; every time we asked for DEMO access to the platform, the founder would throw a fit, not wanting to cooperate. Even though, during our calls, the founder would operate a demonstration showing how the platform creates value for its customers.


So, we decided to conduct additional technical due diligence with two different expert teams. It turned out that we were shown an excellent Figma design all this time without an actual platform behind it. This project was a classic ""fake it till you make it,"" and it was a deal breaker for us. We can understand that sometimes MVP is still in the process of making, but a deliberate lie that the revenues generated in the company come from nonexisting platforms was a no-go for us.Entrepreneurs may underestimate the consequences of dishonesty, believing that the ends justify the means. Yet, the truth has a way of revealing itself, and when it does, the repercussions can be severe, from ruined reputations to legal consequences. Giving in to the temptation to be deceptive can seriously harm the foundation of a startup.Related: Stop Lying to Your Team — And Yourself. Try Radical Honesty Instead.Turn the truth into your strategic assetStatistics indicate that, on average, the partnership between an investor and a startup lasts longer in the USA than a marriage – more people divorce faster than investors and startups part ways, achieving exit.


Based on my experience, honesty emerges as a powerful strategic asset for entrepreneurs. Successful businesses have thrived on transparency and building trust with customers, investors, and employees. Honesty is not just a moral imperative but a smart business move fostering long-term relationships.Several examples in the business world showcase the impact of truth as a strategic asset. Even when the news is not entirely positive, companies that openly communicate their challenges and successes often gain respect and loyalty from their stakeholders. By being forthright about shortcomings or setbacks, entrepreneurs can build a foundation of trust that withstands the test of time.When an investor has to decide in complex startup situations, for example, to support the startup or not for the second or third time, if there is no trust, the investor is likely not to support the startup because they will already feel deceived. Therefore, it is very important to embed these relationships from the very beginning on the principles of transparency, openness, and honesty. These basic things are important because they form the foundation for future years of relationships and communication between the investor and the startup. There have been cases where some of our startups needed bridge rounds, and we were ready to support them because they were honest about their situations and what they needed.Related: 3 Ways to Build a Culture of Radical Honesty (and How It Can Transform Your Business)


Navigating the gray areasIn the complex entrepreneurship landscape, ethical dilemmas often arise in grey areas. A gray area is an area or situation in which it is difficult to judge what is right and wrong. Entrepreneurs face tough decisions that test their commitment to honesty. Real-world scenarios illustrate the importance of choosing the path of transparency, showcasing positive outcomes resulting from these decisions.Navigating the grey areas requires a commitment to ethical decision-making. Entrepreneurs must weigh short-term gains against long-term consequences, recognizing that honesty, even when uncomfortable, ultimately builds a more robust and resilient business foundation.Related: Science Has Confirmed That Honesty Really Is the Best Policy in the WorkplaceCulture of honestyBeing honest in the world of entrepreneurship can be challenging, especially when money is involved – that might be a real test for a startup. Just like when we build relationships with our life partner or spouse, if these relationships start with lies, even if they're seemingly innocent lies, they can start to erode and create cracks in the future.


Entrepreneurs can actively cultivate a culture of honesty within their startups. Open communication, trust-building, and accountability are crucial in fostering a workplace environment where honesty thrives. Successful companies prioritizing honesty as a core value often experience heightened employee loyalty and increased customer satisfaction.By setting the tone from the top down, entrepreneurs can create a culture where team members feel empowered to be transparent about challenges and uncertainties. This culture promotes ethical behavior and enhances collaboration and innovation within the startup.In the competitive entrepreneurship landscape, the stakes are high, and the journey to success is filled with challenges. The deceptive temptation may seem like a shortcut, but it will lead to a dead-end sooner or later, trust me. Embracing honesty, not just as a moral code but as a strategic advantage, can be the key differentiator between thriving and falling.

Recently, my team and I lost a client — a large client. And it hurt a lot. We don't like losing; call it our competitive nature or just the fact that we pour everything we have into these client engagements, our ideas, and our time.In just over a decade, we have landed in New York and grown from a team of under ten to an organization with more than 500 people globally.

To lose with conviction and a promise to learn, grow and continuously do better.Don't believe me? Just ask David Beckham and Sir Alex Ferguson.Close your eyes and reflect on the 1998 World Cup in France. England faced their old enemy, Argentina, in the first knockout rounds. David Beckham started for England in midfield. At this moment in time, he was a young man with the world at his feet. He was a fast-emerging superstar. He was dating a superstar. And he was playing for England and Manchester United.Life was looking good for Becks. Until, with the game tied at 2-2, Argentina's notoriously tenacious midfielder Diego Simeone committed a cynical foul on Beckham. After Beckham hit the floor, Simeone antagonized Beckham by ruffling the back of his hair.


And in that moment, Beckham's life would change forever.Beckham lost control of his emotions. He instinctively kicked out his leg at Simeone— leading the referee to swiftly brandish a red card and send Beckham off the pitch. England lost the game. And chaos ensued.Beckham went from the golden boy to the most hated man in Britain in a flash. The media turned on him. He received death threats from fans, bullets in the mail, and a Beckham effigy was even hanged outside a pub in London.Related: Why Failure Is Your Best TeacherEveryone turned on him. Except his manager, Sir Alex Ferguson.Sir Alex put his arms around him. He protected him — and made sure his teammates did, too. He created an ""us versus the world"" mentality within Beckham and the club. And together, they fought on and pushed forward.And it worked. Within a year, Beckham and Manchester United would win an iconic treble. Tides would shift. He was back to his place as beloved the world over.Pivoting back to the world in which we thrive — the world of business—this ""us versus the world"" mentality can be incredibly powerful when deployed well and with intention. By having instilled the right mindset, our best work has been done when we've lost a few things in a row.


Why? Because it forces you to reassess your position in the market, develop new tools and capabilities and refine your sense of direction. Lastly, always remember that feedback is a gift, take as much as you can and learn from it. Embrace it. We call that having a growth mentality.Related: 7 Lessons on Failure You Can Learn From Top AthletesLosses and lessonsLosing hurts. It will always hurt. But there is no shame in losing — so cast that thought aside. There is only regret if you fail to learn.Sir Alex Ferguson turned a crisis into an opportunity by leading with a people-first mindset and putting the collective well-being of his team first. He stood by his team, and the world witnessed that.


Businesses work in the same way. Leaders need to create a sense of togetherness. When you lose out on a pitch, people will worry about the security of their jobs. As I am learning again, an ""us against the world"" mentality can be a transformational asset in these moments.If you spoke to David Beckham in the aftermath of that game versus Argentina, he would likely give anything to turn back time and change his actions. But that loss, that mistake, was likely worth more than he could realize.A loss is not always for the worse. Sometimes, it is the best thing that can happen for a person or a business. It's a chance to refocus. To reevaluate your processes and your priorities.We are all going to face challenging moments in 2024. Everyone will lose at some point. But not everyone will learn. And that, more than their percentage of wins against losses, is what separates successful leaders and businesses from the rest.

30,How To Choose the Right Funding Model for Your Startup,"Feb 20, 2024",Kimberly Zhang,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-choose-the-right-funding-model-for-your-startup/470003,"
Choosing the right funding approach is a critical decision for launching your startup that can shape the trajectory of your business.In this article, we will explore various funding models available to startups and provide insights on how to make informed decisions based on your unique needs and goals.Understanding Types of Startup Funding ModelsBootstrappingBootstrapping involves funding your startup with personal savings, revenue generated by the business, or loans from friends and family. While it offers autonomy and control, it comes with the challenge of limited resources and a potentially slower growth trajectory.



Angel InvestorsAngel investors are affluent individuals who provide capital for startups in exchange for ownership equity or convertible debt. This funding model not only brings in financial support but often includes mentorship and industry connections.Related: 12 Things You Need to Understand about the Silicon Valley Model before Using it in Other Markets


Using SecuritySome entrepreneurs use security as a means of funding. This can come in multiple forms, including using your property, inventory or other assets as collateral, which can be risky if you cannot repay the finance. Other options include using accounts receivable (or invoice factoring), such as future orders, and borrowing money against these future orders.Venture CapitalVenture capital firms invest larger amounts of money in startups with high growth potential. Venture capital funding is suitable for businesses with scalability, a strong market opportunity, and a capable team. However, it involves giving up a portion of equity and adhering to rigorous growth expectations.CrowdfundingCrowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo allow startups to present their ideas to a global audience and collect small contributions from backers.Kickstarter alone has facilitated over 500,000 projects, raising more than $6 billion from 18.6 million backers, showcasing the impact of crowdfunding on startup funding.


This model not only provides capital but also serves as a marketing tool, generating buzz and interest around the startup.Related: 12 Key Strategies to a Successful Crowdfunding CampaignBank Loans and Traditional LendingHistorically, if you need a loan, you would visit your local bank branch and speak to a bank manager. This has changed significantly over the last few decades towards more private institutions which may offer more favourable terms and faster funding.Through the likes of Funding Circle, MT Finance, Iwoca and Swoop, new businesses are able to access capital much quicker and raise significant amounts, even as much as £500,000 or £1 million. However, note that you may need to be trading for a minimum period of time, e.g., 6 months or 2 years, and have regular revenue.


Factors to Consider When Choosing a Funding ModelStage of Your Startup: The stage of your startup plays a crucial role in determining the most suitable funding model. Bootstrapping might be ideal for early-stage ventures, while later stages may benefit from venture capital to fuel rapid growth.Business Model and Industry: The nature of your business and industry can influence the choice of funding. Some high-growth industries may be more attractive to venture capitalists, such as biotechnology, while other new businesses, such as in consumer goods, may find success through crowdfunding or angel investment.Financial Need: Evaluate the specific financial needs of your startup. Consider factors such as initial capital requirements, operating expenses, and potential expansion plans. This assessment will guide you toward a funding model that aligns with your financial goals.Risk Tolerance: Assess your risk tolerance as an entrepreneur. While venture capital might bring substantial funding, it also involves relinquishing control and adhering to aggressive growth targets. Bootstrapping, on the other hand, offers autonomy but requires a higher risk tolerance due to limited resources.Timeframe for Results: Consider the timeframe within which you expect to see results. Venture capital may provide rapid injections of capital for quick scaling, while crowdfunding campaigns might take time to build momentum. Bootstrapping offers a gradual approach but may result in slower growth.How To Choose The Right Funding Option For Your StartupThoroughly research each funding model, understanding its advantages, challenges, and success stories within your industry. Networking becomes incredibly important, so take time to consult with industry experts, mentors or advisors who have experience in your field. Their insights can provide valuable perspectives on the most suitable funding model for your startup.Also consider a diversified approach by combining multiple funding sources. For instance, a mix of angel investment, crowdfunding and bootstrapping might provide a well-rounded and resilient financial foundation.Choosing the right funding model for your startup is a pivotal decision that requires careful consideration of various factors. Whichever method you opt for, aligning the funding model with your startup's stage, industry financial needs is essential.

31,"Adapting to Change Is Key to Surviving Every Consumer Demand — Just Ask Netflix, Blockbuster, WeWork and More","Feb 19, 2024",Zain  Jaffer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/pivoting-is-the-key-to-survival-just-ask-these/469582,"
The case of how the shared workspace company WeWork went from being a darling of American business to bankruptcy is an example of a long line of business failures that stem from an inability of top management to adjust to a major change that has occurred in the world.Many do not see the iceberg ahead, but some can shift courseThe RMS Titanic sank in 1912 because everyone thought she was unsinkable. Human hubris and pride is a flaw we all have. Even C-level executives have it despite their opinions to the contrary, and old practices that worked well in the past are hard to change.Take for example Nokia, a giant in the analog cellphone sector. When Apple launched its iPhone, and Google came out with the Android operating system, the Finnish giant which had pivoted earlier from the lumber industry radio business to cellphones decided to stick it out with its proprietary Symbian operating system. The market did not agree, and soon thereafter Nokia lost its lead in the industry along with players like Sony Ericsson and Motorola to newer phone makers like Samsung and Apple.



When Netflix was a puny startup, they offered themselves up for sale for $50 million to Blockbuster, which declined Netflix's DVD mailing movie business. During that time, Blockbuster was the giant in the VHS/DVD movie rental business, with a retail store presence on many street corners. Unfortunately for them, they failed to recognize the changes that had occurred, namely that streaming video technology had become cheap. Netflix on the other hand was humble enough to recognize the shift and is now one of the major behemoths of the NASDAQ.Related: How Pivoting Saved My Business When Things Didn't Go According to Plan


Often those who have stellar educational backgrounds fail to recognize these shifts particularly if success is all they have encountered with the status quo. It is after all hard to question why you are successful. Most people will simply take it for granted, and in some cases, decide that their special management abilities are what led to their success.On the positive side, one example of a major strategic shift that was executed successfully was when Intel under their late CEO Andrew Grove with cofounders Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore led their business shift from memory chips to the new business of microprocessors in the '70s. It is easy to make that shift as a business if the current business is losing money, but harder if it is making tons of money. In Intel's case, they decided that if new management came in, they would shift to microprocessors because of the upcoming personal computer (PC) business with IBM and others, so they decided that they would do it instead.Grove pointed out in his management bestseller book, Only the Paranoid Survive, that each company and industry might in its future face what are called Strategic Inflection Points. These are key moments when management should recognize that something major has shifted, and if a company is unable to pivot, the company might face a decline or even extinction.How, then, should we act?The number of eventual business failures that have graced the covers of top business magazines shows that hubris is everywhere. A real business leader, to remain successful throughout the duration of a career along with the company should also exhibit some humility.


What is worse is we often try to defend our positions and use confirmation bias, even if the data that supports our argument is random to begin with. Meaning that the data, while appearing to support your position, does not.The first step we need to do is to admit that as human leaders, we are not infallible. Every one of us can make mistakes. Appearing on the cover of a business magazine and getting invited to speak in prestigious global forums like in Davos, Switzerland or sitting in the C-Suite does not make us less human.Next, learn some statistics, such as how to use an XY scatter plot. At least enough so that you know you need enough data to show a real correlated trend. Learn not to infer a trend from a random set of data that does not even show a line or a curve if graphed. Just because you got three coin tosses as heads does not mean that the next coin toss will land the same as before.A turkey's life before the ax falls on its head is pretty good. The turkey is well-fed and gently treated. In short, past performance is not an indicator of future performance.


If your data already shows a trend, do not suffer from analysis paralysis just because you are incapable of shifting gears. If it is time to change course, just do it. Discuss with your team what to do if you are wrong and actually make that shift in direction. Have a pre-agreed exit strategy from the position you first took, no matter how hardcore you were. If something has changed, be ready to pivot.Related: Knowing When — and How — to Pivot Is Key to Your Business' Survival. Here's What You Need to Do.Do not become extinctHaving the ability to spot when something has changed, and the willingness to abandon the success of the past that may no longer be true for a new uncharted course is part of good business leadership.It is not risk-free, but it is necessary. It can prolong your business for the next few decades to come if your company masters this skill — otherwise, you'll become just like the dodos and dinosaurs.

32,"If You Don't Learn How to Pivot Your Business, You'll Watch It Perish — Here's What a Successful Pivot Looks Like.","Feb 19, 2024",Hilt Tatum IV,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/if-you-dont-learn-how-to-pivot-your-business-youll-watch/469027,"
Netflix, Instagram, Slack. These three companies have one thing in common: Their initial business plan wasn't sustainable, and they became the formidable companies they are today because they chose to pivot in a new direction.Pivoting in startup culture is a strategic business decision to shift course to capitalize on a new need in the market that your product or service can meet with calculated changes. Doing so successfully requires high organizational adaptability and flexibility to achieve long-term success.In a business world that is constantly fluctuating, pulling the plug when things don't go as planned is an easy out. However, successful entrepreneurs and investors who truly understand their markets can see innovative ways to meet new opportunities by tweaking current business models.



Is it time to pivot in your business? Let's see when it makes sense, how to do it well and what it looks like in both success and failure.Related: Knowing When — and How — to Pivot Is Key to Your Business' Survival. Here's What You Need to Do.


Time to make a changeI have lost track of how many businesses I've seen with everything set up for success, only to have the market pull the rug out from under them. Even the most business-savvy and meticulously prepared ventures can be surprised by economic changes.From market shifts to new technological advancements to drastic economic hits, numerous external factors can force companies to consider pivoting their business model. Internal factors such as plummeting performance metrics or shifts in consumer behaviors may indicate it's time to change.The truth is that few successful businesses got to where they are today following the same strategic plan they started with. While always maintaining your core values — what makes your company unique — keeping your organization agile is essential. You should always prepare to make a necessary shift that will keep your company relevant and financially stable.Decision timeRecognizing the need to pivot and deciding to execute are two different things. There are many factors to consider, and several stakeholders will likely need to sign off. That's why conducting extensive market research, data analysis and forecasting is essential before deciding next steps.


Some businesses might be experiencing a rough patch that will even out with a few tweaks and perseverance. For others, a drastic overhaul of their business model may be necessary for survival. There's no instant solution or easy answer. A decision of this magnitude requires due diligence and belief in your team and product.A great example of pivoting based on informed decision-making is Netflix.Initially, it was a mail-order service for DVDs in the early 2000s. Even though it had a corner in the at-home entertainment market, it felt the strain of growing competition. While executives had their eyes on the current industry trends, they also saw an entirely new, untapped market to conquer.In 2007, it launched its streaming platform, where many of the same movies and shows they sent in the mail were now ready to enjoy on demand. They pioneered the streaming revolution and continued to adapt as they began developing new and original content.


Yes, many others eventually followed suit, but the point is that Netflix executives understood the market and their company so intimately they knew when it was time to pivot and executed it in a way that disrupted their industry and kept their company's profits rising.Related: What Tennis, Microsoft and Starting My Own Company Taught Me About the Mind's Role in Achieving SuccessSuccessful implementationThe next phase of the pivot is setting everything in motion. Implementation can be one of the most challenging aspects because your business will likely face scrutiny and backlash from all angles, including the inside.This is the phase where clear, effective communication becomes critical. You will feel resistance from your employees who are uncomfortable with change. Stakeholders who weren't involved in the decision will feel slighted. Industry pundits may think this change is outlandish. Your company's messaging and resolve must be unwavering regardless of who says what.


If you've done the proper research, considered all the options and scenarios and have buy-in from the appropriate parties, no other forces should change your stance unless there's a legitimate threat to your business's future.Communicating this shift from the point of empathy and care while respectfully sharing the need for a pivot and how it will work is essential to keeping the process steady. Pivoting your business is never easy, but planning and implementing the process effectively can be successful.There are no guaranteesNotice how I said it ""can"" be successful. Like your initial business plan, it could still fall flat even if laid out and executed perfectly.The unfortunate part of business is that there's always risk involved. Nothing is ever promised. Yes, pivoting could save your business from failing — or it could lead you down a path that seems promising but is yet another dead end. If that's the case, learn from it. It could mean the end of the line or another detour on the road to your company's true potential. Regardless, don't let a single failure go by without gaining insights for improvement or wisdom for what does and doesn't work.


Failure feels miserable, yes, but it's an incredible teacher. Even if your pivot is successful, that doesn't mean you won't have to stay on your toes, ready to adapt as the market changes again. No business is ever safe. Industries shift. Competition grows fierce.Never stop innovating. Don't get comfortable. Keep your eyes on the path forward, watching for whatever obstacle is next.Change isn't a bad thing. Pivoting isn't a sign of weakness or failure. The leaders who are open to change of direction tend to be most successful. They're the ones who are vigilant and ready to pounce on the next opportunity before anyone else knows it's there.Stay flexible, be ready to adapt and when the time is right, pivot well.

33,5 PR Tips Any Company Can Use to Get Media Coverage,"Feb 12, 2024",Kelsey Kloss,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-hacks-any-company-can-use-to-get-media-coverage/468533,"
Here's a simple truth: Companies like yours have incredible stories and expertise to share — and that's also what makes them so primed for press coverage. In turn, press coverage is incredibly valuable for your SEO, brand awareness, marketing collateral and overall credibility.Here's how to get more visibility for your organization so you can multiply your impact and help more people.Related: Yes, You Can Still Get Organic Media Coverage — and Here's Why You Should



1. Hone in on your specific expertiseThis can be fairly straightforward in some cases: A financial institute will cover all things money-related, while a gym franchise might be the go-to for fitness tips.However, sometimes a little more creativity is needed. For instance, we work with a Tai Chi expert who covers everything from fundamental internal martial arts to stress management tips, productivity at work (the principles of Tai Chi can help with this!) and balanced walking.


Getting creative with the expertise you offer can provide you with more verticals to reach. Typically, a company's mission can be translated into several different pillars of serviceable content for the media.2. Get credentialed spokespeople for your companyFirst and foremost, journalists will look for certain letters behind experts' names. They may be PhD, MD, CPT, CCWS, RDN or a wide range of other credentials.If you're the CEO of a company but don't have specific credentials for a certain area of expertise, pass the media baton onto someone in your company who does — or hire a spokesperson for that purpose. For instance, many fruit and vegetable companies hire RDNs to comment on healthy eating topics.Make sure your spokesperson is well-versed in how to translate complicated science into easy-to-understand terms for everyday media consumers. A journalist won't come back to a source for more interviews if that source's quotes are stuffed with jargon and clunky terms.


Try to strike a balance between conversational and detailed quotes. You want your spokesperson's soundbites to have personality but also to get the core of a topic in a meaningful way. Vagueness makes for weak quotes that are less likely to be published.Related: This is the Biggest Factor Holding Companies Back From Media Coverage — and 3 Ways to Fix It3. Have research to back up your claimsWhen your company's spokesperson makes a claim like ""pine nuts help to improve heart health,"" the journalist will likely look for a specific study to back that up. You can help by providing that research for them.However, ideally, the research should not have any conflicts of interest — meaning it wasn't funded by, say, a pine nut company. It's fantastic that private companies can fund research to contribute to scientific literature, but journalists are generally encouraged not to cover studies sponsored by parties that may have a conflict of interest (or, at the very least, they need to disclose the affiliation in their coverage).


You may also find it helpful to invest in infographics to translate key information your company wants to share. Infographics help translate complex data and give the media a valuable asset to publish, benefiting their readers. At the very least, they'll help a journalist easily understand your key data points so they can relay them in an article.4. Tell your story in vivid colorMany companies have incredible stories about why they launched, usually rooted in a passion for helping others. These can make beautiful long-form features that go beyond expert quotes (a blend of both is great for your company's media portfolio).Your product or service is what a target consumer will purchase, but it's your story that will attract them in the first place — or encourage them to stay a loyal customer.Make sure your PR efforts demonstrate why you set out to make an impact and how many people you've helped as a result.Related: 5 Key Things You Need Before Launching a PR Campaign5. Give journalists a first-hand experienceJournalists are offered everything from free DNA test kits to press trips around the world. This industry typically has many opportunities to sample out services or products.However, connect with the journalist to build a relationship with them first (or hire a PR team to do this for you). Not only can it be expensive to send out samples of certain products blindly, but some may take a bit of trust-building with the journalist before they try it.For instance, if you're offering biological age testing to a journalist, they may not feel comfortable participating unless they know you and your team well already.


Get lunch with them or hop on a video call where you can chat face to face. Public relations is built around relationships, and when you can combine strong ones with your incredible story and expertise, you'll be primed for success in the media.

35,Read Target's '15-Minute Rule' That Workers Say Led to a Rash of Firings Over Stanley Cups,"Feb 1, 2024",Dominick Reuter,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/read-targets-15-min-rule-led-to-firings-over-stanley-cups/469121,"
This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Target's sudden firings of workers over their purchases of Stanley cups have raised the profile of an often mentioned — but often poorly understood — policy known colloquially as the 15-minute rule.The rule is intended to ensure that customers have a reasonable and fair opportunity to buy merchandise from Target before employees purchase the items for themselves.



While some Target workers know of the rule, others told Business Insider that they were either unaware of it or simply unsure of how to avoid violating it.In general, Target workers say the 15-minute rule is usually communicated verbally, if at all, and only occasionally presented in written form. Even a store employee handbook obtained by BI has no specific mention of the 15-minute duration in its summary of the employee purchasing policy, though it's mentioned in a separate document.


""Everybody says 15 minutes. I've heard that in multiple stores over the years, and I've told it to people, but I'd never seen it in writing,"" a Target employee speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions told BI. ""I never thought about how I'd never seen it until I read it in your article.""BI confirmed the person's identity and employment. Target did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment on the firings and its employee purchase policy.The store employee handbook simply says that workers ""cannot use their status to gain an unfair advantage over guests when it comes to purchasing merchandise.""The text of the rule that so many workers have been fired for breaking is found in a separate document called Team Member Purchasing Guidelines, which the employee provided to BI.


That person said the document was stored on an internal human-resources site that nonmanagerial employees generally couldn't access and that it required an intentional search to locate.""It took some looking to find it,"" the employee said.In a section on high-demand merchandise, the 15-minute duration is mentioned: ""HDM moved to the sales floor (whether from the back room, the Guest Service desk, or as part of re-shop process) during store hours must remain on the shelf for enough time necessary to ensure the guest has a meaningful opportunity to purchase such items (15-minutes is sufficient) before team members are permitted to purchase such items.""The guidelines also say workers must be off the clock and remove their name badges when making purchases, and concealing or holding merchandise to purchase later is prohibited.


A section titled ""consequences"" says, ""Team members who violate these Guidelines may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination.""Before January, instances of the company electing to choose the most severe option were comparatively rare but not unprecedented, Target workers told BI.""It seems to happen in waves,"" the employee speaking anonymously said. ""When this kind of stuff happens, it comes out of left field.""Other workers who knew of purchasing violations told BI that enforcement more often came in the form of a formal warning.


A list, also obtained from the employee, of prepared responses for managers to address various policy violations indicates a company preference for correcting employee behavior rather than firing them, including for breaking the 15-minute rule.""It is your responsibility to know, understand and abide by the team member purchasing guidelines,"" the document says. ""If you have any additional questions regarding purchasing merchandise, see a leader.""

36,Why Indonesia Is Becoming the Next Serious Player in Entrepreneurship,"Jan 30, 2024",Vlad Ayukaev,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-things-all-entrepreneurs-must-know-before-they-enter-the/465921,"
Indonesia is an island nation with a total population of nearly 300 million inhabitants and an ever-growing consumer class. It consists of 17,000 islands spread over an area of almost 2 million kilometers — all of which revolve around a strong central hub — namely, Java.As the most populous island of Indonesia, it has a significant influence on the nation's economy. And therefore, it can be considered the 'gateway' to the rest of the country.No city in Indonesia proves this point better than Jakarta. This Javan megacity is home to many multinational corporations, headquarters, and venture capital funds, which include prominent names such as Golden Gate Ventures, Sovereign's Capital, and Alpha JWC Ventures, among many others.



Indonesia provides a solid startup foundation for venture capital and technological innovation. And it presents the perfect environment to build and secure strong partnerships and investments. But even though there is great potential here, there are, of course, unique factors that every entrepreneur should consider beforehand. And 4 of the most important are as follows.Related: What Makes Indonesia the Fastest Rising E-commerce Country


1. Linguistics, culture and religionIndonesia is divided into many islands spread out over a large area. Because of this, there is great diversity throughout the nation. In total, there are 1,300 ethnic groups. And while Bahasa Indonesia is the country's first official language, each region can contain its own linguistic variations.Entrepreneurs must be ready to localize marketing materials and provide customer support in multiple languages to improve accessibility and engagement. This linguistic diversity also extends to cultural diversity. And so, sensitivity and respect must be carefully exercised for marketing strategies, product development and customer interactions.What's more, Indonesia is home to the world's largest Muslim population, which means that businesses here need to show religious respect and develop a deep understanding of Islamic beliefs, practices and traditions.Related: Why Tech is the Future of Education in Indonesia


2. Social dynamics and business practicesLocal connections and strong, well-maintained relationships are extremely important to succeed in the Indonesian market. However, this can be difficult to achieve when there is a general attitude of caution toward foreigners, especially in the context of trustworthiness.Islamic business culture strongly influences the market, which emphasizes the creation of value for the common good over and above profit. The focus here is on social responsibility, philanthropy, sustainable practices, ethical conduct, partnerships, Sharia-compliant finance and social entrepreneurship.Trust is earned in Indonesia. Never expected. And the best way to do that is to enter the market with 'good faith' intentions that align with the business culture.Related: Want to Earn Trust? Don't Break Any of These 4 Links in the Chain of Credibility.


3. ClimateIndonesia is known for its hot, humid, and rainy weather, with average yearly temperatures at around 24°C. Expats from other climates might find it difficult to adapt to life here, which can, in turn, affect their productivity.As a likely result of this warmer climate, Indonesia's pace of life is generally slower than other parts of the world. And that extends to business, too. There is a more relaxed approach to time management, which might initially frustrate entrepreneurs who are new to the market and eager to begin their business journeys.Adaptation is what is essential in Indonesia. Learn to make this way of life work for you.Related: Opportunities and Challenges for Entrepreneurs Thinking About Indonesia's Solar Energy Sector


4. Geography Because its many islands are spread over a vast area, logistics and supply chains can be very challenging for businesses that wish to expand beyond the Java-Bali region.Implementing more complex transport and delivery systems that combine air, sea and land vehicles might become very necessary.However, as stated earlier, Java is the key to the rest of Indonesia. Any desire to operate elsewhere in the country will likely require some form of interaction with it or through it, whether for legal, bureaucratic or practical reasons. Therefore, it is highly recommended that solid foundations be built on Java. No matter what one's business plans are for Indonesia as a whole. This is especially true for its capital, Jakarta.Related: Why Businesses with Remote Teams in Southeast Asia are ThrivingConclusionIn summary, entrepreneurs looking to enter the Indonesian market should prioritize establishing a strategic presence in Jakarta. Success in this diverse business environment requires adapting to local culture, building trust and navigating unique challenges. A systematic and culturally sensitive approach and strategic planning will be essential for tapping into Indonesia's opportunities.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Elise Whang and Emily Erkel, co-founders of B2B marketplace platform LePrix, which offers a curated space for sourcing pre-owned luxury items from top suppliers around the world.LePrix has done more than $100 million in topline gross merchandise value since launch. It has raised $15 million to date and is the largest B2B pre-owned luxury platform globally, with over 150,000 units of pre-owned luxury at wholesale prices per month, according to the company.How did your corporate careers prepare you to launch the side hustle that would become LePrix? 



Whang: Early on in my legal career, I had the opportunity to meet entrepreneurs from mega-corporations who had built their businesses from scratch. Their journey was fascinating and inspiring to me; however, I quickly realized entrepreneurs are often over-glamorized. Lawyers see all the blemishes and the challenges and hardships business owners face as well. This experience helped me take the proverbial leap with my eyes wide open. Importantly, being a lawyer also trained me how to write thoughtfully, be persuasive and take measured risks. I also learned that what I enjoyed most about being a lawyer would carry over to being an entrepreneur — helping people and fixing problems.Erkel: My career in retail strategy consulting prepared me for the launch of LePrix in so many ways. Each project was a different opportunity to help a client overcome a challenge and succeed — whether it was launching a large Japanese fast-fashion retailer in the U.S., helping a women's specialty retailer go omnichannel or [helping] an iconic luxury brand house known for its handbags expand into other categories. The skills I learned to quickly identify the problem, be creative with the solution and help the retailer execute helped me learn the skills that every entrepreneur needs: strategy, execution, grit and adaptability.

It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.When did you start the side hustle that would become your company, and what was the inspiration behind it? Whang: When that first amazing business idea dawns on you, it is like a bright light bulb going off in your head. It first lit up when I was standing in line for coffee before work knowing I had to work over the weekend. What I really wanted to do over the weekend was go to my favorite consignment stores with my sisters, but these stores all closed at 7 p.m., and I could not get there. So why not bring all these wonderful designer consignment stores online? This first iteration of our business was consumer-facing, aiming to aggregate the best designer consignment stores online in one platform. This laid the groundwork for our present business model, focusing on business-to-business (B2B) pre-owned luxury wholesale.In the early days, I juggled my entrepreneurial pursuits with my demanding role as a lawyer. My side hustle typically unfolded between 8 p.m. to 2 or 3 a.m. and consumed weekends for several years. Fast forward — the light bulb went off again when we saw that our stores were buying from each other more and more on our platform. We realized they needed a way to source pre-owned authentic handbags and jewelry from other trusted businesses online. We then launched the first B2B pre-owned luxury wholesale auction houses from across the globe to retailers in the U.S., and it grew from there.


At which point did you decide to leave your corporate jobs to focus on LePrix full-time, and what motivated you to take the leap? Whang: I was eight months pregnant, happily married, with a great job as a lawyer. I was patting myself on the back for being the first female lawyer in our family. But I was also panicking that life was going by at warp speed, and if I didn't take the leap soon to work on this great business plan, it may never happen. In hindsight, I was probably going through a midlife crisis. We applied to an accelerator program and got in, but they required only full-time founders, which meant I had to quit my day job. I was scared about what our immigrant parents, who worked their behinds off to give us the American dream, would think. My husband asked me what I was going to do — and I said I wanted to take a bet on this business; otherwise, I'd regret it on my deathbed (I know, dramatic). I popped out my baby and then started my entrepreneurial journey. I haven't looked back since.Related: Being 'Lazy' Paid Off: Her Failed Side Hustle Led to a Business That Brings in Over $100 Million a YearErkel: At the time, I had been at a large specialty retailer, working with the leadership team on different strategies, from growing their new baby business to exploring ways to shorten lead time from design to delivery. It was an amazing experience and a great team, but part of me yearned to build something that was more aligned with my passion growing up. When I was younger, I was obsessed with fashion, especially luxury and vintage. When my co-founder and sister, Elise, approached me with the idea of launching this as a side hustle, my gut reaction was an immediate yes. Once we started gaining traction and growing quickly, I knew it was time to go full-time, but I was nervous. Innately, I am more risk averse, but the numbers (and Elise) are very convincing. Would I rather be a cog in a wheel or chart my own course and try something new and exciting that there was clearly a market demand for? The answer was clear.


What have been some of the biggest challenges you've faced over the course of your founding journey so far, and how have you overcome them? Whang: One of the significant challenges we faced was securing funding from venture capitalists (VCs). The reality of less than 5% of female founders successfully raising funds from VCs is real. Our company deviates from the conventional VC company profile; we're far from resembling the stereotypical characters depicted in the HBO show Silicon Valley (one of my favorite shows). Notably, our team is 60% BIPOC, with two female founders, and we take immense pride in this diversity. We have, however, successfully secured funds from private investors and early-stage VCs who wholeheartedly believe in our vision, the business, its potential and our team.Erkel: Another challenge was the pivot from B2C to B2B. It was clear that the way to help our stores was not selling but sourcing. For businesses, sourcing pre-owned luxury is difficult, risky and expensive because the wholesale industry for luxury resale is highly fragmented. As our B2B business continued to take off, Elise and I knew it was time to sunset our B2C business. It was a decision we thought very carefully about as the B2C business was not only our first baby, but we had also built a pretty successful business. However, the growth of the B2B business was immense, and with limited resources and time, we knew it was time to double down on B2B.Related: I Spent the Last 3 Years Building My Side Hustle Into a Full-Time Business. Here's What I Learned.What are you most excited about as you look to LePrix's future? Erkel: As the leader in the B2B pre-owned luxury industry, we are most excited to be the driving force making luxury resale accessible to retailers globally. We have the opportunity to change the industry, help retailers meet consumer demand and, most importantly, make a sustainable impact.What's your best advice for other side hustlers who hope to turn their gigs into full-time ventures?Whang: Don't quit your day job until you have some data or traction. DO build out a business model with your data and make an informed decision to take the leap. Don't obsess about hyper growth anymore, but DO build a profitable business — it's still a business. Don't kick yourself for failing. DO learn from your mistakes and quickly pivot.


Erkel: Don't be scared to take the leap. Life is short, and time is limited. If your side hustle shows traction and the only thing that is holding you back is fear, overcome it. Don't let fear dictate your life and stop you from moving forward. Life is more fulfilling if you're doing what you love.

38,4 Launch Strategies for Startup Success and Longevity,"Jan 29, 2024",Jessica Wong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-launch-strategies-for-startup-success-and-longevity/468612,"
The startup scene across the United States is expanding at almost unprecedented rates. Data from the Economic Innovation Group (EIG) shows that the country's business startup rate in 2021 was the highest since the Great Recession. This statistic alone illustrates two facts: founders are confident in the opportunities in the U.S. economy, and the startup marketplace is growing more crowded in almost every industry.As a result, founders are turning to more innovative approaches to ensure their product launches stand out from the crowd, becoming both memorable and financially successful.The United States has traditionally been a hotbed for startup activity. With a culture that embraces entrepreneurship and values business growth, the country has traditionally welcomed new ideas and innovation.



However, having a great idea is no longer enough to succeed. With nearly half a million new businesses being created every year, it can be hard for founders to cut through the noise to get the attention of investors and potential early customers and launch their first product. Some of the most successful recent launches have seen business owners turn to innovative and unconventional tactics to help them stand out in their marketplace.Although common challenges vary depending on which industry a startup is in, some apply to almost any startup. Most have to work with limited resources regarding manpower and finances. New companies also need to overcome lower brand recognition levels than their more established counterparts, making it harder to stand out.


Product launches can be divided into three phases: pre-launch, launch, and post-launch. Applying an innovative approach can be beneficial at either of these stages, and it will depend on your industry to determine when it is most beneficial to think and act out of the box.Related: 3 Things Your Business Idea Must Have To Succeed — as Proven By Famous Harvard Business School Startups1. Develop a compelling pre-launch strategyThink of a music festival: for hours and sometimes days, lesser-known bands are taking the stage, building up to the main event, the headliner. As these bands play, the crowd's excitement grows, and they are ready to cheer as loud as they can for the main artist. The previous bands have helped to create a buzz around what is coming next.The same process happens when your startup is getting ready to launch a new product. In the pre-launch phase, your team is looking to build excitement and anticipation that turns into endorsement and sales once your product is ready. Teaser campaigns can work well to build excitement, or your team could leverage your social media channels to build a community around the upcoming product. Just like the crowds at the festival, engaging with the community will help build buzz.


Stock trading app Robinhood is a great example of a successful pre-launch strategy. Well before the app was launched, the founders attracted over a million users. They used a compelling proposition — $0 commission on trades — and a referral marketing strategy to build buzz. Signing up was simple, and any new user had the right to invite others. The more people a user invited, the higher they moved up in the queue to gain access to the app. By the time the product launched, a community of traders was waiting to use it.2. Leverage influencers and partnershipsWorking with influencers and celebrities and building partnerships with complementary brands can be powerful tools during the pre-launch and launch phases. The influencer's notoriety and their community can become multipliers for marketing messages, and they may also be among your first customers.Direct-to-consumer beauty company Glossier has been using a novel approach to influencer marketing for its product launches. Rather than working with established influencers, the company sends products to people who engage a lot with its online content or have bought a high volume of products. These ambassadors then share their thoughts and help spread the word about new products.Related: 5 Things You Should Know Before Collaborating With An Influencer


3. Create unconventional launch eventsLaunch events offer startups another excellent opportunity to connect with their audiences. While the classic, opening-night-style event may work for brick-and-mortar startups, tech businesses can still utilize this strategy to lift the proverbial curtain on a product.Virtual tours and other experiences work well for launch events, especially if they allow the audience to interact with the product. Consider using the pre-launch phase to deliver clues about the product, allowing your audience to build a connection. The launch then becomes the final step that reveals the product and perhaps offers free access to those who have consistently engaged during the pre-launch phase.4. Leverage customer engagement and feedbackIt is too easy to pour all your energy into the launch and pre-launch phase but forget about post-launch engagement. Doing that would mean your company is missing out on one of its biggest opportunities.The post-launch phase is when you turn first-time customers into advocates. This is the perfect time to ask for feedback and show your customers you care by resolving problems quickly. It is also important to keep an open mind toward product iterations and adjustments during this phase. No matter how much time your team spent developing your product, it is almost impossible to foresee every potential issue.


Dealing with concerns quickly and engaging customers regularly will go a long way toward building a loyal customer base for your brand.Related: Redefining Customer Engagement in a World Where Data Privacy ReignsConclusionInnovative product launches make an impression, with consumers buying your product immediately and others holding off. Taking a creative approach to the pre-launch, launch, and post-launch phases can help startups build the foundations of a loyal customer base that has supported the brand for decades.There is no right or wrong way of applying these out-of-the-box approaches. Draw inspiration from the examples above, but remember to develop a launch strategy that is authentic to your startup for the highest impact.

Katherine O'Brien.When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?



My side hustle journey has been two-fold. I started my ice cream business, Cream Cruiser, in May of 2015 kind of on a whim. I was working a regular 9-5 but always knew that I wanted to create something that was my own.At the time, I was walking to my 9-5 job through the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, which, over the summer, was always filled with lots of visitors and corporate commuters such as myself. Some days, there would be so many people that you could hardly navigate through the crowds. I was constantly thinking to myself how amazing an ice cream cart would be on a hot, sunny day.


Also, at this time, the mobile food industry had really started to gain traction. I wasn't interested in starting an ice cream truck because of the investment. I wanted something smaller and simpler. After some research and phone calls, I found a small business that manufactured custom food bikes. And within minutes of speaking with them, I knew it was for me.I got the entire business up and running for under $10,000 and launched in just a few months. I started at a local farmers market, and it wasn't long until I got into catering weddings, corporate and college events, etc.Image Credit: Elizabeth Rodenhizer Photography


Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill. It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.I worked a full-time job and sold ice cream during the summer for over three years to be able to put every penny back into the business. Finally, in 2018, I quit my job to go all in on my ice cream business. At this time, I also expanded into wholesale and even private label.The second part of my side hustle journey came into play after a tough few years from 2020-2022. As a small business in the food and beverage and events industry, I felt like I could not keep my head above water and knew that something needed to change.As events were introduced back into our lives, my little catering business started to take off. All of a sudden, I got my fire back and had a great income stream that I had been missing over the past two years during the pandemic. Towards the end of 2022, I decided to stop focusing on the wholesale and private label and go back to doing what I loved, which was selling ice cream from a bike at events.


This led me to part two of my side hustle journey. I created Bike Business University to share my love of this ice cream bike business model with as many people as possible. It's simple, it's affordable, and it's fun! My goal is to make the bike business community just as big as the food truck community.Related: This Ballet Dancer Needed a Side Hustle When the Pandemic Stopped Performances. So She Spun Her Unique Skill Set Into a 6-Figure Business.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?The first thing I did was start my Ice Cream Bike Lady social media accounts. I began sharing my journey and what I loved about my ice cream catering business.  I was also using this time to learn more about digital marketing and how to teach others what I had learned over the years. I wanted to help them avoid some of the lessons I learned the hard way. Pretty quickly, I started connecting with people all over the country looking for a mentor to help them get started and, most importantly, hold them accountable for bringing their business to life. So, I continued listening to my audience and created what they were asking for.


Image Credit: Katherine O'BrienWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?Due to the challenges that came with the pandemic, for a while, I struggled with feeling like I had failed — that I didn't have what it took to scale my ice cream business to what I had originally envisioned when I first went full-time with it. But in reality, those challenges were the best thing that ever happened because they forced me to refocus my goals and brought Bike Business University into my life. It took me a while to be okay with the fact that change is healthy, and being an entrepreneur, it is incredibly important to adapt as needed.

Here's What I Learned.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue, and at what point did the side hustle's income surpass your full-time job?I launched Bike Business University before I had even created it. I had an idea of what the program would look like and had started developing the backend, but it was far from ready. I wanted to make sure it sold before I dove in 100%, so I did a pre-sale. Within the first week, I had sold over $10,000 in courses. I am very grateful that it did not slow down after that, and almost immediately, I replaced my full-time job's income.You've turned your side hustle into a full-time business. How much average monthly or annual revenue does it bring in now?Currently, I average $20,000 per month with Bike Business University. With the recent growth, I am projected to double that by the start of summer 2024.What's your advice for other side-hustlers who hope to turn their ventures into successful businesses?Start before you are ready, and trust yourself enough to know that if you're passionate about what you're doing, you will figure it out as you go. It's okay to make mistakes. It's okay to learn lessons the hard way. It's okay to adapt and make changes as you need to. Just keep going and keep growing.Related: 4 Things Entrepreneurs Don't Need, According to This Outdoor Adventurer and Creative Founder


Also, learn online skills. The internet and social media can be incredibly powerful when you understand the opportunities available. Nothing brings me more joy than selling ice cream out at events, but having an online side to my business has been a total game-changer for me — and provided me with an uncapped income that would not be possible solely from ice cream sales.

40,The Unorthodox Communication Model That Can Better Align Your Company's Values,"Jan 5, 2024",Michael Quoc,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/thinking-in-circles-isnt-a-good-thing-except-in-this/466312,"
Growing a business in a way that nurtures alignment instead of stunting it persists as a famously difficult task. And it's only becoming more important. According to research by LSA Global, organizations that are ""highly aligned"" grow revenue 58% faster and are 72% more profitable than poorly aligned organizations.How can leaders rethink their businesses' organizational structures to make alignment possible? How does alignment translate from an aspirational buzzword to a resonant reality?Enter the concentric circle model of communication, an organizational structure that understands the importance of alignment in business and the need for collaboration, community and shared outcomes. The methodology needs not replace existing organizational structures but augment them.



Related: A Step-by-Step Guide to Achieving Organizational AlignmentThe concentric circle model and the future of organizational thinkingThe concentric circle model is an organizational way of thinking. It places the residents of your world in a ripple effect instead of in a tree or ladder-like structure. From partners (the strong core of the business and its mission) to employees, beta testers, community members and back again, the concentric model helps information flow freely across groups.


Imagine a startup aimed at developing sustainable technologies. In the concentric circle model, you'd see the following:Core: The founders and primary stakeholders setting the vision.Next circle: Employees bringing the vision to life.Following circle: Principal informants providing crucial feedback.Outer circle: The wider community interested in its mission.In a traditional hierarchical model, communication between different groups might be linear and restrictive, whereas the concentric circle model promotes a continuous exchange of ideas and feedback. This means that engineers can receive input from the community, which helps them understand their technologies' real-world impact and potential improvements. Additionally, the core team's vision and updates can not only reach employees but also target audiences and the broader community. This ensures everyone is aligned and fosters a shared sense of purpose.As the company evolves, each ripple in the concentric model contributes to a continual feedback loop that drives innovation, alignment and a strong communal bond toward achieving the mission of sustainable technology.The benefit of this mindset is that it is mutually collaborative. Values can be shared from group to group — no matter where that group sits in the circle. Because of that sharing, the business can become quickly aligned on economic outcomes and a sense of common purpose. In turn, group members can take bold action, knowing they're in unity with the whole circle.


At my company, this means pursuing a true everybody-wins culture from a financial perspective. When the product succeeds, shoppers save money, businesses make more sales and our company earns more money, which allows us to reward users. When the company revenue grows, our stakeholders also share in that growth.Related: Why Aligning Your Company Values is Crucial for Long-Term Success3 ways to make the concentric circle model work for your businessThe concentric circle model of communication might sound like a fabulous idea, but how can you put it into practice? Does it require a complete renovation of your business's organizational structure? Not necessarily. It's a way of thought, and practicing it well means keeping some key methods in mind:1. Identify your stakeholdersTo make the concentric circle model of communication successful, you need a holistic, working knowledge of your organization. What parties do you need to include in your vision? What are their roles? What are your organization's layers? One business might include beta testers and influencers; another might include a wide network of suppliers and volunteers.


Identify key stakeholders and assess the impact of their actions on your business or product to determine their positioning within the circle. For instance, those with higher impact are placed closer to the center. Those who are folded closer into the circle often have higher participation in decision-making. To bring outer echelons inward, involve more stakeholders. For example, Demand.io's SimplyCodes product not only asks for constant user feedback, but also identifies product champions to employ in an internal council of high-expectation users who earn a stipend for their valued input.2. Find agreement on shared goalsThe purpose of the concentric circle model is to create a collaborative way of working and making decisions based on a shared vision. Achieve this by establishing your business's core goals. Across the layers of the circle, you must design and tweak your aims to align with the community. Begin with the nucleus of partners and decision makers to form a set of core initial ambitions and then find unity in the wider circle by collaborating.Goals could be economic, or they could be product- or service-related. Maybe your goals are to grow your business into new territories; maybe it's to condense your impact and make your business more community-centric. No matter your ambitions, shared goals can lead to shared outcomes. The above research from LSA Global found that highly aligned companies outperform their peers in retaining and satisfying customers, engaging employees and leading effectively.Related: Your Public Messaging Strategy Starts With Your Inner Circle


3. Align your valuesIf you've followed the above steps, you've established a strong working knowledge of your organization, its various layers and how they function in your circle. You've also set goals you'll aim toward collectively. The final piece of the puzzle is values. Currently, your organizational values might be fragmented. Different groups may want different things and be guided by conflicting values, but the concentric circle model encourages you to zero in on the values shared across your community. Aligning these values will have a unifying effect on everything you do.In applying the concentric circle model, every major business decision should be held up to the model, and leaders should consider whether benefits ripple across the whole circle. To aid alignment, you need not necessarily agonize over perfect plans but discipline your vision and mission to be authentic and considerate of every layer of your circle. Driving business strategy toward shared outcomes encourages the team to ideate innovative and sustainable business flywheels instead of juggling adversarial relationships.The CEO of Chicken Salad Chick implemented a concentric circle model in the business. With a strong focus on community growth and awareness to pave the way for future expansions, the brand went from 32 restaurants in 2015 (when the CEO joined the company) to more than 220 today.The concentric circle model is an important tool for thinking differently about business value alignment. It may not replace hierarchical structures, but it does respond to the future of business leadership as the landscape evolves. By beginning with a strong core and radiating values outward through the various layers of the organization, the concentric circle model can forge deep, lasting, productive connections among stakeholders and communities.

41,A Company With a Conscience — How to Make High-Priced Products Accessible to Working-Class Families,"Dec 7, 2023",Rashan Dixon,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-make-high-priced-products-accessible-to/463079,"
There are times when products are inherently expensive. Homes are a classic example. So are vehicles. In those cases, the constant human needs for shelter and transportation have created natural solutions in the form of mortgages and auto loans.But what about companies outside of staple product niches? Here are three examples of how companies with high-priced products designed for larger consumer markets can make them accessible to working-class families.Leasing expensive equipment to customersLeasing is a classic business model. It involves renting an asset under a contractual agreement at a certain price for a set amount of time.



When leasing comes up, it's usually referencing major assets such as a house or car. However, it's completely possible to lease a wide variety of additional products.Related: 5 Major Leasing Deal Points to Know Before Signing a Lease


One example of this is solar panels. NerdWallet reports that the average solar panel installation can cost as much as $35,000. The renewable source of energy can save money over time, but its barrier to entry is inhibitive and has made solar power inaccessible to lower-income homeowners for over a decade.Some companies aim to combat this by leasing solar panel systems to homeowners. The end result is lower energy bills that ideally cover both the leased equipment and reduce the original cost of energy for the home.This approach to solar panel installation saves consumers tens of thousands of dollars in up-front fees. This makes it possible for homeowners to tap into the long-term savings of solar power without breaking the bank in the process. The same model is easy to reproduce for any brand that has a solid product and enough capital or investors to front the cash for equipment.Related: How to Invest In Real Estate Amid High Interest Rates and Inflation


Offering interest-free paymentsInterest is a major detracting factor that makes larger purchases unappealing. For example, if an individual purchases a car in New York and takes out a five-year $25,000 auto loan at 5% interest, they'll end up paying over $2,600 more in interest.Broken down over 60 months, this is nearly $45 per month in interest alone. To a working-class family, this is a legitimate cost that they must factor into their financial plans.Savvy companies that sell big-ticket items have caught onto the toll that interest payments take on their customers. Some have opted to offer interest-free payments as an alternative.Home Depot, for instance, regularly offers its customers coupons for 12-month and even 24-month interest-free financing. The Home Depot credit card also provides a round-the-clock six-month interest-free financing option. That means a customer can hold a balance with the company for that entire period (whether it's six, 12 or 24 months). As long as they pay off the total before the payment period ends, they won't pay a penny in interest.


This model assumes a certain degree of risk on the part of the company. However, when managed well, the interest-free financing model more than makes up for the risks in the amount of larger purchases it encourages from those customers with limited up-front funding.Breaking things into smaller bundles and á la carte pricingSometimes, a grouped product selection can push something out of reach of working-class family budgets. When this is the case, splitting a product up into multiple components can help reduce the financial barrier to entry.The exorbitant cost of cable television is a good example of this issue. Cable provider Spectrum has found a solution to the problem of its excessively priced full television packages by offering its Spectrum TV Choice bundle.This allows users to choose from a variety of channels to fill up a smaller quota of total channels. They can change their selection once a month, making the arrangement sustainable and accessible.


Not all products come in individual pieces. Whenever that is the case, though, companies should consider innovative ways to repackage the individual components to make them accessible to customers without losing their collective value.Related: How Businesses Can Empower Consumers to Make Sustainable ChoicesMaking high-priced products accessible to everyday consumersThe middle class in America is able to make larger purchases. But they cannot do so with the same laissez-faire attitude as those with ample wealth and disposable income.Companies that want to market higher-priced products to middle-class consumers must be willing to find unique and innovative ways to help them make a purchase. From leasing and financing options to á la carte and ""buffet style"" offerings, consider how you can make your brand's big-ticket items accessible to your target audience.

Technology completely defines mainstream society today because it makes people's lives easier and expands the horizon of possibility. Apple's once novel catchphrase, ""There's an app for that,"" has never rung truer. You can order groceries, visit the doctor or adjust the temperature in your home — all from the palm of your hand.Technologies are also bringing ease and efficiency to businesses small and large. Global manufacturers have embraced Metaverse-like technologies to design, plan and test operations in their future factories before entering the costly construction phase. Even restaurant franchises are exploring new technological opportunities, with artificial intelligence drive-thrus garnering serious attention. Beyond maximizing operational efficiencies, digital technologies can boost the value a business is able to offer its customers — and this is increasingly happening through the Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS) business model.Similar to the way smartphone apps make everyday tasks easier, the XaaS model makes achieving your and your customers' desired outcomes more practical and feasible. Under this model, a company owns, delivers and manages a suite of product offerings, including various hardware and software solutions. Enabled by the addition of digital technologies in particular, XaaS business models are generating more value for companies old and new.



In fact, according to a recent report from EY, over 90% of companies that responded to its survey are now generating at least some revenue from XaaS models. Driven by competitive pressures and market changes, the amount of businesses generating more than 80% of their revenues from XaaS is expected to surge from 3% in 2022 to 19% by 2026, showing great momentum for the XaaS model. From greater customer satisfaction to repeatable revenue streams, companies that reimagine how they deliver value through a XaaS lens can find sustainable success in today's rapidly evolving macro dynamics.Related: 3 Tips to Keep in Mind When Taking Your Company Global


Create a one-stop shop that maximizes customer satisfaction and creates repeatable revenue streamsToday's economic climate is leading many businesses to reconsider the way they purchase products and services. What once worked — like making one-time purchases from a number of vendors and paying upfront for each — is now inefficient and expensive.This is especially true for small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), which are unable to exploit economies of scale, but make up nearly 90% of all businesses worldwide. In addition to being expensive, these siloed products are rarely capable of solving complex business problems, as they fail to account for the wider business perspective and future integration challenges.For example, retail franchises that want to reduce operating costs by lowering their energy usage likely need more than just new light bulbs. They'd also want to invest in energy-efficient heating and cooling, smart thermostats and a way to automate and monitor their real-time energy consumption to ensure they're achieving their energy reduction goals. Approaching each solution as part of a whole — rather than an individual unit — allows XaaS models to minimize costs and complexity and accelerate project timelines to meet client objectives.Companies that deliver their offerings via XaaS business models provide far more value, particularly SMBs. By directly tying the ability to earn recurring revenues to customers' desired outcomes, the XaaS model creates a one-stop shop for customer satisfaction and repeatable income streams while ensuring full transparency into investment outcomes. The ability to showcase ongoing value also enables XaaS providers to develop stronger and more resilient long-term client relationships.


Grow with your customersThe XaaS structure is designed to grow and scale as a customer's needs shift or expand. With it, service providers are incentivized to continuously optimize and enhance their offerings through critical learnings and insights gathered on the job. This flexible model is optimal for today's macro climate, which increasingly requires businesses to adapt to changing demands in the face of new market catalysts.Small and large businesses, for example, are facing mounting pressure to become more energy-efficient and resource-conscious as climate change and other environmental challenges are growing more salient to the public eye. XaaS companies in the energy space, known as Energy-as-a-Service, use intelligent monitoring systems to learn and resolve where energy is being wasted to maximize energy savings and lower overall operating costs.Related: Do You Have the Right Tech Mindset?A win-win-win for companies, customers and the macroeconomyThe comprehensive capabilities of XaaS and today's shifting macro dynamics make outcome-based services a more attractive way to meet customers' needs. A results-driven model, XaaS aligns the economic costs of a solution and its tangible and intangible benefits derived over time, allowing stakeholders to focus on generating long-term results as opposed to spending upfront capital. This runs contrary to one-time ""upfront purchase models,"" which have the unfortunate consequence of interfering with optimizing value outcomes.


At its core, XaaS empowers businesses with the flexibility and sustainability to continuously innovate and scale, unconstrained by product boundaries to best meet customer demands. To find success in today's economic climate, business leaders must embrace new and holistic, growth strategies that align their business goals with that of their customers.

43,How to Unlock Your Company's Value in the 'Circular Economy',"Sep 20, 2022",Jessica Abo,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-unlock-your-companys-value-in-the-circular-economy/435480,"
Michael Smith, a general partner at Regeneration.VC, sat down with Jessica Abo to talk about his company and the steps you can take to unlock value where you work, especially if you're looking to be part of the circular economy.Jessica Abo: Michael, great to be with you. Can you first start by telling us what is the circular economy, and why does it matter?Smith:



The circular economy is really a response to the linear economy, which we live in today, where we take things from the earth, make them into products, consume them, and then throw them away. 91% of all material ends up in a landfill, an ocean, or a natural system. So within a circular economy, we are, from the moment we're making new products, thinking about materials that can be reused. We're thinking about how we use them and trying to keep things extended beyond a single use or limited use. Almost two-thirds of global emissions are tied to the things that we consume every day, the food we're eating, and the clothes we're wearing. So if we can make things in a better way and keep them in circulation longer, we can drastically reduce emissions, can improve life on our planet.I love your origin story. Can you share what you were doing before you started Regeneration, and what made you want to start this venture capital fund?Smith:I had been touring around the world as a DJ in my early twenties and thirties and was seeing the world change around me, the environment, and I really wanted to do something. And I had also been an entrepreneur and set up a business doing music for restaurants, hotels, and retail stores. And after I sold that business, I really wanted to marry my two interests in the environment with investing in a for-profit business. And so Regeneration is the marriage of those two things. We invest in early-stage companies working around circular economy opportunities.And what is your overall fund strategy, and how do you use capital to drive positive environmental outcomes?Smith:


We invest across three different areas. The first we call design. These are the materials that go into the products we consume, the fibers in clothes, the packaging, and the food and beverage inputs for the consumer brands. We're buying formulations for beauty products. The second is use. These are the brands and services that use those products. Think about companies like Patagonia and Alternative Meats and things like that. And finally is re-use. So if we're not sending something to a landfill and we're putting it back through the supply chain, what are we doing with it? How do we upcycle what would otherwise be a waste stream into a valuable material?We've invested in a company called CleanO2 which does all three of these things. First, they have equipment that captures HVAC emissions from air conditioning units and heaters, and it traps a material that is called potash. And that potash is then used to make a new material, a cleaning product, that is sold as a brand, a consumer soap. That's the full chain of circularity. We get active with our portfolio companies. We've made eight investments so far. And we work to accelerate them and to bring them to market quicker so that they can actively compete and really scale out.Can you tell us about your most recent investment and why you're so excited about it?Smith:


The most recent investment we've made it into a company called TULU. If you live in an apartment building, you've probably felt that you could share with residents certain things, like vacuum cleaners or maybe consumer products, video game systems. And they have units in your lobby that enable that. They let you unlock additional amenities and opportunities out of your living experience within shared environments, whether it be a scooter that you could take out with a helmet that's much nicer than what you'd find on the street. Printing services so you don't have to have your own printer and paper. We're very excited about what it means for how manufacturers, like Bosch, who's an investor and partner to them, are using that information to make products that can last longer, that can be used more. Where you may only use a vacuum cleaner once a week, in this model, that same vacuum cleaner is getting used many times, and it's displacing each vacuum cleaner, upwards of 50, from being created in the first place. So we're just very excited about the concept of unlocking the sharing economy within living environments.Are big companies committing to circularity and are they taking advantage of these learnings?Smith: You have industry leaders like Apple getting back their phones and making new phones out of them, paying more to get those old phones back, and opening up repair opportunities for the first time in over a decade. You have companies like Amazon working on their packaging and committing to different circular outcomes. You have Nike that's open-sourced strategies of how you can make your business more circular, particularly within the apparel world. Unilever, Procter & Gamble, and so many are committing to this, as well as cities and governments. So there's a huge movement around circularity and we're excited to be a small part of that.


For people who want to unlock circular opportunities within their businesses, what are some steps that you recommend?Smith:There are so many ways that you can apply it, but the most basic is, to go through your business now, and think about places that you have wasted. Think about times when you can increase efficiency and improve overall performance. Rank those for how much they're going to cost you, how much they can make you, and how profitable they can become for you. And then do your best to figure out what the environmental implications may be and where new regulation is moving. There's so much to be done here, and it's a really fun way to think about how you can improve the planet and make money.

44,Why You Should Use a Subscription Business Model,"Mar 19, 2015",Chuck Longanecker,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-you-should-use-a-subscription-business-model/243573,"
Since consumer buying habits are trending toward more simple and hassle-free shopping experiences, more and more companies are jumping into the subscription space and seeing incredible growth. Last year, Dollar Shave Club was expected to generate $60 million in revenue, nearly tripling its 2013 revenue. Even more impressive, Honest Company was expected to bring in $150 million in revenue in 2014, landing the business a $1 billion valuation.But along with the increasing success of subscription-based businesses comes the cautionary tale of the failure to adapt. Take, for instance, the decline of movie rental giant Blockbuster. Faced with Netflix's budding success, Blockbuster failed to recognize the changing needs of the modern consumer. By the time it rolled out its ""no late fees"" campaign, the last nail had already been hammered in place. In 2010, just 10 years after the arrival of Netflix, Blockbuster was worth just $24 million with $1.1 billion in losses.When we look at the success of software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies, many of which are offering monthly or annual service subscriptions and pulling in multi-billion valuations -- hi, DropBox and Salesforce.com -- it's more evident than ever that customers prefer subscriptions. Yet professional service industries are falling behind. The only hope? We must adapt.



Valuable for the company -- and the customerThe subscription model owes its success to the optimal balance of value it provides to both the company and the customer.For customers, the value lies in the convenience. First, there's the autopilot simplicity of subscriptions that removes the thinking out of a purchase decision. Subscribers never have to remember to reorder every month, which gives them the reassurance that they will have whatever they need before they actually need it. Everything arrives to your door like magic -- removing the hassle of making a trip to the store or website to place an order. Second, subscriptions offer a flat rate which helps customers stay within their budget -- always. Lastly, subscriptions usually bring added value to the customer through bundling or getting it all for the price of one.


For businesses, the value of a subscription is the ability to predict revenue through recurring sales. In fact, according to John Warrillow, creator of The Value Builder System, recurring revenue is perhaps one of the most compelling factors in a company valuation. ""The more guaranteed revenue you can offer a potential acquirer, the more valuable your business is going to be,"" Warrillow says. ""Because a high percentage of the revenue of a subscription-based business is recurring, its value will be up to eight times that of a comparable business with very little recurring revenue.""This consistency in revenue also allows subscription-based companies to easily calculate the lifetime value of a customer, manage inventory, offer simple pricing and many other business benefits.Time for services to launch subscriptionsAs I mentioned earlier, while products and SaaS have caught onto the subscription model, it seems that professional services have not. Sure, we have the monthly retainer, but these agreements are usually locked in based on pre-purchased services rendered and tasks completed. It doesn't allow for flexibility like subscriptions do.What if services were offered on a subscription based model instead?


Fed up with the risk and constant guessing game of scoped projects, I took the plunge and converted the subscription business model of my UX firm Digital Telepathy to subscription only. Instead of signing project agreements or monthly retainers with a detailed scope, we simply offered all of our services under a flat-fee subscription. Clients were initially confused, but once they experienced how our new approach improved our alignment on strategy, design output and working speed, our retention rates catapulted. Since switching to the subscription model, our revenue has increased by 300 percent.In addition, the subscription model positively impacts our clients by providing results that are aligned with their business objectives, not just a project plan. In other words, we went from creating project deliverables to being an extension of their team and impacting their bottom line.Positive impact of a service-based business1. FlexibilitySubscriptions allow you as a company to plan resources and predict revenue. Your client wants to change the focus of the project? No problem -- nothing is ""out of scope"" because there isn't a scope. Service subscriptions allow you to be flexible in your tactics without having inconsistent service due to recalculating costs. It gives your company the ability to provide different types of services, not just deliverables. This is also a benefit to the client, as they always know that resources (whatever they may need) will be available to them as their needs change. It gives the option to change their objectives on the spot and adjust the game plan month over month.2. Ability to scaleIf client needs change dramatically, a subscription will give them the ability to scale work up or down, without worrying about contracts. For instance, if a client is in the middle of a website redesign, and they suddenly need to invest funds into a special product initiative they are rolling out, they have the ability to decrease their subscription for a few months. Work will still continue but at a slower pace.


On the other hand, if the client just closed a round of funding and needs to accelerate the launch of their SaaS site to satisfy investors, they can increase their subscription to increase the pace. Or let's say a client is opening another location and is in need of more design work, the graphic artist could increase their service subscription to meet the needs for that month. Subscriptions allow clients the security of knowing that everything is month-to-month, and nothing is set in stone -- especially scope.As a company, subscriptions also allow you to scale if you continue to add value to the client and impact their bottom line.3. Stronger relationshipsThe subscription model is also not about getting a project done and then moving on to the next client. It allows us as a service provider to grow a relationship with the client and cater to their business or design needs as they change. It builds a substantial level of trust since the client knows that you have their best interests in mind and understand their business.Moreover, it also forces service providers to be accountable in their client relationships. In a project, the goal is to finish, whereas with a subscription, the goal is to accomplish the objective -- and continue to provide value over time. We must always be pushing for innovation and exploring ways to make a greater impact, to be proactive instead of reactive. For instance, lawyers would look to drafting stronger contracts and proactively looking out for trademark infringements, using new tools to do so.


Subscriptions can workServices must adapt to avoid falling behind like Blockbuster. There are already a number of successful service providers using the subscription model. Global web and software developer Pivotal Labs offers their services through coaching subscriptions -- clients retain their team's expertise and learn their processes by working side-by-side with them on location. Their success didn't go unnoticed. EMC acquired them in 2012. Innovative medical startup One Medical Group has remade the office visit into a convenient and efficient process. Members of One Medical pay an annual fee of $149 to $199 (depending on the city) and enjoy benefits such as same-day appointments made online, more personal treatment plans and direct access to doctors outside the office. The group raised their second round of funding in 2014, bringing in $40 million in additional investment.Product and SaaS service subscriptions offer value to both the company and to the customer. Following their lead, professional service providers such as web designers, marketers, financial advisors and more can reap the benefits of subscriptions and grow their companies. Sure, it's a bit different than the way things are usually done -- but if we can do it, you can, too.

45,Claim to Be the Uber of X. Enliven Your Company With the Right Analogy.,"Oct 22, 2014",Miles Jennings,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/claim-to-be-the-uber-of-x-enliven-your-company-with-the/238810,"
Except for the embarrassing whirring of the one laptop in the room without a solid state drive, the room is completely quiet. The first slide pops up and a company logo is animated with light for a second, invoking a fish's wet back glinting in the sun as it struggles against a line. The pitch is on.""Picking a present for your girlfriend is hard, right?"" the presenter begins. Two people in the room wince and exchange glances with the lone woman in the room. A few people nod in agreement.""And you always wait until the last second, right?"" he continues. ""Well, worry no more. UGift.ly buys presents for you and brings them right to your door -- all through a simple smartphone app. You just connect your Facebook friends, tap a button and the perfect present will be delivered in a few hours.""



""But I don't understand,"" says an investor, who, in his irresponsible youth, was editor of the Harvard Crimson. ""How do you make money?""""Oh, simple .We're like Uber for gift giving,"" the presenter replies.Related: 'We're the Uber of X!'There's a collective sigh in the room and quite a few smiles. The next slide shows a cartoon lightbulb that's immediately understood. All is right in the world.Everyone these days uses analogies to describe a business model. A stadium could be filled with the founders of startups who have used Uber to create a business analogy (Uber for pizza, Uber for flowers and Uber for dates). And this is for good reason: Invoking Uber calls to mind all that's beyond cool. Uber summons with a tap, a future that is convenient, polished and without pain. It's no wonder that it's now also a massive cliché among startups.That doesn't mean that invoking another company as a business model is wrong or trite. Picking the right analogy isn't just for informing weary venture capitalists. Choosing the right analogy can inform an entrepreneur's choices and decisions and opens up up new ideas. 



  In a Harvard Business Review article ""How Strategists Really Think: Tapping the Power of Analogy,"" authors Giovanni Gavetti and Jan W. Rivkin wrote that analogies are ""imperfect but useful. The challenge is to get the most out of them.The right analogy frees an entrepreneur from being trapped within his or her own industry for inspiration. Instead of sticking an analogy into a slide presentation and forgetting it, try bringing it deep inside the business strategy in these areas:Related: 6 Great Business Models to Consider for a Startup1. Revenue.How does the model company make money? Look beyond its stated products to see how it earns money through partnerships and third-party integrations. The real revenue sources may be very different than the consumer-facing products.2. Key metrics.What key indicators does the model use to forecast and plan against? Uber might consider number of app downloads or drivers or the average cost of the ride. How do these translate to the new startup's market?


3. Content. How does the model company market itself and generate search traffic? How does it engage its audience?It's easy to figure out a company's content strategy because this is mostly public. Can this strategy be applied to the new startup being launched? 4. Hiring.The business being followed as a model can give an idea about the most important hire to make when scaling up the startup effectively. Does that business rely on heavy customer support or lots of salespeople in the field? Use this example to hire proactively based on a similar pattern of operational growth.5. Exit.The model company is likely years if not a decade ahead of the new startup. When did it take outside capital and how did it plan its rounds of investment? Was there an exit by the founders? Who is that company's potential buyers and who might be potential buyers of the new startup? The capitalization strategy may mirror that of the model company.


The analogy picked may dictate the future of the startup so pick carefully. But after finding that great model that resonates, be sure to make the most of it. Use the analogy to build a new business wisely and fulfill its ultimate purpose. Related: 3 Things Entrepreneurs Must Do to Keep Their Business Model Relevant

46,3 Things Entrepreneurs Must Do to Keep Their Business Model Relevant,"Sep 3, 2014",Jesse Torres,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-things-entrepreneurs-must-do-to-keep-their-business-model/236997,"
A business model describes how a company will make its money and creates a road map to follow so as to ensure enough funds come in to keep it solvent.  Entrepreneurs like Ryan Krane, president of the eponymous firm Ryan Krane Inc. and creator of the Krane Training Method, know that launching and operating a company is a challenge and that success requires continuous evaluation of the business model to improve tactics and try new approaches.Slightly more than 10 years ago Krane began his fitness-training and rehabilitation business, offering personal sessions and one-on-one attention. 



Over the years Krane has adjusted his business model to take advantage of demographic changes. On my Money Talk radio show, he recently shared his tips for keeping a business model relevant and achieving entrepreneurial success:1. Seek a growth component.Abraham Lincoln once said, ""The probability that we may fall in the struggle ought not deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just; it shall not deter me.""


When it comes to starting and growing a business, entrepreneurs should give themselves the best shot at success. The marketplace is packed with competitors. While new entrants with considerable innovation can have success in serving mature and stable segments, entrepreneurs must be cautious. They can get the greatest bang for their buck by targeting segments that are growing and where players are not yet established.Krane recognized the business-development opportunities suggested in research citing the health benefits of regular exercise. His hunch was bolstered by the following Bureau of Labor Statistics projection: ""Employment of fitness trainers and instructors is projected to grow 13 percent from 2012 to 2022, about as fast as the average for all occupations.""2. Evolve the business.The Greek philosopher Heraclitus is widely credited with saying, ""The only thing that is constant is change."" While some entrepreneurs may not be trained in the classics, this is one lesson that business owners ought to know. All industries are in a constant state of change and companies that do not evolve will eventually die.When Krane began his fitness-training business, baby boomers were still years away from beginning their exodus into the world of retirement (perhaps eating bonbons and sipping Mai Tais). As years passed, he recognized a need to address the aches and pains that come with aging.


Indeed as the Denver Post reported, ""the benefits of exercise for any age are well documented, but recent studies indicate that it can have significant impact on reducing illness and chronic disease in those over the age of 50."" Krane saw business potential in this trend and took timely action by implementing programs focusing not only on traditional fitness and nutrition regimens but also on addressing some common ailments that arise with aging.Earlier this year, Krane released a series of videos intended to address these ailments with titles like Get My Ankle Better, Get My Knee Better and Get My Back Better. 3. Be innovative.Innovation can keep an entrepreneur's competition at bay. About three years ago, as Krane witnessed the surge in popularity of video and the power of YouTube, he began to explore the use of instructional videos as a form of marketing. (Indeed YouTube broke the billion-user mark in 2013, according to Advertising Age.) Krane created his own YouTube channel and began to create and distribute fitness advice online.Krane's reputation for producing fitness and nutrition content spread and he began receiving inquiries from potential clients around the world.


Pursuing yet another chance to innovate, Krane expanded his in-person fitness training business to include virtual training by using Skype. His client portfolio expanded to include clients from as far away as Indonesia. His innovative approach to fitness training scored him a recent interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer.In the real world, more than three areas of concern arise. But entrepreneurs who adequately focus on growth, evolution and innovation can aim for their business models remaining relevant at all times and giving them the greatest opportunity to achieve success.

47,An Investigative Report on Franchise Profits,"Oct 21, 2013",Jason Daley,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/an-investigative-report-on-franchise-profits/228698,"
Franchisors are pretty upfront about what it's going to cost to get you into their systems. They happily outline franchise fees, royalties, marketing requirements and grand-opening costs, and they can ballpark figures for potential franchisees on everything from the amount of printer paper they'll go through each month to the best deals on neon signs.But franchisors are bashful when it comes to talking about how much moolah franchisees can actually earn running their businesses.This reluctance makes sense to a certain extent. Any earnings claims that a franchisor makes, either outright or implied, can open the company up to a lawsuit if a disgruntled franchisee doesn't reach those goals. Instead, franchisors direct candidates to their Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD), the detailed prospectus they are required by law to give to interested investors.Item 19 of the FDD details the financial performance of the franchise and offers a snapshot of the average revenue a franchisee makes. But Item 19 is often calculated with a sleight of hand that would make a magician proud, with the numbers spun to put the system in the best possible light. The earning ranges documented can be so large (e.g., $50,000 to $500,000) as to be meaningless, if they are shared at all, since filling out Item 19 is optional.



So, how much can you earn by opening a franchise unit? According to a large survey by the research firm Franchise Business Review, the average franchisee across the spectrum earns a profit of $66,000 annually. Beyond that, it's hard to generalize, since there can be major differences between concepts even in the same sector.We spoke with experts, franchisors and franchisees in restaurants, mobile opportunities and personal-service companies to estimate the profits one might expect when investing in different types of businesses. More important, we picked their brains to discover the moves smart franchisees make to increase their margins.Now Serving: Cracking the Restaurants ModelMad money: Dean Clarino opened a second Teriyaki Madness store in 2011.Photo© Leila NavidiWhen people think of franchising, fast food is often the first thing that comes to mind. While restaurants make up a healthy chunk of the franchising world, it's hard to recommend a food-based franchise to beginners. Typically, restaurants have some of the highest startup costs in franchising. At the same time, they offer the biggest returns. ""There are a lot of moving parts and specialization in food,"" explains Alex Cunningham, a Florida-based business consultant who focuses on maximizing franchisee profits. ""I would strongly recommend a background in the industry.""


Jeff Elgin, CEO of franchise referral firm FranChoice, agrees. He believes that to make a go of it in the food business, operators must be extremely smart right out of the gate. ""Restaurants are tough businesses with much, much smaller margins than other franchises,"" he says. ""It's very unforgiving. You have tiny margins and can't afford to make mistakes.""According to a report on food franchising by Franchise Business Review, 51.5 percent of food franchises earn profits of less than $50,000 a year; roughly 7 percent top $250,000, with the average profit for all restaurants coming in at $82,033. That doesn't sound too bad, until you factor in the initial investment. Though some basic restaurant concepts cost less than $100,000 to open, many established brands require as much as $500,000 to start. And a full-service restaurant may require an initial investment of $1 million or more.There's no question, however, that a well-operated restaurant can be a cash cow, even with the higher overhead expenses. In 2007, when Dean Clarino bought his first Teriyaki Madness location in Las Vegas, he didn't have any food-service experience. But he was passionate about making the store work.He blanketed the surrounding area with advertising, and each week he invited a local business to come in for a free lunch. His enthusiasm paid off, and he watched customer counts and revenues grow steadily.When he was ready to open a second location in the endcap of a suburban strip mall, he knew that keeping his rent reasonable was key. In fact, he says he walked away from negotiations with the landlord six times before signing a lease on 2,300 square feet of space.After securing the lease, the first thing Clarino did was install signs outside of his restaurant facing in all directions; for 72 days during construction, the lunchtime crowd saw his signs from the windows of other restaurants. When his second Teriyaki Madness opened in 2011, it saw $126,000 in business during its first month. Clarino says he made back his investment in just four months.


Currently, his first location grosses $900,000 per year, and his newer store makes $1.2 million. With 20 percent margins--incredibly high for a restaurant--he estimates profits at $400,000 per year.But Clarino emphasizes that he's not a typical restaurateur. He didn't just follow the franchisor's system; he spent more than advised or required, maxing out his spending on advertising. Doing the minimum required by a franchise system is not the way to make big numbers--he recommends doing as much as possible in the beginning, theorizing that if franchisees are scrimping on advertising or labor in the first year just to keep the doors open, they didn't have enough operating capital to begin with.Clarino also keeps close tabs on labor and food costs on a daily basis, something many other restaurant franchisees look at only occasionally. ""Our [point-of-sale] system gives percentages, and every night I look at lunch, dinner and our labor costs,"" he says. ""Those numbers help you understand the neighborhood, like what happens when the sun is out and weather patterns. I know exactly how much we sell on Tuesdays--it's scary how consistent it is. You know when to advertise, when to have two cashiers scheduled. It makes the restaurant run better and makes the customers happy.""Roll With It: Taking the Wheel of a Mobile FranchiseRobert Croley of Pooch MobileImage courtesy: Pooch MobileDenver's Robert Croley has made the Pooch Mobile Six Figure Club--breaking $100,000 in revenue--for the past three years. With the low overhead of a mobile franchise, he says most of that is profit. Not too bad for washing dogs. Besides sudsing up about 2,000 pups each year, Croley contracts out four nearby territories, taking a percentage of the revenue from each.After 25 years in the corporate world, Croley, who signed on with Pooch Mobile in 2008, saw the appeal in mobile franchising. ""I looked into it, and the startup money for a franchise like this is super cheap, so it made sense for me,"" he says. ""There are hardly any expenses, and the sky's the limit for profits. You can make as much as the market will bear.""Croley is not alone in his thinking. In the past decade, mobile businesses have exploded, with dog washers and groomers, junk collectors, handyman services, furniture technicians, blinds installers and dozens of other concepts coming to the fore.


Business consultant Cunningham says mobile appeals to a certain type of entrepreneur who has no problem running a one-person operation. ""You have to be willing and want to be chief cook and bottle washer,"" he says. ""Yet mobile services are significantly less expensive than other businesses. You don't have to sign a five-year lease on a building. You don't start out with labor costs other than yourself. You may have to buy a vehicle, but you can pay for that over time. You can make a handsome profit running a mobile business, and there's an opportunity for a six-figure income.""There is a flip side. When starting a mobile business, Cunningham says, franchisees need to be outgoing and have a sales and marketing mindset to succeed. ""People who don't prospect for business are going to have a hard time,"" he warns.Croley's experience with Pooch Mobile bears that out. In the beginning, he was washing dogs one day a week. The rest of the time was spent marketing, driving around from parking lot to parking lot to work on his books and make phone calls from his truck, which served as a mobile billboard. At first, his business was 90 percent marketing and 10 percent dog washing. Now, he says, that ratio has flipped.David Messenger, vice president of market expansion for Memphis, Tenn.-based ServiceMaster, a family of brands that includes the Furniture Medic and ServiceMaster Clean mobile franchises, believes marketing, especially in the startup months, is the differentiator between average and high-profit franchisees.""Marketing can be the biggest discouragement,"" he says. ""Franchisees can spend a lot of money for two to three months, not see results and then give up. But it will eventually work. That's one area where franchisors need to help guide franchisees, especially if they don't have a lot of experience in marketing.""High-touch, Higher Profits: The Personal-service SectorAgency-style businesses--­like maid services and home healthcare, where the franchisee acts as a hub for independent contractors--are the hottest sector of franchising right now. Home healthcare in particular is in high demand, mainly because aging Baby Boomers want to stay in their homes as long as possible and are opting for in-home nursing care and assistance rather than moving to assisted-living facilities. But the other reason those franchises are so popular is the profit margin. According to Franchise Business Review, the average profit on senior-care franchises is $98,723 per year.


""The typical investment for senior care is less than $100,000, and most are grossing $1 million or more in a year or two,"" says Elgin of FranChoice. ""They are intensely the most profitable franchises. But you have to do lots of marketing.""That's something Brian Petranick, president and COO of Omaha, Neb.-based Right at Home, says franchisees need to be ready for. Overhead on these businesses is low, but any savings can be whittled away quickly by lack of business.""It's not the hard costs that shock people,"" Petranick says. ""It's the fact that it could take two to three months to find their first client. They need to learn how to be a salesperson. It takes a while. The first three to six months you're introducing yourself to the market, and you have to prove that you can provide quality care. Then the market responds, and business picks up.""The same applies to commercial-cleaning and maid-service companies, which take a lot of time to squeeze their way into a crowded marketplace. Cunningham says the biggest mistake most franchisees make in this area is thinking they will have cash coming in the door from the get-go.""We encourage people to have realistic expectations. Oftentimes, people haven't thought about the amount they'll need to live on while starting their business,"" he says. ""In reality, a business that looks like it will take $50,000 to start might take $80,000 or $100,000. If you're capitalized well, you don't have the stress and worry thinking about overextending yourself, and the result is you'll grow quicker. That's the real key.""Disappearing Acts: Where Profits Go Up in SmokeEven though different franchise categories have different issues when it comes to making money, Elgin believes there are three areas that all franchisees need to pay close attention to in order to thrive. ""To maximize profitability, good operators focus on three areas--labor, rent and cost of goods sold,"" he says. ""It's often the little stuff that eats away your profits. If you save a few points here and there, your profit and loss statement can get stunningly better.""In fact, with many businesses operating with single-digit profit margins, a half percent here or a percent there is often the difference between being in the red and being in the black. The road to profitability begins in the very first stage, Elgin says, and negotiating rent can be a determining factor.""You have to make sure you get the right terms or you're going to live with that mistake for years and years,"" he says. ""The best operators have good real-estate attorneys and drive hard bargains. It's fun to watch--they negotiate deals so much better than other franchisees get.""Elgin says labor is another expense that can eat profit margins if it's not controlled, especially in a food franchise. Like Clarino of Teriyaki Madness, restaurateurs need to constantly make sure their staffing levels are in sync with customer traffic. Without a clear understanding of customer patterns, those numbers can quickly get out of whack. ""In a food business, if labor is budgeted at 35 to 40 percent of your expenses and you're running at 44 percent, you can change from being profitable to not profitable at all very quickly,"" Elgin says.The last area to watch is cost of goods sold. Holding an inventory of products that aren't moving off the shelf or being used is another way to lose profit margin. Restaurants often lose several percentage points to product spoilage and ""shrinkage"" (a euphemism for employee theft).Cunningham notes that part of the burden of profitability falls on the franchisor, too. The amount of training and support franchisees receive can be critical in helping them get up to speed quickly. ""Support and training are paramount,"" he says. ""If you get two or three weeks of training, that's great. If you have a person assigned to you from the franchisor who works day in and day out with you for the first 90 days, that's even better. All those things drive a more successful business. Those collective resources result in higher profitability if the support is there.""

48,"Ronald Coase, Lighthouses and Elon Musk","Sep 3, 2013",Ray Hennessey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/ronald-coase-lighthouses-and-elon-musk/228173,"
Many entrepreneurs may never have heard of Ronald Coase, but his work made it easier for the free markets to triumph over areas traditionally managed by the government, rather than the public sector.Coase, a Nobel laureate and University of Chicago economist, died Sunday at the age of 102. For economics students, he is one of the most cited researchers, namely for two works: The Nature of the Firm, which looked at organizational structure and growth, and The Problem of Social Cost, which took a transactional-cost look at ways to remedy perceived harm done by businesses in areas such as pollution.To the legal profession, he was best known for the Coase Theorem, which looked at how peoples' actions (which he called externalities) could create a cost on others, and how those externalities could be fixed – without groups like the government getting involved.



Related: Taxi Company Weaves Out of LA's Regulatory JamBut, for entrepreneurs, Coase's work with lighthouses is especially important. Most of his work led him to the conclusion that all forms of government regulation are bad. He was not, however, one to simply condemn any effort by the government to set rules. Rather, his argument was more nuanced.


""If someone says there's going to be regulation, I don't say that regulation will be bad,"" Coase told Reason magazine in 1997. ""Let's see. What we discover is that most regulation does produce, or has produced in recent times, a worse result. But I wouldn't like to say that all regulation would have this effect because one can think of circumstances in which it doesn't.""But he was clear that the private sector could always produce a better result because market forces were their own regulator. He rejected the idea that the government could even operate for the ""public good"" better than private business.And that's where lighthouses come in. For decades, economists cited lighthouses as the area where government knew – and operated – best. Lighthouses needed to be built and managed by the state, since too many people benefited from their guidance and few could afford, or even had the inclination, to pay.Hogwash, argued Coase, citing history. (Interestingly, for economics students, Coase was accessible because he didn't burden his research with formulae or very much math at all.) In The Lighthouse in Economics, Coase showed that private lighthouses in Great Britain, owned by individuals and corporations and funded by shipping fees, existed and thrived. The British government indeed became a monopoly for lighthouse operation – but only after it seized the private ones. The government didn't like the competition. It never does.


What do British lighthouses have to do with entrepreneurs and innovators? Look at what is happening in cities like Los Angeles, where new ride-sharing companies are taking on the government-backed and regulated taxicab industry. Look at the increase and new dynamic pricing models for private toll roads.And look at Elon Musk. His SpaceX is a private company that has essentially taken on the private good that was once the monopoly of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. And his idea for the Hyperloop directly competes with the government's control of rail transport in the state of California (though the Hyperloop almost certainly won't be built in that state).Related: When the Axe Swings, Your Worst Employees With OutperformThe private sector faces competition and roadblocks from the state every day. In fact, governments can make the argument that everything they do is a social good. In socialism and communism, states do just that: industry is designed to create jobs and equality, and such goals needs to be imposed on the people. Governments don't run businesses for the financial benefit, but rather for the social good – workers' rights, power to the people, and all that. But, with respect to those who want more government involvement in worker pay or business conduct, these kinds of systems rely on the totalitarian nature of their governments to meet their goals. With economic equality, there is a distinct lack of personal freedom.


Coase recognized this...and preached it. Economic freedom came from allowing private enterprise to correct solutions and fix problems. The government is too inefficient to do so, and it relies on taxation, rather than a drive for profits, to meet its goals.Instead, the world's problems can be solved by private people sketching ideas on the back of a cocktail napkin and finding private capital to transform their thoughts into enterprises. That's the essence of entrepreneurship, and Coase's ideas fostered that drive and philosophy.Related: The Half-Baked Plan for Pot Legalization

49,Conscious Capitalism: The End of Business as Usual?,"Nov 27, 2012",Martin Zwilling,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/conscious-capitalism-the-end-of-business-as-usual/225066,"
Young entrepreneurs are more socially conscious today than ever before, which is a great trend. Unfortunately, some are so focused on this principle that they forget that every business, even nonprofits, must practice the basic principles of capitalism -- that is, build a business model to make money to cover their costs and to do other good things.Examples of profitable companies practicing this model include Trader Joe's, led by Doug Rauch who retired as president and now serves as a trustee for Conscious Capitalism a research and membership organization for socially-minded businesses. Then there's The Container Store, led by Kip Tindell. Both of these are purpose-driven businesses that boast high growth, high loyalty and very low employee turnover.Related: At This Year's Clinton Global Initiative, a New Focus on Young People



Of course a profitable model isn't required if you intend to rely solely on donations, or have deep pockets to fund your socially-conscious efforts yourself. Conscious capitalism is an alternative approach, dedicated to advancing humanity, while using tried and proven business principles.The concept has four pillars:


1. Higher purpose. Business can and should be done with a higher purpose in mind, not just with a view toward maximizing profits. A compelling sense of purpose creates an extraordinary degree of engagement for all stakeholders and catalyzes tremendous organizational energy.2. Stakeholder orientation. To recognize the interdependent nature of life and the human foundations of business, a company needs to create value with and for its various stakeholders (customers, employees, vendors, investors, communities, etc.). Like the life forms in an ecosystem, healthy stakeholders lead to a healthy business system.3. Conscious leadership. Conscious leaders understand and embrace the higher purpose of business and focus on creating value for and harmonizing the human interests of the business stakeholders. They recognize the integral role of culture and purposefully cultivate a conscious culture.4. Conscious culture. This is the ethos -- the values, principles, practices -- underlying the social fabric of a business, which permeates a company's environment and connects the stakeholders to each other and to the purpose, people and processes that comprise the company.


I see conscious capitalism emerging at just the right time for young entrepreneurs who are a bit disillusioned with the image of ""business"" today. They want to be profitable without sacrificing trust, reputation and credibility with their peers and stakeholders. They want their business potential to support the overall human potential as well.Related: Want to Raise Money for Others? Start a BusinessNone of these positives obviate the need for a viable business model, in order to survive. I would expect that to seem intuitive to all entrepreneurs, but every investor I know has many stories about startup funding requests with no clear business model. The most common failures are solutions looking for a problem, lack of a defined market, and giving away the product.Soon, companies that also want legal recognition of their socially conscious focus will be able to incorporate as a Benefit Corporation (B-Corp). The B-Corp status, already available in eleven states, including New York and California, is meant to reduce investor suits, and gives consumers an easy way to spot genuine social commitment, without assuming it is a non-profit.


Entrepreneurs and startups are all about innovation, in business principles as well as in products and services. Perhaps it's time to innovate how you do business too?Related: Social Entrepreneurs Need to Make Money TooHow are you incorporating conscious capitalism into your business?

50,Why Addressing the Racial Wealth Gap is Good for Business,"Jul 6, 2023",Sandra M. Moore,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/why-addressing-the-racial-wealth-gap-is-good-for-business/454639,"
Philanthropy and government programs have been trying to close the racial wealth gap for a long time, but they've been focused on band-aids when we need ladders. While the wealth gap is fueled by several contributing factors, including disparity in home ownership, accumulation of financial assets and strong growing wages, as small business investors, we can draw our attention to a core piece of the problem: the wage gap.Let's take a moment to clarify what we mean when we talk about the wage gap as it relates to the racial wealth gap. We are not just talking about good-paying jobs for people of color. We really need good-paying jobs that provide a clear pathway for Black and Brown employees to build a stronger, sustaining financial future.The typical white U.S. household has nearly eight times the wealth of the typical Black household. To address the systemic issue of racial wealth inequity, the private sector must do what it does best – invest in great companies and entrepreneurs that create quality jobs –and ensure all workers, especially Black and Brown workers, have an equal opportunity to build a lasting, positive economic reality for themselves and their families.



Related: Compounding Inequality to Compounding Success: Bridging the Racial Wealth GapMedia reported widely that recent pandemic aid cut U.S. poverty to a new low, but that was a short-term solution to a global crisis — it wasn't aimed at driving wages higher in perpetuity. As that funding source dries up, those in a lower economic bracket return to the same or even worse circumstances than they were at the start. To truly attack the racial wealth gap, we need the private sector to make the change that the government and non-profits simply cannot do independently.


Private sector employers and investors often can't see how they can drive the change needed to give Black and Brown Americans access to wealth-creation opportunities while growing businesses and pleasing investment partners. But it is not as hard as they may think, and the benefits to their business and community deliver a long-lasting ROI for companies, workers and families.Building a path to financial security starts with strategic wagesFor decades, wages for Black and Brown workers have lagged behind those of white workers with the same experience and education, even in the same geography Even when people of color climb the corporate ladder, they make less — 97 cents on the dollar.These communities need more than just a living wage; they also need opportunities for long-term career development, pay parity and wage progression. A rising wage promotes economic stability, helps workers provide for their families and facilitates wealth accumulation for future generations.Wage progression — whether linked to individual performance, company performance, tenure, skills development, or promotion — is also good for business. It helps attract the best employees, improves retention, and sustains and incentivizes business growth.


Related: How to Support Black Employees During (and After) Juneteenth The role of benefits in building generational wealthMeaningful benefits are a major piece of increasing sustainable employee wealth. Most employee wealth is derived from workplace benefits packages: health insurance, 401ks, stock options, etc. Low-wage workers typically don't have those options, which are key to building generational wealth.Business leaders and investors can change this situation by learning from employees what benefits and opportunities would make the greatest difference in their lives and free up income for saving and investing– be that affordable healthcare, child/eldercare support, or direct wealth creation through incentivized savings opportunities like 401k plans, IRAs, and employer matching savings programs.Offering these types of household-stabilizing benefits could largely pay for themselves in terms of lower absenteeism, greater productivity, increased retention and worker-driven competitive advantage.


Help employees continually grow their skillsToo often, the leadership potential and training of Black and Brown Americans is overlooked. According to McKinsey, Black workers are disproportionately concentrated in entry-level jobs with low pay and underrepresented in leadership and executive positions.Correcting this divide means providing entry-level workers with access to training and development opportunities from the moment they are hired. Programs that teach employees valuable skills for remaining relevant in their careers to prepare them for higher responsibilities while reducing turnover, improving engagement and accelerating business growth.Making it happenInvestors typically provide small businesses with growth capital, but they can also provide operational capital that is invested directly in employees. Business leaders, their investors and advisors can collaborate to devise a feasible and ambitious plan that establishes measurable goals for the company and the impact company leaders aim to achieve by driving an innovative wage strategy.Several local or national advocacy groups for diverse workplaces, such as the Business Consortium Fund, the National Institute of Minority Economic Development and the Minority Business Development Agency, can assist with this kind of wage-targeted approach to eliminating the racial wealth gap.


Furthermore, it is crucial to monitor and evaluate outcomes using meaningful metrics. Failing to measure outcomes from these changes means businesses will not know what they've really achieved, which keeps them from continuous improvement.Related: How to Overcome Workplace Inequality and Reach Gender ParityOpportunity and obligationI believe that every employer and their investors have a moral imperative to make closing the racial wealth gap a focal point of their business model, even if it means taking a little less for themselves and other executives off the bottom line. There is a tremendous opportunity to hire workers from disadvantaged communities and grow and sustain a strong workforce that helps grow all businesses. In return, employees would benefit from quality jobs and greater economic vitality now and in the future, setting up the next generation for even greater progress.It's about doing something incredible and making work ""work"" for businesses and employees alike. This type of investment is the catalyst for the change we need in our business world and our society —but it can't happen without the private sector and its leaders driving the charge.

51,How to Balance Entrepreneurship and Parenthood Without Losing Your Cool,"Jul 5, 2023",Terry Rice,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-balance-entrepreneurship-and-parenthood-without/455327,"
Like many parents, I thought things would get ""back to normal"" after the pandemic. My kids would start attending school in-person and I'd finally be able to get my work done during the day without any interruptions.I was wrong.Sure, my kids are back in school. But they're still home quite often due to breaks and other unexpected reasons. Beyond that, I often cut the workday short to attend their events or take them to various appointments. Is this all part of the job? Absolutely. Is it still frustrating at times? Yep! And, it creates an interesting paradox.



I work so I can give my kids the resources and opportunities they need. But they often interrupt my work, and it's usually to tell me something about the resources and opportunities they need.So if you're also balancing the world of entrepreneurship and parenthood, the latest episode of the Launch Your Business podcast is for you. We're joined by parenting expert and licensed educational psychologist Reena B Patel. Get ready to take some notes as she shares the secret to getting your work done while still giving your kids the attention and support they deserve.


You can check out some of my key takeaways below.Work-life balance is a mythReena started our time together with some myth-busting. Although many of us get into entrepreneurship for flexibility, many of us expect to find some kind of perfect equilibrium between our work life and our real life/family time.But perfection doesn't exist – you might get one day a year that feels like the exact right balance of each. ""There is going to be a give-and-take,"" Reena said. ""There are going to be days where you're going to have to put in more hours at work because you might have a deadline, and there are gonna be days where your children really do need you.""But Reena also says that the give-and-take can actually be good for our kids:""I think that fluidity and flexibility is the one life skill, if we can give to our kids (but also teach ourselves) is really important.""Having a schedule is your friendWhile committing to being flexible is important, Reena said it's also critical to maintain a schedule and a routine. This can look like getting dressed for work after you make the kids breakfast, or setting your preferred work hours and looping in your partner.You can still arrange this schedule around your kids (Reena said she made sure she took her lunch break at the same time her kids did during the pandemic), but the main point is that there is a schedule and shared expectations of what your time looks like.""I think that's really important to establish an environment, a workspace that's conducive for you to be productive,"" Reena said. ""The last thing we wanna do is finish the day and feel like we got nothing accomplished.""


When your child is your coworker, use novelty to keep them busyThe younger the kid, the harder this is – but Reena said that one key to keeping your child entertained is bringing novelty to your child's time at home (or in your office/workspace). Give them a designated place for them to play, and cycle through different kinds of toys/puzzles/games.""You don't want all the toys out at all times,"" Reena said. ""You wanna rotate them because that keeps that novelty and excitement there. Put the things that they haven't engaged with in a long time in that bin. And so there's that excitement, there's that newness.""Some other ways this could work: Bring in books they haven't read from the library, add some new toys or crafts to the mix from the dollar store, and reserve ""headphones on"" activities for when you really need to work uninterrupted – like when you're hopping on a Zoom call.


Bonus: Be annoyingHere's one of my favorite tips from Reena, teaching your child empathy. Of course, this is an important trait to instill, but Reena provided a unique way of doing so.Start by having your kids engage in an activity they enjoy. Let's say it's coloring for example. Then, continually interrupt them while they're engaging in that activity. Get obnoxious with it to the point where they get frustrated.Once that happens, say something along the lines of ""You don't like being interrupted when you're doing this, and I don't like being interrupted while I'm working, so let's find a way to give each other space when we need it.""In the best-case scenario, your kids learn how to keep themselves occupied when you absolutely must focus on your work. Worst case scenario, at least you'll have some fun messing with them!

52,3 Essential Tactics You Need Do to Help Your Company Sell,"Jul 5, 2023",Peter Daisyme,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/3-critical-strategies-to-help-your-company-sell/454634,"
When you're getting a new business off the ground, selling it is likely the last thing you're thinking about.However, the truth is that it's much easier (and much less costly) to develop your exit plan from the start than it is to restructure your company to sell. For business owners, the best course of action is to grow a sellable company right from the beginning.Not sure how to develop a sellable business? Here are some tips to get you started.Related: 3 Reasons You Should Sell Your BusinessHow do you improve sellability while building a business?Making your business sellable doesn't only benefit you when it comes time to make a sale. The businesses that command the highest sale prices are also the most profitable, so when you're building a sellable business, you're also setting yourself up for success as a business owner.



One of the keys to building a sellable business is making early investments to improve scalability over time. You can do that by focusing on the following:Implementing high-quality, efficient technology systemsHiring executive leadersHaving financials regularly reviewed and auditedBuilding human capital functionThese might sound like obvious investments to make to some. Still, many founders do not want to make the necessary investments in infrastructure to be able to scale the business, instead viewing it as 'overhead.'Investing in infrastructure from the outset may involve a substantial cash outlay, but it will dramatically increase your business's value when it comes time to sell. Align Business Advisory, a leading M&A advisory for small and mid-size businesses, also points out that a third-party advisor can greatly help businesses to figure out ways to improve their overall scalability with services like business valuation and exit planning.If your company has quality infrastructure that can be built upon, potential buyers are looking at a turnkey sale. You'll be poised to make significantly more from the sale in this situation. If a buyer sees that they will need to restructure the company for scalability after they purchase it, they'll pay much less.


Related: Top 5 Mistakes Entrepreneurs Make When Scaling Their Business To 7 FiguresHow do you help your company sell for a higher multiple?Even if your company has already been in business for years, there are still several things you can look at to optimize total value. If you want to make sure you'll make as much as you can from the sale of your company, start with these steps.1. Enhance operational efficiencyMany smaller business owners are owner-operators; their presence is essential for business success. However, when it comes to making a sale, this situation can dramatically decrease what a buyer is willing to pay.Why? If the buyer purchases a business like this, they're taking on considerable risk. Once you leave the business, there's a possibility that daily operations will suffer or key customers will leave.


If you can demonstrate that your business functions well without your involvement, buyers will see a purchase as much less risky, so they'll likely pay more when the time comes to sell.Related: Selling Your Business? Do These 6 Things Right Now.2. Optimize gross margin and EBITDANot all revenue dollars are created equal. For instance, If a company must spend $99 to make $100, then that $1 of profit is not as valuable. So, regarding profitability, the cash in your business's bank account isn't the only thing that matters.To ensure your profit margins are high enough to draw in quality buyers, you'll want to look at your EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation Amortization) margin profile.


Your EBITDA margin indicates your operating profit as a percentage of your total revenue. In most cases, buyers want an EBITDA margin of at least 10%. Many buyers view businesses with lower margins as too risky.3. Diversify your customer baseHaving one or two customers who routinely spend large amounts at your business can give you a sense of security. But buyers want to see diversified revenue. If most of your revenue comes from a few customers and those customers stop patronizing your company, your finances will suffer.In most cases, buyers look askance at any business where a single customer accounts for over 20% of the revenue. They may still purchase your business but are likely to pay substantially less.If you currently rely primarily on a few customers for steady income, make an effort to diversify income sources. That could mean offering additional products or services or using targeted advertising to draw in different demographics.

However, it is vital that entrepreneurs prioritize sellability from the start of their business journey.The tips above provide ways to help maximize your business's total value and attract quality buyers. By proactively working toward sellability, you are not only positioning yourself for a successful sale, but also setting yourself up for long-term business success and profitability.

54,Why It's Unwise to 'Fake It 'Til You Make It' in the Startup World — and What to Do Instead,"Jun 29, 2023",Collin Williams,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-startups-must-drop-the-fake-it-til-you-make-it/453746,"
The recent imprisonment of Elizabeth Holmes got me thinking more deeply about the old Silicon Valley adage, ""Fake it 'til you make it."" This saying has long been the mantra of startups not only in Silicon Valley but throughout the country. I've been involved in the startup community for the better part of 8 years now. I worked at a startup that believed faking it was a legitimate business strategy. Its founders are now staring at substantial prison time tied to a multitude of fraud convictions. I've also worked at two startups (my current one included) where the focus was grit, effort and hard work always backstopped by integrity. You don't tell people you can do something you can't do simply to benefit your own self-interest.The fact is ratifying ""fake it 'til you make it"" is nothing more than creating an excuse about your own personal or professional failures. Does that mean you can't push limits? Or test the abilities of your team? Does it mean you can't seek to achieve goals that seem unattainable? Or to publicly aspire to accomplish those goals? Absolutely not. Startups are typically only successful when they are backed by seemingly impossible dreams. But there are ethical ways to get there. Let me explain.Let's say your startup idea is to create a two-sided marketplace for art. On one side, you have buyers who are interested in art from particular artists, and on the other side, you have sellers who have access to legitimate pieces of art from those artists. Your goal is to programmatically match buyers and sellers and to use technology to validate and authenticate the art. In your mind, this will all eventually be done without human intervention, but it will take months (or maybe years) to make that happen technologically. So, now let's break this down into two models: (a) a model based on ""fake it 'til you make it""; and (b) a model based on grit, hard work and creative but ethical solutions.



Related: Here's Why You Should Not ""Fake It Till You Make It""""Fake it 'til you make it"" modelLet's start with the ""fake it 'til you make it model."" You put out a pitch deck and marketing materials that tout proprietary matching algorithms that will connect the right buyers to the right sellers and an AI-based software that will detect fraudulent or forged works of art. Without question, these are how you envision the future state of your business. Moreover, your website states that you've completed thousands of successfully matched art transactions. What does it matter if it's not true? It's not hurting anyone.


Now the truth is it's still your dream to create proprietary matching algorithms and AI-based fraud detection, but what you currently have is a simple database of sellers and buyers of art with a basic taxonomy that allows you to classify the works. You also employ a few art experts who can review the listings for any clear or apparent fraud. Since you started the site, you've matched around 100 buyers and sellers who all seem generally pleased with the experience and what they've received. Seems simple. Unfortunately, the fact is, you have completely misrepresented your product, your transaction history, and fundamentally, what your company does to provide value.It may seem harmless because your users are satisfied, but what if an angel or VC firm is so interested in your pitch that they want to invest seven figures into your business? You're a startup. You need money. Depending on the angel or VC, it may also provide significant clout or publicity to your business. So, now you're stuck between Scylla and Charybdis. Do you perpetuate false information and financially insulate and benefit your business? Or do you turn down the money and attempt to rectify the untruths which may severely impact your business's ability to survive? Neither is a good option. The fact is, because you touted the potential future state of your business instead of its current reality, you've engaged in ""fake it 'til you make it"" and, depending on the outcome, committed fraud.Related: The Truth About 'Fake It 'Til You Make It'Reality-based modelNow, how could this have been done ethically, while still generating interest and buzz in your business? It's simple. In your marketing materials, you could state your value proposition as a technology company/marketplace that helps buyers find sellers, sellers find buyers and ensures that each party is comfortable with the legitimacy of the pieces of art. Your goal can still be the creation of algorithms that help match buyers and sellers as well as an AI-based fraud detection software, but that isn't what you are currently selling.


In order to make sure users have a good experience, you can have team members in the background manually poring over the listings to find the best matches and those same art experts perusing the lists for forgery and fraud. The truth is, the users will be happy as long as they have a good buying or selling experience, get what they want and feel as though the platform provides transactional transparency and certainty.Publicly, your marketing materials can tout that you've successfully matched ""numerous"" buyers and sellers and even use quotes and endorsements from those satisfied customers. Angels and VCs will see traction and may very well decide to invest in your vision without believing it to be the current reality. Most importantly, you haven't committed fraud or compromised yourself ethically simply to boost your ego. You've simply used grit and ingenuity to provide a good experience without relinquishing a much grander vision for the future.We've now seen the result of the ""fake it 'til you make it"" culture — Sam Bankman-Fried, Elizabeth Holmes, Charlie Javice, etc. Right now, we're operating in a legal climate where the traditional startup mantra is having real and serious repercussions. But that doesn't mean it won't change in the future. More importantly, it doesn't mean the temptation won't be there for the next generation of entrepreneurs and startups. It's hard to be patient. It's hard to grind. But it's also the only real path to success. Speed kills is another old adage that has existed for generations. Perhaps that should be the new mantra for startups.Related: The 5 Worst Tips I Received When Starting My Business

55,7 Steps You Must Take When Inventing a New Product,"Jun 28, 2023",Cyrus Claffey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/7-steps-to-take-when-inventing-a-new-product/453649,"
Curiosity and innovation are the two most prominent characteristics of inventors and change-makers. A craving to understand the mechanics of a problem — and to find the solution to that problem — drives curiosity to take action.But once you've made it to the action phase of an invention, what's next? How do you make your ideas work in the real world? In this post, I break down the seven steps it takes to bring an invention from idea to product.Creativity, imagination, innovation and entrepreneurship are understood as a cycle of invention. Because people are as unique as their ideas, the cycle might look different for everyone while still following the basic tenants.



Once the end of this cycle is reached, some innovators might feel lost about how to proceed.Related: 5 Steps for Turning Your Invention Idea Into a Product


1. Understand your ideaYou may be thinking, ""It's my idea, of course I understand it."" But knowing what you're making isn't the same as understanding it.Here are some questions you can ask yourself to see if you truly understand your product:What is its most basic use?Who needs this product?What specific problems does it solve?How does it work?How do I describe this product to others?If you can explain your product idea to someone outside of your industry, then you truly understand it. Knowing this explanation will guide you through the subsequent stages of production!


2. Conduct market researchKnowing your target market is half the battle when creating something new because it helps you narrow down features and desired outcomes. One way to conduct market research is by searching relevant spaces on the internet and social media platforms.Consider the following questions:Who are my target customers? Are they primarily millennials and Gen Zers or more experienced consumers?What fields do most of my consumers work in?Why should my target audience purchase and use my product?How are my competitors appealing to our target market?Moreover, understanding your competitors may also give you an edge by giving you ideas of how to fill the gap of what they don't offer in their products.3. Create a modelBy creating a model, you take an abstract creation and make it tangible. This empowers you to see the idea outside of your mind. Then, you can make corrections, improvements and tweaks.


Digital sketches and wireframes are incredibly easy to make nowadays and give great visual depth. However, everyone's creative process looks different. So, you have to do what sparks your imagination.Once you've created your model, you can then have your prototype created. This will help you in the coming steps.4. Test your productNow that you have a prototype of your product, it's time to test it! This can be an exhilarating yet anxiety-ridden step, so take it slowly.While everyone wants their prototype to work on the first try, it's neither a realistic nor practical outcome. Without failed models and setbacks, it's harder to see what needs improvement and what is perfect as-is.


Try to take this time to be both proud of and critical of your design. Take extensive notes, ask for feedback from trusted colleagues, and then put your changes into action.Related: How to Conduct Effective Prototype Testing — Essential Tips and Best Practices for Maximum Impact5. PersevereThe prototyping phase can be stressful and test the resolve of many inventors. That's why perseverance is a crucial step in the product invention process.Take breaks when you need to, but remind yourself why you started in the first place. This is where having your understanding of the idea can come in handy because it can help motivate you to continue trying.


Remember, you're not creating something for the sake of it, you're creating a solution to a problem.6. Gain fundsUnless you have a lot of capital on hand, funding the production of your idea won't be quick and easy. It's best to begin your funding campaign ahead of schedule in case it takes longer than expected.So, how do you collect enough funding to take your invention from prototype to production?You can:


Apply for an invention or business loanSet up a crowdfunding campaignFind a company that finances inventorsFind a venture capitalist to fund your invention7. Hire a manufacturerOnce you've reached the end of your process, you should find a manufacturer to mass-produce your creation.Some things to consider before signing an agreement include:Location of the facility: Is the facility domestic or international? This matters greatly for legal and financial reasons. Plus, the closer it is, the sooner you can get your product.Expenses: Ask for a breakdown of expenses and extra costs. These might include shipping, equipment fees and more.Quality: Imagine putting a bunch of money into manufacturing just to find out there are no quality assurance experts on-site. This is a valid concern and greatly affects the sale of your products. Make sure quality assurance is part of their offer to you.Order amount: Before negotiating with a manufacturer, know how many products you want for your first order. Some companies have a minimum order policy that you'll need to make sure is compatible with your needs.Related: How to Take Your Product From Idea to RealityAt the end of the day, product development is a trial-and-error process. Furthermore, having a close-knit group of colleagues to help makes all the difference. One person can do a lot, but many trusted people can do more.


Moreover, entrepreneurship and invention takes a certain level of perseverance, intuition and bravery. If you have all those things, then following your invention through to fruition will be more than possible.

56,How to Turn an Upset Customer Into Your Company's Best Advocate,"Jun 28, 2023",Micah Solomon,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-deal-with-an-upset-or-angry-customer/453874,"
Here's the bad news: an angry customer is breathing down your neck or tearing you up over the phone, shooting daggers at you via e-mail. Worst case, they're threatening you with the words every business owner dreads, ""I'll never use you again, and I'm telling everyone I know not to use you as well.""So, is there any good news as well about this scenario? Surprisingly, there is! The heavily tested psychological principle called the ""service recovery paradox"" has demonstrated that a customer who is initially unhappy, whom you later make things right for, is more likely to become a lifetime loyalist and advocate before your company.That's right: one of those desirable customers who not only do business with you but are interested in telling all their friends about you in a good way!



Why would this be? Well, now the customer knows that you're more than a fair-weather friend, and they can count on you even when things have gone sideways. The two of you have now gone through a shared, challenging experience together: you've got your hearts pumping simultaneously, and you're both feeling the relief of getting to the other side.Related: Why Customer Service Is Your Get Out Of Jail Free Card For Business Success


How do you successfully satisfy an unhappy customer?Now that you know the potential upside of turning around a customer, here are the four elements involved in service recovery success.Start selecting future employees based on personality strengths that make them well-suited to this work (to the extent this is possible, considering your organizational constraints).Regardless of the psychological makeup of your existing employees, begin to offer customer service training in ""situational empathy,"" the ability to put oneself in another person's (in this case, a customer's) shoes.Adopt and embrace a service recovery framework. Decide on, train on and rehearse a specific service recovery framework. Which particular framework you choose (a few are circulating out there, some of them company specific) isn't as important as your commitment to adopt it companywide, train on it and rehearse it before the next upset customer comes into view with all the negative energy that that situation can engender.If you don't already have a service recovery framework, let me offer you mine.The service recovery framework I recommend to my clients is called ""the MAMA method,"" and it's my own, although it owes a lot to the pioneering work of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company in service recovery.Related: Stellar Customer Service Starts with the Hiring Process


The MAMA Method of service recoveryMake time to listen.Acknowledge and, if appropriate, apologize.(have a) Meeting of Minds.Act! And follow up.Here it is in more detail:M: Make time to listenImmediately stop whatever you're doing.Don't interrupt the customer with questions or explanations.Only then, strive to learn more about the situation by probing for what the customer is specifically upset about.A: Acknowledge and, if appropriate, apologize. Acknowledge the situation and, if you sense the customer feels it is called for, apologize sincerely. (Note: Every customer is different! Not all customers want an apology, and some are made uncomfortable by one. This is something you'll learn to sense as you practice.)M: (have a) Meeting of minds. This is the step where you strive to marry what the customer wants and what you realistically can accomplish for them, considering your organizational constraints and realities.


A: Act! And follow up. Get busy taking care of the issue as promised in the prior ""Meeting of Minds"" stage. If you end up delegating any part of the service resolution, follow up with those you've handed it off to ensure it was handled appropriately and completely. For organizational growth, also document what went wrong so that patterns of failure and their causes can be addressed systemically later.An important alert and disclaimer: This service recovery sequence and approach are not intended to guide you if you're confronted by an individual who is armed or threatening violence. Handling that situation is a different discipline, typically called ""de-escalation training""; it is not what I'm covering here and is not within my professional expertise.Why have I chosen ""MAMA"" as a name and mnemonic? The overarching idea of the MAMA method is that you should treat unhappy customers as a caring mother — or father! — would treat a child with a trivial injury rather than how a ""just the facts, ma'am"" litigator might.A caring parent would acknowledge the child's feelings rather than try to minimize them; this, as parents know, is the fastest route to getting their kid to dry their tears and go back out to play. If, in contrast, they dismiss the child's feelings, the crying will escalate, as the child needs to prove to the parent that they're injured.


With customers, you're not here to prove that they haven't been injured or are wrong. Rather, you're here to comfort and listen to them tell their story without interruption. Being sure that you do that, you will hear your customer open up and tell you what they are looking for as a resolution, thus giving you a chance to modify that in light of what can be realistically accomplished considering your organizational resources and realities.

58,4 Crucial Ways to Revamp Your Remote Sales,"Jun 27, 2023",Joel Yi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/unlocking-the-4-cs-of-breakthrough-remote-success/454131,"
Remote work is the future in today's digital age, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that this includes sales teams. Traditional sales techniques, which were once conducted in high-rises or at business meals, have shifted to virtual platforms, creating new opportunities and challenges.Certain factors are game-changers during the transition to creating a remote sales team. Incorporating the 4Cs — Contrarian Compensation, Captivating Recruiting Flywheel, Consistent Coaching, and Compounding Culture — is one such crucial formula.Related: How to Make Remote Sales Work for You



1. Contrarian compensation: Igniting high performanceCompensation in a sales environment is typically straightforward, consisting of a base salary and commission. But what if we adopted an unconventional, counterintuitive approach to compensation plans that could spark greater performance?Consider sliding scales, additional milestone compensation and non-monetary incentives such as travel vouchers or extra vacation days. This not only encourages team members to achieve and exceed their sales quotas but also fosters an innovative, creative environment. If we want our sales teams to be innovative in how they sell, shouldn't we also be innovative in how we compensate them?


When employees see that their extra effort is rewarded with tangible benefits, it stimulates their competitive spirit and fosters a culture of high performance. Moreover, public recognition of their contributions can result in even greater morale and job satisfaction, thereby reducing employee turnover.According to a 2019 Gallup poll, 65% of employees would switch to a position that enables them to work remotely part-time. This indicates that innovative and flexible compensation programs, which may include work-from-home options, can be a significant motivator for your sales team.Related: 5 Tips for Building a Remote Sales Team2. Captivating recruiting flywheel: Continually attracting top talentA common misconception is that once you've filled all your open positions, you can pause recruiting. In reality, recruiting should be a continuous process. A successful sales team evolves, which requires an ongoing effort to attract and retain top talent. This concept forms the basis of the Captivating Recruiting Flywheel.


Embrace the idea of ""topgrading"" — always look for talent that can replace the bottom 10% of your sales team. This is not to instigate a culture of fear but rather to cultivate a mindset of growth, learning, and continuous improvement. By constantly recruiting, you're sending a message to your sales team that complacency won't cut it; that being good is not enough when you could be significant.To create a truly captivating recruiting flywheel, it's also essential to portray an authentic image of your company's culture, values, and vision to prospective employees. Share the success stories of your top performers, give a glimpse of your unique sales strategies, and showcase the dynamic nature of your team.By continuously improving the quality of your sales team, you create a self-perpetuating cycle of success and improvement.3. Consistent coaching: Maintaining peak performanceEven though he is a basketball superstar, LeBron James practices every day. He adheres to a rigorous training regimen because he recognizes the significance of continuous advancement. Similarly, sales professionals require consistent coaching to remain competitive.


However, consistent coaching in a remote setting requires a distinct approach. Creating a high-performing remote sales team requires virtual training programs, role-playing sales scenarios, one-on-one mentoring, regular feedback sessions, and a culture of continuous learning.Remember that coaching is about more than just developing sales skills; it is also about personal growth. Encouraging your team members to cultivate their skills outside of work can result in enhanced work performance. Improving their communication skills, emotional intelligence, or time management skills, for instance, can substantially impact their sales performance.Continuous training's significance cannot be exaggerated. According to LinkedIn's 2020 Workplace Learning Report, a staggering 94% of employees stated that they would remain with a company longer if it invested in their learning and development. Therefore, frequent coaching is a requirement if you wish to retain your top-performing sales talent.Related: Will Company Culture Suffer From the Rise of Remote Work?


4. Compounding culture: Driving sustainable growthA company's culture is the lifeblood of its operations, and it's even more crucial in a remote team. A robust and vibrant culture can make the difference between a group of disconnected individuals and a cohesive, high-performing team.Culture isn't something that happens overnight, and it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. It's built over time, with careful thought and attention. It's about creating a shared set of values, practices, and behaviors that unite your team, no matter where they are. It's about cultivating a sense of belonging, a shared mission, and mutual respect among team members.Creating a compounding culture means developing a positive feedback loop where good practices, behaviors, and attitudes are consistently reinforced and rewarded, leading to better performance over time. This could include acknowledging good work, celebrating wins together, and creating opportunities for team bonding.Consider virtual team-building activities or creating an online forum where team members can share non-work-related content and discussions. Encourage transparency and open communication. Implement peer recognition programs or regular shout-outs during team meetings.


With a strong, positive culture, your sales team will be more committed and motivated and become brand ambassadors, attracting even more talented individuals to your team.ConclusionCreating a successful remote sales team requires more than mastering virtual communication tools and recruiting self-motivated people. It requires a deliberate and strategic approach incorporating the four Cs: Contrarian Compensation, Captivating Recruiting Flywheel, Consistent Coaching and Compounding Culture.As you transition your sales force to a remote environment, remember the importance of fostering a culture of growth and learning. It involves changing how you recruit, coach and compensate your team. Doing so allows you to create a remote sales team that survives in the digital age and thrives.In the end, what matters is not just being the greatest in the world but also being the best for the world.

59,5 Little Business Practices I Started Doing to Generate Over $1 Million in Revenue,"Jun 27, 2023",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-little-things-that-make-a-big-impact-on-your-business/452546,"
As the mother of five kids, I spend a lot of time — a lot! — talking about lessons learned and how to apply them to better our lives and ourselves. It's the same with my business as it is with my family: What hard-won lessons I've learned can I pass on to other solo entrepreneurs to try to make their own paths forward a little easier?With so many entrepreneurs venturing out on their own these days (and yet with about 50% of them failing in the first handful of years), business owners and leaders need to take full advantage of highly strategic steps they can take to increase their chances of beating the odds.Top 5 MVPs (most valuable processes) to promote business growthI recently wrote about the five biggest mistakes I made in successful business ownership. Still, now it's time for the flip side of that: the five most positive and profitable lessons I learned along the way to ensure growth instead of stagnation. I call these lessons my ""MVPs"" (most valuable processes) because they're all actionable steps that any-size business can embrace and implement from the very outset of their enterprise. Each is ""little"" in terms of cost outlay, yet they all yield maximal ROI in terms of the smart and savvy application of immediately available resources.



MVP #1: Network, network, network!This was, by far, the most influential skill I possessed when it came to growing my business. I didn't start off understanding P/L statements, balance sheets, and tax codes, but I knew how to talk to and connect with people. To make them feel heard. To make them feel like they matter.This translates to virtually any industry: Start by creating a circle of contacts around you (strength matters more than size here), then watch it feed off itself and auto-expand as people tell other people about your service and your expertise. It's people who create business, not the other way around. So pick up the phone. Attend events. Join professional associations. Seek out a mentor. When you arm yourself with an aptitude for networking, half the battle is won.


Related: Effective Networking Requires Mastering These 5 SkillsMVP #2: Have an inspired idea and a clear vision.If you don't wake up every morning bubbling with exuberance about your foundational idea — what you're contributing to your market — why should anyone else get excited about it? Be original and inventive. Narrow your focus. Clarify your vision. Craft a service menu or product line that speaks for itself.Do people read mission statements on websites anymore? Maybe not. But write one anyway — more for yourself, to serve as your North Star. Get really clear on what makes your business exceptional and what makes it the right choice. Only when you've locked down your intention and are motivated by it daily will you be able to communicate it to others effectually. When they can see your vision, they can help you materialize it.MVP #3: Find the right people with the right skills.People are everywhere. Skills are everywhere. But zeroing in on the right people with the right skills at the right time? That's the difference between having a talented staff and having the precise kind of talent that will best serve your clientele by achieving their definitive goals.


Don't underestimate the passion factor here, either. When you find employees or contractors who are passionate about what you do, they're open to you teaching them the art of your profession. As their proficiencies grow, so too will your business. It's a constant give-and-take between leading your people effectively to fulfill company objectives while allowing them to shine in their own areas of mastery.As in your relationship, don't settle. Hold out for as long as you can for just the right person for the role you have to fill. In the end, it'll save you tons of disappointment and aggravation.Related: 6 Steps for Hiring the Right People to Build Effective TeamsMVP #4: Focus on the goal, not the process.We've all heard of not seeing the forest for the trees, of getting lost in the details. The weeds will always be there, just waiting to trip you up, so one of the greatest gifts you can give yourself is the daily reminder to concentrate on the big picture — that vision you mapped out as your business' guiding star.


When it's your own business, you are in complete control of your final destination. You are the captain of your own ship. There are likely myriad and sometimes uncertain routes to get there, but if you keep your gaze intently fixed on the horizon you've marked as your end goal, which sea lanes you're in as you travel, there are rather insignificant. Pick the right product you excel in and pick the right people to bring it to market, and you'll stay on point.MVP #5: Clearly outline your scope of work.Perhaps nothing will save you more time and energy than specifying exactly what you're expected to do and deliver to your clients — in writing. The business contract is the least fun, but it's vital nonetheless.If you can afford to consult a contract lawyer on the appropriate verbiage and terms, it's worth it. If not, compose your own streamlined, transparent document template in plain English that you can tweak appropriately for each client. Either way, you need to protect both you and your client by ensuring rights on both sides; on your side, the point is not to allow a project's parameters to slowly balloon to the point of bursting and ensuring you get paid for your work.Make no mistake: Scope creep is only too real. And it'll eventually burn you. Stay away from the fire by enacting a contract to keep you and your staff on task, on time and on budget.


Networking. Clarifying your vision. Assembling the right team. Staying committed to your prime objective. Avoiding scope creep. Not one of them costs a thing, and yet each of them is an invaluable asset that will fill the treasure chest of your business … Next to you, of course. Never forget that you're the real treasure of your own solo entrepreneurship!

60,My Kids Got Me the Best Father's Day Present Ever. Here's How.,"Jun 27, 2023",Terry Rice,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/my-kids-got-me-the-best-fathers-day-present-ever-heres/454830,"
I have four kids, but for some reason I still associate Father's day as a holiday to celebrate my dad, not me.But my kids always get excited about it. Sometimes a bit too excited, to the point where they spoil the surprise by revealing what they got for me weeks in advance.For some reason, this year was different. I almost forgot it was Father's Day until I walked into my kitchen to see my kids impatiently waiting for me to open my gifts. I mentally prepared myself to be extremely happy to receive whatever gifts they bought or made for me.



And don't get me wrong, I do appreciate the gifts, it is the thought that counts. But sometimes I have to get creative when expressing how happy I am about them giving me a piece of construction paper with random stuff glued to it.But again, this year was different. I didn't have to fake anything, I was truly impressed and appreciative of the gift they gave me: Beef jerky.By now you might be thinking that jerky is hardly a step up from the abstract construction paper art thing, so I'll explain.This wasn't just beef jerky, it was a beef jerky flower bouquet from the Manly Man Company. Related: 5 Reasons Why You Should Give Gifts to Employees Any Time of YearDubbed by Food Network as the ""manliest, meatiest, bouquet ever!"" I'd have to agree and also add that it's the ""most useful, thoughtful, Father's Day present ever!""I was so impressed that I reached out to one of the co-founders, Jacquie Coca Murray, so I could discover the origin of the company she founded with her husband, Greg Murray.I'll share their story, and three reasons why this was such an amazing gift. And if you follow along, you'll discover a few ways to make your product or service stand out in a crowded industry as well.


It was usefulI eat rather light throughout the day. Outside of a Huel meal shake, Sports Research MCT oil and cashews, the only other thing I eat is beef jerky. This routine keeps me fueled up so I can get my work done without slowing me down by eating heavier meals.My kids got me a month's worth of beef jerky and I'll feel grateful every time I take a bite throughout the day.You can take a lesson from this experience as well. Instead of getting all fancy with your offer, focus on products and services that have a specific use case and will have a meaningful impact.It was uniqueHonestly I don't even want to eat the beef jerky flower bouquet. It just looks so cool and people keep asking about it when they see it during Zoom calls. And I like it because it's not just unique for the sake of being unique.


Jacquie provides more detail on the idea that sparked the formation of their company.""The concept of offering gifts that are both memorable and useful originated from our aspiration to provide a unique gifting experience. Recognizing the widespread consumption of beef jerky as an everyday product, we saw an opportunity to transform it into an extraordinary and sentimental gift for men. ""What does this mean to you? Even if you offer a product in a competitive market, you can differentiate yourself simply by delivering a unique customer experience.It was thoughtfulThe bouquet is awesome, but my favorite part of the gift box is the personalized Meathearts.

61,3 Proven Methods of Boosting Franchise Operation Sales,"Jun 16, 2023",Dan Rowe,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/3-key-methods-of-boosting-franchise-operation-sales/452926,"
The old saying goes, ""Sales cures all,"" and that may be right, but how exactly does a savvy businessperson intending to grow a franchise go about boosting their sales numbers?My inbox and social feeds are filled with ""helpful"" pitches by marketing professionals — digital marketing, PR companies, lead generators, funnels, text marketing... the list seems endless. It's vital, in considering all these come-ons, that you not confuse efforts and results.Think, for example, about how improvements in operations can compound sales growth. I call it the ""10/10/10 Method:"" By focusing on increasing daily customers, check size and visit frequency by 10% in each category, you'll juice yearly sales in a disproportionality large way.Take Five Guys: Its average franchise location does about $1.2 million in yearly sales — roughly 220 customers a day averaging about $15.00 per check. If you can attract just 22 more people a day, and manage to up-sell one additional item on each check, things change dramatically. I recently sat down with Fransmart's CFO and ran the numbers: Yearly sales would go from $1.2 million to $1.59 million — a 32% increase by being just 10% better.



Here are three ways to ensure that your 10/10/10 growth strategy is a success.1. Nail that trial periodMost of your marketing budget, particularly in the early days, will be spent on getting customers to try your concept, so great operations and loyalty programs will keep guests coming back and spending more. Sweetgreen, for example, has a loyalty program that builds revenue by charging customers for extra perks, and it works. Rest assured: people will pay good money for a quality experience.Grand openings are, of course, vital. These events are usually held between a month before and a month after you open and should be designed to create a buzz in the market. Break through the noise by being creative; add a twist to your messaging so people won't want to miss out.


Be exhaustive in your research of the local market and tie your brand's message and marketing into it. And, whether in tandem with opening events or in a separate effort, consider a discount or giveaway to give folks additional motivation to stop by. Give them a reason to invest, because good value and community support are equally vital.When that crowd inevitably shows up, capture it in every way you can — whether in photos, video — heck, rent a drone and show just how far the line goes. A giveaway or other tempting draw may be great, but there's no incentive better than the fear of missing out. If the community sees a massive line, they'll be through the door soon.Related: The 8 Rules to Live By in Franchise Marketing, According to Top Franchise CMOs2. Encourage frequencyRepeat customers are the most profitable because you don't have to re-market to them. If someone enjoyed their first experience, the instinct is to repeat it, in the process hopefully trying other products. There's no marketing or incentive needed to bring these people back through the door: Your brand is the draw.Remember that marketing is an investment in repeat customers: it's not a cost. Consider a customer who uses you two times a month and spends $10 each time: That person isn't just the $10 they spend at that moment, but $240 a year and $2,400 over ten years. And that's not even factoring in the word-of-mouth business they provide by bringing in friends.Another major component of encouraging repeat business is making sure customers can enjoy your brand in whatever way they want, which means having a quality delivery program. You may cringe at the cost of developing your own, and/or partnering with third-party apps, but remember: This isn't just about building incremental sales but building a relationship with a repeat customer who will pay full price the next time they drive by your business. That's worth an investment.


Another vital consideration: The quickest killer of repeat business is making guests feel unsafe or uncomfortable. Great marketing might get someone through the door, but if they walk through a cobweb on their way in, it's over. Ensure that locations are adhering to high standards of presentation, or all the other good work is wasted.Related: 3 Customer-Service Tips That Will Ensure Repeat Business (60-Second Video)3. Grow check averagesI once asked the founder of a popular burger brand what percentage of customers also ordered its fries and maybe a fountain beverage. ""Everyone does,"" he replied. ""Well, most everyone. I think most do."" We watched the line for the next 10 minutes, and less than one-third of the customers were also ordering fries and a drink. Why? Because there was a line out the door and the cashier was trying to move it along instead of suggesting extras.Once you have people in the door, you're failing as a business if you're not doing everything you can to maximize each sale. This is an art: You don't want to apply undue pressure, but remember that you're in business to sell, not just take orders.To that end, customer service is more than a warm smile. People want a valuable experience, and that means having their needs met. Businesses should be prepared to ask good questions, identify specific needs and offer the right products to meet them. That means making sure the staff is well-trained. Suggestive selling will lead to a better experience if it's addressing a genuine need.Many businesses are turning to kiosks now to address the need for such selling. I love Wow Bao, an Asian concept in Chicago that's nailing the ordering process. In the early days of the company, new customers were clogging the lines by asking a long series of questions when ordering, causing regulars to turn away and avoid the wait. In response, the company installed kiosks, and the check average went up by almost 20%! This has driven revenue growth while lowering labor costs and giving repeat customers a better experience… a truly winning formula.

62,How to Revive Dead Leads to Generate Sales and Growth,"Jun 15, 2023",Joel Yi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-sales-farming-can-bring-new-life-to-dead-leads/453028,"
In the fast-paced business world, there is no asset more valuable than leads, as they are the key drivers of growth and profitability. As is often the case, many leads within your CRM may become inactive and be classified as 'dead' due to their lack of recent engagement or conversion. Numerous companies prioritize investing in acquiring new leads instead of allocating resources towards re-engaging inactive prospects. As per the Harvard Business Review, retaining an existing customer is significantly more cost-effective, with a range of five to 25 times less expensive than acquiring a new one.What if you could convert these dead prospects or clients into profitable sales? Welcome to the world of 'sales farming' and revenue recovery, which has proven to be a game-changer for experts, coaches and consultants.'Sales farming' differs from the conventional 'sales hunting' strategy, which focuses predominantly on acquiring new leads. Instead, it promotes the maintenance of existing relationships and the reactivation of dormant leads. This strategy entails meticulously combing through your contact database, identifying prospects whose interest in your business has waned, and strategically reviving it.



Related: How to Get High-Quality Business Leads with LinkedIn and Marketing AutomationNotable businessmen such as Dan Lok and fitness legend Brandon Carter have effectively employed sales farming strategies. This innovative strategy focuses on nurturing and re-engaging these cold prospects and clients, giving them new life and substantially boosting your bottom line. We assisted Dan Lok in generating over one million dollars in six months by reactivating 300,000 leads. Similarly, we assisted Brandon Carter in converting 25,000 cold prospects into over $400,000 in revenue within four months.


How, you ask? By leveraging the power of AI and effective Sales Farming strategies.Dead leads: recognizing the hidden treasureBefore implementing the strategy, it is essential to analyze the inherent value of 'dead' leads, which are commonly disregarded. A lead may initially go cold for various reasons, including that the timing wasn't right, the prospect wasn't ready to purchase, or your solution didn't meet their current requirements. Often, it is also a previous buyer who, over time, stopped purchasing your solutions. However, conditions alter. What a prospect or client may not have been interested in a few months ago may be exactly what they're looking for now.Therefore, these inactive leads represent a concealed treasure trove of potential business, and it is your responsibility to unearth this value.Related: How to Maximize Your Online Sales Leads


Sales farming: key strategies to implementSales Farming as a strategy relies heavily on personalization and automation. Several market tools can help your business achieve these goals, including Salesforce, HubSpot, GoHighLevel and Harvest AI.Bespoke Outreach: The initial step is to create tailored communication. This isn't just about mass communication; it's about crafting messages that feel individually personalized, which can help reignite interest in your business. Tools like Salesforce and HubSpot are particularly well-equipped for crafting and managing these personalized emails, texts, and voicemail drops.Automated Appointment Scheduling: Streamlining your sales call booking process can significantly improve the experience for your leads, thus increasing the likelihood of conversion. Platforms like GoHighLevel can provide the kind of automated bot assistance you need. Using advanced AI technologies, these bots can interact with leads, understand their schedules, and set appointments accordingly.Personalized Video Content: The power of video as an audience engagement tool can't be overstated. Creating a video and then personalizing it for each lead can greatly enhance your outreach efforts. Several advanced tools in the market, such as Harvest AI, can modify the lip-sync of the video to align with the lead's first name, taking personalization to a new level.


Improved Deliverability: Ensuring your outreach messages reach your leads is critical. Services that assist in obtaining A2P and STIR/SHAKEN approvals can enhance your deliverability rates, increasing the chances of your messages being seen by your leads.Efficient Lead Management and Tracking: A key aspect of Sales Farming involves efficient lead management. This involves organizing and tracking all communications with a lead. CRM systems like Salesforce and HubSpot give you visibility into a lead's interaction history, enabling you to design more targeted outreach strategies.In conclusion, Sales Farming isn't just a technique; it's a comprehensive strategy designed to turbocharge your sales efforts. By offering personalized outreach, automated processes, and optimized deliverability, platforms like Harvest AI and others provide you with the tools you need to breathe life back into your dormant leads and unlock new revenue opportunities.Building a sustainable business modelWhile the impact and results of Sales Farming are apparent in the short term, it's also essential to recognize the long-term benefits of this strategy. By nurturing and re-engaging existing leads, you create a sustainable business model that doesn't solely depend on acquiring new leads. This shift reduces your cost per lead and establishes a more stable revenue stream for your business.


Remember, the leads in your CRM were once interested in your business. They may have gone cold, but with the right approach, they can be re-engaged and converted. In the grand scheme of things, nurturing these relationships can prove to be more valuable than constantly seeking new leads.Conclusion: Unearth hidden valueIn conclusion, Sales Farming, particularly when powered by Harvest AI, provides a significant opportunity to unearth the hidden value within your CRM. It allows you to maintain fruitful relationships with your prospects, keep your pipeline healthy, and build a sustainable business model.Remember, your CRM is not a graveyard for dead leads. It's a farm, ripe with potential, waiting for the right strategy to cultivate it. Start farming your leads and watch as your 'dead' leads spring back to life, generating revenue and driving growth for your business.It's time to put your CRM under the plow and plant the seeds of re-engagement and retention. As the saying goes, 'the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.' The same goes for your leads. Start Sales Farming now, and harvest the fruits of your efforts in the form of revived leads and increased revenue.""

63,4 Secrets to Growth in a Tough Sales Environment,"Jun 15, 2023",Dave DeWalt,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-strategies-to-growth-in-a-tough-sales-economy/453267,"
A global economic downturn might be cooling a once blockbuster funding environment for startups, but don't let the gloomy headlines dent your growth ambitions. Technology advancements are reigniting investment activity and creating new opportunities for scrappy founders that can take advantage.The commercialization of large language models like ChatGPT is driving tremendous excitement about the future of artificial intelligence. In fact, worldwide spending on AI is now expected to hit $154 billion by the end of 2023, according to research firm IDC. And that will have a ripple effect through all areas of business.Already, investors are rushing to fund new AI startups. Meanwhile, areas like cybersecurity continue to see sustained investment. Sure, financiers are more cautious in their bets, and startups now have a mandate to run more efficiently. But the opportunity has never been better for savvy entrepreneurs to build sustainable businesses and investors to make smart — and eventually, lucrative — bets on software's next-generation.



Founders need to ensure they are preparing their own businesses to capitalize on the potential ahead. But competition is fiercer than ever. No matter what type of software they're selling, startup leaders have to intimately understand their target customer and their challenges, then build products that address all those needs in one easy-to-use and secure platform.Recently, at RSA, the largest annual gathering of cybersecurity professionals, I had the opportunity to speak to many of the industry's top entrepreneurs about the strategies they are using to hit their next financial milestones — whether that be $100 million, $500 million or $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. This built on my own experience as a four-time CEO, including three times of a public company.


Here's what I learned.Related: 10 Growth Strategies Every Business Owner Should Know1. Don't start smallIn the beginning, many founders will make the mistake of trying to target both small and large businesses. It divides the sales team and diverts attention away from the true profit center for most early-stage startups.Enterprises have a much larger appetite for experimentation. They're willing to invest in narrow applications that provide capabilities that their larger platforms can't handle — what's often referred to as ""best of breed"" systems.


Instead of wasting time chasing down customers that often don't have the budget for many new IT tools, founders should focus on solving a narrow problem for one customer segment – whether hospitals, manufacturers or retailers — then go after the largest organizations in that sector.That way, startups can quickly narrow down the total number of potential corporations' customers to target and spend the rest of the time figuring out the most effective sales approach to win their business.2. The world is hybrid. Build your product around that.It's obvious that enterprises aren't standardizing on one IT foundation. Businesses are using multiple infrastructure vendors — usually some mix of Google Cloud, AWS, Oracle, or Azure — and many still keep a small footprint of private, on-premises data centers.That means startups can no longer afford to build for just one ecosystem. They have to ensure their products work in all those different environments. The better startups can do this, the more successful they will be with customers.


Related: You Should Let Your Team Decide Their Approach to Hybrid Work. A Behavioral Economist Explains Why and How You Should Do It.3. Don't ignore the public sectorBack in the 1980s, Oracle nabbed the CIA as its first customer. Over four decades later, government institutions have become an even more vital launch pad for tomorrow's technology giants.There's a huge digitization push in the public sector. Around the world, governments are investing in upgrading local and national IT infrastructure, deploying new AI-powered applications and seeking to safeguard all the new software from increasingly hostile cyber adversaries. Founders should take advantage of this.Public sector customers often invest for the long haul. It's why so many vendors can build sustainable businesses just by catering to government customers. But don't underestimate the unique challenges in growing that business.


For many, it will be too difficult to build a profitable company trying to tackle both public and private-sector clients. Instead, startups should decide early-on whether which market they want to target and invest accordingly.4. Connectivity is a huge challenge for businesses — and a big opportunity for startupsFor businesses, the secret sauce to an AI future is connectivity.No longer can enterprises afford to let their technology environments run in silos. With the rapid acceleration of AI, businesses are trying to link those disparate systems together to build richer data streams that can help feed relevant and timely information to the models constantly.Of course, that's easier said than done. Many enterprises are running hundreds, if not thousands of applications. They're in multiple clouds. And they have many legacy programs to manage alongside the new digital investments. For startups, there's major growth potential for tools that can help customers deal with that complexity.


For example, in cybersecurity, companies like Claroty are growing quickly by helping customers protect their newly connected physical and digital environments — what some call ""cyber-physical"" devices — that are increasingly under attack from cybercriminals. In a hospital, this could be the medical devices used on patients, along with elevators, escalators, or oxygen machines in operating rooms.

65,Infusing Sustainability into Your Business Model,"Jun 15, 2023",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/green-entrepreneur/infusing-sustainability-into-your-business-model/454176,"
The pandemic caused people around the world to reevaluate their careers. For Kayli Kunkel, a layoff from her corporate job led her back to her roots. Inspired by her childhood experiences spending time in nature, Kayli created Earth & Me, the first zero-waste store in Queens, New York.Earth & Me offers a wide selection of zero-waste home and self-care products. To encourage customers to live more sustainably, the store also sells bulk products, like shampoo and conditioner, at refill stations where customers can fill their own reusable containers.""Our real benefit for the consumer is that you can come and shop and know that you're doing good by the earth,"" Kayli said. ""You don't have to vet products because we've done that for you.""



Reviewer Lina A. was first drawn to Earth & Me by the floral aroma and sunny decor. After learning more about the store's mission and the refill stations, she felt inspired to shop there more and make her habits more sustainable.""I do purchase things in plastic to be honest, but to walk in a store that's completely different than what I'm used to, that's what intrigued me,"" Lina said. ""I've never seen a store like that.""


When Kayli first opened Earth & Me, she started small with a pop-up shop. It was so successful that she decided to transition to a brick-and-mortar store. Three years later, Earth & Me has two locations and is gearing up for a third.In addition to expanding to new locations, Kayli has expanded the range of products she offers in her stores. While personal care items are the main focus, the shop has introduced vintage clothing and home goods options in an effort to diversify product offerings.Ever aware of improving her business, Kayli considers customer feedback to decide which new products to introduce and the best locations to open in. She hopes to continue expanding beyond her three locations and eventually turn Earth & Me into a bodega style shop you'd be happy to see on any street corner.""[Starting a business] is really scary, especially in the aftermath of COVID. There are a lot of risks that you undertake. But people who come and check it out and are excited to tell people about it really gave me the confidence to move forward,"" Kayli said. ""I had this idea and I loved it and I'm passionate about it, but if it doesn't resonate with my community, then what's the point?""


To solidify Earth & Me's connection with the community, Kayli regularly hosts events and local initiatives at the store, such as flower arranging workshops and clothing exchanges. She also uses the store's social media to share educational resources and opportunities to get involved in environmental justice and partners with other sustainable brands that share the same values, particularly women-owned businesses.""Being a woman-owned business, it's so important to me to use that space to really elevate women in our community who are doing the work,"" Kayli said. ""Other women-owned businesses, artists, and makers—it's a diverse community that's very important to me.""Lina resonated with the emphasis on female empowerment and community at Earth & Me, saying she appreciates how welcoming and inclusive the store feels. The thoughtful environment keeps her coming back.Since many customers like Lina are learning how to live more sustainably, education is an important part of Earth & Me's customer service. Lina said the staff are always helpful and willing to answer her questions about the store's products.


""For me, customer service is everything. The business is important, and what the business offers, but customer service is very important,"" Lina said. ""That sells your business. That makes me want to come back.""In addition to tips on becoming more sustainable, Earth & Me shared great advice for any small business:Keep your business values at the forefront. Customers will resonate with your mission if you're genuine and share what you care about. Post about your values on your social media and include them in branding around your store.Partner with businesses that share your vision. By working with other local businesses, you can grow together and learn from each other.Engage your community. Host community events to bring in new local customers and raise awareness for causes you care about.Continue prioritizing the customer experience. Even as you expand, customer service should always be top of mind. Teach new staff members about your customer service guidelines to ensure culture doesn't change across stores.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Kayli and Lina, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.Available on: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Stitcher, and Soundcloud.

66,Why You Should Never Treat Your Business As A Side Hustle,"Jun 15, 2023",Samuel Leeds,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/why-you-should-never-treat-your-business-as-a-side-hustle/453272,"
There is a trend of people starting side hustles as a way to supplement their income. The great thing about this is more people are becoming interested in being entrepreneurs and investors. This means that more people are breaking free from the limitations put on them by the traditional education system. The more people create and invest in businesses, the quicker we can improve the world. That is what is so great about capitalism!But while it is great that so many people are taking steps to start their own businesses, side hustle culture has some bad aspects. Often by framing businesses as side hustles, people self-sabotage their chance at starting a real, sustainable business. I believe when you start any business, you should see its potential to be something bigger. That doesn't mean you should quit your job and put all your time into your enterprise before you can afford to do so, but it does mean having a plan for it to grow.If you treat your business as real from the start, you can achieve life-changing results much better. As a multimillionaire property investor, trainer and businessman, I want to see as many people succeed as possible. In this article, I will give you three tips on ensuring you treat your new enterprise as a serious business rather than just another side hustle.



Related: I Accidentally Became a Successful Entrepreneur. Here Are 5 Mistakes I Learned to Avoid When Starting a Business1. Find your income replacement numberWhen you first start your business, you will need to continue to work a job to afford to live. But at some point, it will make more sense to focus on your business. You need to work out how much money you need to make a month for it to be possible for you to quit your job. Remember that when you are running your own business, each month will be different, so you will want to build some contingency into that number.


Once you start earning the amount you need, you should wait to see that you consistently earn this amount or more over months. Once you consistently earn enough money, you can decide what you want to do. You may choose to cut down the hours you are working to focus on your business, quit your job entirely or stay in your job and be more financially secure. Which option you choose will depend on your risk tolerance.2. Systematise your businessWhen you first start in business, you will effectively be a self-employed worker. You will have created another job for yourself. Once you start making some money, it is time to start systematizing your job into a real business. You will need to document everything you do so that you can transfer your work to employees, contractors or service providers when the time comes. You should also use the latest industry software to automate as many things as possible.As soon as it is financially possible, start to find people who can do parts of your work. Start by finding people to do the jobs you like the least, and keep doing what you are best at. Over time, you can step back into a managerial role. You should create an editable training manual for each role, adding answers to any new questions your employees ask. Over time, this will mean that you have to intervene directly less and less, as your employees will have a comprehensive book of answers they can refer to.Related: 6 Tips to Drive Sustainable Business Growth


3. Make your business passiveNow that you are in the manager role, it is time to transition to owner status. You will now need someone to take over your management role. This will make the business passive for you. You can then work on building the business at a high level. You can also start to build new parts of the business or start a complementary business that fits well with your existing offering.Having a business that you own, rather than one that relies on you to work within it, means your business has a value. How much your business is worth will depend on your industry and size of business. However, businesses are often worth 3-6x annual earnings. Down the road, you may wish to sell your business or raise capital to grow it. Therefore, having a business that can be valued in this way is very important.All this differs greatly from what most people think about when starting a side hustle. The side hustle mindset is limiting, whereas the business mindset has unlimited possibilities. Whatever industry you are in and whatever size your business is, I hope this article has helped you to look at it from a fresh perspective.

67,Purpose-Driven Companies Grow 3 Times Faster — So Here's How to Become One Without Sacrificing Profit.,"Jun 14, 2023",Anjan Thakor,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-balance-purpose-and-profit-for-long-term-success/449090,"
It used to be enough to drive profitability, but modern businesses (and their employees) now require a transcendent higher purpose. This is the ""why"" behind your company's mission and vision statements and helps align the decisions you make when dealing with uncertainty in business.Purpose-driven organizations are valued by stakeholders because they grow three times faster on average than non-purpose-driven competitors. Purpose-led organizations encourage personal development among all employees with the understanding that businesses have a powerful influence on society and should be focused on more than just financial goals.Of course, creating a purpose-driven organization without sacrificing long-term profits is easier said than done. It requires the right catalyst and transformative leaders understand that authentically reaching for something deeper and more meaningful achieves better business results. There are four ways to be a change catalyst and lead your organization with purpose.



Related: Why a Purpose-Driven Business Is the Real Key to Success1. Look to the voice of your organizationPurpose isn't invented — it's discovered. And the best way to discover your organization's purpose is to listen to it. I call it ""hearing the voice of the organization,"" and it's the future of leadership development. Committed leaders at purpose-driven organizations model behavior with appropriate rewards and consequences that are aligned with societal standards and organizational objectives.


Being a change catalyst means you must recognize your organization's higher calling and be transparent and open about how that must be balanced with financial stability. Money alone is not a driving factor, and you need clarity on the true vision you want everybody to follow. This will help you influence those around you to become change champions, too.Take Burt's Bees and its mission of ""For Nature. For All."" as an example of this idea in action. The popular skin and lip care manufacturer has emerged as a leader in sustainability efforts over the years, with the vast majority of its products' packaging being 100% recyclable. While its corporate mission could stop there and be fulfilled, the leaders at Burt's Bees take their mission further by ensuring their products are sourced responsibly and not bringing more harm to the environment. Its operations are landfill-free by directing waste to compost, recycling and waste-to-energy sites.As co-founder Roxanne Quimby said, ""We take from nature, so we must respect and preserve it."" It's a stance that has served the company well. Is Burt's Bees sacrificing some profit to be an industry leader in sustainability? Without a doubt. Is it the right thing to do for the long-term health of the company and, beyond that, the communities it serves? Absolutely, and it all begins with its mission.Related: Why a Purpose-Driven Business Is the Real Key to Success


2. Be genuine about your visionYour purpose will be the arbiter of all business decisions, so it must relate your courage and conviction to investors, employees and customers. Change champions must take accountability for making important decisions, no matter how difficult they may be. We are naturally drawn to people with courage and conviction in their actions, even if it means facing consequences.When it comes to being genuine in their convictions, Patagonia and its founder, Yvon Chouinard, have been a consistent example of this with the mission statement, ""We're in business to save our home planet."" As a company, Patagonia donates 1% of its profits to charity each year and became a certified B Corporation. Patagonia also emphasizes the quality of clothing to combat the waste of fast fashion. To support this, the company created the Worn Wear program to divert more garments from landfills by repairing consumers' Patagonia clothing and allowing customers to trade them in for different items. Patagonia could stop its initiatives at its activism efforts, but to stay true to its mission, Patagonia makes efforts to ensure its products are better for the planet.Speak from the heart when communicating your vision to the team. Your passion and resolve will spread and become a driving force in managing uncertainty in business that would normally create anxiety and pressure. When you are genuine in your purpose, it makes business easier.Related: Power With Purpose: The Four Pillars Of Leadership


3. Connect each employee to the purposeAn organization is only as good as its individual people, and converting your team into change champions means investing in leadership development. Every employee in every department should feel appreciated and meaningful in what they do with their professional lives.Finding a purpose isn't easy, and changing your organization to follow it after the fact is even harder. According to Bain & Company research, only 12% of companies undergoing large-scale change management fully achieve their goals. This shows that creating a purpose-driven organization is easier than converting a wayward one after the fact, but enacting the change isn't impossible.Purpose-driven organizations empower every employee to do their best for the greater good. This motivational factor will give your entry-level employees more agency to work smarter and make bolder decisions that can improve overall operational performance. A sense of purpose can increase both customer and employee loyalty, making the business more profitable in the long run.Related: How to Build More Purpose Into Your Work


4. Align changes back to the same purpose every timeThe most important ingredient in creating purpose-driven organizations is consistency. Change is the only constant in business, and you must consistently show progress toward the same goal through all of these changes. When Apple pivoted from Macintosh computers to iTunes, iPods, iPhones and everything else, it maintained its same greater mission throughout: ""Apple is committed to bringing the best personal computing experience to students, educators, creative professionals and consumers around the world through its innovative hardware, software and internet offerings.""Although the landscape and your business will change often throughout your lifetime, your higher calling should not. Consistency is a powerful weapon when dealing with uncertainty in business because it provides a safe foundation for people to work and build on proactively.The hardest part isn't starting the habit. It's keeping it. This is something you believe in, so share your passion for the goals, share that vision with your employees and listen to their feedback. They might even know how to make the purpose of your organization become a reality faster.

68,Hybrid Work is No Longer a Precaution — It's Undeniably Beneficial for Business Success. Here's Why,"Jun 14, 2023",Jack Truong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/hybrid-work-is-no-longer-a-precaution-its-necessary/453247,"
In March of 2020, companies officially closed their doors and opened their minds to new ways of running their business amidst the global pandemic. Since then, the feasibility and advantages of in-office vs. remote work have become a topic of conversation and controversy. Today, business leaders are rethinking ideal work structures again, and return-to-office mandates are rampant among companies like Netflix, Disney, Goldman Sachs and Apple. The response to these mandates has been mostly negative — but why rebuild the workplace of the past when we could be building a better future?I've experienced firsthand the innovation that resulted from pandemic conditions rather than despite them. In a time of uncertainty, frustration and loss, businesses proved that growth and creativity are possible even amidst a crisis. While there's no substitute for the unity and face-to-face communication of the office, remote work provides an important supplement to in-office work — one that accelerates growth on a global scale.For this reason, I believe that hybrid work is no longer just a necessary precaution — it's undeniably beneficial to business. In 2023, the workforce is more diverse, connected and adaptive than ever before. Hybrid work holds immense opportunity, and companies hoping to create the future must stop pining for the past.



Related: Debunking the 5 Myths of Hybrid WorkDiversityThe modern office spans geographies to build cross-cultural understandings. Teams are multitalented and multinational, comprised of individuals with different backgrounds and fresh perspectives. Remote work allows qualified individuals to apply for positions previously unavailable to them; those who could not previously commute to the office daily now have full access to job opportunities beyond their geographical region, ushering in an era of equal opportunity.


With this shift, employees have the privilege of working alongside those who are different from themselves, creating space for cross-functional and cross-cultural collaboration. The diversity of available talent creates an inclusive, multicultural workforce that is better equipped to succeed by sharing ideas and exchanging information.Rather than stunting company growth by employing only like-minded individuals, hybrid work fosters diversity of thought within businesses — without which true innovation would not be possible. Cultivating a vast cultural understanding improves the workforce and the work itself. Greater representation among the workforce increases the company's capability of meeting a wider set of customer and consumer needs, reaching more audiences in more places.Related: You Should Let Your Team Decide Their Approach to Hybrid Work. A Behavioral Economist Explains Why and How You Should Do It.ConnectivityOver the past three years, the traditional workplace structure has been revolutionized. Hybrid work has frankly obliterated the limitations previously imposed by distance and time zones, enabling businesses to tap into a global talent pool — and modern business leaders know how to do just that. Companies now recruit top-notch candidates from anywhere in the world, regardless of their home base. This real-time, worldwide communication pipeline has also led to increased business opportunities, as organizations can effortlessly interact with customers and consumers from anywhere and anytime—allowing for broader market reach and increased revenue generation.


I experienced the incredible shift toward multinational, connected teams while working at James Hardie. Before 2020, I only met in person with my global direct reports as a team roughly once per quarter. Immediately after the pandemic broke out, we began establishing a daily cadence of meetings, even though one of my colleagues was based in Germany and the other was based in Australia. At first, these meetings were digital because they had to be; then, they became more regular because they were so effective. If our business leaders had become myopic about in-person collaboration, we would have lost the regular cadence of incredible, transnational connectivity we gained over the last three years.Related: The Apple Vision Pro Will Revolutionize Remote Work — Just Not for Apple Employees. Here's Why.AdaptabilityNot only did we become more connected during the pandemic, but we also became more proactive. Responding to each outbreak meant planning for the next; people worldwide were exchanging information about the virus, trying to plan ahead for future challenges and opportunities. I believe this constant communication strengthened the pipeline of ideas and accelerated the pace of the right decisions made at the right time for the company.The modern, digital workspace transcends boundaries, paving the way for seamless communication. Executives and employees can now collaborate anytime, anywhere, without needing to coordinate expensive in-person meetings weeks and months in advance. For example, project teams can now be comprised of employees located in multiple regions. North American teams can now collaborate with their Asian Pacific counterparts, whereas before, they would have operated in far-flung, in-office siloes. What's more, when the work day for the North American team members ends, it's only just beginning for the Asian Pacific team members.


As a result, projects can progress quickly and seamlessly around the clock. Thus, important decisions can be made more quickly, allowing for better alignment and maximized execution. The instant transfer of information allows companies to build and adjust strategies in real-time, keeping pace with the ever-changing market. This pace of continuous improvement would not be possible without a workplace structure that enables the constant progression of ideas across various time zones and locations. Thus, a hybrid work structure benefits the quality and quantity of work.Lastly, employees are not the only ones who have responded positively to hybrid work — so has the environment. With fewer employees commuting to work, lighter traffic has reduced air pollution, and less paper is used for office materials — mitigating some of the environmental impacts of traditional office-based work. Not only is digital globalization better for business, but it's also better for the planet. In many ways, the world has changed and has moved on — and it won't wait for old-school business leaders to catch up.

69,"Why ""Free"" Shipping Isn't Really Free (And Why It's Getting More Expensive)","Jun 13, 2023",Tyler Metcalf,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-rising-and-expensive-cost-of-free-shipping/453008,"
Covid-19 cemented the expectation of two-day and next-day shipping for ""free"" with Amazon Prime. Just before Jeff Bezos stepped down in 2021, Amazon had added 50 million subscribers over the pandemic. Back then, Prime was $119 a year, a price set in 2018.Now, it's $139 a year. Amazon recently announced it had updated its inventory management system and search algorithms to reduce the number of touchpoints in the delivery system to keep delivery times low. It's also added a $1 fee for returning packages when an Amazon pickup/return center is reasonably close by. This and other minimum order limits have shown the shift towards moving costs back onto the consumer for home delivery. It's not just Amazon, though.Walmart has had less luck in the optics of this shift, recently receiving vocal outcry on Twitter about their high delivery prices. If you're not a Walmart Plus member, you'll pay up to $9.95 for a delivery fee on regular orders. ""Express"" delivery is an additional $10, no matter if you're a Plus member or not.



So, why now?Amazon was trying things during Covid-19, like every huge ecommerce company. There were new problems to solve and plenty of money coming in, but now they're done throwing spaghetti at the wall. Amazon is cutting back, with over 27,000 people laid off this year and programs like the Scout delivery robots, brick-and-mortar bookstores and Halo health device being shut down. With the experimentation phase over, the main concern is making costs.


Related: Amazon Increases Prices for Prime Members Once Again. Is It Still Worth It?Bezos is gone, so there's a responsibility to shareholders. Amazon is too large to be a completely lean and trimmed organization, but the core delivery service (200 million subscribers use) must work. To match consumer expectations, they've shifted to AI and robotics, emphasizing the ""regionalization"" techniques to get products delivered faster. They've shifted to AI and robotics to match consumer expectations. And it works. It's good. But…Even though Amazon has such expansive warehouse distribution, it's never going to be perfect. No matter what you have, logistics and robots, 90% will be good… but never 100%. The fully automated sci-fi future is still a ways away, so, for now, we need to be aware of the human element in delivery.Drivers, both short and long-haul drivers, are a key human element in the delivery system. People are necessary to move products, either between warehouses or to someone's front door. Working conditions are tough. There's no time for breaks, and there are expectations to get packages to as many doors as possible every day. In California, an Amazon Delivery Service Partner organized a union with the Teamsters to secure safety protections and pay increases.


Related: 'Amazon Is Too Big to Listen to Anyone': Dum-Dums Says It Is Losing Millions to Amazon Seller ScamMy dad is a long-haul driver, and it takes a lot of planning to maintain any semblance of work-life balance. Just to be able to work out, he had to find a gym membership that had locations along his routes in New Jersey. The human element is a limit that can't be pushed within the delivery infrastructure, or you run the risk of dehumanizing your workforce.Drones have been talked about as an option for smaller products. Amazon even announced its new drone last year, but it is still limited in where and what it can deploy — it drops its payload from 12 feet in the air. There's a ""last meter problem"" with drone delivery. It has to be safe for the package and everyone on the ground.For now, drones will be expensive to monitor and maintain. DroneUp, a Walmart-backed startup, had to lay off part of its workforce, saying new hires will come in the future. Scaling drones to cover the delivery process will work eventually, but that will take time.


Where does that leave consumers today?Do you remember back in 2020 when all anyone could talk about was the supply chain? Container rates were soaring. Delays at L.A.'s ports were growing. It was the only thing we could talk about — until we all stopped talking about it. For a moment, though, there was a collective understanding of how difficult it is to move products around the world.Related: What Does 'Free Shipping' Really Mean for Retailers?As the world slowly bounced back from Covid, and many businesses, like Amazon, came out on top with the monumental shift to buying online, consumers forgot about those supply chain woes. It's easy to forget — until it starts to hurt their wallets.


And that's precisely where they don't want to feel it. Consumers don't necessarily want fast. They want cheap. In a survey, shipping cost was 2.85 times more important than shipping speed. Consumers enjoy getting their products faster, but not at the expense of cost.It's a miracle that two, one, or same-day shipping is accomplishable. The amount of advancement in delivery capabilities and logistics in just the past ten years amazes me. I remember when a delivery taking four to six weeks was the average. As our expectations for quick delivery have been surpassed, it may mean we need to pump the brakes for infrastructure to catch up.Maybe consumers learn to pay the extra price for delivery, or companies like Amazon and Walmart market a new, relaxed delivery tier; there are ways to put less stress on the system, and it may lie in putting the concept of ""free"" shipping to rest. Consumers need to know fast delivery isn't magic and isn't free.

    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

""The age of AI has begun,"" Bill Gates declared this March, reflecting on an OpenAI demonstration of feats such as acing an AP Bio exam and giving a thoughtful, touching answer to being asked what it would do if it were the father of a sick child.At the same time, tech giants like Microsoft and Google have been locked in a race to develop AI tech, integrate it into their existing ecosystems and dominate the market. In February, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella challenged Sundar Pichai of Google to ""come out and dance"" in the AI battlefield.For businesses, it's a challenge to keep up. On the one hand, AI promises to streamline workflows, automate tedious tasks and increased overall productivity. Conversely, the AI sphere is fast-paced, with new tools constantly appearing. Where should they place their bets to stay ahead of the curve?



And now, many tech experts are backpedaling. Leaders like Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Tesla's Elon Musk, alongside 1,300 other industry experts, professors and AI luminaries, all signed an open letter calling to halt AI development for six months.At the same time, the ""godfather of AI,"" Geoffrey Hinton, resigned as one of Google's lead AI researchers and wrote a New York Times op-ed warning of the technology he'd helped create.


Even ChatGPT's Sam Altman joined in the chorus of warning voices during a Congress hearing.But what are these warnings about? Why do tech experts say that AI could actually pose a threat to businesses — and even humanity?Here is a closer look at their warnings.Uncertain liabilityTo begin with, there is a very business-focused concern. Liability.


While AIs have developed amazing capabilities, they are far from faultless. ChatGPT, for instance, famously invented scientific references in a paper it helped write.Consequently, the question of liability arises. If a business uses AI to complete a task and gives a client erroneous information, who is liable for damages? The business? The AI provider?None of that is clear right now. And traditional business insurance fails to cover AI-related liabilities.Regulators and insurers are struggling to catch up. Only recently, the EU drafted a framework to regulate AI liability.Related: Rein in the AI Revolution Through the Power of Legal LiabilityLarge-scale data theftAnother concern is linked to unauthorized data use and cybersecurity threats. AI systems frequently store and handle large amounts of sensitive information, much of it collected in legal gray areas.This could make them attractive targets for cyberattacks.""In the absence of robust privacy regulations (US) or adequate, timely enforcement of existing laws (EU), businesses have a tendency to collect as much data as they possibly can,"" explained Merve Hickok, Chair & Research Director at Center for AI and Digital Policy, in an interview with The Cyber Express.


""AI systems tend to connect previously disparate datasets,"" Hickok continued. ""This means that data breaches can result in exposure of more granular data and can create even more serious harm.""MisinformationNext up, bad actors are turning to AI to generate misinformation. Not only can this have serious ramifications for political figures, especially with an election year looming. It can also cause direct damage to businesses.Whether targeted or accidental, misinformation is already rampant online. AI will likely drive up the volume and make it harder to spot.AI-generated photos of business leaders, audio mimicking a politician's voice and artificial news anchors announcing convincing economic news. Business decisions triggered by such fake information could have disastrous consequences.

But It Won't Be the Last Time You're Fooled By an AI-Generated Image.Demotivated and less creative team membersEntrepreneurs are also debating how AI will affect the psyche of individual members of the workforce.""Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us?"" the open letter asks.According to Matt Cronin, the U.S. Department of Justice's National Security & Cybercrime Coordinator, the answer is a clear ""No."" Such a large-scale replacement would devastate the motivation and creativity of people in the workforce.


""Mastering a domain and deeply understanding a topic takes significant time and effort,"" he writes in The Hill. ""For the first time in history, an entire generation can skip this process and still progress in school and work. However, reliance on generative AI comes with a hidden price. You are not truly learning — at least not in a way that meaningfully benefits you.""Ultimately, widespread AI use may lower team members' competence, including critical thinking skills.Related: AI Can Replace (Some) Jobs — But It Can't Replace Human Connection. Here's Why.Economic and political instabilityWhat economic shifts widespread AI adoption will cause are unknown, but they will likely be large and fast. After all, a recent Goldman Sachs estimate projected that two-thirds of current occupations could be partially or fully automated, with opaque ramifications for individual businesses.


According to experts' more pessimistic outlooks, AI could also incite political instability. This could range from election tampering to truly apocalyptic scenarios.In an op-ed in Time Magazine, decision theorist Eliezer Yudkowsky called for a general halt to AI development. He and others argue that we are unprepared for powerful AIs and that unfettered development could lead to catastrophe.ConclusionAI tools hold immense potential to increase businesses' productivity and level up their success.However, it's crucial to be aware of the danger that AI systems pose, not just according to doomsayers and techno-skeptics, but according to the very same people who developed these technologies.


That awareness will help infuse businesses' AI approach with a caution critical to successful adaptation.

71,Boomers vs. Millennials? How to Broker Peace Between Generations in the Workplace,"Jun 12, 2023",Andrej Jonovic,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/boomers-vs-gen-z-how-to-create-peace-between-generations/453001,"
If we are ever to hope for a workable solution to intergenerational tension in the workplace, it is incumbent on leaders and managers to first get our analysis right. The reality is that younger generations can be better at reading certain markets since they tend to constitute a large part of it, but older generations are more likely to spot a fad over secular change or societal pivot. Synthesize these points of view, and you have a perspective keyed into areas of potential growth buffered by realism and sustainability. What could go wrong?The workplace can be a microcosm of society, and on-the-job tensions are nothing new. However, in an age where we are defining more differences between people than ever before, we risk overstepping those boundaries. Politics has also permeated America to such an extent that people are being led to believe that there are only two kinds of thinking: Blue or red. Healthy arguments have given way to a lot of noise.None of this is fertile ground for peace at work, let alone peace in our time. But there is a way to bridge the generation gap between digital natives and their older colleagues. If we understand each other and the crises that have shaped every cohort, each generation's beliefs and attitudes become more relatable and less adversarial. We would have common ground to build upon.



Related: How to Keep Workplace Relationships Drama-Free: Advice From Family-Run FranchisesIdentifying intergenerational tensionsMismatched expectations create different views on what is appropriate, what is inappropriate, and the value and meaning of work itself. Conflict between generations then tends to crystalize around interpersonal interactions and results in lazy stereotypes. So many expectations that drive intergenerational tensions — such as ambition, work-life balance, and socioeconomic structure — are subjective, so it can be hard to address the root cause.


It helps to understand that employee attitudes are molded early in their careers, so each new generation receives an abundance of information on how to operate in the workplace, but how they receive it is informed by the challenges unique to each era. For context, Boomers arrived in the workforce with a certain degree of stability that is foreign to Millennial workers, who have known nothing but change. Meanwhile, Gen Z entered the workforce in the midst of the pandemic, which presented unprecedented circumstances for all employees.This disparity is apparent when processes are updated in the workplace. Each generation has had different conditioning in response to change, so divergent attitudes can cause disagreement and misunderstanding. But brokering peace requires that we go even deeper into the changes that created a whole new set of expectations for the different age demographics.Related: 4 Ways To Overcome Age-Related Tension In The OfficeGetting to the root causeEvery generation that has entered the workforce has faced at least one major crisis that shaped their values and affected the way they work and live. It's a sobering thought, but the newest generation may not have even met their crisis yet. The pandemic drastically shifted the face of work, and for those new to the workforce, the post-COVID world bears little resemblance to the relative predictability enjoyed by those born between 1946 and 1964.


Boomers themselves were shaped by existential uncertainties, like the Cold War, the Vietnam War, or the civil rights movement. For newer generations, the growth of remote work accelerated by pandemic restrictions has denied them the opportunity to assimilate workplace norms by coming into the office. In one striking case reported by The New York Times, a young worker resorted to ""stalking"" Glassdoor reviews of her own company to learn about its culture.It makes sense that being met with remote interactions in a fast-paced, ever-changing environment in the early stages of one's career would significantly affect a young worker's career mobility and attitude towards their employer. It also makes sense that older generations equate experience with authority. Getting to the bottom of each generation's core beliefs offers the foundation for how to work with these differences.Related: 3 Ways Technology Influences Generational Divides At WorkHow to forge the path to peaceThe problem with workplaces is that they are not always meritocracies. There are politics, shifting priorities, and the natural churn of talent or mobility. All of that can result in intergenerational tensions being put low on the priority list. Depending on the industry, management, and even ownership structure, companies risk losing the necessary diversity of opinions and approaches if they are not addressed.


In an ideal world, we would always have a harmonious, peaceful, and efficient environment, but the existence of tensions themselves is not inherently negative. In creative industries, we are familiar with competing ideas begetting innovation, yet competing viewpoints and even worldviews have the potential to create greater empathy and understanding if harnessed correctly.When an employee is having issues, understanding what their ""crisis"" may have been can provide insight into the kind of coaching and assistance they may need or how to help adjust to the workplace dynamics they may have missed. Management can also provide opportunities for the generations to get to know each other in a collaborative environment. It shouldn't be such a stretch to cultivate mutual respect because no one has been left untouched by the changes to the face of work.Related: 'They Think They're Better Than You': 74% of Managers Surveyed Say Gen Z Is More Difficult to Work With Than Other GenerationsFrom binary to complementary: Working togetherAs managers and leaders, we must bring all people under our care into greater harmony — for everybody's sake and for the business. If we are open-minded, objective, and willing to disarm tensions rooted in generational camps, we stand to gain from age-diverse teams. When members of intergenerational teams are encouraged to share and learn from their differences, decision-making, collaboration, and performance all improve.


With fewer younger workers entering the workforce due to changing demographics and the spate of early retirements during the pandemic, ensuring that the skill sets of each generation are treated as complementary is vital to maintaining operational efficiency. The solution to intergenerational tensions is getting our diagnosis right at the outset so we can work towards facing the next inevitable change or crisis together.

72,How AI is Helping Us Break Free From The 9-to-5 Grind,"Jun 7, 2023",Asim Rais Siddiqui,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-ai-is-breaking-the-9-to-5-mold/452728,"
As someone who is a huge tech enthusiast, I have been privileged to witness the continuous evolution of technology throughout my career. From groundbreaking innovations like the iPhone to cutting-edge advancements like 5G, the pace at which our world changes never ceases to amaze me. However, amidst this ever-changing landscape, one particular technology has captured my attention and sparked my curiosity: generative artificial intelligence (AI).Generative AI, at its core, is a remarkable fusion of human ingenuity and machine learning. Its capacity to go beyond our preconceived limits and generate, imagine and produce is truly awe-inspiring. As someone who has always been captivated by the transformative potential of AI in various industries, encountering generative AI took my fascination to an entirely new level.When I first witnessed the capabilities of generative AI, I was left in awe. It's almost as if the AI possesses its own inherent creative instincts, blurring the boundaries between the realms of human imagination and machine intelligence. While the notion of machines creating art, music, or writing that can rival human creativity might appear daunting to some, with fears of the automation apocalypse rampant, I think otherwise.



In the 2023 edition of its annual Future of Jobs Report, the World Economic Forum reports that out of the 803 businesses that it surveyed from around the world, 25% believe that the integration of AI tech will lead to job losses, while 50% believe that it will create job growth. AI can only replace humans if you think it will and stop progressing and upskilling alongside it.The potential for AI to push the boundaries of what we thought was possible is truly inspiring, and that can be illustrated in the way that it can reimagine the 9-to-5 workday.


Related: Why Are So Many Companies Afraid of Generative AI?Reimagining the 9-to-5 workdayThe traditional 9-to-5 work schedule has long been the standard in the corporate world, but with the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), the concept of ""clocking in"" and ""clocking out"" is undergoing a profound transformation. AI technologies are revolutionizing work, allowing flexibility, personalized schedules and reimagining the traditional workday.Every position within every organization holds the potential for reinvention. Accenture conducted a manual assessment of 200 language-related tasks to gauge the impact of generative AI. The aim was to identify which tasks were more likely to be automated or augmented through AI. The results showed that generative AI is projected to influence approximately 40% of individuals' working hours.In this article, we will explore how AI is reshaping the 9-to-5 paradigm and empowering individuals to ""flex out"" of rigid work schedulesRelated: How ChatGPT and Generative AI Can Transform the Way You Run Your BusinessEmbracing flexibilityWithin any given role, generative AI will help automate certain tasks while others will be assisted, freeing up individuals to focus on more meaningful endeavors. Rather than being bound by inflexible schedules, workers now have the chance to embrace flexible work setups that cater to their personal preferences and productivity patterns. Companies can optimize workflows, automate repetitive tasks and streamline processes, increasing employee flexibility.Additionally, there will be tasks that remain unaffected by the technology. The advent of generative AI will also usher in many new responsibilities for human workers, such as ensuring the responsible and accurate utilization of new AI-powered systems. This contributes to creating new job roles like AI system managers, AI ethics experts and prompt engineers.The rise of remote workAI has also played a crucial role in facilitating the surge of remote work, granting individuals the freedom to work from any corner of the globe. The advancements in communication and collaboration technologies, combined with AI-driven virtual meeting platforms, have simplified the process of remote collaboration for professionals.


The flexibility offered by AI-powered remote work helps eliminate the need for lengthy commutes, reduces overhead costs for companies, and expands opportunities for individuals in remote locations. Moreover, AI-enabled remote work allows organizations to tap into a global talent pool, accessing a diverse range of skill sets and perspectives that can fuel innovation and foster growth.Related: How The AI Revolution Is Liberating Workers from the OfficeRedefining work-life balanceThe conventional 9-to-5 work model frequently falls short when it comes to striking a healthy work-life balance. AI is helping reshape this paradigm, granting individuals the liberty to manage their time in a manner that aligns with their personal obligations and outside responsibilities. Nobel Prize-winning economist Christopher Pissarides believes that AI can enable humans to work just four days a week.With the aid of AI, flexible work schedules empower individuals to allocate dedicated time to personal endeavors like quality family moments, pursuing hobbies, or prioritizing self-care activities. By nurturing a more harmonious work-life balance, AI isn't just bolstering employee satisfaction and well-being but also improving productivity and overall job performance.


A flexible and personalized approach to the 9-to-5 workdayWith the continuous advancement of AI, the inflexible 9-to-5 work model is gradually being replaced by a more adaptable and personalized approach. Professionals now have the chance to break free from the confines of the traditional workday structure.Embracing this transformation facilitated by AI can result in heightened productivity, increased job satisfaction, and a more balanced and fulfilling work-life equilibrium. As we progress, it becomes crucial for individuals and organizations to harness the potential of AI to reshape work hours and unlock the full capabilities of the modern workforce.Related: It's Time to Prepare for the Algorithmic Workforce

74,You Could Lose Your Entire Business in a Personal Injury Claim. Here's How to Protect Yourself,"Jun 5, 2023",Hank Stout,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-growing-trend-of-personal-injury-impacts-on-small/452536,"
The personal injury industry is worth roughly $53.1 billion as of 2022. The majority of these claims fall under motor vehicle accident claims or medical malpractice.With more than 64,000 personal injury law firms in the United States, it's an increasing reality that small business owners will face a claim against them or their insurance provider over the years.Although a car accident claim may not be directly relevant to all small business owners, other types of personal injury claims are. More relevant claims would likely involve product liability or a workplace accident lawsuit.For small businesses to grow, businesses to incorporate more services and offer their expertise to more people. But as business owners increase their reach, many will eventually encounter a situation involving a personal injury claim.



Personal injury claims are among the most common types of lawsuits filed. For example, in 2020, personal injury/product liability increased by 97% over the previous year.Related: 7 Workplace Injuries That Can Put You Out of Business


Suppose someone is injured while on your property or by one of your products; you and or your insurance provider may be in a position to be held liable for the injury. But how could this have been avoided in the first place? Various factors play into establishing fault.Accidents and the unforeseen occur constantly. It's critical, though, to think as critically as possible and prepare yourself and your staff for the possibility of this situation. Savvy small business owners will know to not only be ready for this possibility but assume it will happen eventually.Protect your team through adequate insurance coverageAt a minimum, small business owners are recommended to carry commercial general liability insurance. This will help support your staff in case of an injury on your property. It goes in tandem with creating a safe work environment, which is also critical. Keep floors clean, walkways available, and doors are clearly marked. If you work with specialized equipment, ensure all staff members are trained and certified to use said equipment.Be up to date on the law and keep an evolving recordThe rules that govern local small businesses include employment, environmental and product liability laws. Knowing the latest changes and amendments to these and related laws are essential, as they will impact your business operations. Keeping digital and printed records of all rules is recommended for quick accessibility and reference. Document everything if something occurs on your property leading to an accident, injury, or complaint. If you are sued or face a legal challenge, showing all your steps with written documentation can be hugely beneficial.

The Legal Ramifications of AutomationKeep a written policy on customer service and be responsive to customer complaintsTo minimize confusion and help your staff interact with customers, display your customer service policy for any patrons visiting your establishment or office. This policy should include clear guidelines for an emergency involving an injured guest or staff member. If anyone is injured on your premises, request medical assistance immediately. Taking any injuries seriously in this situation is paramount.It may not be easy but keep a positive outlookIt's understandable to feel stressed when faced with injuries and a potential personal injury suit against you or your insurance policy. You should consult with an experienced legal counsel in these scenarios. Many personal injury lawyers often also provide defense litigation services.

This was what's commonly referred to as the duty of care. Many personal injury claims will revolve around the legal claim that this duty was broken.


Duty of care is typically defined as a base requirement that a person be attentive, exercise caution, and be mindful while in public. The small business owner and their patron/user are expected to follow this. A personal injury case could be possible if one party is found to have acted in a directly negligent fashion.Related: 5 Reasons Personal Injury Law Firms Are ThrivingDefending yourself and your business from an accusation of negligence will be a significant deciding factor in the validity of the case.

75,How You Structure Your Business to the IRS Can Affect More Than Your Tax Bill. Here's What You Need to Know.,"Jun 5, 2023",Nellie Akalp,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-you-structure-your-business-to-the-irs-matters-heres/450527,"
The business formation structure you chose at startup may no longer be the best one for your business. As you grow, your company's legal entity can affect your tax bill, personal assets and ability to attract investors, raise money and expand your business.Those are many variables, so let's explore your options.Related: Which Business Structure Is Right for You?



Sole proprietorshipsMost startups in the U.S. start — and stay — as sole proprietorships. Of 33 million U.S. small businesses, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says 28.3 million are nonfarm sole proprietorships.Sole proprietorships are the simplest form of legal business entity. The setup process is easy. While sole proprietorships without employees don't need an Employer Identification Number (EIN), it's recommended since many banks won't let you open a business account without one.


There is a downside, however. There is no legal separation between a sole proprietor and the business. So, you are personally liable for any debts, obligations and lawsuits against your company. If your company is sued, your personal assets (property, bank accounts, etc.) can be at risk.For tax purposes, sole proprietors report their profits and losses on their individual tax returns (IRS Forms 1040) and attach a Schedule C Profit or Loss From Business, showing income, expenses and allowable tax deductions. In addition to income taxes, sole proprietors pay self-employment taxes of 12.4% for social security and 2.9% for Medicare. Taxes are due April 15.PartnershipsMany entrepreneurs start businesses with family or friends or look for partners when their businesses grow. Like sole proprietorships, there is no legal separation between the partners and the company, so the partners' personal assets are at risk if something goes wrong.Unless specified differently in the partnership agreement, all partners are equally responsible for paying taxes. Partnerships use IRS Form 1065, Schedule K, to list partners and the business's revenues and expenses. Plus, all partners must pay self-employment and estimated taxes. Partnership tax returns are due March 15.


Related: 5 Tips for Structuring Your New Business Like a ProLLCs offer liability protectionAs their businesses grow, many entrepreneurs become uncomfortable with their personal assets being at risk and explore incorporating their companies.There are two ways to incorporate: forming a Limited Liability Company (LLC) or a C Corporation. Both structures are considered separate legal entities and protect business owners from the company's liabilities, shielding their personal assets.Owners of LLCs are called members. Single-member LLCs are taxed like sole proprietorships using tax form 1040 and Schedule C. Multi-member LLCs are taxed like partnerships and use partnership forms 1065 and Schedule K and K-1. LLC members must still pay self-employment taxes. You can also opt for an S Corp election (see below).


You must file Articles of Organization with your state to form an LLC. And while not required, it's recommended that you create an operating agreement. An operating agreement defines the roles and responsibilities of a multi-member LLC.LLCs are becoming increasingly popular due to their relatively simple management structure, fewer compliance requirements and flexible tax treatment. They're essentially a ""have your cake and eat it too"" option. For instance, multi-member LLCs can allocate percentages of the company's profits and losses to the members as they see fit.LLCs have fewer and less complex compliance responsibilities than C Corps. They don't have to elect officers or a board of directors. There are some ongoing compliance requirements — check with your state to learn more.The biggest disadvantage of owning an LLC is that you can't issue company stock, making it more challenging to raise money.


C Corps offer robust liability protectionAs your business grows, you may want stronger liability protection and opt to form a C Corporation. While C Corps are more complex to form and operate, they provide the most robust liability protection for the company's shareholders. C Corps must file Articles of Incorporation in the state where you operate.A C Corp is a separate business entity and files a tax return on its profits and losses using IRS Form 1120. But the owners/shareholders are considered corporation employees, receive W-2s and are taxed as individual taxpayers, often called ""double taxation.""However, C Corps can deduct employee-related costs, like wages, health care, retirement plans, operational expenses and fringe benefits like company cars. Ultimately, the current C Corp flat tax rate of 21% may be lower than what sole proprietorships and partnerships pay,In C Corps, the company and its employees each contribute 6.2% of the employee's wages to Social Security and 1.45% to Medicare. Plus, employers contribute to their state-run unemployment insurance funds (SUI).


It's easier to raise money and attract investors since C Corps can offer unlimited numbers of shares and multiple classes of stock.C Corps typically have higher registration costs and more compliance requirements, including adopting bylaws, submitting annual reports, holding shareholder and board of director meetings and more.Related: The 5 Biggest Tax Differences Between an LLC and CorporationThe S Corp tax electionLLCs and C Corps can elect to be taxed as S Corporations, allowing them to divide profits into wages and dividends. While dividend distributions aren't subject to employment taxes, shareholders must be paid reasonable compensation as defined by the IRS. Electing to be taxed as an S Corp can lower your overall tax bill while maintaining liability protection. S Corps use IRS Form 1120-S, and tax returns are due on March 15. To elect S Corp status, you must file IRS Form 2553 no later than March 15 of the tax year the election is to take effect.


However, only American citizens and residents can be S Corp shareholders, and only 100 shares can be issued, so check with your accountant before choosing this path.Get adviceIt's crucial to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the different business structures. For many entrepreneurs, the liability protection and possible tax savings outweigh the added costs and complexity of incorporation.With so much at stake, it's recommended that you consult with your accountant or attorney to help determine which structure is best for your business today and for future growth.

76,Top Solar Energy Trends To Look Out For in 2023 and Beyond,"Jun 1, 2023",Abe Issa,https://www.entrepreneur.com/green-entrepreneur/top-solar-energy-trends-to-look-out-for-in-2023-and-beyond/452357,"
With the latest Energy Information Administration (EIA) report now out, we have a more precise look at renewable energy numbers throughout the United States, including the latest growth. Renewable energy investors and developers should already feel encouraged by the broad goal set for reaching 100% clean electricity by 2035.But there are several important current trends worth keeping an eye on.Renewables did well during the pandemic and are posed for more growthThe EIA reports that through October 2022, renewables grew to provide 22.60% of the total United States electrical energy generation. That included an impressive 14.26% growth compared to previous numbers from a similar timeframe in 2021 and a prediction that renewables will reach at least 25%.



This is good news for solar investors, not only because of the growth rates but because so many different sectors have contributed to it. Growth is coming from state programs and grants, more commercial applications than ever, and global trends pushing toward broader, more affordable solar energy.Solar energy also has more room to grow than wind energy, which has seen similar growth rates but holds nearly 10% of the U.S. market compared to around 5% for solar energy, a gap that offers plenty of potential for future developments.


Related: Why the Tide Is Turning for the Energy SectorWhere businesses will see the most growth this decadeWhat does the EIA report say about support for renewable energy growth in the coming decade? One crucial goal the EIA cites is reaching a global ""net-zero"" state by 2030. This means roughly 61% of the United States' electricity will come from renewables. The EIA also provides several ideas on what kind of energy growth can get us there, which is a roadmap for potential high-growth areas in the coming years.More grants for construction: Government investment in grants for builders and business owners interested in solar are likely to increase in the coming years. But there is a caveat: much of the support for these grants on a federal level currently comes from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The House of Representatives is now in talks about managing the U.S. limit, and one of their demands is cutting many of the programs included in the IRA, which could affect energy investment across the board. If the IRA remains intact, it will be a vast boost for renewable construction. If it is significantly altered, grant programs may largely be left up to the states.Heat pump growth: Heat pumps are one of the most underutilized traditional methods of saving energy and cutting out fuel use for the average home or business in the United States. State regulations, such as those passed by NY and others, will only encourage more adoption of heat pumps in the future. Owners will be happy to go along when the cost benefits compared to fuel become clear, and HVAC installers can expect growing interest over time.Wind energy: While wind energy has narrower investment opportunities than other options — primarily wind farms — especially offshore building — I expect this sector to see significant future growth, including the Midwest and coastal states.Targeted solar installations: Solar is more affordable than in years past and offers significant advantages for businesses, especially when it can capitalize on existing space while cutting costs. Two examples are parking lot installations (which also provide shade for cars) and additional rooftop installations on compatible commercial buildings, as well as new residential interest.Related: Why Investors Should Look at Vietnam's Renewable Energy IndustryPushback from utility companiesThe growth of renewable energy now sees considerable pushback from utility companies, which see solar energy, in particular, as a threat to their profit models. Among other decisions, utility companies are lobbying state governments to retract programs meant to encourage solar construction and kill models that allow solar energy owners to benefit from the excess electricity they produce.


This war has already done immense damage in key solar markets in the United States, including California, where regulators have killed solar-related incentives, and Arizona, where utility companies backed a successful campaign to remove any benefits from rooftop solar and Florida, where utility companies are directly writing legislation and sending it to state congress to limit solar power.The way forward here is unclear. A war between renewable energy and traditional utility companies yields only the worst results for end users, and governments caught up in shifting laws or regulations make the solar investment even more confusing for newcomers. This may be one of the most significant challenges moving forward from 2023.

77,The Rise of the Underdog: Why Holding Groups Won't Work for New Marketing and Media Giants,"Jun 1, 2023",Kristopher Tait,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/why-holding-groups-wont-work-for-new-marketing-and-media/450441,"
Change comes. It may be glacial, or it may come at the speed of a raging forest fire. But it is inevitable.And it could be that such an accelerated upheaval is headed for big marketing and media organizations that service global clients — what we commonly call the holding groups.While I'd never label the existing ""big six"" holding groups as out-of-touch dinosaurs as there's much they do very well and admittedly much we can learn from them, whether they're a template for the future is up for grabs.



And the question is certainly one for now, given that there's a hungry new cohort of expanding marketing and media companies on the horizon. These ""underdogs"" are busy building up their talent, resources and focus. Oh, and they're also landing impressive clients and fees.A changing of the guard may very well be underwayThe huge amount of M&A activity in the past few years reflects this potential ""changing of the guard."" While M&A activity in marketing and media has slowed somewhat this year thanks to uncertainty caused by inflation and the war in Europe, among other things, in the first quarter of 2022, M&A transaction volume rose 19% quarter-over-quarter. It reached a peak in value over the past five quarters.


Stunning numbers, yes. But this also means that the acquisition groundwork has been done for independent agencies, particularly within digital and performance, to prepare to springboard into the big leagues… as long as they called the right shots, of course. I'd number S4Capital, Stagwell Group and PMG among the frontrunners, and I, for one, am excited to see what 2023 brings for each of them.But if the new breed is going to come to the fore (and coming soon), how will they structure and organize themselves in a way which works best for clients, as opposed to what might work best for their own objectives? Because it's most assuredly the client-centric agencies that will win the work and the applause, as time and experience have shown.Related: How to Find International Customers and Partners as Your Expand Your Market 


For starters, clients don't want to deal with complexityYes, clients will always want sophisticated solutions to address the multiple challenges of a complex world, but they want to be able to access agency thinking, tools and talent quickly. These wishes won't be served by navigating numerous agency brands within a holding group and figuring out what each one ""stands for"" and its area of expertise. There's a saying about moving an oil tanker instead of a speed boat… nimble and light wins the speed race.Clients will want one-stop shops that can quickly organize specialist teams to work on their specific solutions without any politics or internal siloes creating an obstruction.To be fair, the holding groups have recognized this new reality. Consolidation has been a trend within the big groups, including WPP, Publicis and Omnicom, while S4Capital wasted no time folding all its acquisitions under the Media.Monks name in 2021.But in the short term, these mergers — as absolutely no one likes to call them — disrupt operations as senior directors vie for top jobs, people look to their earn-outs, offices are relocated and maybe most importantly, different cultures try to align. All this distracts from servicing the client — no ifs, ands or buts about it.


Furthermore, the established networks also have the challenge of wrestling with departments set up to service legacy media, with teams and individuals often managing steady decline. Newer media businesses, on the other hand, can focus solely on digital solutions or build robust omnichannel teams from the start.Read More: AI Is Considered the ""Wild West"" — Here's How Marketers Can Rein It In and Ensure Ethical UseHerald the super-adaptoidThe future looks increasingly like one super-adaptive, agile agency that can operate at scale and is simultaneously equipped with best-in-breed tech stacks, an agency that can dial resources up and down as needed with flexibility woven into its fabric. The new generation will also wield the power of complementary AI and Machine Learning tools that remove a lot of the repetitive ""grunt work"" from operational implementation.Certainly, size, as measured by staff numbers or by ""buying power,"" is no barrier to winning the biggest client accounts. Just look at how independent media agency PMG outpaced holding company agency brands to carry off Nike's North American prize, ultimately being named integrated media agency of record and global digital capabilities partner. Big news. Big shoes (to fill).


Automation will give us the ability to increase particular efficiencies. Still, it's important to remember that we're service- and people- companies rather than tech businesses (perhaps the ones that adopt a tech mindset will flourish). All agencies contain valuable talent — it's just a question of how best to deploy that talent. Perhaps it's a matter of pulling talent from across departments and even locations to answer a brief or allowing talent — the freedom, even — to jump in and out of projects. Making the best use of employee expertise will be a challenge for all agencies, but as an industry, we're always finding new ways to stretch and excite our teams.Undoubtedly, we'll continue to witness disruption in the agency landscape over the next few years, and there is a race to see whether the agency holding groups can evolve quicker before the underdogs can muscle up enough to grab more of their lunch.

78,3 Automated Lead Generation Strategies To Implement In Your Sales Process,"May 31, 2023",Lewis Schenk,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-lead-generating-strategies-to-implement-in-your-sales/452215,"
As one of my first mentors said: ""In business, sales solves all."" This reigns true in the majority of cases. When you make a sale, you can re-invest that into a new employee, advertising campaign, software, marketing, etc. You get the point. The problem with lead generation and sales for most SMEs, however, is that they depend solely on one channel — which, more often than not, is inbound leads or referrals.While these are arguably the best forms of lead generation, as the prospect is ""warm"" & they already know, like and trust you, these methods are the least scalable. Why? Because you're putting your fate in other people's hands and not taking a proactive approach to growth.Now more than ever, it is essential to diversify your approach to lead generation, leveraging different strategies that work best for your business and target market. In this article, I'll break down three automated outbound lead generation strategies we use with great success and how you can use them to drum up more business and, more importantly, epic client case studies.



Related: 5 Ways Businesses Can Get Traffic and Generate Leads1. Cold emailWith advertising costs on the rise, companies are looking for more cost-effective ways to generate attention and leads. Now, before you think, ""Cold emails are for spammers and scammers,"" — please read this with an open mind. A cold email has become one of the hottest topics in the B2B marketing space, with many new tech and SaaS startups emerging in the cold email automation space to fill these needs.


All seasoned cold emailers understand that it provides unparalleled scalability for the cost. That said, don't expect to start emailing today and drumming up new business immediately. It takes time to tweak, refine and improve upon your process. It took us four months of trial and error before we found an email that really hit the mark.And just a word of warning — no matter what, you will get people that dislike your email and will respond with criticism. Understanding that this is part of the game will help you persevere and succeed. The best resources I've come across and used to learn the A-Z of cold email are Alex Berman's YouTube channel. Some baseline metrics to aim for in your B2B cold email campaigns are a 75% open rate, 10% reply rate and 2.5% meeting book rate. Review your cold emails every week to ensure you're constantly improving and hitting these baseline numbers.2. LinkedIn outboundTo be completely honest, I slept on LinkedIn for a long time. While it isn't my preferred place to consume content, it has been tremendous for us in terms of lead generation. It also has some incredible automation abilities and will produce epic results when done right.Where I see most people go wrong on LinkedIn is primarily a basic lack of understanding of people. Who in their right mind will respond to a 7-paragraph, 800-word introductory message? Don't worry, at some stage, pretty much everyone has been there (myself included).


Why I believe LinkedIn is far superior to other social networks for B2B lead generation is 3-fold.Firstly, it's a business platform. People expect to be doing business there. Secondly, it has a sales navigator tool. A way to get directly into people's inboxes without even connecting. Thirdly, it has a lot of automation capability — we use a Walaaxy for this.This allows you to import a list of your ideal customers automatically and then automatically connect with them, sending them an invitation message and even a follow-up message sequence, which you can use to explore potential meetings or synergies. Again, the messaging sequence here needs to be short and sweet — as I mentioned, there's nothing worse than an unsolicited four paragraphs from a stranger trying to get you onto their ""free webinar.""Related: How to Get High Quality Leads From LinkedIn At No Cost


3. Twitter outboundTwitter has quickly become my favorite social media platform — it is a no-BS place, and people don't have time for fluff. With that in mind, that's why it's such a fun platform to try and crack the challenge of outbound. It's not uncommon for people to screenshot a bad DM they receive and shamelessly post it to their thousands of followers, causing public embarrassment to the person who sent the DM.That's why it's so challenging. You need a unique approach. The approach that we have used, which works incredibly well, is a purely value-based message. We essentially offer our services for free — no strings attached. Doing so builds a relationship, an audience and a network of influential people. Believe me, when I say you will be shocked at the kind of connections and relationships you can build. I was even shocked at how I immediately received referrals and people wanting to do more business with us.Final thoughtsIf I haven't convinced you yet to implement these strategies, the fact that it costs me five times less to acquire a customer with these strategies compared to paid advertising says everything you need to know.Forget manually sending 100 emails, DM's, and messages per day. Leverage automation to do the heavy lifting for you, then take over to complete the process. Remember always to constantly tweak and optimize your processes to make micro-improvements throughout all stages of your sales process. 


If you implement all these strategies effectively, watch your pipeline and sales skyrocket this year.

79,How to Protect Your Reputation by Managing Online Reviews,"May 31, 2023",Adam Petrilli,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-protect-your-law-firms-public-perception-by/452425,"
In today's digital landscape, choosing a law firm is largely influenced by online reviews. For better or worse, when prospective clients begin their search for a law firm these days, they usually start with a search engine.And while that may be convenient for them, it opens the door for a slew of biased or untrue opinions that can put your practice on the defensive.That's why it's never been more important to evaluate and manage your firm's Google search footprint and your online reputation. Though you may be aware of your reputational standing in the real world and the legal community that sees your work, crafting a positive image for your practice takes a different type of awareness — and approach. While this may take an upfront investment, it's well worth the time and money to ensure new clients can find your firm and entrust their case and legal needs to your team.



As a digital marketing and online reputation expert, I'm well aware of the power an online reputation can have on an attorney's reach, revenue and long-term growth. To that end, I'd like to share a few best practices for managing law firm reviews and protecting your firm's reputation. These crucial behaviors can help you control the online narrative while focusing on the work that truly matters.Related: Why Your Company's Online Reputation Matters


Determine where you standBefore making any changes to your online reputation, you need to determine where your law firm currently stands on the web. It helps to picture yourself as the average client in need of what you offer and create a list of search terms or keywords relevant to what they need and to your firm. It can help to start your search in incognito mode to ensure your previous search history doesn't influence your results.Begin compiling your results into a spreadsheet, pulling from the wide range of review sites as well as any third-party blogs, articles, profiles and other online elements (good, bad and neutral) you may find. This database will help paint a bigger picture of your online reputation and what platforms or areas may need more attention.Related: How to Build a Reputation That Will Become a Real Asset for YouNote repeat issues As you compile your results, take note of issues that crop up repeatedly. While some law firm reviews may be from difficult clients whose experience does not accurately represent your firm or your team, certain repeat problems can shine a light on issues that can be easily addressed and shored up as needed.


When you find negative reviews, take care to respond publicly and empathetically. Your response to each negative comment will remain online and linked to the original negative review, providing balance when future prospective clients are reading reviews and demonstrating that your firm takes client feedback seriously.Related: 7 Ways to Recover After a Reputation CrisisEngage with the positiveWhile responding to negative reviews — politely and apologetically, of course — is key to mitigating their impact on your online image, just as important is replying to positive reviews. As with negative reviews, your responses remain linked to the original posts and provide an easy but fairly powerful opportunity to bolster your online cred.When replying to positive feedback, ensure each response is personalized rather than issuing a boilerplate reply template. Robotic replies can often hurt authenticity and sometimes undermine your efforts altogether. You may also consider reaching out to individual reviewers and asking permission to share their positive feedback. Direct quotes from satisfied clients can be shared and utilized in various ways, including on your website, in email campaigns and across other aspects of your firm's outreach strategy.


Related: 3 Tips for Managing Your Business' Reputation Via Social MediaCreate a review pipelineOnce you've addressed existing reviews affecting your firm's brand online, you can begin gathering new reviews. Encouraging and sometimes even incentivizing client reviews (strategically, of course) can generate activity that catches Google's attention and push your firm to the top of organic results pages. In some cases, this increased positivity can help push negative feedback off of page one. No matter what, don't attempt to create false reviews with accounts of your own. Such black hat techniques can often create red flags that ultimately do more damage than good.Automated email drip campaigns can provide an excellent opportunity to encourage happy clients to review your firm online. Updating your website with easy-to-find links directing clients to feedback surveys can also be an effective way to solicit positive feedback. These outlets can provide quotes you can use in both organic and paid marketing campaigns.Related: The Relationship Between Reputation and Brand


Branch out to new platformsA major step in managing your online reputation is branching out to new digital platforms. If your firm isn't active on social media, consider creating accounts and posting regularly. You don't need to jump on every new app. Instead, focus on the platforms that make sense for your law firm, such as LinkedIn. There, you're better equipped to control the narrative and present positive messaging.It can also help to work with a public relations expert with the focus, skillset and media relationships to incorporate mentions of your law firm's successes into high-authority online news outlets, local blogs and other high-traffic venues. Even short, relevant blog posts on your own website can help promote your practice and increase client trust in your firm. Over time, expanding to social media and other online outlets can boost your placement in search engine results while promoting your law firm where it generates the best results.

In only six months, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has surged significantly, climbing from 2.65% to 3.17%. This substantial increase of 0.52% has undoubtedly caused concern for real estate investors. However, amidst the changing landscape, it is important to remain optimistic as there are still viable opportunities within the market waiting to be explored.The sudden spike in interest rates has undoubtedly created a challenging environment for those involved in real estate investment. Nevertheless, it is crucial not to succumb to worry as the market presents avenues for potential gains. Despite the rising borrowing costs, strategic and astute investors can adapt to these changes and uncover untapped prospects that align with their investment goals.Related: How to Invest In Real Estate Amid High Interest Rates and Inflation



1. Keep your eye on the long-term prizeThe rising interest rates may make it more difficult to purchase property in the short term, but remember the long game. Real estate is an investment that can appreciate over time, and the key is to make smart purchases that will hold their value.Instead of buying a fixer-upper that may require expensive repairs, consider investing in a property already in good condition and with growth potential.


2. Consider alternative financing optionsWith the rise in interest rates, traditional mortgages seem less appealing to some. However, it is worthwhile to consider alternative financing options. One such option is hard money loans, short-term loans secured by the purchased property. While these loans usually have higher interest rates, they offer greater flexibility and are often easier to obtain.Hard money loans can benefit those looking to make a quick purchase or who need help meeting traditional lending requirements. By using the property as collateral, the lender takes on less risk, making the loan easier to obtain. Additionally, hard money loans can allow for more flexibility in purchasing, making them a valuable tool for real estate investors looking to act quickly on a good opportunity. Though they come with a higher price tag, hard money loans can be an attractive financing option in certain situations.Related: How Does Inflation Affect Real Estate? Here's What You Need to Know.3. Focus on up-and-coming neighborhoodsThe adage ""location, location, location"" still holds regarding real estate. Although some parts might be unaffordable due to increasing interest rates, several good neighborhoods still need to be explored. As a prospective homebuyer, focusing on areas experiencing renovation projects with excellent educational institutions conveniently located near public transportation is crucial.


When searching for a neighborhood, keep in mind that revitalization efforts can have a significant impact on property values. These areas often attract new businesses, increased foot traffic and community events. Furthermore, families with children should prioritize areas with reputable schools, as education quality can affect property prices. Lastly, being close to public transportation is ideal for those who rely on it for work or leisure activities. This not only saves time and money but can also increase the accessibility of the area to potential buyers.4. Diversify your portfolioDiversification is a vital aspect of achieving success in real estate investing. Although investing in a single property can be alluring, spreading investments across various properties and neighborhoods can help reduce the risk of loss. It's crucial to explore different types of real estate investments, such as commercial or multifamily properties, and not limit oneself to only one variety.Investors should be bold in taking risks in exploring alternative types of real estate investments. Rather than relying on a single property, investors should consider diversifying their portfolio to include a range of assets. Commercial or multifamily properties, for instance, are excellent options for those looking to diversify their investments.Related: The Real-Estate Game Is Changing Fast. Are You Ready to Win?


5. Take advantage of low inventoryRising interest rates can affect confident prospective homebuyers, leading to a decline in the number of available properties. However, this situation can present an advantage for real estate investors. With decreased market competition, investors may uncover valuable opportunities to acquire previously acquired properties beyond their financial reach. The reduced buyer demand creates a favorable environment for investors to find lucrative deals and expand their portfolios.The increase in interest rates has the potential to deter potential homebuyers, resulting in a limited supply of homes for sale. Nonetheless, this circumstance can benefit those involved in real estate investment. The decreased market competition opens avenues for investors to secure properties at favorable prices, which were previously unattainable. As buyers become scarce, investorsIn conclusion, while rising interest rates may pose challenges for real estate investors, there are still opportunities in the market. You can adapt and thrive in a changing market by keeping a long-term perspective, exploring alternative financing options, focusing on up-and-coming neighborhoods, diversifying your portfolio, taking advantage of low inventory and maintaining a sense of humor. Remember, real estate investing is a journey, and with the right strategies and mindset, you can navigate the challenges and continue to find success. So stay proactive, stay informed and keep investing with confidence.

83,Why Businesses Fail to Build a Sustainable Growth Model With Satellite Technologies,"May 26, 2023",Rim Elijah,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/why-businesses-are-failing-to-build-a-sustainable-growth/452154,"
With around 5,000 active satellites orbiting Earth, sattech propels modern agriculture, telecommunications, environmental monitoring and national security. Recent advancements like commercialized SAR technology, improved AI and data analytics fuel the global satellite data services market's 19.5% annual growth.However, this growth remains suboptimal for many small and medium-sized businesses, which flock to the enticing sattech market for revenue and innovation but struggle to unleash its full potential.Understanding the challengesTo create a sustainable growth model in the sattech market, it is crucial to understand the industry challenges businesses often face. One primary obstacle is the allure of short-term gains over long-term value creation. Reselling sattech data or analytics can provide immediate profits, but it lacks the long-lasting impact of creating tailored solutions that address clients' specific needs. By focusing on solving clients' problems, businesses can foster lasting relationships and ensure a sustainable growth trajectory.



Another challenge lies in the insufficient understanding of clients' needs. Without a deep comprehension of their clients' industries, objectives and pain points, businesses may struggle to develop optimal sattech solutions. This lack of insight can lead to missed opportunities and a failure to capitalize on the full potential of satellite technology.The increasing availability of sattech data and analytics has also resulted in its commoditization. As satellite data becomes more accessible, price erosion becomes a real concern for businesses that rely on reselling models. In such a landscape, differentiating through value-added services, such as technical support, market insights and consulting, becomes vital for long-term success.


Industry players like Planet, Orbital Insight and EOS Data Analytics have set the bar high by shaping the satellite data market with innovative analytics algorithms. However, their partners often need help in understanding the intricacies of these sophisticated solutions when they attempt to resell the data and products. Success in the sattech market demands a deep comprehension of the target audience's challenges, whether it is addressing the skepticism of Argentine farmers towards new technologies, or easing the concerns of African consulting companies who are unsure about the return on investment when adopting cutting-edge satellite data analytics.Related: Can Satellite Imagery Help Bridge the Gap of Food Security?Investing in innovation and differentiationIn the rapidly evolving sattech landscape, investing in innovation is paramount for businesses to maintain a competitive edge and adapt to changing market demands. Companies that rely solely on reselling sattech data often allocate insufficient resources to research and development, consequently limiting their ability to create new, value-added offerings that cater to emerging needs and opportunities. By prioritizing innovation, businesses can not only enhance their existing solutions but also identify new ways to serve their clients, ensuring long-term sustainability.Differentiation through value-added services is another crucial aspect of building a sustainable growth model with sattech. As satellite data becomes increasingly commoditized, businesses must set themselves apart by offering more than their technological partner's platform or satellite images. Addressing local problems in the region, providing actionable insights and delivering tailored consulting services can significantly increase the value proposition for clients. In doing so, businesses can foster deeper relationships and improve customer retention, contributing to their ongoing success.Innovation in the sattech industry typically seems daunting for small and medium businesses, but there are ample opportunities to innovate in applying these technologies to specific regions and sectors. From identifying prime locations for mining to tracking carbon footprints, finding a niche and validating demand is vital for sustainability. Furthermore, businesses must resist the temptation to assume that sattech's prowess will sell itself. Regardless of the market, customers want to be convinced that the product or service offered is user-friendly and beneficial. By emphasizing on the ease of use and tangible advantages, businesses can differentiate themselves and foster long-term growth.


Related: What Agribusinesses Should Do To Profit From Modern-Day Satellite Technologies?Leveraging partnerships both globally and locallyStrategic partnerships and collaboration play a vital role in building a sustainable business growth model with sattech. Forming alliances with other players in the sattech ecosystem can enable businesses to access complementary skills, technologies and resources, enhancing their ability to create tailored solutions for clients. Collaboration helps businesses stay abreast of industry trends and leverage collective expertise for better problem-solving.Examining case studies of successful sattech integration can provide valuable insights into best practices and strategies. By analyzing the key factors that contributed to these companies' success, other businesses can learn from their approach and apply similar tactics to their own operations, ultimately driving growth and long-term sustainability.The significance of partnerships cannot be overstated, as many current leaders in the sattech industry owe their success to collaborations with technological partners, such as satellite assembly, rocket launching or geo-intelligence companies. Newcomers in the industry can take heart in knowing that they can rely on the support of established technological businesses. Success in the sattech market is a collective endeavor, contingent upon effective communication and collaboration among all players, fostering a shared vision and commitment to progress.


Related: 6 Tips to Drive Sustainable Business GrowthBottom line: Now is the timeTo achieve sustainable growth in sattech, businesses must pivot from reselling to crafting client-centric solutions. Through innovation, differentiation and strategic partnerships, they can harness satellite technology's potential and gain a lasting competitive edge. There is no better time than now for businesses to embrace change and secure long-term success in the dynamic sattech industry.

84,7 Essential Questions to Ask Yourself Before Starting a Franchise,"May 25, 2023",David Busker,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/8-essential-questions-to-ask-yourself-before-starting-a/450081,"
More people than ever are curious about starting a franchise business. The potential rewards seem obvious, but the risks also seem high. Even more than risk and reward, starting a franchise requires a hard look in the mirror to decide if you really have the makeup to become an entrepreneur.Here are seven questions you should ask yourself before starting a franchise business.Related: 7 Things You Need to Know Before Becoming a Franchise Owner1. Do I have a future vision?To take action and start a franchise, you need to understand your why, not necessarily the widget. Do you have a future vision of your life you're trying to achieve? Think of that as the destination and the franchise as the car — the vehicle to help you get to the destination.



A clear future vision should include your involvement in the business, your career and the lifestyle you visualize for yourself. This will help you select the right franchise model that fits this vision.2. Do I have confidence, grit, determination and resilience?Every business owner in America had to deal with the impact of Covid-19. There will be unknown future obstacles when you start a franchise.To move forward, you must bridge uncertainty with an emotional commitment and confidence to overcome obstacles. You must also have the grit and resilience to see through difficult periods. A franchise can help you launch more quickly than starting a business from scratch and will help you navigate any difficulties through best practices from a network of fellow franchise owners.


3. Should I go it alone or engage a franchise consultant?Like shopping for a house, you can certainly find franchise opportunities on the internet. However, it's a noisy environment with thousands of brands — and like everything else, some are good and some are bad. And no franchise brand shows its business model on its website, so you're drawing conclusions purely from a consumer viewpoint.You cannot easily find newer emerging brands on the internet and can waste tons of time investigating brands only to find out they're not a fit. A franchise consultant, like a good financial advisor, will reverse this process and start with you and your goals, help you set your criteria and only then match you with franchise brands that fit. They then will guide you through the investigation with education and resources.Related: How to Narrow Down Thousands of Franchises to Find the One That's Right for You4. Do I have the capital to start a franchise?You should carefully consider your financial ability when starting a franchise. To understand the specific capital requirements for any particular franchise, you can consult Item 7 of the Franchise Disclosure Document, which details the Estimated Initial Investment. These are based on actual franchises and tend to be very accurate. However, make sure to build your own estimates, as these line items can vary significantly between franchisees.While there are always exceptions, investment ranges can commonly be broken down into three categories. These include self-employment or work-from-home models; scalable executive service models; and semi-absentee or semi-passive models:Self-employment or work-from-home models with few or no employees that do not require customer-facing real estate generally range from $75,000 to $150,000 in total investment per territory or unit.More scalable, equipment-intensive service brands that do not require customer-facing real estate tend to range from $100,000 to $350,000 per territory or unit.Brick-and-mortar location-based franchises require more real estate investment but tend to be more semi-absentee and can range from $250,000 to $1 million or more per unit.5. How will I finance the franchise?There are many options to help you finance your new franchise. If you have a former 401(k) or IRA, you can roll over a portion of your retirement account balances in your new business' stock tax-free. Candidates also use personal loans, such as a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a securities-backed portfolio loan, which have the lowest debt costs and easiest access to capital.


You can also obtain an SBA-guaranteed bank loan, which is a popular option. Many franchisors will have prearranged financing with preferred vendors. Regardless of your financing choice, it is important to consider it ahead of time to make sure your business and personal needs are covered during your business launch.6. What franchise industry is right for me?Many of my candidates are looking for a business they're passionate about. Of course, you need to believe in your product or service, but it doesn't need to be your hobby. It is the business model that needs to fit. For example, I owned a fitness franchise. While I'm not a fitness junkie, the business model fit and seeing the joy in our clients transforming their health was very gratifying.Going through a deliberate process of investigating business models that fit your criteria and comparing them with the help of an experienced consultant is often the best way to find the right industry. By focusing on the business model and your role as a franchise owner, you will find the industry can be a secondary criterion.Related: Check Out the Fastest-Growing Franchises In 20237. Do I believe in continuous improvement or ""if it isn't broken, don't fix it?""If you have a more reactive style, franchise ownership is likely not for you. Owning a franchise requires you to constantly look at the business with an eye toward continuous improvement — making each process, such as sales, marketing, operations or customer service, continuously better for your customers. Having a proactive approach versus a reactive approach is critical to success.While there are many considerations in starting a new business, fundamentally it is an emotional decision that starts with you doing some self-reflection. Asking yourself the hard questions will let you know if you're emotionally ready to take the next step.


If you're not ready, consider what changes or milestones in your life need to be achieved so you're ready when the time comes. If you find you are excited and ready to move forward, seek out the resources needed to explore franchising and commit to follow through the process. This will bring you the confidence you need to find success.

85,How Dairy Farming Made Me a Better Tech Entrepreneur,"May 24, 2023",Justin Vandehey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/3-ways-dairy-farming-made-me-a-better-entrepreneur/451916,"
For more than 60 years, my family has owned and operated a mid-sized dairy farm in Junction City, Wisconsin. I spent many of my formative years at the barn working alongside my grandparents, parents, uncles, aunts and cousins milking, ""sweeping in"" and making hay. And while I'm sure I caused them more work and stress from having to fix my daily mistakes, the experience working on that farm influenced how I've approached entrepreneurship and made me a better technology company founder.It's well known that farm life is insanely hard work, both physically and mentally (which is why I got a marketing degree). However, beyond grit and determination, there were several less obvious lessons I learned from my family during my childhood about what it takes to own and operate a successful venture.These are a few of the lessons I learned and how working on a dairy farm made me a better tech entrepreneur.Related: The 8 Lessons Entrepreneurs Could Learn From FarmersMake hay while the sun shinesThere is no way (yet) to control the weather. Meteorologists can predict it, and we can plan for it, but we can't dictate when and how much it rains. Farmers never receive ""perfect circumstances,"" especially in the unpredictable weather conditions of the Midwest. Farmers often have a very narrow window in which they can plant and harvest crops throughout the summer months, without any real control over what the weather will bring them. The expression, ""You need to make hay when the sun shines,"" still holds true to this day and is equally relevant to building a software company.



As a tech entrepreneur, I've come to accept that you'll never own or control all of the market conditions. Oftentimes, you'll need to adapt or adjust to the macro-environment to make your business work. The benefit of doing this with software, of course, is that you don't have the machinery or livestock that you need to pivot with (although aligning teams around a new strategic direction, particularly the larger you are, can feel like herding cattle).At my last company, Disco, we had a great product that solved a problem for customers; However, for almost three years, the market viewed it as a ""nice-to-have."" The dynamics of the market needed to change and mature in order for the narrative around Disco to become necessary for business operations.There were two ""hay-making"" windows for Disco. First, when platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams began building out their ecosystems, we were able to launch our app alongside that momentum to accelerate our initial growth, signal market interest and raise capital. Second, when Covid and remote work became mandatory, our value proposition around building culture across a distributed workforce was table stakes. We were able to double our revenues in a 6-month stretch, secure a Series A term sheet and have a great outcome in selling the company to Culture Amp.Although the conditions might not always be ideal for your venture, if you have a good product that solves a customer problem, a committed team and the revenues to sustain your business and support, be patient and know that the weather can change at any point. And when it does, make hay.


Related: What the American Farm Can Teach Business Leaders About 'Sowing' SuccessOperate on the horizonsAI and automation are improving efficiencies across every industry, farming included. We've seen the evolution of automated milking machines, and more recently, the introduction of autonomous farming equipment and IoT devices to monitor crop and animal health to optimize yield with data. These innovations are exciting, but the reality is that farmers need to be selective with these investments to ensure they can sustain their daily operations and keep the cream flowing.What I observed was how our family tested new concepts, all while minimizing capital outlay and disrupting daily operations. They approached innovation through creative and strategic financing to pilot hardware and new workflows, and they isolated tests to smaller portions of the farming operation before investing more capital. Additionally, they'd occasionally hire less expensive help (like a pudgy kid with a bad bowl cut, ahem, yours truly) to do the jobs that could be put on auto-pilot. This was my first exposure to the practice of Horizon Planning, where projects were resourced and staged according to experience and skill and during times that would minimize disruption to our cash cows.While building my last company, we were faced with similar opportunities and questions around how, where and when to innovate. We were often forced to evaluate the tradeoffs of paying down technical debt or building a boring but crucial HR systems integration versus developing a feature like rewards that we knew would delight our customers.


By splitting our team and product priorities into horizons, as well as separating a smaller group to focus on ""delighter features,"" we could keep our operation going, pay down our technical debt and more cost-effectively deploy resources and capital on tasks that required less mindshare from our more senior engineers.Related: I've Been a Tech Entrepreneur for Over 20 Years — Here Are 5 Key Lessons I've Learned Along the WayMath and margins matterImagine Leonardo DiCaprio from The Wolf of Wall Street walking into his office with Dickies pants and boots. Farmers are basically day traders with less cocaine and hair gel. The financial models involved in understanding agricultural derivatives are no joke. Not only do farmers need to endure the physical aspects of their job, but in most cases, they're playing the role of part-time stockbroker.I observed my family actively monitor the market rates for milk to understand their margin and calculate COGS based on the inputs from feed prices, as well as improved operational efficiencies from investments in technologies that could help the farm scale. It taught me to look at a balance sheet and the importance of cash burn. I also learned how critical it was to stay informed of market conditions and how they impacted commodities, and more specifically, how to use tax, subsidies and legislation to help your company survive.


At Disco, these observations and lessons helped us run an incredibly lean operation while making the company profitable. This is rare for a young, growing software business, and it's ultimately the reason it was able to survive dry periods when growth stalled.There are many other reasons I'm grateful for the farming experience — dealing with ambiguity (animals are predictably unpredictable), overcoming a fear of heights and the joy of working toward creating a product that does a body good.While these baby-soft hands have softened over time, I'm grateful for how much dairy farming prepared me to be a technology entrepreneur. But more than anything, it taught me how fortunate I was to have that time and those lessons with my family. And for the record, I'm confident the cows are happier in California than in Wisconsin. Just ask them in January.

86,Boldness Is Key When It Comes to Starting a Business — Here Are 5 Ways to Boldly Launch Yours,"May 24, 2023",Leigh Burgess,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-launch-your-business-with-boldness-and-confidence/451023,"
Launching a business requires a lot of hard work and dedication. However, sometimes it takes more than that to make your business successful. Boldness is key when it comes to launching a company, and being able to make pragmatic choices can set you apart from your competitors.The first step towards launching a business is taking the bold step to start something new. As a leader, stepping out of your comfort zone is not an easy task, but it is the first essential step on the journey to success. If you are planning to launch your business, it's essential to stand out from the mainstream and think outside the box. Boldness not only signifies courage, but it also demonstrates the determination to change the pattern.Let's talk about five ways to launch a business with boldness and set yourself apart from the pack.Related: 5 Ways Business Owners Can Slay Fear and Be Bold1. Embrace creativityOne way to launch a business with boldness is to embrace creativity. Don't be afraid to think outside the box when it comes to your business plans. Consider unique marketing strategies, unconventional advertising techniques or even a daring company name. Creativity can be key to setting yourself apart from your competition and gaining attention. Let the ideas flow, but know that not every idea is a good idea.



Your approach to business can set you apart from competitors, so it's crucial to have an open mind when trying to come up with innovative business ideas. Embrace your creativity, and explore different options before embarking on a new business. You may be unique in ways that can attract a new audience or create an entirely new market. The key to success in entrepreneurship is putting in the effort, and creativity goes a long way in taking your business to the next level.2. Take growth-mindset-driven risksTaking calculated risks is another way to launch a business with boldness. Don't always follow the conventional path, but examine a radical approach and research all the possible outcomes. You may find that taking a bit of a risk can be greatly rewarding in the end. This is the essence of boldness — not knowing if it will work but knowing that you did everything possible for it to be successful and to learn from the attempt, even if it fails.Taking risks is essential when starting a business because growth rarely comes without risk. While there's no guarantee that doing anything in business will work, taking risks and making calculated decisions is one of the most effective ways to grow. The chances of success are significantly higher when we take calculated risks and learn from our failures. For example, if you're considering a particular strategy or partnership that could make or break your business, you need to have the courage to move forward and see what comes out of it.3. Find your nicheOne of the biggest mistakes new business owners make is attempting to tackle a broad market. Finding a specific niche in your overall industry might seem limiting, but it can allow you to become an expert in that area. Your passion for that niche will draw in customers, and your unique skills will make you stand out. You do not and cannot be everything to everyone.


Your business's market can be broader and more relaxed at first to enable you to gain some foothold; you may concentrate on a small area that's more likely to react positively to your product or service. Once you get your foothold, you'll gradually increase your customer base. If you want to achieve long-term success, your niche or focus market should be unique and serve a purpose.Related: 6 Key Things to Keep in Mind Before You Launch Your Business4. Stay public and engagedBold companies aren't afraid to be present and visible to the public. Using social media is an excellent way to stay publicly involved with your audience. Building and targeting a relevant audience will require engagement. Not only will it help in gaining customers, but it can create relationships and enable you to keep learning from your market. Be consistent in your posting, and be authentic to your brand.It is vital for entrepreneurs to be public, although we may like to be private when launching a business. Entrepreneurs can stay active on social media and participate in speaking engagements, local business events and other local marketing activities to gain more awareness and enable their followers to get to know them better. Promote your business whenever you can, and the attention you garner could eventually result in organic searches.


5. Believe in yourselfLast but not least, the most important key to launching a business with boldness is to believe in yourself. Individuals who are too hesitant may not have the courage to push forward with their idea. You may face difficult times, pressure and possible rejections. You must have faith in yourself and the vision for your business. There will be noise when you are starting out — be sure to have strategies you can use to mute the negative and filter the essential learnings to strengthen your confidence and success.When starting a business, it's essential to remember that success takes time. There will be setbacks, roadblocks, hurdles and times when things don't go as planned. But don't give up. Believe that your hard work is worth it. Always remain focused on your goals, and have belief in yourself. You have to put in the work to succeed, so stay positive, be patient, and believe in your business — and the success will come.When launching a business, taking chances and believing in yourself can help you get ahead. It's important to embrace creativity, take risks, find your niche, stay public and believe that your business is worth all of the hard work you're putting in. Remember that success does not come overnight, but your determined and calculated boldness will take you there!Related: The Importance of Having Courage

87,How Ecommerce And Tech Companies Can Learn From Each Other,"May 23, 2023",Patrick Frank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/ecommerce-and-tech-companies-have-much-to-learn-from-each/451907,"
There are lessons to learn every day in the business world. Often, we find ourselves looking to companies in our industry or vertical for winning examples and strategies. This is a great habit, but sometimes you have to look beyond the familiar to find new unique approaches to growth that you can adopt.As someone who wears many hats and has been part of all different types of online startups — from SaaS healthcare platforms to an ecommerce brand that makes wild pool floats, consumer real estate market places and even card games — I have come to realize that everything and everyone has something to learn from each other.Nowhere is this truer than in the sometimes disparate worlds of SaaS (software as a service), technology companies, and direct-to-consumer ecommerce companies. Besides the key differences between software and physical products, the way these companies operate can be opposites. Sometimes you need a foot in both worlds to realize how much two industries must learn from one another.



Building brand loyaltyEcommerce has traditionally been hyper-focused on building brand loyalty as a means to grow. This should always be a priority, with a reported 72% of global customers saying they feel loyalty toward at least one brand or company. These businesses build loyalty with referral programs, freebies, rewards, stellar customer service and all-around great engagement. While each of these perks can apply to tech companies, too, building brand loyalty within SaaS tends to happen more organically through product innovation and efficiencies.The first lesson tech can learn from ecommerce is that intentionally building a brand to earn loyal SaaS subscribers is critical for retention. That means innovating specifically with user feedback in mind, which can be even more effective when customers and clients are closely involved in the personalization of a platform. That way, these customers graduate from passive users to being completely dependent on what you have built for them.


In SaaS, there has been a movement to open development, which allows users to determine the next best features that should be created. This builds a brand and loyalty, as they feel part of what you are building and stick around to see their ideas come to life. Put a cherry on top, and don't be afraid to throw the odd piece of free merch for great product feedback. On the flip side, ecommerce can learn from its tech counterpart to branch out from the brand loyalty route and adapt its core products to meet market needs.Related: How This New Style of E-Commerce Transforms Online BusinessScaling upWhen we hear about tech companies rapidly scaling, it's often due to Moore's law of network effects — which refers to when more usage lends itself to a better overall experience and greater value for all users. In other words, the more players, the more winners. This allows tech companies to receive free, organic advertising when active customers bring more users to the platform.In contrast, when you look at ecommerce companies, they have historically scaled through advertising campaigns. That's where the next lesson comes in: ecommerce companies need to learn how to better leverage outside resources. This includes partnerships with influencers, ambassador deals, capitalizing on positive word-of-mouth chatter, and prioritizing organic sales through referrals.


It's easy to get stuck in a digital bubble with ecommerce, where blasting out digital ads and social media promotions en masse into the ether feels like the ceiling. But ecommerce companies thrive when the digital world meets the real, and they can learn a lot from the time and attention tech companies give to their users.Related: 5 Dos and Don'ts of Scaling Your Tech Startup on a BudgetEfficiencyEvery business strives for efficiency, but ecommerce can teach tech companies to be especially lean rather than overly focused on headcount and headlines. For example, ecommerce brands use various tools to outsource human needs to help their companies scale faster. Examples include software platforms for inventory management, data entry, automation, virtual assistants, analytics add-ons, remote website developers, AI customer service and much more.Ecommerce companies don't run day-to-day operations the same way your typical brick-and-mortar store would, meaning efficiency isn't a preference but a necessity. Tech companies should learn to leverage their own internal tech stack of partners — your software and technologies needed to run your platform — which can also turn into a referral network.


SaaS has been affected by the recent shift in the market demanding massive cost-cutting, leading to recent layoffs with companies getting more capital-efficient and profit-focused rather than growth at all costs. Ecommerce tends to stick to the basics and is naturally required to be profitable to operate. This is crucial now that the market has shifted, and all eyes are on tech companies' financials, not just their growth.Related: Hack Your SaaS Growth With These 3 Easy StrategiesSynergistic teamsUltimately, it still comes down to the people when we put aside the tech logistics and business jargon. Yes, we may be reading headlines of AI and automation getting better and more intelligent by the day, but there are no signs of it replacing the core roles just yet. Both ecommerce and technology companies need to leverage the strength of a synergistic and aligned team that can move fast, efficiently, and innovate. The founder's role should always be to steer the ship in the right direction, keep it on course, promote the company, and gain notability.If there's one thing I've learned, scaling up doesn't happen when you stick too close to the book. Think outside the box, operate like every dollar spent comes from your life savings, and it will push you to get scrappy and force innovation. Some of our most valuable lessons can be right in front of us, primed and ready to be applied in a whole new business setting waiting for lift-off.

89,How to Manage Growth in a Remote Startup,"May 19, 2023",Judah Longgrear,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-manage-growth-in-a-remote-startup/451738,"
Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, remote work has become a popular option for businesses looking to scale quickly and efficiently. Startups, in particular, have embraced the flexibility of remote work as a way to reduce overhead costs and tap into a global talent pool. This special advantage has potentially accelerated growth and innovation for hundreds of startups worldwide.With teams now spread across different locations, company culture, communication, a sense of community, collaboration and productivity are more critical than ever before. This long-distance relationship requires a different approach to management, which several startups struggle to navigate.To survive as a potential growth starter, remote work needs systems and processes that account for the unique challenges of a remote environment and provide a roadmap for achieving growth and success.



Related: 5 Ways to Enhance Remote Company CultureBuild a remote-first cultureLoneliness is the second biggest struggle remote workers face, making it crucial for startups to foster a sense of connection, community and belonging among employees working in isolation.


Startups need to find ways to bring their team members together, despite the physical distance. Regular virtual events, such as team-building exercises or happy hours, can help remote employees feel more connected to their colleagues and the company.Providing opportunities for growth and mental health resources also shows commitment to employee engagement and mental health and can boost performance rates.Establish a data-driven growth strategyAny strategy uninspired and unguided by data is like a ship without a rudder — adrift and directionless. It's a dangerous position for startups trying to navigate a sea of ruthless competition.Customer data and real-time insights are indispensable to developing fail-proof and agile growth strategies needed to support the flexibility of remote work and ensure every team member is aligned with the company's short and long-term goals.


Data can also help startups monitor their key performance indicators (KPIs), identify areas of improvement, such as operational inefficiencies or underperforming products or services, and make necessary adjustments.Implement scalable processes and systemsStartups often experience rapid, time-sensitive growth in multiple departments, and it can be harder to keep track of without seamless communication and collaboration among team members and scalable infrastructure that accommodates rapid changes.Effective remedies include automating repetitive tasks, using cloud-based tools (such as Asana, Slack and Zoom), infrastructure development and a willingness to invest in new technologies and systems to increase efficiency, reduce errors, enable remote collaboration and communication, and induce scalable growth.Attract and retain top talentThis can include offering flexible work hours, remote work options and competitive salaries and benefits. Investing in ongoing learning and development opportunities is also crucial for retaining employees in a remote startup.


With team members working in isolation, it can be challenging to provide opportunities for professional development. However, remote startups can offer online training, mentorship programs and virtual conferences to provide ongoing learning and development opportunities.Related: 7 Keys to Scaling a Remote WorkforceEmphasize strong leadership and communicationIn a remote environment, developing a leadership style that prioritizes transparency, accountability and trust is crucial. With distractions at home and teammates in different time zones, maintaining productivity can be challenging.Holding employees accountable when working from home requires even more effort, which is why strong leadership and communication are essential for managing growth in a remote startup.


To foster a culture of feedback and continuous improvement, startups must emphasize transparent communication, regular check-ins and clear expectations. Using various channels and mediums, such as video conferencing, chat platforms and project management tools, can help facilitate communication and collaboration among team members.All things consideredThe benefits of remote work are undeniable, but as more startups embrace this approach, success depends on the ability to develop strategies that accommodate the unique challenges of working remotely and enable them to manage growth from home and across borders.With a comprehensive growth strategy that incorporates these processes, leaders of remote startups can build successful and resilient businesses that can compete on a global scale and contribute to a more equitable society.

90,Have a Business Idea? Here's How To Put It into Action.,"May 19, 2023",Chris Kille,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/9-steps-to-put-your-business-idea-into-action/451722,"
You've just had a wonderful idea for a startup company. It's been spinning around in your head for months now, and you just know that you have something special on your hands. Your thinking is, ""If only I could make it work"" or ""If only someone would give me the money to get it off the ground!""Well, guess what? No one's going to hand you a sack of cash. But the good news is that you don't need anyone's money if you can't find anyone to help fund your business idea. Here are the steps you need to take to put your business idea into action:1. Validate your ideaThe best way to validate your business idea is by asking people for their thoughts on it. Don't ask for money or investment. Ask them for specific feedback about certain aspects of your business. For example, if you're opening a new restaurant, ask them what kind of food they like eating at restaurants and what restaurants they like going to most often.



You'll get better results if you focus on one specific part of your business at a time rather than asking them if they'd use your entire product or service — it allows them to give more in-depth answers without feeling overwhelmed by everything else in your pitch!Related: 5 Ways to Validate a Business Idea, Right Now


2. Write a business plan and business modelWriting down your ideas and plans not only helps you clarify what you want to do, but it also allows you to make sure there are no holes in your plan. Here's what you should include:A description of your business, including its mission statement and goalsA description of the target market for your product or serviceA description of the competition in your industryA description of how customers will find out about your product or serviceHow much funding is needed for startup costs and ongoing expenses3. Talk to your potential customersIn order to put your business idea into action, you have to talk to your potential customers. That's right — it all starts with a conversation.When creating a new product or service, you can't assume that your customers' needs will align with yours, because they might not. You need to speak directly to potential customers and ask them what they want and how much they'd be willing to pay for it.


4. Develop a prototypeIf you have a great idea for a product or service but want to know if people will buy it before you invest time and money into making it, you need to create a prototype. A prototype is a working model of your idea that allows you to see if it works, what needs to be reworked and how you might improve it. This can take many forms — from an Excel sheet or Google Sheets document with all the features you want in your product to a fully-functional website that mimics the final product.5. Test it out and prove the conceptIt's time to test.Test your business idea in a small way. For instance, if you want to be a freelance writer, write up a few sample articles and offer them free to some clients. If you plan on starting a food truck business, make one or two dishes and sell them at one or two events (or even in your kitchen). You can also use tools like Google Analytics or SurveyMonkey to see which ideas are most popular with customers before you launch your business.Related: How to Take Your Product From Idea to Reality


6. Understanding the legal implications and registering your businessA big part of creating a business is selecting one available business structure. In the United States, no single government agency is responsible for registering new businesses. Instead, many different types of entities can be formed for small businesses, including corporations, limited liability companies (LLCs), partnerships and sole proprietorships. Each type of entity has its pros and cons and is suited to different types of companies. Once you have determined which type of entity is right for your business, you will be able to register it with the appropriate state or federal agency.7. Financing and investorsWhile not all startups fail, those that do usually make one of two mistakes. First, they run out of money before they have developed a market for their product or service; second, they fail to persuade investors to give them money in exchange for equity. The best way to avoid these mistakes is to demonstrate that people will want your product or service enough to pay for it.8. Build market awarenessBefore starting your business idea, building awareness and credibility with potential customers is essential. Start by creating a website, social media profiles and a mailing list. Reach out to people who can help you get feedback on your idea; find out what business would best suit your skillset and where there is enough demand for it in your area. There are plenty of ways to get started without spending lots of money on marketing materials or advertising campaigns; just go through Neil Patel Blogs to start.Related: 3 Strategies Entrepreneurs Can Incorporate to Build Brand Awareness


9. Hire employeesAfter you have completed the above steps to start a business, it's time to begin hiring employees. You should hire people for customer service, sales, marketing and accounting roles. I have found that the best way to hire employees, in the beginning, is by word of mouth. If someone has had a positive experience working with you, they will tell others about their experience and recommend that they apply for a job at your company.If you have a brilliant business idea, you should work hard to put it into action — but here's one last tip: Before you start up your own business, make sure to research what the competition is all about. Is there anything already in place? Is there a product or service similar to yours? If so, look into the advertising and marketing strategies, and study the areas they've succeeded and failed. Don't steal their ideas, but rather be inspired by them, coming up with an idea of what works for you since every business is unique.

91,3 Ways to Determine if Low Code is Right for Your Agency,"May 15, 2023",Albert Santalo,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/3-ways-to-determine-if-low-code-is-right-for-your-agency/447504,"
Low-code platforms can help digital agencies deliver client projects faster while increasing their margins and reducing reliance on scarce, expensive software development talent.The intuitive ""a-ha"" about low code is that it lets developers spend more time writing the code that truly differentiates instead of working on the non-unique elements of a project, which can easily win over the productivity-minded who want to be as effective and efficient as possible. Instead of performing repetitive tasks, low code allows these developers to focus on the work and the code that truly matters.Of course, some developers are ""purists."" They have a strong tendency for control and choice over the tech stack while coding everything from scratch. They constantly keep up with libraries and frameworks to improve productivity, but the complexity and maintainability can cause headaches and add cost.



Related: 5 Things Your Agency Must Know Before Establishing a Low-Code PracticeSo how can your agency find its way forward with low-code advocates and opponents on your payroll? Below are considerations as you begin to strategize and plan for building a low-code practice:


Evaluating if low code is for youEmbracing low code is a strategic decision for your agency. Creating alignment amongst key principals is as important as selecting your low-code partners.Bring the appropriate stakeholders together to discuss expectations, concerns, next steps, etc.Find one or more developers open to exploring what's possible outside of traditional development. Have them build the MVP or part of a client project over a few days and evaluate learnings.Take note of the productivity gained during the development phase and evangelize it for greater internal adoption.Create talking points around the potential competitive edge, estimated bid-to-win ratio, expected margins, etc.Evaluating low-code platformsIt's also important to bring key stakeholders from the low-code evaluation phase into the platform selection process. There are various dimensions for evaluating which low-code platform is suitable for your agency and your customers; some include:Economics - Will the platform's pricing work for you and your customer profiles? Some may have high entry-level pricing designed for enterprise-level customers. Alternatively, others may be more affordable during the development phase and scale up in production due to compliance/security and runtime.Agency process - Does the platform feature capabilities built for agencies, such as:Multi-tenant use/views across clients.Workflows for transferring ownership and payment method of client projects.Hybrid client and agency team management.Ability to create agency-specific template libraries.Learning curve - How quickly can your team onboard and learn the platform? Is it something new or a better way of doing what they know?Developer experience - Will your developers feel constrained by the platform or feel like it enhances their productivity and ability to accomplish necessary tasks without extra workarounds or clunky architectural patterns?Client experience - Is using a low-code platform beneficial for your client and agency?Related: Low-Code and No-Code Design Is the Future of Website BuildingPreparing for salesP&S Intelligence predicts a low-code compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31.1% through 2030. Plan how to capture a slice of the $187B low-code market revenue predicted over this period.


Here are several helpful activities for new go-to-market motion in sales:Sales collateral - Update your sales deck(s) or proposal template(s) to include messaging around how low code empowers productivity, development, and more. Consider how it adds to your existing value proposition. Include product literature and success stories from your preferred low-code platform.Website - Update your website to reflect your low-code value proposition and partners. You may even build specific landing pages to optimize for SEO.Template library - Build a library of pre-packaged low-code templates that represent the intellectual property you have built up either in preparation for opportunities or in the process of serving them. This library will become your most valuable asset for rapidly delivering new business.Customer discovery - Talk to your best relationships to get feedback on this new offering without selling them on it. Ask for their help. If their interest in exploring is high, you may convert some of these to actual customers.Case studies - Document your success stories and include them in your future sales materials. Be sure to educate your broader team on them continually.Training - Educate your team on how to identify low-code opportunities and how to sell them.ROI calculator - Develop a calculator for sales scenarios that depict the economics involved in traditional development versus low-code development.Lead generation - The best way to see how a low-code platform can transform your agency business is to start with a live opportunity. In addition to sourcing a client yourself, some low-code platform companies offer partnership programs and marketplaces. Others will bring your firm leads they've secured.Selling low code - Traditional agency sales work is a highly consultative process focused on people, past work, and methodologies. Bridging the ""trust gap"" is often the greatest inhibitor to closing a deal.Once you've successfully executed your first project, weave this new mindset into the rest of your agency. Continue the virtuous cycle of low-code education, template development, talent development, and sales to transform the business with higher profit margins and greater client satisfaction.With low-code tools, agencies have the opportunity to move past conversations. Imagine showing a client how their project comes to life rapidly rather than simply discussing it. That's because the right low-code tools can provide many of the building blocks in real time.Organizing for low-code sales takes a slightly different approach. You will want to include sales engineers capable of rapidly embracing a client's requirements and building a mock-up of the application using the low-code platform and perhaps a template library built by your agency in anticipation of such opportunities. Lastly, the low-code company's marketing and sales support can often bolster your agency's efforts.


Low-risk, high rewardThanks to low code, you can offer clients more frequent CX iterations, decrease complexity, and accelerate time to market. This edge can lead to more wins, lower risk for your agency, and higher client satisfaction.

92,"Over 90% of Companies Generate Revenue from This Business Model, One Survey Says. Is It Time to Try It Out in Your Business?","May 15, 2023",Al Subbloie,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/try-this-business-model-to-generate-more-revenue-and-success/450463,"
Technology completely defines mainstream society today because it makes people's lives easier and expands the horizon of possibility. Apple's once novel catchphrase, ""There's an app for that,"" has never rung truer. You can order groceries, visit the doctor or adjust the temperature in your home — all from the palm of your hand.Technologies are also bringing ease and efficiency to businesses small and large. Global manufacturers have embraced Metaverse-like technologies to design, plan and test operations in their future factories before entering the costly construction phase. Even restaurant franchises are exploring new technological opportunities, with artificial intelligence drive-thrus garnering serious attention. Beyond maximizing operational efficiencies, digital technologies can boost the value a business is able to offer its customers — and this is increasingly happening through the Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS) business model.Similar to the way smartphone apps make everyday tasks easier, the XaaS model makes achieving your and your customers' desired outcomes more practical and feasible. Under this model, a company owns, delivers and manages a suite of product offerings, including various hardware and software solutions. Enabled by the addition of digital technologies in particular, XaaS business models are generating more value for companies old and new.



In fact, according to a recent report from EY, over 90% of companies that responded to its survey are now generating at least some revenue from XaaS models. Driven by competitive pressures and market changes, the amount of businesses generating more than 80% of their revenues from XaaS is expected to surge from 3% in 2022 to 19% by 2026, showing great momentum for the XaaS model. From greater customer satisfaction to repeatable revenue streams, companies that reimagine how they deliver value through a XaaS lens can find sustainable success in today's rapidly evolving macro dynamics.Related: 3 Tips to Keep in Mind When Taking Your Company Global


Create a one-stop shop that maximizes customer satisfaction and creates repeatable revenue streamsToday's economic climate is leading many businesses to reconsider the way they purchase products and services. What once worked — like making one-time purchases from a number of vendors and paying upfront for each — is now inefficient and expensive.This is especially true for small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), which are unable to exploit economies of scale, but make up nearly 90% of all businesses worldwide. In addition to being expensive, these siloed products are rarely capable of solving complex business problems, as they fail to account for the wider business perspective and future integration challenges.For example, retail franchises that want to reduce operating costs by lowering their energy usage likely need more than just new light bulbs. They'd also want to invest in energy-efficient heating and cooling, smart thermostats and a way to automate and monitor their real-time energy consumption to ensure they're achieving their energy reduction goals. Approaching each solution as part of a whole — rather than an individual unit — allows XaaS models to minimize costs and complexity and accelerate project timelines to meet client objectives.Companies that deliver their offerings via XaaS business models provide far more value, particularly SMBs. By directly tying the ability to earn recurring revenues to customers' desired outcomes, the XaaS model creates a one-stop shop for customer satisfaction and repeatable income streams while ensuring full transparency into investment outcomes. The ability to showcase ongoing value also enables XaaS providers to develop stronger and more resilient long-term client relationships.


Grow with your customersThe XaaS structure is designed to grow and scale as a customer's needs shift or expand. With it, service providers are incentivized to continuously optimize and enhance their offerings through critical learnings and insights gathered on the job. This flexible model is optimal for today's macro climate, which increasingly requires businesses to adapt to changing demands in the face of new market catalysts.Small and large businesses, for example, are facing mounting pressure to become more energy-efficient and resource-conscious as climate change and other environmental challenges are growing more salient to the public eye. XaaS companies in the energy space, known as Energy-as-a-Service, use intelligent monitoring systems to learn and resolve where energy is being wasted to maximize energy savings and lower overall operating costs.Related: Do You Have the Right Tech Mindset?A win-win-win for companies, customers and the macroeconomyThe comprehensive capabilities of XaaS and today's shifting macro dynamics make outcome-based services a more attractive way to meet customers' needs. A results-driven model, XaaS aligns the economic costs of a solution and its tangible and intangible benefits derived over time, allowing stakeholders to focus on generating long-term results as opposed to spending upfront capital. This runs contrary to one-time ""upfront purchase models,"" which have the unfortunate consequence of interfering with optimizing value outcomes.


At its core, XaaS empowers businesses with the flexibility and sustainability to continuously innovate and scale, unconstrained by product boundaries to best meet customer demands. To find success in today's economic climate, business leaders must embrace new and holistic, growth strategies that align their business goals with that of their customers.

Q: Every founder seems to have a personal brand, but it doesn't appeal to me. Do I really need to do this? — Eloise, San DiegoBefore I answer your question, consider the following scenario:Imagine comparing two people who work for you. One employee does everything that you ask of them. The other does that, too — but they also go above and beyond to identify opportunities outside of the job's general requirements. Not everything the second employee does is a hit, but a few things are, and those uncharted opportunities add asymmetrical upside to your business. Which employee does more to help your company?

94,How To Use Psychology To Gain A Competitive Edge,"May 8, 2023",Samuel Leeds,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-use-psychology-to-gain-a-competitive-edge/450561,"
When people think of entrepreneurship and investing, they often focus on numbers and financial calculations. All that is, of course, an integral part of the business world. However, what I have discovered as a businessman and investor in UK property, is successful business and investment is ultimately about people. To succeed, you need to understand and work well with people — whether they are customers, partners or investors.It is imperative to understand human psychology both at the macro level (understanding market trends) and at the micro level (understanding the person you are doing business with). If you get this right, you can consistently produce outsized returns in your business and your investments. Get this wrong, or fail to control your own emotions, and you can end up losing money when others are getting rich.In this article, I will address the different emotional states of the market and the individual actors that make it up. I will give you strategies that allow you to profit from each of them and give you insights that will prepare you to control your own emotions.



1. FearFear is a powerful motivator of human action. This is as true in business, financial and real estate markets as it is in the rest of society. When there is fear in the markets, justified or unjustified, sell-offs quickly follow. Inevitably, this leads to assets being sold at prices way below what they would normally be valued. For those that resist giving in to fear, there are some huge and potentially life-changing opportunities at these times.Stock market genius Warren Buffett says to ""be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful."" Whenever everyone is running for the exits, it is time to look at assets with a cold, calm head. For example, in the real estate industry, look at what a property is cash flowing or could cash flow. If that number allows you to hold the property for the long term, it doesn't matter much if prices continue to fall.


Even when markets are not fearful, any market will have motivated sellers. Motivated sellers want to get rid of their properties fast. This could be because they are moving overseas or need to sell the property due to a relationship ending. Your job is to understand their motives and make life easier by offering them a quick sale. In exchange, you can get the property below market value.In the business world, you may need to adapt your product offering. This may mean offering cheaper online versions of real-world products or events. However, it may also simply be a matter of re-framing existing products. Does your product help people protect themselves from uncertain market conditions, for example? How can you emphasize this aspect of your offering in your marketing?Related: 5 Fears All Entrepreneurs Face (and How to Conquer Them) 


2. NeutralWhen the market is not moving too fast in either direction, people tend towards neutral emotions. People are not normally selling assets for either very far below their normal price or too far above their normal price. There is more time to assess deals and for both parties to consider all their options. This can create a challenge for those looking to get market-beating deals either as a buyer or a seller.The key in this type of macro environment is to look at the micro. Just because the market isn't in a rush to buy or sell doesn't mean individuals aren't.In real estate, for example, regardless of the market, there are still people that need to sell their homes fast, and there are still people in a hurry to buy. In business, this is the time to understand your customers and their needs. In the investment world, it is a great time to understand companies' true value and dig deep into their balance sheets.Again, this is about understanding people and their psychology. Take the time to talk to the people you are doing business with and understand their story. If you can work within their timeline, they may be willing to give you a great deal. The better you can empathize with others, the better you can create win-win scenarios for all parties involved. Remember, the business world is always about people.


Related: 8 Ways Traders Can Manage Their Emotions and Achieve Success3. GreedWhen the market is booming, people experience FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). This pushes prices much higher than is reasonable.In the property industry, this is a good time to be a seller or refinance your properties. If you are buying, you need to control your emotions and only pay what you think an asset is worth. Be willing to walk away and have plenty of deals under consideration at any one time, as many will fall through.FOMO is also particularly relevant in the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investment. That industry is driven by hype and 4-year market cycles. When everyone else is buying, this is the right time to sell into the demand. If you are buying when everyone else is, you can lose a lot of money in that market.


In conclusion, regardless of market conditions, if you understand: your own psychology; the psychology of the market; and the psychology of those you are doing business with, you can make money as an entrepreneur or as an investor at any time!Related: Should You Buy Investment Property Now, or Wait for a Crash?

96,Breaking the Bank: America's Multi-Trillion Dollar Banking Problem,"May 5, 2023",Solo Ceesay,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/americas-multi-trillion-dollar-banking-problem/450505,"
If you're reading this, you've probably come across some of the recent turmoil within the United States banking system. Most notably, we've seen the collapse of several notable banking institutions, which include the likes of Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank.To date, the overwhelming majority of the blame for these recent failures has been assigned to the excessive risk and volatility associated with the emerging cryptocurrency (crypto) industry and early-stage companies when in all actuality, the primary driver of these failures stems from an age-old flaw of our banking system. Specifically, the bank failures of today were somewhat predestined, given bank runs are a known, well-understood threat to the health of any fractional reserve banking system.Now, more than ever, is the time for the American people to fight to lessen our archaic banking system. After all, we're the ones who suffer the most, not the ultra-wealthy.



Related: Why the American Dream is DeadWhat is a fractional reserve banking system?In the simplest of terms, a fractional reserve banking system allows banking institutions to lend out a certain percentage of the customer deposits that sit on the bank's balance sheet. The reason why a bank might do this is simple: free money. For a nominal interest rate due back to its depositors, banks are able to borrow funds and generate substantial returns from a myriad of investments. You might ask what regulations are in place to ensure that your money is there should you choose to initiate a withdrawal, so let's go through a quick history lesson.


In 1913, the Federal Reserve Act set out to accomplish a couple of key items:Creation of the Federal Reserve Banks (in aggregate, the Federal Reserve System)Set minimum reserve requirements for banks (set at 13%, 10% or 7%, depending on the type of institution)Fast forward to mid-century, and minimum reserve requirements increased marginally (up to 17.5% for certain banks) before settling within the 8-10% range from the 1970s to the 2010s. Most recently, in 2020, reserve requirements were abolished and replaced with the Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB) system, where banks were paid interest for funds that sat on their balance sheet, incentivizing them to lend fewer customer deposits. Crazy, right?In case you're wondering how much interest banks were paid for sitting on customer deposits, it was 0.15% (or 15bps) from 2020 until early 2022, when the Federal Reserve started to hike rates. See where I'm going with this? In a world where shareholders are in constant search of yield, the opportunity cost of sitting on reserves when the S&P 500 (or even real estate) pays high single-digit returns on an annual basis incentivizes risk-taking, which benefits the nation's elite at the expense of deposits (everyday Americans).Related: You Might Not Know That You're a High-Risk Customer for Mainstream BanksWhat you've been toldOne important item to note is that fractional reserve banking systems don't solely benefit banking institutions. In fact, fractional reserve banking is one of the biggest drivers of economic growth — businesses can scale and produce more products while consumers can more easily access capital. Credit cards, mortgages, auto loans and small business loans are all made possible by the reshuffling of customer deposits. It's genuinely one of the greatest innovations of modern finance; however, it doesn't come without its risks. Unfortunately, many of those risks aren't well known to the general public.


More likely than not, you've been told to 'rest assured' that the banking system is 'fine.' More likely than not, you've been told that the biggest risk to the United States financial system is the crypto industry. More likely than not, you've been told that decentralized frameworks are breeding grounds for fraudulent activity when in all actuality, it's the centralized nature of our banking system that enforces the need for consistent over-regulation due to incentives that always seem to be misaligned.Fractional reserve banking is a key pillar that brought us into the 21st century, but with how much the economy has grown over the past century, we must start to migrate to new banking frameworks. In particular, frameworks that better mitigate excessive risk-taking and function whether or not the general public trusts it.Related: Bank Problems = Bearish Thumb on Stock Market ScaleWhat you need to hearBanks are centralized organizations with the sole mission of increasing profits, and within centralized infrastructures, checks and balances are often put aside in exchange for speed and efficiency. Shareholders pressure banks to produce profits while banks pressure regulators and lawmakers for looser regulation which forces an infinitely small subset of people to make some tough decisions that impact the well-being of the common person who, by the way, knows very little about what happens to their money as soon as they deposit a paycheck.


For this system to work, the common person must put immense trust in the powers that be to good actors. Should depositors at scale initiate withdrawals, banks are at risk of not having enough funds to process requests. And because there's minimal visibility in a bank's position at any given time, Americans are forced to blindly trust that their money will be there when they need it.Crypto and, more specifically, self-custody solves this problem as your assets truly become your assets when you custody them yourself. Decentralized ecosystems completely eliminate the risk of a bank run but also eliminate the most efficient financing that a bank could ever get. And I already know what you might be thinking: ""What about credit cards and mortgages?"" Decentralized finance, or 'DeFi' for short, ushers in a new paradigm where these types of transactions can be facilitated through smart contract logic that is auditable and public.The threat the crypto industry poses to the traditional financial system is palpable. Because of that, we've been, nefariously, sold the narrative that crypto enables fraud when in reality, it's hard to commit a financial crime in crypto frameworks because every event is public and lives on the blockchain.Moreover, the media often fixates on the financial crime that does occur within the crypto industry, as evidenced by the fixation and coverage of the Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX fraud cases. Ironically, traditional banks have cases outstanding that dwarf the financial fraud that has occurred within the crypto industry. Moreover, it's because of centralization and opacity that lives within the traditional banking system that allows for implicative decisions to be made, which in turn, hurts those who partake in the system.


ConclusionNow, more than ever, it is time to be skeptical about the ways in which we live our daily lives. For the longest time, we've been forced to assume the risks that come with traditional finance because of a lack of better financial systems. And as with any major structural change, friction and great resistance is to be expected. After all, despite being a multi-trillion dollar problem on our hands, the United States financial system is also a trillion-dollar market opportunity that could shrink materially should crypto and other decentralized frameworks be implemented. TLDR: traditional finance won't go down without a fight.That said, it's on us to protect ourselves, and the first step we can take toward financial freedom is education - do your best to learn more about what's at stake while raising awareness among those around you. If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

This will democratize the creation process and enable entrepreneurs to focus on innovation.10x more automated: Automation will become a significant driver of efficiency in startups, allowing for leaner teams and smoother operations.Global teams, localized products: Startups will increasingly be built by global teams, yet their products will be tailored to local markets to better serve customer needs.95% dominated by solopreneurs and microentrepreneurs (teams less than 12): The startup landscape will be dominated by solopreneurs and microentrepreneurs, leading to more diverse and agile businesses.Pop-up digital experiences: Apps and platforms that only work during specific times or events will become more common, creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity.The marketing holy trinity: Successful startups will need to achieve product/market fit, content/market fit, and community/market fit to truly gain traction.Half robot/half human teams: A mix of AI and human talent will form the backbone of startup teams, combining the best of both worlds for optimal results.Accelerated by ""boring marketing"": Effective marketing strategies that may seem mundane or unexciting will play a crucial role in driving startup success.Multiple revenue streams: Diversifying revenue streams will become the norm, as startups look for various ways to generate income.Design matters: The importance of design will continue to grow, with high-quality aesthetics and user experiences being non-negotiable.Partnered with creators: Creators will play a significant role in distributing and promoting startups, leveraging their established audiences for greater reach.Feels like a game: Gamification elements will be integrated into startups, making them more engaging and fun for users.Purpose-driven moonshots: Startups will increasingly focus on making a positive societal impact, attracting both customers and investors who share the same values.Productized agencies for cash flow: Agencies will pivot to offering standardized products to generate consistent cash flow, like design agency Dispatch Design.Product studios become the norm: Product studios, which develop multiple products simultaneously, will become a popular business model in the startup world.99% of MVPs won't need VC: Venture capital will become less critical for the majority of MVPs, as alternative funding sources and bootstrapping gain traction.The future of building startups is set to be an exciting journey marked by rapid experimentation. As the landscape evolves, entrepreneurs will need to adapt to new trends and strategies to stay ahead of the curve. By embracing AI, no-code platforms, and purpose-driven missions, startups can position themselves for success in this new era of entrepreneurship.Related: 18 Inspiring Lessons From the GOATS of Entrepreneurship and LeadershipFor those interested in learning more about the future of startups and gaining valuable insights from Greg Isenberg himself, you can book a 1-on-1 video call with him through Intro.

98,7 Reasons to Trust Your Gut When Starting a Business,"May 4, 2023",Kartik Jobanputra,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/7-reasons-to-trust-your-gut-in-entrepreneurship/450378,"
Starting a business is an exciting but daunting prospect. You need to consider many factors when taking the plunge and deciding whether or not you can make it a success. One crucial factor that shouldn't be overlooked is trusting your gut.Trusting your gut means more than just relying on instinct or being impulsive. It's about trusting your intuition and decisions when starting a business. It's about learning how to recognize the signs that something isn't right and taking action accordingly rather than having an emotional reaction to every situation. Knowing how to trust your gut can help you make decisions confidently, even in uncertain times.Related: Should You Actually Trust Your Gut Feelings?Why should you trust your gut? You know what's right for you. Every decision you make needs to be right for you and your business. While opinions from family and friends are valuable, ultimately, you should make the final call based on what you believe is best for you and your business. Only by listening to what feels right internally can you make the right decision for yourself and your venture.Recognize patterns. Experienced entrepreneurs know how to identify patterns in their businesses that signal opportunities or challenges ahead. Learning to read between the lines will help inform decisions that lead to growth and success for your business. Recognizing patterns also enables you to spot potential problems before they become too big of an issue so that issues can be addressed quickly as they arise.Make quick decisions. Trusted entrepreneurs take decisive action when faced with difficult situations rather than dwelling on them for too long or overthinking their options. This helps them move quickly from one challenge or opportunity to another without getting bogged down in analysis paralysis or second-guessing themselves due to fear of failure or change. By identifying patterns in their businesses, trusted entrepreneurs can make quick decisions with confidence that align with their core values and goals for their company without hesitation or indecision, delaying progress or putting them at risk of missing out on potential opportunities down the line due to lack of action now.Stay true to yourself. One crucial thing successful entrepreneurs understand is staying true to who they are as individuals while running their businesses regardless of external pressures from peers, industry trends, etc. Staying true allows them to remain focused on achieving their goals rather than being distracted by temporary fads or industry hype since trust relies heavily on consistency over time.Don't get caught up in the details. Many entrepreneurs get caught up in details when starting a business instead of focusing on what matters most: the people involved in making things happen! That's why trusted entrepreneurs prioritize relationships over tasks; they understand that building strong relationships between key stakeholders is essential for long-term success, even if it requires extra effort during tough times like start-up phases which may require everyone to work together diligently until stability sets in!Listen to advice but ignore the noise. A successful entrepreneur understands where the advice comes from before accepting it; advice from experienced professionals should be taken seriously, but input from random strangers should be ignored since chances are it might not have a basis in reality nor provide any tangible benefits, either short term or long term! That's why trusted entrepreneurs listen carefully before acting upon feedback received because sometimes ""no"" is just as important as ""yes""! Additionally, if the advice does come from someone reputable, then there's no harm double checking facts provided out of precaution because mistakes can happen, so always verify information correctly before proceeding!Embrace failure. Ultimately failure happens, but it doesn't mean destruction; failure provides valuable lessons which can help shape future decisions made by trusting entrepreneurs who embrace adversity instead of running away from it because when done correctly, failure leads us closer to our desired outcomes, not away from them due diligence coupled dedication paying off eventually if persistent enough!Related: Know When to Trust Your Gut and When to Seek Outside AdviceConclusionStarting a business requires courage and conviction. Trusting your gut is just one way successful entrepreneurs learn how to manage risks while navigating uncharted territory successfully!



It's all about learning how to recognize patterns within our environment, spotting opportunities, taking decisive actions while staying true to ourselves, never allowing outside noise to distract us and focusing solely on what matters.Energy is spent unnecessarily, so always trust your gut and never settle for anything less than the best. Strive higher — only then will you reap the rewards.

    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

This story originally appeared on Readwrite.com.Does your company value and encourage remote work?As the founder of a fully remote digital PR subscription service, I believe it is likely that certain companies will continue to use remote workforces in the future. It's crucial to foster a positive remote company culture that results in happy employees, whether your staff will work remotely temporarily or permanently.



Related: Remote Work Is Here to Stay: Are You Ready for the New Way of Life?But you can't make other people happy for you. Leaders can establish expectations for how workers should behave and interact, but they cannot dictate how those workers perform or behave. Culture instead dictates this role.


It's not simple to establish a remarkable culture of remote work. My own company, which has always been a remote-first model, has had to step up its game in light of the current climate to make its remote workers feel safe and valued. I can only imagine how much more challenging this is if you are making a fresh start. You may worry that your new startup's culture is built on the unstable ground if no solid groundwork has been laid first.However, it is possible to construct a rapid and robust base. What I've learned over the years of leading distributed teams is this:1. There is no such thing as a remote company culture flukeCreating a productive culture for remote workers requires some planning. Share your thoughts and values about remote work with your colleagues. Let them know how you would like them to interact with one another.Find and hire people who already exhibit these qualities. Once those parameters are established, providing your team the freedom and support it needs to reach its full potential will be much simpler.


Then contemplate what else you might do to foster an optimistic atmosphere. In my workplace, for instance, we have a salaried position called ""Chief of Cheer,"" whose job is maintaining and cultivating a positive business culture.2. Get your ego out of the way firstTo quote the famous fifth habit of the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: ""Seek first to understand, then to be understood.""I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the best listener when I have something to say. But doing so prevents you from listening attentively and learning anything from the person standing before you.Related: Why Active Listening Is a Critical Skill for Founders and Entrepreneurs


Concentrate on hearing the other person out. To get more information out of them, you should ask clarifying questions. Don't discount their emotions just because you find them difficult to hear or because you disagree with them. Think of the other person as a potential source of information, and take an interest in them. In this context, consider Socrates' famous paradox: ""I know that I know nothing."" Adopting a humble demeanor involves admitting one has shortcomings and can always improve.3. Be a role modelMembers of your team will do what they are told. When leaders set high standards for their teams but fail to meet them themselves, they undermine morale and productivity. This is the consensus opinion of all the remote specialists I've consulted.Because of this, it's crucial to serve as a role model for your staff. My organization places a premium on work-life balance and employee trust by granting flexible work hours. We utilize a chat program for speedy contact, but we made it clear from the start that nobody was expected to respond immediately. We have made it abundantly apparent that we are not keeping tabs on their Internet use. For instance, I try not to respond to my instant messages immediately if I'm not online or in the middle of something else, even if I really want to.Similarly, generosity is one of our most important principles. I try to be considerate no matter what's going on, and I make it clear to the rest of the executive team that they should also.


4. Make time for enjoymentHaving a good time together at work is a key component of a successful team. Some people have the misconception that people who work from home are slacking off in their pajamas.Remote workers often don't have clear boundaries between their professional and personal lives, unlike those in more conventional workplaces. They spend their time at home working. And it's not always easy to relax a highly motivated person.Incorporate some lightheartedness, then. Make it a point to celebrate your successes and start new customs with the team. Invent unique ways to honor special occasions. You can't make someone join in, but you can clarify that everyone on your team is free to relax and enjoy themselves.5. Permit your group to make an impactPeople wish to have a positive impact and contribute to society. Insisting on a robotic approach to work while telling your colleagues to ""think outside the box"" is a contradiction. Predetermined expectations might make people feel that their actions are meaningless. Make them feel like they have the freedom to try something new. Raise them above their daily routine.


In a free setting, great cultures can flourish. Only when individuals feel safe with one another and have faith that their opinions and ideas will be taken seriously can there be an open atmosphere.6. See what a thriving remote company culture looks likeCould you distinguish between a culture that gets the job done but is sick and one that thrives? Recognizing a positive (or negative) cultural trend is crucial for influencing positive change.Consider the reaction of your own remote staff to get a sense of the company's remote culture. Do they express gratitude to you and each other? Is there an overflow of good vibes into personal lines of contact? Do you feel like you're beginning to understand who they are? Do you and they openly support one another? These are characteristics of a team that is starting to gel.7. Great cultures tend to reproduce themselvesAn effective remote work culture serves as an unconscious call to unity. It's the result of individual actions and the beliefs of those who take part in those actions. It results when people recognize their role in the whole. And it spreads to the rest of the team.


If the atmosphere at your remote office is positive and supportive, it will continue to thrive despite the inevitable transitions that occur when a team expands. Great company culture benefits the business and its clients — but it takes work to maintain.This article is syndicated from Readwrite.com, with author credit to Adam Torkildson.

101,From Hustle to Happiness: Redefining What It Means to Succeed with Alex Schlinsky,"May 2, 2023",Terry Rice,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/from-hustle-to-happiness-redefining-what-it-means-to/450746,"
I don't know of many people who have taken a straight and narrow path to entrepreneurship, myself included.I studied entrepreneurship in college but didn't actually do anything about it until about ten years later. Most entrepreneurs I know had a 9-5 for a while then decided it was time to do their own thing.But my most recent podcast guest, Alex Schlinsky, is different. He bypassed having a traditional 9-5 and immediately pursued entrepreneurship. Reason being, he thought there was a chance he might die at a young age.I don't want to make this overly dramatic but I can imagine feeling like you don't have a lot of time left can encourage you to truly live for the day and make the most out of however many days you have left.



Fortunately, you don't have to go through a life or death experience in order to take more control over your future because Alex shared the lessons he learned during the most recent episode of the Launch Your Business Podcast.Some key takeaways from our interview, which you can listen to here or below:


The power of persistence in getting where you want to go in lifeHow to build a robust and lucrative online communityWhy the ""hustle hard"" mentality makes no sense (and what you should do instead).We also discussed Alex's new book, The Anti-Hustler's Handbook: A Step-by-Step Guide for Hardworking Entrepreneurs: Who Want To Redefine Success Now & Discover Infinite Choices for Fulfillment Without Sacrificing Everything That Matters.The power of persistence and purposeAlex got to the anti-hustle movement unintentionally (he hustled himself into burnout at a young age). It all started with a diagnosis of a congenital heart defect at 18. Alex said that when you know you have open heart surgery at some point in your future, you want to make your time count. So in school, he worked himself into the ground to earn a degree in psychology while running a business on the side.After graduating, the idea of putting more years into school became untenable. He also wasn't quite ready to be an entrepreneur and grow his digital marketing agency – so he threw himself into his passion, which was local sports. In pursuit of media credentials with the Miami Dolphins, he called their media department every day for two months straight.""After hearing every single objection in the book, I knew one thing that was really important to me, which is I was willing to hear no more than they were willing to say it,"" Alex remembers. ""And so I just called and called and called eventually knowing that the brow beating will eventually make them capitulate and they would give me this opportunity.""


His persistence paid off, and he still has the Dolphins media member's badge in his office, reminding him of the feeling of achievement after months of work – a feeling he says he wanted to chase over and over.Accidentally starting a 7-figure businessThe season was rewarding, but it yielded about $500 for his coverage. To make income, Alex turned to the business he had accidentally started during his last year of high school, when Facebook had released the business page feature. Alex's neighbor (who was a personal injury attorney) was convinced that Facebook would be crucial to bringing in business. The neighbor offered Alex $1,000 per month to post once per day on Facebook and run his email newsletter.Alex worked for about ten attorneys throughout his college years, waking up early to pull potential case opportunities (like recalls) and post them on Facebook, then heading to class for the day.""It's so crazy because I never really thought about it as a business. It was just a side hustle the whole time. Fast forward four to five years later, finishing college, realizing journalism isn't really gonna make me money as much as it is passion. What can I do? And, and so naturally I thought, 'Is social media a business?'""


It doesn't take much Googling to find the answer.Alex got some training, transitioned his offer from social media to Google advertising, and quickly built a seven-figure agency.Alex's moment of reckoningBecause he had open heart surgery hanging over his head, Alex worked in overdrive, putting in maximum effort into all of his endeavors.About 10 years after his diagnosis, his heart had grown to the point of needing intervention. Alex said he accelerated the need for help by 30 years – and although the doctors couldn't give him a straight answer, he connects early surgery and the 10 years of working in overdrive.


""But it was enough in my mind to know that putting the engine in red all the time, what happens to the engine?"" Alex asks. ""It dies, it breaks, and that's what ended up happening.""Alex said he was so bought in to hustling, when the doctors told him that they needed to operate as soon as possible Alex's first question was if they could push surgery until after a business event he had coming up.""That's how skewed my mind was,"" Alex said. ""I just got the bombshell news that I had to have open heart surgery, and my brain was [saying], 'Can I push it until after we do our business event?' And that was a really big wakeup call for me.""The End of HustleWaking up doesn't necessarily mean slowing to a complete halt. Alex now runs a community called Prospecting On Demand, which offers mentorship for agency owners, digital marketers, coaches, and consultants looking to scale their business.


This is the tricky part: Alex said that for most people, ""scaling"" means acquiring more at all times. So even when you reach the top of one mountain, there's always more to be gained. It leaves the business owner feeling a lack of clarity, always churning towards bigger accomplishments (whether or not that actually adds benefit to their life).""The anti-hustle model inherently is all about identifying what the true goal of entrepreneurship is,"" Alex explained. ""Everyone wants to be happy and they want to be free. The thing is with freedom is most people posit freedom as financial freedom and time freedom. And yet so often time is just thrown aside for the benefit of financial freedom, financial freedom, financial freedom – without ever defining what even financial freedom was (and worse, never taking the time to define it and allowing someone else to define it for you). … You can actually come out with a very clear understanding of particularly how much money you have to make instead of this indefinite more, right? Because that lack of clarity is what creates that anxiety and frustration and – for so many people – that burnout.""Alex said that the results of defining success and scale are beneficial for the business and the business owner, but they also expand to the friends and family.""I think most people, when they come into a coaching program, mentorship program, their intention is very directly related to bottom line ROI, which makes a lot of sense and I respect that completely,"" Alex said. But ultimately what we end up finding is how much impact we have on people's lives, on their family's lives, on their relationships with their children and their friends, their family, their peers, their network.""

102,4 Reminders To Help Define Your Company's Values,"May 1, 2023",Under30CEO,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-ways-to-help-define-your-companys-values/450784,"
A company's core values shouldn't just sound nice. They should become guiding principles for everyone in your organizations to follow.Ideally, employees should be able to consult our values during times of autonomous decision-making. That way, they can make choices that align with our intended brand direction. However, many companies have values that aren't clear or up to date. As Gallup research shows, this can lead to serious problems.Related: Core Values: What They Are, Why They're Important, and How to Implement Them Today



In one of Gallup's recent surveys, fewer than one-quarter of respondents said they're led by their company's values. A mere 27% admit to believing in the values that their employers highlight. As a result, the values become little more than words — and that undermines their potential to be inspirational and clarifying.Ideally, you want your corporate values to do much more than sound good on paper. You want them to resonate with all your team members and appeal to your customers or client base. To get those benefits, though, you may need to reconsider or refresh your existing company values. Below are the best strategies to make sure new values are reflective of what employees and buyers need.


1. Bring your workers into the discussion earlyGetting buy-in for values is hard if you haven't asked your team for feedback first. A better way to ensure that your values are on the right track is to survey your workforce. We recommend bringing in a third party. Consider partnering with a consultant with experience creating strong, effective corporate cultures. After all, you want your values to drive your culture — and vice versa.To put it into practice, hold town halls, send out surveys, and find out the ways your people want to be contacted and ultimately treated. I've found that this is one of the best ways to get the conversation started across the corporate landscape.2. Match your words with your actionsToo often, companies share values but don't live those values. Your corporate actions should support your company's values. For example, one of our values is to treat all people equitably. If we had gender pay gaps that weren't being addressed, we would show my team that I'm not truly behind the values I push. It wouldn't take long before someone noted the disconnect, which could lead to employee turnover or negative press.There are plenty of ways to match your actions to your values. Case in point, you could donate to specific causes. Or you could pay your employees to do volunteer work throughout the year. Feel free to get creative in a way that makes sense based on what your values are.


3. Talk about your valuesKeeping your values top of mind can be tough, especially during busy periods. One method to keep values alive that we've leaned into is talking about them openly. For instance, adding them to your company's social media or blog posts. The more often you speak about your values, the more real they'll become to internal and external stakeholders.Related: Stand for Something: How to Establish Authentic Core ValuesA side advantage of discussing your values is that they'll become synonymous with your brand. Patagonia is a good example of this. The company's core values include environmentalism, unconventionality, and a commitment to justice. As such, Patagonia's leaders have made bold stands about protecting the planet and fighting systemic racism. The result? The company and its values are forever married.4. Start small and sincereIf you're starting on the path to constructing values, begin on a smaller scale. You don't need to have a dozen value points. I've noticed that selecting just one is enough to kickstart your company. It's okay to add more value statements or expand them as you move forward.


Remember: The goal isn't to overwhelm everyone with what you value as an organization. It's to show your business's true colors. Feel free to choose individual words to make up your values or generate a sentence that embodies your values. Slack does the latter with its header: ""Make work life simpler, more pleasant, and more productive."" It's easy to see how that value statement could become a roadmap for teams to follow.You can't always be around to tell your employees and peers what to do. But your core values can. Start refreshing and refining your value proposition today. When you do, you'll better position your company to remain strong and competitive.

103,One Founder's Super-Sized Side Hustle Is Helping Small Businesses — and It's On Track to Generate More Than $50 Million This Year,"May 1, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/one-small-business-side-hustle-will-generate-50-million-in/450370,"
In 2014, Joel Holland was living with his wife in Washington D.C., running a company in the technology space there — and suffering from a serious case of burnout. ""[I was] burned out on traffic, going to a cubicle, too many people,"" Holland recalls. ""I was just longing to get away, whatever that meant.""When the couple went to a wedding in Leesburg, Virginia, inspiration struck: Holland wasn't ready to go back to the city, and with an RV dealership nearby, it was a chance to explore the possibility of a different kind of lifestyle. Impressed by the ""little houses that you could drive"" — complete with everything from fireplaces to king-sized beds — Holland and his wife were ready for their next adventure.They purchased an RV, bought a truck to tow it and embarked on their first trip to Westville, Virginia, kicking off a travel-filled couple of years that took them through 48 states while they enjoyed ""total freedom and flexibility.""



But there was one problem they kept coming up against. ""A lot of the places we were staying were these boring campgrounds or parking lots,"" Holland says. The duo frequently passed beautiful farms and wineries — so why not stay somewhere more scenic for a night?""My thesis was there are millions of RVers in the U.S. — 11 million, to be exact — and all of them probably have the same need that I had, [wanting] to stay at really unique places,"" Holland says. ""So I was like, 'If I need it, others probably do too.'""


That realization would ultimately lead Holland to become the CEO of Harvest Hosts, an RV membership program that helps small businesses generate an average of $12,000-$14,000 in additional revenue annually at no cost. Harvest Hosts earns its own revenue via its membership model, which offers RVers three plans ranging from $99 to $179 per year.Today, Harvest Hosts' members have access to thousands of unique locations spanning wineries, breweries, farms and other attractions, including more than 400 golf courses for those who opt for the golf upgrade.Entrepreneur sat down with Holland to learn how he turned his idea into something much bigger — and about his ongoing commitment to helping small businesses.Related: Renting Out Their RV Went From Side Hustle to Full-On Business


""Mark Zuckerberg probably doesn't love to hear this, but Facebook is now the platform for our parents — and it's perfect for RVers.""When Holland started doing some research on his idea, he discovered that the exchange model had already been implemented in France. A program called France Passion, established in 1994, boasts a network of more than 2,000 winegrowers and other producers that provide parking for motorhomes. The program encourages but doesn't require the purchase of a host's goods as a token of appreciation.Soon, Holland found that a husband-and-wife team had launched a similar program in the U.S. called Harvest Hosts. But the program hadn't reached the scale that Holland envisioned. He considered building out his idea from scratch but eventually decided to acquire the existing program — using its initial network to get a head start.Holland purchased Harvest Hosts in 2018 and got to work spreading the word. He advertised on online channels including Google and Facebook, spending nearly $1 million on the latter per month at one point. ""That was just incredible because our product's very visual and very social,"" Holland explains. ""Also, our product tends to skew older. Mark Zuckerberg probably doesn't love to hear this, but Facebook is now the platform for our parents — and it's perfect for RVers.""Harvest Hosts also partnered with influencers on YouTube and Instagram to generate awareness for the program, but the company never allowed affiliates who weren't actual members to promote the product.


Image Credit: Courtesy of Harvest HostsRelated: 5 Things You Should Know Before Collaborating With an Influencer""That was surprising to me — how hard it was to sell a free product, basically.""Building out the host network was one of the most critical pieces of the puzzle. Conscious that Harvest Hosts could easily fail if it oversold memberships without supporting hosts, Holland doubled down on host recruitment. Today, the company has more than 10 full-time employees whose sole focus is just that; they educate hosts about RV life and clarify important points like the common misconception that hosts have to provide RVers with water and electricity.Still, getting hosts on board proved unexpectedly difficult. ""That was surprising to me — how hard it was to sell a free product, basically,"" Holland says. ""To contact the host and be like, 'You're just gonna make at minimum $13,000 per year, probably up to $50,000 per year, and we don't ask for any of that [revenue].' You'd think that'd be easy, but it's hard. So that has taken a lot of resources.""


Holland acknowledges that small businesses are always getting pitched programs, so it's essential to ""cut through the noise."" Of course, small businesses have also faced significant challenges amid the pandemic and inflation, and Harvest Hosts is committed to helping them navigate them.""Our goal is to try to keep a flow of these people coming to small businesses to support them,"" Holland says. ""And I think what's neat these days, especially for our members, but in general, [is that] people appreciate small-town America, small businesses and Main Street, [and] they don't want to see that die.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Harvest HostsRelated: 5 Things Not to Do When You're Running a Small Business


""Fifty million dollars, which is a lot of dollars, is going to flow directly into the pockets of small businesses [this year].""Since 2018, Harvest Hosts has seen 100x growth — soaring from 600 locations and 6,000 members to more than 8,700 locations and 250,000 members.Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive from both members and hosts; members love it because they get to stay at ""magical places,"" and hosts appreciate the opportunity to share their lifestyles and passions, Holland says.Naturally, the additional revenue is another major bonus for hosts. Last year's members spent more than $40 million directly with the small businesses in the Harvest Hosts network, Holland says, and this year they're on track to spend more than $50 million, which comes out to an average of $13,000 per business.Related: 10 Small Business Marketing Strategies That Actually WorkBecause Harvest Hosts never takes a cut, all of that profit goes right back to the small businesses.""Fifty million dollars, which is a lot of dollars, is going to flow directly into the pockets of small businesses [this year],"" Holland says. ""And that's going to manifest in interesting ways. It's going to help keep some open. It's going to help some pay higher wages to their employees to keep them happy. It's going to help some pay for those more expensive inputs.""Our goal is to keep growing both the host network and the membership so that that number just keeps getting bigger and bigger,"" he continues. ""It would be really cool — and I guess this is not too far off — [if] in a number of years we could say, '$1 billion has been spent with small businesses because of this program.'""

Below, you'll find a pay structure breakdown for Uber Eats.Please keep in mind that these figures are approximate and subject to change. Uber Eats drivers' earnings will differ based on numerous factors, such as location, time of day and individual performance.Base payThe base pay for Uber Eats drivers consists of three main components:


Base fare: A fixed amount paid per delivery.Pickup fee: Compensation for the time and effort spent picking up the order from the restaurant.Drop-off fee: Remuneration for delivering the order to the customer.The typical Uber Eats drivers earn a base fare per delivery, ranging from $2 to $4, depending on the market.Trip supplementsTrip supplements are additional payments that account for the time and distance of a specific delivery, ensuring that drivers are fairly compensated for longer or more complex trips.On average, drivers might earn an extra $1 to $2 per mile driven.Surge pricing and high-demand periodsDuring peak hours and high demand periods, Uber Eats may implement surge pricing, resulting in higher earnings for drivers.Factors influencing surge pricing include:Peak hours and busiest days: Times and days with increased demand for food delivery.Promo and incentives for drivers: Additional incentives are offered to encourage drivers to work during high-demand periods.During high-demand periods, drivers can earn a percentage-based bonus on top of their regular earnings, ranging from 10% to 50% or more.Related: What UberX and Lyft Drivers Can Do to Minimize Their Personal LiabilityCustomer tipsCustomer tips play a crucial role in enhancing a driver's overall earnings. Although these tips are optional and not guaranteed, they can contribute significantly to a driver's income.


The number of tips received can be influenced by various factors, such as the speed and efficiency of the delivery, the driver's demeanor and professionalism and the overall customer experience.While tips depend on customers' generosity, drivers might expect to earn an average of $2 to $5 per delivery in tips.Ensuring that deliveries are made promptly, food items are handled with care and clear and friendly communication can increase the likelihood of receiving tips.Moreover, during peak hours or busy days, when food delivery services are in high demand, customers may be more inclined to tip generously to appreciate the driver's efforts.

Earnings for Uber Eats drivers may vary from city to city due to several factors:


Local restaurants and food order volume: The number and popularity of local restaurants can impact the volume of orders and, subsequently, driver earnings.Market competition with other food delivery apps: Competing food delivery services may influence drivers' market share and potential earnings.Case study: Uber Eats driver earnings in New York.New York City, renowned for its diverse and bustling food scene, presents many opportunities for Uber Eats drivers.The high demand for food delivery, driven by a dense concentration of restaurants and a large population, makes the city attractive for those seeking to maximize their earnings. In addition, the fast-paced lifestyle of New Yorkers often leads to a higher reliance on food delivery services, further increasing the potential for more delivery requests.However, Uber Eats drivers in New York City also face numerous challenges that can offset some of the earnings advantages.For example, traffic congestion and limited parking availability can increase the time spent on each delivery, potentially reducing the number of deliveries completed per hour. Moreover, higher living costs, such as rent, utilities and transportation expenses, can significantly impact the drivers' net income.


As such, it's essential to consider these factors when evaluating the overall earnings potential in New York City.Comparison with earnings in other citiesComparatively, smaller cities or suburban areas may have lower order volumes, which can result in fewer delivery requests for Uber Eats drivers. However, these locations often provide a more relaxed driving environment with infrequent traffic and parking challenges.This can lead to faster and more efficient deliveries, allowing drivers to complete more orders in a shorter time frame, potentially increasing their hourly earnings.Additionally, the cost of living in smaller cities or suburban areas is generally lower than in densely populated urban centers like New York City.


This can positively impact a driver's net income, as lower housing, utilities and transportation expenses can allow for greater financial flexibility. Furthermore, competition with other food delivery apps may be less intense in smaller cities, providing Uber Eats drivers with a larger market share and more opportunities to earn.Related: Wait For Perfect or Charge Forward? Lessons From Lyft's Controversial NYC LaunchHow does your vehicle type influence earnings? Utilizing a scooter or bike for deliveries in some urban areas can be advantageous, as they offer increased maneuverability and lower operating costs. In addition, scooters and bikes can navigate through congested streets more efficiently, resulting in faster deliveries and potentially more orders completed per hour.However, this may limit the range of delivery distances and affect overall earnings potential due to constraints on carrying capacity and weather conditions.


Vehicle maintenance costs Vehicle maintenance costs, including fuel, repairs and insurance, can significantly impact a driver's net income. You should consider these expenses when calculating the overall earnings potential as an Uber Eats driver.For example, car drivers may face higher fuel costs and insurance premiums. At the same time, scooter or bike riders may have lower expenses in these areas but may need to invest in protective gear and maintenance more frequently.Hourly rate for different vehicle typesThe hourly rate for drivers may vary based on their chosen vehicle type. For example, while scooter and bike drivers may have lower operating costs, their earnings could be influenced by the abovementioned limitations.On the other hand, car drivers may have a broader delivery range, but higher operating expenses could impact their net earnings.


Ultimately, drivers should carefully consider the trade-offs associated with different vehicle types to determine the best fit for their circumstances and earnings goals.Related: Uber Tips for a Smooth RideshareHow do you balance Uber Eats with other delivery opportunities? Drivers looking to maximize their earnings may consider working simultaneously for multiple food delivery platforms. By doing so, they can optimize their schedules, capitalize on peak hours for various services and potentially increase their overall income.Side hustle opportunities for full-time and part-time gig workersAside from food delivery, gig workers can explore various side hustle opportunities to diversify their income sources, providing added financial security and flexibility.


Here are a few examples:Rideshare driving: Platforms like Uber and Lyft offer opportunities to transport passengers from one location to another.

This allows individuals to work on their own terms, pursue projects they are interested in and set their rates.Online tutoring: Individuals with subject matter expertise can offer online tutoring or mentoring services through platforms like Tutor.com or VIPKid. This provides a chance to share knowledge with others and enables tutors to earn money from the comfort of their homes.Task-based gigs: Platforms like TaskRabbit connect gig workers with individuals seeking help for various tasks, such as assembling furniture, moving assistance or minor home repairs. This allows workers to choose tasks that match their skillset and availability.By exploring these and other side hustle opportunities, gig workers can create a more diverse and stable income stream, mitigating the risks associated with relying on a single source of income.Additionally, engaging in various gigs can offer a sense of fulfillment and personal growth by allowing workers to pursue their interests and passions.Related: Uber Drivers Reveal the 5 Worst Things Passengers Can Do During a Ride.
