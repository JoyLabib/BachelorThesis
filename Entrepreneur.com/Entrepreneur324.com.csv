0,How to Get a Lifetime of Investing Experience in Only One Year,"Apr 19, 2024",Ross Cameron,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-to-get-a-lifetime-of-investing-experience-in-only-one/472431,"
There's no denying that long-term, buy-and-hold investing can produce remarkable results. Berkshire Hathaway is the best example of that. I'm a day trader and find value in long-term investing. Because it's enough for me to focus just on day trading, I have an investment advisor who manages the long-term portion of my portfolio.The contrast between what he does and what I do could hardly be greater: My average hold time for a stock is five minutes, and sometimes, I'll be in a stock for mere seconds. With those hold times, it doesn't take long to find out if my investment strategy was right, wrong or dead wrong.It's not an exaggeration to say that day trading can be like compressing a lifetime of investing into a year. I've made over 20,000 trades so far and plan to keep trading for many more years.



Two common phases day traders go throughThe first phase is beginner's luck. I actually think it's a thing with day trading, and I experienced it myself. In my first year of trading, I made about $30,000. Was I pumped! Yes, it was work, but it sure beat pumping gas, which I had done a few years back, or working for a bad-tempered boss, which I also knew about.Over the years, I've heard enough similar stories from other traders to believe beginner's luck is quite common. However, a hard reality always waits in the wings for those happy beginners, and it even has a name: regression to the mean.


After my second year of trading, I gave back those early gains and was now at breakeven. But in my third year of studying and hard work at trading — I wish I could say I turned the corner, but I didn't. I lost a lot of money and was down to my last chance before having to get a ""real"" job.Some people can look back at turning points and identify a mentor who said the right thing or a chance encounter that made a difference. In my case, keeping a journal of all my trades saved my day trading career. I recorded not only the trades but also my strategy at the moment I took the trades. In scouring that journal, I discerned a trading pattern that resulted in losing transactions and a different set of characteristics for my winning trades. With this knowledge, I turned my ship around.This leads me to the second common phase, ""investing friction."" Sometimes, when day traders experience a hard loss, they fear taking more risks. They mentally box themselves in, and it becomes more difficult to regain their trading confidence. It can be the beginning of a downward spiral.But here's the really interesting thing: The same phenomenon sometimes happens with wins. After an especially memorable win, traders will pull back and make progressively smaller trades.


Back to my trading journal: There are about 250 trading days in a year. I've found that my top 10 trading days usually account for over 20% of my entire year's profit. On those golden days, am I just throwing caution to the wind? No, and this is where the flying analogy comes in.Related: Best New Shows For Entrepreneurs Streaming Free NowTrusting your instrumentsWhen you learn to fly, you only practice on days with good weather. You're operating under what's known as ""Visual Flight Rules."" But if you stick with it, you'll learn ""Instrument Flight Rules."" When you're cleared to fly with those rules, the good news is you can fly in all kinds of weather. The bad news is you must ignore your gut and learn to trust your instruments, or you'll go into the ground.The same is true with day trading. Successful day traders are not gamblers or cowboys but more like experienced pilots. They do a profit-and-loss calculation before ever taking a trade. They will see a recognizable pattern in the behavior of the stock price, including other factors like trading volume, news about the company, and so on. If it adds up, they take the trade.


The next part is where successful traders earn money: They stick with the parameters they set up. That means if the stock goes up, they have a process for taking some profits off the table while letting the stock continue to rise. But if the stock begins to go down, they don't let it ride ""a little longer,"" hoping it will turn around. Instead, they sell without hesitation and cap the loss.Either way, they trusted their instruments and would live to trade another day.Related: Day Trading: How To Get StartedDon't get me wrong: Even after 20,000 trades, I can control my emotions and trade according to my instruments. It never gets ""easy"" because I can always follow my parameters. Sometimes, emotions will get the better of me, and I'll think: What just happened? Then, my journal review will reveal that on that day, my emotions got the best of me for that trade. It's then up to me to become more disciplined in the heat of the moment, so I apply what I learned from that last trade.


There's no way to turn day trading into a sure-fire system for profit-making. You can improve your chances of doing well in this most unforgiving of environments. You achieve that by doing three things:Record what you were thinking at the time and how it worked out;Analyze that transaction and how you might adjust your parameters in the future; andHave the discipline to stick to those course corrections on the next day.There is no guarantee of profits, but it's the only way I've found to stay in this profession for the long term.

  He Took His Side Hustle Full-Time After Being Laid Off From Meta in 2023 — Now He Earns About $200,000 a Year: 'Sweet, Sweet Irony'
  
    When Scott Goodfriend moved from Los Angeles to New York City, he became ""obsessed"" with the city's culinary offerings — and saw a business opportunity.

      Key Takeaways    



        Goodfriend turned his passion for food tours into a business with some encouragement from his friends. 
      


        The business made about $30,000 a year before Goodfriend was laid off from Meta and went full-time with the venture.
      


        Goodfriend appreciates being able to ""pursue something I love and earn a salary from it.""

Scott Goodfriend. When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it? I moved to New York from Los Angeles in 2011. I always loved traveling and getting lost walking through different cities. When I moved to New York, I was fascinated by the ability to visit anywhere in the world by subway, even neighborhoods that were far away. I researched different restaurants and then started thinking, well, maybe I can eat at a few different places, so I started planning walking routes to different eateries on Google Maps. My friends found out I was doing this and wanted to join.



Eventually, the word spread. My friends and family from out of town started calling me when they came to visit New York. They would tell me about a neighborhood they wanted to explore and ask if I could plan a food tour. I enjoyed the challenge and was happy to do this, and I probably ended up planning 50-100 tours over seven or so years.Related: TV Shows All Entrepreneurs Should Be Watching


During this entire time, I was a broke freelance TV producer living in the East Village who lived off a fair amount of $1 pizza. I lived close to Chinatown and figured I could probably take a short walk and find something better. I not only found delicious food but also discovered the variety, depth and complexity of Chinese food, which I became obsessed with. I started doing tons of research into the regions, cuisines and history and the Chinese experience on the Lower East Side. I started taking people to Chinatown, and they fell in love with the tour. They told me to do this as a business, and I always poo-pooed the idea, saying I didn't want to build a website or do the marketing (sweet, sweet irony — but more on that later). My friend encouraged me to put my tour on something called Airbnb Experiences. I posted the Chinatown tour on Airbnb in 2019; it got to the top of Airbnb in a short timeframe. Then, Covid-19 hit, which shut my operations down for over a year.In 2021, I reworked the tour and put it back on Airbnb, and it got to the top of the ""Activities to do in NYC"" list. People started asking me what other tours I had, so I wrote more. Eventually, I had to hire people to help run the tours and help with the marketing. It got overwhelming because I was also working my dream job as an augmented reality producer at Meta, but then….I was part of the Meta layoffs in 2023! I had a decision to make: Go work for another company I really loved and respected, or pursue my entrepreneurial dreams. I decided to pursue Ultimate Food Tours full-time. It's been great, and I've learned so much doing it. I am really glad I made the jump.Related: This Dad Started a Side Hustle to Save for His Daughter's College Fund — Then It Earned $1 Million and Caught Apple's Attention


What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?The biggest challenge while building my business was deciding where to focus and invest my time. You need to be strategic about what parts of the business you invest in and focus on. Since entrepreneurship doesn't have a playbook, the answer is often to go for it, analyze the results, learn from it and do better next time.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?Ultimate Food Tours evolved tremendously over the last few years, and I'm lucky enough for it to be my full-time job now. Before switching to this as a full-time role, I was making around $30,000 a year. I probably saw consistent revenue between the second and third years. At this time, I was only pursuing Ultimate Food Tours on the weekends, so I was making around several thousand dollars a month.What does total annual revenue look like now?Currently, I generate around $200,000 a year and have seen the brand grow by about three times year-over-year.Related: This Insurance Agent Started a Side Hustle Inspired By Nostalgia for His Home State — Now It Earns Nearly $40,000 a Month


What do you enjoy most about this side hustle? I love being able to leverage my passions and turn them into business strategies. A great example of this is our content marketing. I come from a family of foodies, and I have always loved history and making videos, so I created a social series called Origin Stories, which tells the history behind New York's famous foods and the best places to eat them. We have three seasons and plan to begin long-form content soon. I am so proud of this because we get to use our platform to drive traffic to local restaurants while simultaneously building our own brand. It's conceptualizing and executing these win-win strategies that really got me excited about running a business.Being an entrepreneur is a lifestyle! When I first started, I was putting in around 20 hours a week. Since making my side gig my full-time job, I probably work between 50-60 hours a week. Combining my passion with my livelihood allows me the flexibility to pursue something I love and earn a salary from it. I also utilize outside technology that helps streamline my finances and save me time to focus on my business and personal life.What's your advice for others hoping to start successful side hustles of their own?Stay organized! It's easy to get overwhelmed with various spreadsheets and different numbers flying around. Using an accounting sofware helps free up time on my schedule, allowing me to turn my attention to other areas of the business like marketing and developing additional tours.Whatever idea you have, whatever your big dream is, take that first step now! Buy that domain name, make that social media post, whatever it is. Just do one small thing a day, and the rest will fall into place. Make it part of your routine, and you'll see a return.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.


If you're working a full-time job, try to bite off what you can chew and plan your side hustle schedule around your current commitments. You'll be able to see if it has room to grow, and if you do think you want to make it your full-time thing, start putting things in place that prepare you to make the jump when you feel ready.Network and talk to other entrepreneurs! The most valuable thing I found was talking to other people who started businesses and food tour companies of their own. They knew what needed to be done and were able to fill in a lot of the gaps in managing my time and gave me the insights needed to successfully launch my own business.

How were you introduced to EdTech, and what inspired you to start your side hustle in that space?When I had the opportunity to tutor STEM classes in college, I quickly realized teaching was my passion. I excelled on the newly formatted MCAT and decided I wanted to help students achieve higher scores (one of my students even reached the 99th percentile!). A college friend suggested I create a pre-med club focused on innovative learning experiences, which sparked my interest in curriculum development and the use of learning management systems supported by professionals in medical and scientific fields. The idea to build a website and offer tutoring services emerged after I hosted a successful MCAT seminar, and my commitment to tutoring in college laid the foundation for my future endeavors.



My tutoring venture expanded into a holistic coaching experience, which focused on the psychology of studying, anxiety management and wellness, including the utilization of 24-hour planners, exercise and nutrition. This comprehensive approach led me to pursue a psychiatry residency. Despite not initially seeing myself as a business person, the need for innovation in MCAT preparation drove me to entrepreneurship.Related: Best New Shows for Entrepreneurs (Streaming Free)


After collaborating with peers in clinical trials, we launched online clinical research courses, aiming for excellence and continuous improvement. This endeavor was more than a business; it was about making a meaningful impact and addressing broader needs. CCRPS INC was founded to address the underemployment of foreign medical graduates and healthcare professionals in the U.S. despite their impressive credentials. Together with colleagues in clinical trials, we aimed to provide educational courses to help these individuals secure entry-level positions that offer both competitive salaries and a sense of purpose. We established a strong online presence, developed expert-led courses and focused on education and career preparation. Our commitment to quality content quickly earned us recognition and trust, positioning CCRPS as a leader in the field.What were some of the first steps you took to get CCRPS off the ground?First, we identified our niche by recognizing a gap for non-clinical medical professionals seeking valuable career paths. We built a user-friendly website and formed partnerships with providers, building trust by seeking out video and audio reviews from graduate students to help other students have a better idea of our comprehensive and in-depth educational approach. We collaborated with experts to create high-quality course materials and secured the necessary accreditations to establish credibility. We also offered comprehensive career support and focused on quality education, which spurred organic growth through referrals and a robust online presence.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building the side hustle, and how did you navigate them?Building and growing a startup requires constant ""figuring out"" of challenges. The biggest challenge was meeting and surpassing our clients' needs so they could continue to grow. Additionally, delegating to the right people requires trial and error; you can't expect to get it right from day one! The key to overcoming these challenges is learning to be okay with the ups and downs, being the rock when changes don't go as planned and consistently providing excellent services.Related: This Insurance Agent Started a Side Hustle Inspired By Nostalgia for His Home State — Now It Earns Nearly $40,000 a Month


How long did it take you to see consistent revenue from your work within EdTech?From the outset, our business achieved net profitability, a testament to our compelling curriculum. Starting with one in-person student whose enrollment funded our initial website and SEO efforts, we adopted a strategy that allowed us to reinvest early profits into expanding our operations. This approach was essential in both our foundational stages and as we scaled, particularly with the MCAT company.Despite promising early enrollments, our focus has always been on student success and quality education rather than merely generating revenue. This commitment enabled us to reduce prices over time, making education more accessible and aligning with our belief in the importance of affordable education. Engaging students meaningfully requires commitment, evidenced by our successful partnerships with contract research organizations and our lean yet effective operational model.How do you balance your entrepreneurial pursuits with a demanding career in medicine?Following a year-long hiatus to launch CCRPS, I transitioned back into my residency. Today, brilliant clinical research professionals and a solid team manage the day-to-day operations and business aspects, ensuring student success remains a priority at CCRPS while I fully immerse myself and focus on my residency.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.


What do you enjoy most about running your own business?I appreciate the profound influence I can have on students' success and career advancement. Witnessing their growth, seeing their achievements and knowing that we play a pivotal role in shaping their futures is incredibly rewarding and reaffirms my passion for education entrepreneurship every day. With over 22,000 student members from more than 1,200 organizations, including six government agencies and 308 universities, the reach and influence of CCRPS are evident. A 2024 LinkedIn review of graduates highlighted remarkable outcomes, with placements in over 1,600 companies and 23% achieving managerial roles or higher. Furthermore, the initiative has significantly contributed to developing the clinical research workforce for various contract research organizations. This progress, driven by a team of exceptional clinical research educators, underscores the collective effort and dedication to advancing clinical trials and healthcare.What's your advice for others hoping to start successful businesses?Learning how to harness and delegate our strengths effectively is crucial. Sometimes, guidance from those who've walked the path before us can be a game-changer; seeking expert mentorship in areas we find challenging can make all the difference.Start small and focus on what matters: In a world brimming with startups, it's vital to remember that at the heart of every idea and venture are the people we aim to help. They are our priority, always. Let's embrace our unique talents, lean into learning and always put people first.This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

Ninety-five percent of workers are looking for or plan to look for a new job this year, according to a report from job-search website Monster. If you're one of them, it might be worth your time to check out LinkedIn's Top Companies for 2024 — because they're all hiring, with more than 85,000 current job openings, one-third of which are hybrid.LinkedIn's annual compilation of data can help professionals find out which organizations are industry leaders making an impact with growth opportunities, equity in the workplace and more. Each company on LinkedIn's list was ranked according to eight pillars that translate to career progression: ability to advance, skills growth, company stability, external opportunity, company affinity, gender diversity, educational background and employee presence in the country, per the platform.Related: LinkedIn Changed Its Algorithms — Here's How Your Posts Will Get More Attention Now



""This year, companies in financial services, healthcare and tech dominate the U.S. ranking, driven in part by pandemic rebounding and overall stability within these sectors despite layoff headlines for some big-name companies,"" the company said in a statement, which also noted that 44% of the companies included in the 2024 ranking are new to the list and represent a range of industries including motor vehicle manufacturing and biotechnology research.Several key trends emerged across this year's top companies. They're embracing the power of artificial intelligence, relying on AI for meeting summarization, code generation, customer service assistance, predictive analytics, modeling and more; cultivating academic communities with an AI focus; and even creating their own AI platforms and governance teams, per LinkedIn.


The top companies are also on the hunt for soft skills like adaptability, curiosity, collaboration and communication, and they're aiming to center company culture and connection, according to the research. Some examples include Wells Fargo, which hosts events like puppy-petting with local dog foster organizations as part of its Stress Down Days program, and PwC, which encourages breaks by outfitting its offices with gaming areas that include foosball, shuffleboard, basketball and more.Related: Unlocking the Power of LinkedIn: How Entrepreneurs Can Leverage the Platform for Growth and SuccessBut perhaps one of the most significant developments for employees?

5,Most Americans Don't Think Higher Education Is Worth the Cost — But This State-By-State Breakdown of College Graduates' Salaries Tells a Different Story,"Apr 15, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/college-graduates-make-the-most-money-in-these-us-states/472214,"
A majority of Americans don't believe that a college degree is worth the price tag, according to a poll from The Wall Street Journal and the National Opinion Research Center (NORC). That's perhaps not surprising given that student loan borrowers in the U.S. owe a collective $1.74 trillion in federal and private student loan debt, per NerdWallet, and that since the late 1970s, inflation-adjusted pay for most U.S. workers has largely stagnated, according to the American Bar Association.Still, roughly 70% of Americans remain convinced that having a college degree does lead to higher-paying jobs, even as more than half of them contend that earning that diploma isn't affordable, Inside Higher Ed reported. College degrees often do translate to higher salaries, though, of course, exceptions abound, and new research from career platform Career.io proves that out, along with just how much the earnings disparity between college graduates and non-college graduates varies depending on state.Related: Do Children Need to Go Out of State for the Real College Experience?

      Key Takeaways    



        Kerr saw the demand for enamel pins in the artist community and thought the sales could help fund his daughter's 529.
      


        Within a few days of launching his site, he had an order for 1,000 pins from someone he ""had no link to at all.""
      


        Now, Alchemy Merch offers additional products, sees nearly $2 million in annual sales and boasts partnerships with major brands.
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Alchemy Merch owner Greg Kerr, who was working as a musician when he started selling custom pins in 2015. Today, Alchemy Merch is a full-time business that creates custom products for companies including Apple, Nickelodeon, National Geographic, Nike and more, as well as independent artists looking for ways to monetize their artwork in new ways.Image Credit: Courtesy of Alchemy Merch. Greg Kerr.When did you start your side hustle, and what inspired it? I'd been running a literary-inspired apparel brand, Miles to go, and had begun making enamel pins as one of the products we offered back in 2015. Some friends began asking me for help to get them made because of how confusing overseas production can be. Around that time, my wife and I decided we'd try to have a baby, and on the day we found out we were pregnant (Father's Day in 2016), I bought a domain for Pin Game Strong. I saw there was a demand for help within the artist community, and I initially thought if we could put a few hundred dollars into our daughter's 529, it would be a win. The original intention was that we'd keep running the apparel brand and help people make enamel pins on the side. I quickly recognized that there was a huge gap in the market to offer retail-quality merchandise. Everything was focused on promotional products, and with my background in running a brand, I thought it was important to focus on products people would be proud to bring to market. There was a need to go beyond promotional and into fully custom.



Related: This Insurance Agent Started a Side Hustle Inspired By Nostalgia for His Home State — Now It Earns Nearly $40,000 a MonthWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I'd seen a post on an episode of the Adventures in Design podcast talking about how someone should help people make pins. At that point, I had made thousands of pins for myself but hadn't thought about offering it as a service. I offered to help anyone interested and got a quick response. Word of mouth spread, and I saw that people wanted a safe outlet for making pins. Knowing we had a child on the way was the catalyst to buy a domain and throw together some pricing. I was familiar with how promotional products companies price their products and decided I'd try to beat them. Once the site was up, things started happening quickly, and within a few days, I had an order for 1,000 enamel pins from someone I had no link to at all.Image Credit: Alchemy MerchWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?As things started moving quickly, I had a lot of struggles with my time and how to balance it with the brand that had been paying my family's bills for the past few years. We went from $0 to $1 million in sales in 18 months, and it was just me. I did all of it: managing the business, handling all orders, communicating with factories and all art. It was a lot to handle. We didn't spend a cent on advertising in the first two years. Word of mouth was spreading and keeping me as busy as I could handle. My first step was to get some help on handling art files so I could keep working on customer interactions. I wish I'd looked for help sooner, but when I finally did get the help, it freed me up to focus on sales more.


Related: How to Get the Most Money Out of Your Side Hustle During Tax Season, From an Expert Who Raised $75.2 Million to Make Filing EasierHow long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn? Within six months, we'd surpassed the monthly revenue of the brand I'd been working on for eight years prior — and it kept growing. Once we saw how quickly it was moving, the secondary goal became to replace my wife's income by the time she'd have to decide whether to go back to work or not after our daughter was born. We hit that goal and kept on running upward.You've since turned the side hustle into a full-time business, Alchemy Merch. What's been key to that growth, and what does revenue look like now? We hit a point where I needed to let go of the previous business so I could focus all of my time on making products for others. We started as Pin Game Strong and kept on adding new products in: patches, acrylic keychains, washi tape, etc., and the name just felt too limiting. We'd built up solid name recognition but knew it was time to grow beyond pins. Growth has been challenging for the past few years. When Covid hit, we got knocked back twice. First, we had delays in factories returning to work that caused a lot of refunds for events lined up. Then in March, they returned, and the U.S. got hit with lockdowns. A lot of our business is driven by events. Artists sell at fairs, cons and other events, and corporations will [make items] for conferences or team events. Pre-Covid, we were up only, and since then, we've been working hard to really focus on tightening up what we do and how we do it to help stand out. Although we have had growth the past two years, it's not until this year that we are seeing the energy back in people to create again. We have been floating right under $2 million a year in sales for the past two years and are hoping to finally break past it and continue to grow.Related: Don't let your good idea go to waste.

It's tough running a business in the after-hours if you have a 9-5, but if you really want it, you need to put in the work.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Danny Trejo, an insurance agent who started grow-at-home citrus business Via Citrus in 2020.Where did you find the inspiration for your side hustle? I started working on Via Citrus shortly after moving to New York City, inspired by the nostalgia for the citrus groves of Central Florida. I grew up on a large citrus nursery filled with the sights and scents of orange blooms — a vivid part of my childhood that I always cherished.



While I had always wanted to be part of the citrus nursery business, I wanted to contribute in a different way that not only brought value to the business but also meaning to myself. The distance from my roots, coupled with the longing for the familiar fragrance of orange blossoms, sparked the idea to share this piece of my home with others. It was then that I realized I could educate others on how to grow citrus trees — no matter where they were located — by opening an online store.Related: What to Watch - The Most Inspiring Shows for EntrepreneursImage Credit: Courtesy of Via CitrusWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground? What were some challenges? Starting out, I faced the daunting task of setting up an ecommerce platform. With no prior experience in websites, I had to start from scratch, learning the ins and outs of online retail, from design to development.


Simultaneously, I tackled the important step of defining our product line. Given the vast diversity of citrus varieties ranging from oranges, lemons, limes, tangerines and grapefruits, I had to make decisions about which to offer. This involved researching citrus growth habits and the unique selling points of each citrus type to curate a selection that would appeal to a broad audience.Equally important was determining the size of the plants Via Citrus was going to offer. This decision was a delicate balance. On one hand, offering plants that were too small could lead to customer disappointment, as they might not immediately appreciate the beauty or potential of their purchase. On the other hand, larger plants, while more visually appealing and closer to bearing fruit, would incur prohibitive shipping costs, making them less accessible to a wider audience. This required careful consideration of the growth stages of citrus plants, shipping logistics and customer expectations to select sizes that offered the best value for our customers and the business.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?


The first couple of months saw under $1,000 each thanks to family and friends who supported the launch of Via Citrus. However, it wasn't long before we were averaging about $7,000 per month in revenue, with May (Mother's Day) and December (Christmas) being our busiest.What does average monthly revenue look like now? We see $36,000 per month in sales. May and December continue to be our best sales months.What do you enjoy most about this side hustle? It keeps me in touch with my roots — pun intended — by working on this project with my dad. Growing up surrounded citrus, where my dad dedicated over 40 years of his life, has deeply influenced my appreciation for the cultivation and care of citrus. Now as the person behind Via Citrus, I am able to maintain and strengthen this bond despite being six hours away from the farm. Via Citrus serves as a vital link to my father and the work he continues to do. He's not just the grower — he's out there selecting and packaging each citrus plant we send out to our customers. This hands-on approach from him ensures that every plant we deliver carries a piece of our family's dedication and love for citrus cultivation.


Image Credit: Courtesy of Via CitrusAs you consider the business's future, what are you most excited about? The booming plant industry and the significant steps we are taking to grow alongside it get me excited. As our world gets more digital, people are turning to gardening and indoor plants for both hobby and home decor to take a break from their screens. This trend presents a promising opportunity for Via Citrus, as our unique offering of citrus plants aligns with this growing interest.What is particularly thrilling is our recent purchase of new land for the development of additional greenhouses. These new greenhouses will have the capacity to increase our variety of citrus offers, improve our cultivation process and ensure we can meet the growing demand from our customers.

For me, I wanted to get everything right the first time: the perfect-looking website, the perfect variety, size, packaging, images, etc. I was spending too much time perfecting. Perfection is somewhat of a double-edged sword. No one was seeing my website or buying my citrus plants. Therefore, my quest for perfection limited my ability to get any consumer feedback to make anything better. Eventually, after years of planning and perfecting, I launched the website. The few customers who did engage became invaluable sources of feedback. Their insights helped us refine our offers in ways I hadn't anticipated.It's important to get your product out there, even if it's a limited run of your product. Early feedback provides incredible insights and can steer your side hustle in a direction that better meets market needs and preferences.

This Q&A features Lauren Myrick, founder and CEO of Found. Myrick raised more than $75.2 million from leading VCs including Sequoia Capital, Founders Fund and Lightspeed Venture Partners to build a better banking system for self-employed freelancers and independent workers. Image credit: Courtesy of FoundWhat inspired the idea for Found?I've seen the frustrations of small business owners firsthand through my personal and professional life. On a personal note, my sister is a yoga studio owner and self-employed fitness instructor, and I saw her struggles navigating traditional finance and business management tools. Professionally, when I was the GM of Square's Payroll business, I saw how complicated, painful and stressful taxes can be for small business owners.



Both of these perspectives inspired me to further investigate the financial management and tooling challenges that self-employed business owners face. Connor Dunn, my co-founder, and I started talking to family members, friends and other self-employed business owners to understand their challenges. Many people don't realize that managing your finances when you're self-employed differs quite a bit from when you are a W-2 employee. There are different tax requirements and forms, and you are on your own to figure out how much you need to pay in taxes. We also saw a common theme that people start their own businesses because they want freedom, flexibility and creative control — not so they can become their own accountants.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.


During these conversations and additional research, we realized two important things. First, we could provide tremendous value to these self-employed individuals by giving them a toolkit to manage their finances — something we felt we were uniquely equipped to do because of our backgrounds at Square. Second, the self-employed population in America is large and growing: Approximately 60 million Americans today are self-employed, and self-employment will soon surpass traditional employment to become the majority of the American workforce. Shortly after these conversations, we started Found.Why is doing taxes one of the most difficult financial tasks for freelancers?Unlike W-2 employees, business owners and freelancers do not proactively have income taxes taken out of their paychecks — and are expected to calculate and report their expected taxes themselves throughout the year. They are also frequently acting as their own ""finance department,"" an area where most have very little expertise. This typically involves keeping business and personal finances separate, correctly calculating and proactively saving the proper amount for taxes, and tracking financial deadlines, expenses and fines.In addition, tax laws are always changing and complicated by both state and federal policies. These laws are also starting to regulate how payments are invoiced, paid and tracked in relation to apps and platforms that we all interact with. For example, millions of freelancers, gig workers, solopreneurs and contract workers breathed a collective sigh of relief in December 2022 when the IRS delayed the new tax-reporting requirement for third-party payment platforms like Venmo, Cash App and PayPal, but that was just a temporary measure.Keeping finances organized while also staying on top of these changing laws is a lot to manage, and the tools available to the self-employed are typically expensive and disparate. Because of this, and because there is the ever-looming risk of owing money in taxes at the end of the year, we frequently hear that doing taxes is one of the most stressful parts of being self-employed.


Related: This Once Single Mom Had Negative $1,500 in Her Bank Account Before She Started a Lucrative Side Hustle — and Earned $100,000 Within 1 YearHow does Found's partnership with Column Tax this year offer a solution for that?Found directly helps self-employed professionals save for and pay quarterly taxes. Found can automatically estimate and set aside money for taxes for our users based on their income. We can also help our users easily categorize expenses and provide guidance on what can and cannot be deducted as write-offs.Found partnered with Column Tax to take these benefits a step further and provide tax filing services to its users, particularly those who are Schedule C filers. Column's tech is integrated into Found's suite of financial tools for independent workers. With Column Tax, Found Plus subscribers can access free tax filing services as part of their annual subscription.Filing through Column Tax is already around 1.5-2 times faster than standard DIY tax software providers and can be even faster for certain filers like independent workers who often have more complex tax returns. Because Column Tax is able to pull data directly from Found accounts, this partnership can help save Found users a lot of time when entering financial details during the filing process. The IRS has estimated that self-employed individuals spend 24 hours on taxes per year! And pay $560.


Related: She Used Her Kids' College Fund to Build a Side Hustle, But the Product Was 'Unsellable' — Here's How She Got Back on Track for $100 Million in SalesDo you have any top tips for freelancing and side-hustling filers who want to file with ease?First, it's incredibly important to organize your income sources. Keep track of 1099-NEC forms from clients and 1099-K forms from payment processors like PayPal to avoid a last-minute scramble. Second, make sure to separate business and personal finances, ideally through maintaining separate bank accounts, which will help simplify end of year reporting. You also want to meticulously track all business-related expenses, as these could be deductible expenses and significantly lower your taxable income. This could include expenses related to equipment, supplies, home office costs, phone bills and any other materials needed for your business.Lastly, it's crucial to understand your responsibility for paying self-employment tax in addition to regular income tax. To ensure you have sufficient funds to cover your tax bill, including estimated tax payments, allocate 20-30% of your freelance income into a separate savings account dedicated solely to taxes. If you expect to owe at least $1,000 in federal taxes for the year, make quarterly estimated tax payments to avoid underpayment penalties. Properly budgeting and making timely tax payments can save you from potential financial headaches down the line.And what are some of the common mistakes they make during filing, especially around retirement?When we surveyed Found customers last year, we learned that only 22% of self-employed people know how to maximize potential deductions and write-offs, which means they are missing the chance to lower their taxable income — and therefore their tax bill. Some of the tax deductions, like when you buy a new laptop for your job or pay your CPA, are more straightforward, but there are so many others.

And when you're self-employed, you can likely deduct contributions made to several types of retirement plans, such as traditional IRAs, SEP IRAs and Solo 401(k)s. Some of these retirement accounts can lower taxable income by deferring the tax bill until the money is withdrawn in retirement. Not being aware of these benefits can lead to missed opportunities for tax savings.

Image Credit: Michael Romeo CreationsWhat was your day job when you started your side hustle, and why were you interested in entrepreneurship?When I started playing the saxophone and piano for weddings, private events and nightlife in 2019, I worked as an email marketing coordinator for a retail company in the New Jersey suburbs. I've always been extremely passionate about chasing happiness over money, so becoming an entrepreneur happened by coincidence when I discovered a way to combine my love for entertaining others with my love for mainstream party music.



Related: I Started a Semi-Passive Side Hustle That Earns $33,000 a Week on Amazon: 'Selling There Is a No-BrainerHappiness for me is the ability to wake up every day to do what I love and know that my work makes a difference in the lives of others. After all, being able to entertain over 200 wedding couples during the happiest day of their lives and hearing the phrase, ""You were literally the life of the party. You made our wedding — we couldn't imagine it without you,"" truly humbles me and makes me want to entertain as many people as I can all over the world.


When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it? While I started my side hustle in March 2019, I've played the piano for more than 21 years and the alto saxophone for over 18 years. From an early age, I learned that I have a perfect pitch which has allowed me to play any song by ear.When I attended Rutgers, I became obsessed with mainstream house music. During my free time in college, I enjoyed spending hundreds of hours mixing dance tracks in my DJ software program to make mixes for my friends to play at parties (and even DJ'ed for my friends at parties from time to time, too). Around 2015, I started an Instagram account where I posted short videos of popular songs on the piano and sax (The Chainsmokers, Post Malone, Blink-182, Fetty Wap, etc.) and eventually was hired by a friend's sister to play cocktail hour piano at her wedding. She also had me play along with the DJ for her intro to her reception, and I ended up staying the entire wedding.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I was so attracted to the adrenaline rush from my first wedding that I became obsessed with replicating the feeling. I contacted several entertainment companies in the New Jersey/New York area and quickly started getting booked to play at events. Above any compliments I received about my musical talents on the sax and piano, I kept hearing the word ""energy."" ""Oh my God, you literally have so much energy"" and ""You're literally the life of the party"" were two phrases I heard over and over again, so I realized that my passion for entertaining others far outweighed any passion I've ever had for music.Related: This Gen Zer's Stylish Side Hustle Earns About $20,000 a Month and Paid Off His Parents' $200,000 Debt: 'I Enjoy the Hands-Off Nature'


While playing several events each weekend, I focused on building relationships with different vendors in my industry, including DJs, event planners, photographers, videographers and other entertainers. I also continued gathering content (both photo and video) from my events to grow my Instagram and TikTok accounts, where at least 50% of my event leads now come from. I'm so fortunate to be able to post content from weddings and other events and have the opportunity to reach virtually anyone across the entire world, which has led me to travel for incredible destination events in places like Puerto Rico, St. Maarten, and later this year, Aruba and Dubai.@essentialjasonnelson Wedding guest energy was off the charts at this one ?? #weddings #destinationweddings #rosecliffmansion #rosecliffmansionwedding #theknot #weddingwire #bridetobe ♬ original sound - THE ESSENTIAL JASON NELSONWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?I wanted to leave my 9-5 marketing job at the start of 2020, but once the pandemic hit in March, I lost practically all of my event bookings lined up for the rest of the year. However, I was so fortunate to still have a paycheck and work from home when most full-time event industry professionals were shut down. I remained patient and continued to grow my side hustle by networking virtually, posting content and working on the administrative part of my business because I knew it was only a matter of time before events came back. Sure enough, we saw a surge of events being played (including weddings) in 2021, and I knew I made the right decision to leave the 9-5 world.Since the majority of my event bookings are operated through my LLC (I don't have an agent or any employees), a few years ago, when I started receiving an increase in demand for myself at events, there was a period when I was overwhelmed with how manual the booking process was (scheduling calls, sending contracts and invoices, etc.). However, I started automating my booking process in 2022 using HoneyBook, which I now use to automate the process from a client inquiry through booking. I have so much more free time to devote to innovating my entertainment style in the ever-changing industry and can focus on getting myself physically ready to be on my feet and bring energy to the dance floor for many hours each weekend.Related: I Was a 25-Year-Old Nurse When I Started a Side Hustle to Combat Anxiety.

How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?Within the first year of launching my side hustle, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to play the sax at Angelina Pivarnick of Jersey Shore's wedding and the grand opening party for The Edge NYC. Events like these so early on in my career gave me the confidence to want to take my side hustle full-time. I was on track to earn between $45,000 and $50,000 in 2020, and at the time, my goal was to find a way to replace my email marketing income.You've since turned the side hustle into a full-time business.

12,5 Simple Wealth-Building Tips For This Generation's Forward-Thinkers,"Mar 28, 2024",Lucas Miller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-to-develop-a-wealth-building-mindset/469087,"
The manner in which young adults approach money management is one of the most debated topics in generational wars. However, it's also a conversation that lacks context. After all, you would need to consider the economic challenges that erupted since the start of the 21st century. There have been three significant recessions since the year 2000. While they were each distinct in terms of cause and impact, they also became progressively worse each time.It started with the dot-com bust in 2001, followed by the 9/11 attacks and the Great Recession in 2008. More recently, the 2020 pandemic produced economic turmoil at the global level, leading to unprecedented job losses and financial hurdles from which many still have yet to fully emerge.These are the unsettling economic waves that current young adults were essentially born into. The silver lining here is that they do not have to fall victim to the chaos so long as they partake in future-focused activities that revolve around strengthening their finances.



1. Side hustles for financial securityIn times of financial unpredictability, side hustles have gone from being ""fun-to-have"" to a ""must-have,"" strengthening financial security by acting as a buffer against economic uncertainties. A recent survey from Experian revealed that 50% of millennials are pursuing some kind of side hustle. Those in the 55 to 64 age group, though less likely to have a side hustle, earn the most from it, averaging $1,061 per month.Collectively, even an extra thousand dollars each month being placed directly into savings can help provide a safety net if one's primary job is under threat. The best thing about side hustles is that they typically offer plenty of flexibility and control. The options are also limitless when one considers freelance gigs, the sharing economy, or even monetizing a hobby or skill for financial gain.

Making homeownership a realityDue to increases in rent and high mortgage rates, young adults have been moving back in with their parents in recent years in an effort to save money while researching other options. This uptick led to the belief that young adults are shying away from homeownership, but that no longer seems to be the case.According to research conducted by Wahi, 45% of aspiring homeowners in Canada are now tightening their belts, aiming to save for a home purchase at some point this year. Saving is clearly the right first step, as a recent survey from NerdWallet showed that over 75% of Americans who had planned to buy a home in 2023 did not end up following through.This shift towards homeownership is far more than just a financial goal to work towards. It is also a step towards disciplined financial habits. Making regular mortgage payments is akin to a forced savings plan, steadily building equity and ensuring long-term financial stability.


3. The importance of building a robust credit profileA good credit history demonstrates being on the right track in terms of finances, and the list of benefits of having good credit includes receiving better insurance rates, better loan terms, better odds of approval by lenders, lower car insurance premiums and better housing options.Getting started can appear daunting for almost anyone. However, there are a few ways to ease this process. One can start building credit with secured credit cards and credit-builder loans. Becoming an authorized user on the card of a family member with good credit is also a helpful method to provide a boost.However, these elements are only one piece of the puzzle. You would also need to demonstrate responsible habits, such as making payments on time while maintaining low credit utilization. Over time, this will lead to a good credit score, and with the average credit score in the U.S. at 715 in 2023, you will need to work at getting closer to the highest possible score of 850.4. Invest in low-cost index fundsLow-cost index funds are rising in popularity for novice investors, thanks to the broad market exposure they offer through diversification and their cost-effectiveness. The diversification element comes in handy when one company underperforms, as the impact balances out by the investments in other companies.


Over the past 30 years, the S&P 500 index has delivered an average annual growth rate of 10.7% per year. These can also easily be purchased across numerous platforms with a small initial investment, making it an excellent option for young adults looking to step into the investing world.5. The power of planning for retirement early onPlanning for retirement is typically not something in the minds of young professionals, but there are plenty of benefits for those who choose to start early. This is because it's not just about saving for the distant future; it's about building a habit of financial mindfulness.In 2023, retirement assets in the U.S. totaled $35.7 trillion, yet a significant number of Americans were not on target with their retirement savings, emphasizing the need for early planning.As stated on U.S.News, prioritizing retirement planning helps with making informed career choices, such as opting for jobs that offer retirement benefits. Young adults have the advantage of time, allowing them to take calculated risks in their investments early on, to rake in potentially higher returns in the future.


Related: 3 Ways to Start Thinking About RetirementAt the end of the day, being proactive about finances is far more than just a smart move — it's an essential step towards a more secure financial future. There is no time like the present for young adults to plan ahead with future-focused strategies to strengthen their finances.

13,"Is a Master's Degree Worth It for Aspiring Entrepreneurs, or Does It Just Delay Success? Here's What You Should Know.","Mar 27, 2024",Hanna Shanar,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/is-a-masters-degree-worth-it-for-aspiring-entrepreneurs/470461,"
In the realm of entrepreneurship and career advancement, the decision to pursue higher education often comes down to a critical analysis of cost versus opportunity cost. This analysis becomes even more pertinent when considering the financial implications of obtaining a master's degree compared to entering the workforce with a bachelor's degree.With the average income for bachelor's degree holders at $60,000 per year and the cost of a master's degree running at $30,000 per year over two years, the decision is not merely financial but strategic.Understanding cost and opportunity costBefore delving into the specifics, it's essential to differentiate between cost and opportunity cost. Cost refers to the tangible expenses incurred during the pursuit of education, such as tuition, books, and living expenses. Opportunity cost, however, represents the income or benefits one foregoes by choosing one path over another. For an aspiring entrepreneur or professional, understanding this distinction is vital for making informed decisions that align with long-term goals.



Related: Exploring the Intricate Interplay of Education, Income and Entrepreneurial SuccessThe financials: A closer lookThe average cost of obtaining a master's degree is $60,000 over two years. This figure does not account for ancillary expenses, including potential interest on loans, which can further increase the total investment. On the surface, this cost is counterbalanced by the promise of a higher average income post-graduation, which stands at $80,000 for master's degree holders.


However, this simplistic view overlooks the opportunity cost associated with pursuing a master's degree. For two years, an individual forgoes an average income of $60,000 annually, amounting to $120,000 in lost earnings. This figure significantly impacts the net benefit of obtaining a master's degree, especially when considering the time value of money and potential investments that could have been made with the income earned during this period.The entrepreneurial perspectiveFor entrepreneurs and those with a keen eye on career advancement, the decision to pursue a master's degree is not solely about immediate financial returns. The value of higher education often extends beyond the paycheck. Advanced degrees can provide invaluable networks, specialized knowledge and credibility that can be particularly beneficial in certain industries or entrepreneurial ventures.Moreover, the skills and insights gained during the pursuit of a master's degree can lead to more significant opportunities, potentially resulting in ventures that far exceed the income differential between bachelor's and master's degree holders. Therefore, while the opportunity cost is a critical consideration, it's also essential to weigh these intangible benefits.Calculating the break-even pointTo make an informed decision, one must calculate the break-even point of their educational investment. This calculation considers the total cost of the degree, the opportunity cost of lost earnings and the differential in post-graduation earnings. Specifically, with a total financial investment of $180,000 — comprising $60,000 in tuition and $120,000 in lost income — it would take nine years of working at an $80,000 annual income to break even. When including the two years spent obtaining the master's degree, the total time investment to reach a break-even point is precisely 11 years.


This break-even analysis is crucial for those contemplating a master's degree, as it provides a clear timeline for when the financial benefits of the degree will start to outweigh the costs and lost earnings. It's a vital consideration that requires individuals to take a long-term view of their career trajectory and financial goals.Related: The Most Effective Way to Become a Millionaire Is Still Through Education. Here's Why.Beyond the numbers: The value of educationWhile the financial analysis of cost versus opportunity cost is crucial, the decision to pursue a master's degree should also consider personal and professional growth. Education is not merely a financial transaction but an investment in one's capabilities, worldview and potential to impact society. For those with a clear vision of their career path or entrepreneurial goals, the value of a master's degree might far exceed its initial cost and opportunity cost.Moreover, in an increasingly complex and competitive global economy, the depth of knowledge and expertise gained through a master's degree can be a significant differentiator. This is particularly true for entrepreneurs who seek to innovate and lead in their respective fields.


Making the decision: A strategic approachThe decision to pursue a master's degree, with its inherent costs and opportunity costs, requires a strategic approach. Prospective students and entrepreneurs should:Conduct a thorough financial analysis, including the calculation of the break-even pointConsider the intangible benefits of higher education, such as networking opportunities, skill development and access to resourcesReflect on their career goals and the role that a master's degree might play in achieving those objectivesExplore alternative paths to acquiring the desired skills and knowledge, such as professional certifications, online courses or practical experienceIn conclusion, the analysis of cost versus opportunity cost in the context of higher education is a complex but essential exercise for entrepreneurs and professionals. By taking a holistic and strategic approach to this decision, individuals can align their educational pursuits with their long-term career and entrepreneurial aspirations, ensuring that their investment yields not just financial returns but personal and professional fulfillment.Related: How to Get a Master's Degree Without Going Into Debt

Robinhood introduced a credit card on Tuesday with no annual or foreign transaction fees and a minimum of 3% cash back to the general public. However, the card is only available to Robinhood Gold subscribers who pay $5 per month or $50 per year for a membership.Robinhood announced the card and its waitlist on Tuesday, marking the first time that the online trading app has expanded to credit cards. The company began offering a debit card two years ago and acquired no-fee credit card startup X1 Inc for about $95 million last year.The card offers 5% cash back on travel bookings through Robinhood's new portal.Credit: RobinhoodSimilar to the Apple Card, the Robinhood Gold card has a clean look with no numbers, so users won't have to worry about their information being stolen if they lose their cards. Other cards, such as one from Mastercard, also have this kind of design.

      Key Takeaways    



        Woo's background in management consulting and further research inspired her to build a tool in the form of a card game ""that anybody could enjoy."" 
      


        Her first deck — 52 Essential Conversations — launched in May 2018.
      


        These days, she releases a new deck on Amazon every four to six months, and the business model is a ""no-brainer.""
      












This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dr. Jenny Woo, educator and founder of Mind Brain Emotion, the company behind a line of card games and other tools for the development of emotional intelligence. The story has been edited and condensed for clarity. There's some research that shows that today's college students are way less emotionally intelligent compared to those a decade ago. And this research was done before the pandemic, so you can imagine what that looks like post-pandemic. I've also seen a lot of research on the impact of distance learning and social isolation, where adults and kids just don't have the same opportunity to interact with people. For kids, this translated into social anxiety and regression [in] communication skills and language, and just that unwillingness to connect with people.Image Credit: Courtesy of Mind Brain Emotion. Dr. Jenny Woo.



I've done management consulting for Fortune 500 companies, and through working with senior leaders, I found that soft skills in the workplace are not quite emphasized, which really impacts the health of an organization's team. When I was researching this area at the children's level, I realized, Oh my gosh, these are the skills that basically weren't really taught or discussed in school. So, while at the Harvard Innovation Labs, I took a research-backed approach to develop a tool in the form of a card game that anybody could enjoy — you don't have to go to school or anything. (I wanted to do something that was easy and accessible because I'm the first one in my family to graduate college.)Related: This Gen Zer's Stylish Side Hustle Earns About $20,000 a Month and Paid Off His Parents' $200,000 Debt: 'I Enjoy the Hands-Off Nature'


The development of my first card deck, which launched in May 2018 with the help of a Kickstarter campaign, stemmed from a combination of education research and industry experience. I was in a master's program in education that was focused on the intersection of cognitive science, neuroscience, education and child development, and I guess psychology sprinkled in there. I started with the 52 Essential Conversations to really help people have purposeful conversations in an authentic and vulnerable way. This would be parents with children, adult parents and grandparents with children in school. It's almost like the pearls of wisdom that you want to leave someone close to you — to feel good that they're set for life and can make responsible decisions.I didn't even really think about developing more card decks, but organically, as I was testing the game out with users and gathering these case studies, understanding how people are actually engaging and interacting with it, I realized that in order to even begin to have these vulnerable, heart-to-heart conversations, you need to have that trust, respect and understanding first. And so that is where I created the second deck, which is the Relationship Skills deck — to help people go back to the drawing board, connect with each other and build that caring trust necessary to even have a conversation. I released that one in January 2019.Related: Her 'Crude Prototype' and $50 Craigslist Purchase Launched a Side Hustle That Hit $1 Million in Sales — Now the Business Generates Up to $20 Million a YearAmazon is a platform that's continuously growing in terms of people who rely on the service, so selling there is a no-brainer. These days, I launch a new deck every four to six months on Amazon, and the sales bring in $33,000 a week. I have other streams of income as well. I lecture at the University of California, Irvine. I'm lecturing but also providing a service through my online course as Mind Brain Emotion, my company. So every quarter I teach, and they pay me directly per person taking my online course. We do some real estate too.


I speak a lot to entrepreneurship classes at the graduate college level, and one time I got this question from someone: ""Can you start a business if you're not really passionate about what you're selling if it will make a lot of money?"" My answer is, ""Why would you want to do that?"" My advice is to do something that you're truly passionate about and hopefully passionate about for a long, long time because it is a grind. You're going to get negative customer reviews, which is like a death sentence for a business. And you have to love what you're doing enough to just pick yourself up and keep going. That also goes into knowing what your values are; you're going to have so many dilemmas and decisions that you need to make, and in order to weigh the pros and cons, you have to go back to your values and what's important to you.Related: Learn How You Can Take Advantage of Amazon's Advertising Tools to Get More Eyes on Your BusinessAdditionally, as a solopreneur, you don't know what you don't know, and that's one of the biggest challenges I see when I talk to other entrepreneurs.

19,5 Ways to Make Money Online in 2024,"Mar 22, 2024",Georgi Todorov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/top-ways-to-make-money-online-this-year/471234,"
In 2024, the digital world continues to offer innovative ways to earn money online, marking an era of unprecedented opportunity for entrepreneurs and freelancers alike. At the same time, mass layoffs are fueling a new wave of entrepreneurs.Companies are transitioning towards automation, integrating AI to streamline operations. Businesses lay off employees and replace them with AI. In a survey gathering opinions from over 1,500 small businesses in the UK, 24% of the participants indicated plans to substitute certain staff members with AI within the next 12 months.Undoubtedly, the increase in highly skilled unemployed individuals from the IT and marketing sectors will result in a rise in new entrepreneurs and individuals seeking online income opportunities.



This concise guide highlights five methods to capitalize on the internet's vast potential for generating income.Related: The 5 Most Reliable Ways to Make Money Online


1. Freelance workFreelancing serves as an easily accessible route into the online income world, requiring minimal initial investment or skills, and suits newcomers to the workforce. AI advancements lower entry barriers across professions, enabling almost anyone to generate income, particularly through content creation.This ease of entry makes freelancing an attractive option for aspiring entrepreneurs lacking funds or networks. Starting with simple tasks like article writing, freelancers can increase their earnings as they acquire more skills.However, the challenge lies in the direct exchange of time for money, which may lead to burnout since income stops when work does, excluding time spent on non-billable tasks. Despite these challenges, freelancing can pave the way for future professional growth and opportunities.2. Consultancy business — The next level after freelanceMoving from freelancing to consultancy marks a professional progression, shifting from payment for work volume to earning based on expertise. This change enables higher earnings for less task-oriented time, focusing on offering strategic advice to clients.


Consider the SEO industry, where numerous specialists operate as independent consultants. This mirrors my own journey, transitioning from freelance SEO work to consultancy. According to one study, self-employed SEO consultants earn slightly more than agency or in-house SEOs.The income potential for an SEO consultant is capped due to limitations on client capacity with a maximum of five to six clients. This restriction sets their annual earnings between $50,000 and $250,000.The earning potential as an SEO consultant has a ceiling, but it can be significantly enhanced by establishing an agency and expanding your business with additional employees.3. Create a digital PR agencyDigital PR agencies make pretty good money. According to one study, the average price of one PR campaign for a client can range from $6,000 to $20,000.


Establishing a digital PR agency is a promising venture in the current market, where the demand for high-quality digital PR services is on the rise. This business model involves securing media features and placements for brands across various publications and outlets.Operating a digital PR agency is within reach with the right approach. The key lies in assembling a team capable of crafting captivating campaigns and gathering compelling data. But there's a caveat — over 42% of journalists report receiving between 10 and 100 pitches a day. To cut through the noise, aim to establish long-term relationships with journalists and publishers. Once you've provided value to them, they're more likely to prioritize your pitch next time.What is the disadvantage of starting an agency business? It may not be the right time. In my podcast, The Create & Grow Show, I've spoken with several agency owners who all agree that the agencies are facing challenges. They've experienced a significant loss of clients and find it increasingly hard to attract new ones.Related: 10 Online Careers You Can Start Today With Basically No Money


4. BloggingTransitioning to blogging introduces a more passive, yet intriguing method of income generation. Unlike traditional models, this approach doesn't require trading time directly for money.In one of my previous articles on Entrepreneur, I shared my experience on how I generated income through my ex-blog, thrivemyway.com. My earnings came from various sources, including display advertisements, affiliate marketing and sponsored posts. Eventually, I sold the blog for a six-figure sum. Diversifying income streams can make blogging a less risky venture.For those interested in succeeding in affiliate marketing, my advice is to concentrate on high-yield products. For instance, in the health niche, supplements are lucrative, and that market is growing.5. Become an online personal trainerAccording to one study, the wellness industry could be worth $8.5 trillion (57% growth) by the year 2027. In the U.S., online fitness coaches earn $52K to $93K per year.


These facts make the industry an excellent opportunity for those who are passionate to get involved.Online personal training thrives with digital growth, offering a lucrative and satisfying path by meeting the demand for personalized, remote fitness coaching and enabling global client reach.In conclusion, whatever you choose to do — don't ignore AI. Utilize it to enhance efficiency and save time. AI is not just a hype or a trend; it's the present and will be increasingly integral in the future. To stay competitive, adapting to AI is essential.Related: 10 Ways to Make Money Online You May Not Have Thought Of

This article originally appeared on Business Insider. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Grace Ryu, a 23-year-old content creator based in Houston. The following has been edited for length and clarity.I quit my tech job in March 2023 to explore other income streams. My 9-5 took up too much of my time, and I wanted to focus on ways to make money while I was sleeping or traveling.



Chasing different income streams aligns with my personality — it satisfies my desire to explore and try as much as possible. If I grow bored with one area, I can shift my focus to another, and if one stream isn't that profitable, I have others to fall back on.Here's a breakdown of my eight income streams, with earnings, difficulty level, and time spent each week:


1. Luxury picnic businessEasy rating: 9/10Lucrative rating: 7/10I run a luxury picnic business with my best friend and my boyfriend. We initially posted our products on Facebook Marketplace and school flyers and broke even the first week of promoting them.We re-invested all that money into expanding the business model, like buying more equipment for group picnics. We've since worked with businesses like Kendra Scott, local hotels, and Texas A&M University.We have a six-person team, so I no longer do the physical setup and tear down, and I only put in one hour a week. During March through May, October, and November (peak picnic months), I can take home up to $3,000 a month.It's easy and affordable to start and doesn't require many skills besides having an eye for aesthetics. It's also lucrative because profit margins are very high since there are little to no variable expenses.


2. Influencer brand dealsEasy rating: 8/10Lucrative rating: 10/10I'm a micro influencer, and I have a TikTok account where I post about my life, my streams of income, and product promotions.Brands reach out and ask me to post a dedicated or integrated TikTok video. I used to make content for brands for free, but now I charge at least $1,000 per post.I spend around one hour a week on brand deals. At first, making content and editing was hard because I had to get used to the software and apps. After doing this for two years, I'm very fast at it because I know exactly which clips to add and how to do voiceovers.It takes time to build a following on a platform, but once you get to that point, it's very easy to work with brands for sponsorships. I make between $1,000 and $2,000 per post for about an hour of work.


3. Affiliate marketingEasy rating: 7/10Lucrative rating: 9/10I started doing affiliate marketing through Amazon's influencer program and make anywhere from $500 to $2,000 monthly.In my TikToks, I feature work-from-home essentials from Amazon and link them. Then, people go to my storefront and buy through the links, and I get paid a commission.It takes about five minutes to apply for the program, but you have to have a social media profile that promotes content.If you never post anything, you'll likely get rejected. I have friends who only have a few hundred followers, but they make unboxing videos, so they were accepted.


Anyone can do affiliate marketing because it's easy to start, but the money isn't always guaranteed. It takes lots of time and patience on any social media platform for a post to go viral, which will bring in sales. Once that happens, money comes in fast over a few months, and it's all passive income.4. User-generated contentEasy rating: 4/10Lucrative rating: 8/10User-generated content (UGC) differs from sponsorships because it's content for brands to use directly. I used to work with a lash company, which paid me to make TikToks, but I don't post that content on my account.I have a few retainer clients, which means I'm paid a regular monthly fee in exchange for a set amount of content.I earn about $6,000 to $8,000 a month from UGC. It takes around eight hours a week and can be more demanding than other income streams. I need to craft videos that convert well in sales, which takes extra brainpower.


5. Pet sittingEasy rating: 10/10Lucrative rating: 10/10I got into pet sitting as a side gig while working in tech. I started on Rover, an app that links pet owners with sitters. Setting up a profile and passing a background check is quick, and you can start earning as soon as you're booked.It's ideal for remote workers like me — getting paid to hang out with cute animals is great, and I can still manage other tasks, like checking up on my picnic business, answering emails, or creating content.In January 2024, I was pet-sitting almost every day, and I enjoyed it because it was such a relaxing job. The only downside is I didn't get to travel as much since I needed to stay with the pets.It's an extremely easy side hustle if you understand pet care and behavior. Pets are super easy to work with as long as they're not puppies — puppies are more work.


6. Airbnb arbitrageEasy rating: 2/10Lucrative rating: 4/10Airbnb arbitrage is my least favorite income stream — I may be letting go of this soon because the Airbnb market isn't as hot as it used to be a few years ago.How it works is I rent a property from a landlord for $1,700, for example, and once my business partner and I get the green light to use it as a short-term or mid-term rental, we list the property on platforms like Airbnb and VRBO. We're tenants but act more like property managers, and we then earn profits from these listings.After splitting earnings with my business partner, my net profit is around $600 per month. Since we focus primarily on mid-term stays, which require less frequent turnovers, my partner and I spend about five to six hours monthly on maintenance and cleaning, typically at the end of each stay.It's my least favorite side hustle because the financial risk is the highest — you have to accommodate guest needs, and the work is not enjoyable either. After monthly expenses, I don't think the payout is enough to justify the effort.


7. Selling digital productsEasy rating: 10/10Lucrative rating: 4/10I created a content creation e-book because I've had many people on social media ask me to coach them. Whenever people ask me about content creation, I direct them to my link so they can buy my e-book.I sell it for $20, and each month I make $60 to $80. I don't promote it that much since I only have it as a resource for when people ask.Anyone with enough knowledge about a specific topic can create an e-book or digital product, so it's easy to do. However, it does take time and effort to bring in sales.8. NannyingEasy rating: 8/10Lucrative rating: 9/10I nanny for a family that flies me from Houston to New York three or four times a year. I stay for two to three weeks and get paid $1,200 a week.


My day-to-day is very simple — I take the girls to school in the morning, and when I come back, I can make content or go outside and explore the city. When the girls come home, I eat dinner, play with them, and then put them to sleep.The families I babysit for in Houston and the family I nanny for in New York are all amazing to me and compensate me generously, which makes my job enjoyable and easy. The hardest part is when the kids are sick because I have to be more hands-on. Aside from that, once you become familiar with their routines, it's super chill.I wish I had diversified my income soonerAlthough building my income streams took a lot of hustling upfront, I wish I had started sooner. I went from making $8/hour working a labor-intensive job as a ranch hand to now making over $100,000 a year from only working around 40 hours a month.For those who are considering creating more income streams, don't be reckless or stingy with your spending. Be courageous in investing in yourself, a business idea, or in others. If your dreams don't scare you a little, they might not be big enough.

      Key Takeaways    



        In 2015, at 18, Cao heard about a lucrative business opportunity from a friend: reselling sneakers.
      


        He joined online forums like Reddit to conduct research — then started purchasing online drops. 
      


        After a while, he automated the process, and the venture has generated more than $1.5 million in total revenue.
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Ray Cao, a Gen Z seller on StockX, an online marketplace and sneaker reseller. Image Credit: Courtesy of Ray CaoWhat was your day job when you started your side hustle, and why were you interested in entrepreneurship?I was a student working as a part-time barista earning about $8 an hour (minimum wage at the time) at a bubble tea store in New York City. My family had gotten into $200,000 worth of debt from speculative investments and gambling. We were desperate to the point where my parents borrowed from relatives to get by. This put an obvious strain on the relationship between them, and my family would quickly become the topic of untoward gossip. I was ashamed, scared and insecure. I eventually cultivated these feelings of vulnerability into action and dove into entrepreneurship.



When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?I started the side hustle in 2015 when I had just turned 18. Sneaker and streetwear culture was growing popular, and demand for these coveted brands trended higher. I heard from my friend that this would be a lucrative business opportunity, and we both pursued it. My inspiration for starting and continuing this business was always my immigrant family.Related: I Was a 25-Year-Old Nurse When I Started a Side Hustle to Combat Anxiety. It Made $1 Million in 7 Months — Then Sold for a Life-Changing Amount.


Throughout my childhood and adolescence, I grew to understand that I was much poorer than my peers. My parents were seamstresses and worked around the clock to support the family. My mom would tell me that she only earned a dime for each fabric she had sewn together, totaling only $200 weekly. Even my late grandma would spend her days picking up bottles and cans to recycle for five cents per piece. My parents and grandma navigated their lives here through sacrifice, cultural disparity and language differences. To this day, their story continues to fuel my ambitions and keeps me progressing.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I joined online communities and forums (Reddit, Facebook, NikeTalk) to conduct research and opened a bank account and card to purchase online drops. Eventually, I bought my first item, Supreme Air Jordan Desert Camo 5s (2015), for $225 and sold them locally for a $400 profit.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?As college progressed and my finance career came into focus, I didn't have the energy to grind through the manual labor required for the business (sorting through incoming inventory, shipping outbound orders, conducting quality checks and dealing with returns from purchases and sales). I automated the business through Excel spreadsheets and worked with my parents to facilitate the day-to-day operations. During this time, I also gained access to store inventory at the StockX warehouse. This dramatically reduced my active work time and involvement to 10 hours a month. Everything I needed to manage the business could now be done from my laptop anywhere in the world.Related: Access our best side hustle stories and make more money. Subscribe to Entrepreneur+ now.


As my available capital increased, a new challenge sprouted: order sizing. For example, with $1,000 and a hype release, it was easy to size my order — as much as I could afford. When that available capital increases a hundredfold or a thousandfold, things become more complex. I remember placing a roughly $10,000 order for the Nike Blazer Mid 77 Vintage White Black. About the first 30 sold at a 15% premium, but demand dried up as I flooded the market with available pairs. I lost about $3,000 and quickly learned the importance of order sizing and liquidity.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?During the early growth stages, monthly revenue trended closely with the amount of capital that was readily available. As the business matured, monthly revenues in the past two years peaked at a little under $20,000.What does total revenue look like now?I've earned about $1.53 million in total revenue on StockX.What do you enjoy most about this side hustle?I enjoy the hands-off nature of this business because it allows me to simultaneously progress my finance career (whether it's a new business venture or another corporate gig). The network of partners and relationships I've built along the way is invaluable, and so is being surrounded by so many smart individuals — special shoutout to the StockX team!

Your network is a major barrier to growth, so take every opportunity to show potential partners the value you can bring them. Good information is valuable and scarce: Conduct your market research within small niche communities and build connections organically.

      Key Takeaways    



        Rowley recognized a gap in the market when it came to aesthetically pleasing baby gear — like wraps. 
      


        She bought a few thousand dollars worth of fabric and a used serger and opened an Etsy shop, then got to work. 
      


        After her husband joined the company, they hired their first employee, and sales exploded — to $1 million. 
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Elle Rowley, founder of Solly Baby, a company that produces sustainably sourced baby wraps made of 100% certified TENCEL Modal and other baby gear. In 2023, Rowley stepped away from her day-to-day role (she now serves the brand as a strategic advisor and is on the board), and the company welcomed Nicole Newhouse as CEO to lead the next stage of Solly Baby's growth.Image Credit: Courtesy of Solly Baby. Elle Rowley.When did you start Solly Baby as a side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?



After having my first baby in 2009, I was surprised to find a surge of creative inspiration that I had never known before having kids. My husband was still in school, and I was hungry to start something to supplement our meager student income. By the time I was pregnant with our second child in 2011, the online world was fertile ground for mothers looking to start a side hustle from home. I tried a few different things, but I intuitively knew that there was a gap in the market when it came to aesthetically pleasing baby gear, so I was pretty focused on that space throughout my pregnancy.I loved wearing my first baby, and I'd heard that wraps were the most comfortable way to wear an infant, so being industrious and broke, I made two wraps out of cheap jersey knit fabric — one for me and one for a friend who was also pregnant. While my crude prototype was far from what the product became, I could see the potential for this long piece of fabric to actually be a fashion accessory for the wearer rather than ""baby gear."" What really sealed it, though, was the first time I timidly ventured out holding my toddler's hand and carrying my baby wrapped on my chest. Before we left the front porch, he was asleep and breathing deeply on my chest. The increase in confidence that I felt with each step was palpable. I felt liberated, and at the same time, I'd never felt more connected to my baby. I knew I was on to something.


What were some of the first steps you took to get the side hustle off the ground?I found a fabric supplier in the fabric district of Los Angeles, purchased a few thousand dollars worth of fabric (thanks to credit cards and a loan from my in-laws), bought a used serger on Craigslist for $50 and opened an Etsy shop. Then, I got to work mostly when my babies were sleeping. I turned our house into a factory to make the first 50 wraps. I signed up for every local handmade market that I could find, which didn't garner great sales results, but the feedback I received from people in real life was invaluable. Lastly, in a decision that felt reckless at the time because of the cost, I hired my favorite photographer to take photos of me wearing my son. I had a nice camera and could have ""made-do"" on my own, but I knew that having beautiful images would help compensate for the many other areas where the brand was weak.Image Credit: Courtesy of Solly BabyWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building the business, and how did you navigate them?


Growth is expensive: I had no capital other than the $4,000 loan for fabric, and finance is not my area of expertise, so I knew I would need a very cash flow-positive business model. In the first three years, it was very challenging to finance our growth, but I can see what a gift it was now to have that constraint. Because we had no factoring terms with our suppliers or credit lines, we'd have to pay a hefty deposit on our production when we submitted the purchase order. Then, we'd pay the remainder of the balance upon completion. This made growth slow, and we were constantly underselling. As demand for the product grew, we started placing everything on preorder on our website, which gave us enough to pay for the order. This made it so our customers were essentially funding our growth.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the business bring in at that point?Sales had been growing year over year in 2013, but we were still only grossing a few hundred thousand dollars a year and taking home less than $100,000. Daily sales were still very inconsistent, which made it difficult to have a lot of confidence in hiring employees or even believing that this was anything more than a side hustle. I was hitting a wall of exhaustion when my husband and I made the leap of faith to bring him into Solly Baby with me. He'd finished school and was working with another startup, but we both felt his time would be better spent if we focused our efforts together. This shift immediately led to new growth and vision. His help also freed me up to work more on the business rather than in the business. We then hired our first employee, Kortney, who took over customer service and fulfillment in a way that freed my husband and me up to focus on growth.Just weeks after hiring Kortney, and days before I had my third child in the spring of 2014, we released our spring collection, and the demand went through the roof. Sales went from anywhere between zero to $3,000 per day to $2,000 becoming our new daily baseline — and releases bringing in tens of thousands of dollars in a day. We hit $1 million in sales that November, and by the end of that year, we knew this was much more than a side hustle.


You've since turned your side hustle into a very successful business. What does revenue look like now?It's been amazing to experience the growth we have been able to achieve. To see this business grow from my house to an Etsy shop to reaching millions of mothers, parents and families is truly humbling. As we continued to build the team and find our footing in the market, some years, we saw revenue double year over year. Today, Solly Baby operates at $10 to 20 million in annual revenue.What's your favorite part about running Solly Baby? As a mother of four, connecting with, encouraging and providing products for postpartum mothers during a very transformational time of life has always been life-giving work for me. It will never get old to meet a mother or father who says, ""Your wraps changed my relationship with my baby."" Knowing that our products have the power to change the trajectory of a parent-child relationship is deeply rewarding.


Developing company culture and ethos was also very rewarding. I made our company motto ""small things with great love"" several years ago because I hold a deep belief that small things done thoughtfully create the biggest and best things. This is relevant to growing a business and equally relevant to raising children. Seeing this adopted and trickle down into every part of the company as CEO felt very meaningful.What does your routine look like these days? Are there any helpful habits you'd recommend to other entrepreneurs?Keeping a daily routine is my best advice. I am a big believer in getting up before your kids (unless you have an infant — then sleep as much as you can!), exercising, getting ready for the day and taking at least 30 minutes for spiritual or meditative practice.It was easy in the early days to completely neglect myself to meet the needs of my family and the business, but I strongly believe that we would've grown faster and with more intention had I taken better care of myself from the beginning. I was running on empty all of the time, and it just about broke me in the first two years. What's more is that the business was not stronger because of my ""sacrifices."" I became very depressed and anxious and finally shared this with my husband. We made a self-care plan together, and everything quickly improved in my life, personally and professionally.


What's your best advice for others hoping to start a successful business of their own? We're often encouraged to ""think big"" when it comes to business, but sometimes, thinking ""small"" is the perfect way to begin — mainly because it will get you to begin. I don't think I would have had the confidence to start a multi-million dollar, global company at the age of 25, but I didn't need to. I just needed enough confidence to make the first 50 wraps to help pay the rent and a sincere desire to bring mothers and babies closer through the product. That was all I needed to get the ball rolling, and then my confidence and vision expanded with the company. We kind of grew up together, Solly Baby and me.This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

        He considered driving for Uber or Lyft to supplement his income but had safety concerns.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Sam Ziegler, a 43-year-old drummer based out of New York who has a side hustle providing support on Geeker, which offers on-demand help from IT and software experts. Image Credit: Courtesy of Sam ZieglerWhen did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?



My passion is music, but the gigs, and therefore the income, are not always consistent, so relying on it as a full-time career is not realistic. I started with Geeker in July 2023. I have many years of IT experience and was hoping something like Geeker existed, a remote side hustle where I could apply my skill set to help people solve their computer problems. I was conducting some research on Google and discovered Geeker. My inspiration is my family and the opportunity to help people. Knowing that you make someone else's life easier by solving computer issues is a very fulfilling feeling.What were some of the first steps you took to get started with the side hustle?


I filled out the registration form to become a Geeker, answered a few technical questions they used to measure and qualify my expertise and then had a Zoom interview. After the interview, I was approved as a Geeker.Related: TV Shows All Entrepreneurs Should Be WatchingWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced during your side hustle journey, and how did you navigate them?I am now 43 and have been playing music for 28 years. I went to vocational school for computer repair in 1999 and took a job with IDT. While there, I became skilled in telecom and got certified in Cisco networking technology. Around that time, I was splitting time between the Newark office and the IDT offices in Manhattan. Then September 11 happened, and the towers fell close to the building I was commuting to, and I thought, Life is too short. I left IDT to pursue music full-time. I have been playing weddings, bar and bat mitzvahs and concerts and recording music ever since.Along the way, I have kept my tech skills fresh by taking jobs here and there, but oftentimes, they didn't have the flexibility I needed to keep doing my passion — music-related work. This past summer, I was looking for work as the summer season of busy music gigs was slowing, and I was trying to cobble together something that enabled me to use my tech skills where and when I wanted. I have a family now and had considered driving for Uber and Lyft to bring in some income, but I had some safety concerns and wanted to work from home. I came across Geeker, and it was exactly what I was looking for. I earn between $70-$90 an hour and work as much and as little as I need to, all from the comfort of home. I also get to help people, which I love.

Now the Business Brings in More Than $1 Million a Month — and Boasts Celebrity Fans.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much does the side hustle bring in on a monthly basis now?It varies every month because of the nature of what I do, but I average roughly $2,700 a month for about 28 hours of work.

Daniella Pierson started her media company, The Newsette, at age 19, then built it into a juggernaut valued at $200 million, and became what Forbes called ""one of the wealthiest women of color in the U.S."" Now she's launching a new media company to help people do what she's done — achieve financial freedom.""The whole thing is money equals freedom,"" says Pierson, who is 28. ""It's framing finance as financial fitness, so it becomes a daily practice and something you're actually excited about.""The new company is called Be a Breadwinner. It launches on March 20 with a kickoff event at J.P. Morgan Chase's headquarters in New York City, as well as a newsletter. Other media products, including a podcast network and a book, as well as a new venture capital arm, are slated to follow.



J.P. Morgan Wealth Management is the company's first partner, and Pierson spent a lot of time developing the concept with Kristin Lemkau, chief executive officer of J.P. Morgan Wealth Management. J.P. Morgan will co-host the kickoff event in New York — where speakers include designer Diane von Furstenberg, poet Rupi Kaur, Sakara Life cofounder Danielle DuBoise, and Love Wellness founder Lo Bosworth — and J.P. Morgan will distribute content from the event as well.Pierson says that Be a Breadwinner and J.P. Morgan are currently exploring a longer-term partnership.


Be a Breadwinner will be aimed at a wide audience, but Pierson says she's particularly focused on reaching people like her — someone who, at an earlier stage of life, did not think she could be financially successful. Pierson is open about her mental health challenges, including having ADHD, OCD, and depression, as well as the difficulties she faced starting a business and getting partners to take her seriously.""It's based on the struggles that I faced,"" she says, ""and taking my struggles and my story and everything I learned and building an ecosystem for anyone to become their own breadwinner.""In addition to Newsette, Pierson also co-founded Wondermind, a mental fitness company she started with Selena Gomez and Mandy Teefey. The trio were featured on Entrepreneur's cover in 2021.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Chisom Okwulehie, who started consulting agency Juntero as a side hustle when she was an employee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The piece has been edited for length and clarity. In 2017, I started working at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, where I design and manage infrastructure projects. At the height of the pandemic in 2020, I'd had my first child and was told we wouldn't receive a merit-based pay increase at work, so I wanted to find ways to supplement my income. My father always told me and my siblings that if your spouse dies, you have to be able to cover the mortgage and support your family. I'm a big advocate for diversified income.So, I started Juntero as a side hustle with my husband. Now, it's a corporation that we co-own, split into two subsidiary companies or studios: Juntero Design and Juntero Technology. My husband owns Juntero Technology; I own Juntero Design. Today, Juntero is a full-fledged design and technology business, but it all started with me taking on small projects on different platforms and charging as little as $20.



Back then, I watched a lot of YouTube tutorials to prepare and experimented with my different talents — web design, photo editing, graphic design, architecture design and interior design. People gravitated towards my architecture and interior design services. Initially, I kept my prices low to build a portfolio and accumulate strong testimonials. That credibility is the greatest currency and helped me increase my visibility; for every 10 pieces of positive feedback, I'd raise my hourly rate by $20. Eventually, I learned not to trade my time for money and switched to fixed rates.Related: At 23, She Started a Side Hustle for 'Quick Money.' Now the Business Brings in More Than $1 Million a Month — and Boasts Celebrity Fans.


I made about $55,000 that year, and over $200,000 the next. Then, in 2023, I exceeded $400,000.Then, near the end of 2021, I realized that I couldn't help as many clients as I wanted, so I had to put my ego aside and trust other people. I started hiring other designers on a project-based model. They're not employees; they're contractors. So, since 2022, I've outsourced more than 90% of the work. That helped me scale the business even more. I made about $55,000 that year and over $200,000 the next. Then, in 2023, I exceeded $400,000.At Port Authority, my salary is $125,000. The net profits at Juntero alone are higher than my 9-5 salary, but I plan to stay at Port Authority. Some people think I'm crazy, but I'm on a public student loan forgiveness program and have three years left. Also, I learn so much from my colleagues' expertise.Now that I'm not on the production side of Juntero, I spend more time on marketing and client management. We have two payment structures: a one-time payment model and a subscription-based model. I've spent a lot of time marketing the subscription model. It's an idea that came to me last year. One of my major clients is a developer, so with the subscription model, she can pay the monthly rate and access our services for a range of tasks.

So it's a huge cost savings.I'm very passionate about the subscription model because it's a game changer: It's allowing companies that don't have creative teams to enroll in a membership program and access my creative team for a consistent flow of deliverables, whether it be drawings or 3D models. And it helps these businesses scale, too. One of my clients uses my renderings to consistently sell multimillion-dollar homes over the asking price. With the subscription model, these companies can have five people doing the work for the salary of one; for instance, a marketer could hire a designer at $100,000 a year or enroll with my service and see even more output. So it's a huge cost savings.Related: I Turned My Side Hustle Into a Passive Income Stream That's Earned More Than $1 Million — But Making Money Isn't Even the Best Part


It's essential to diversify your income, especially in this economy. You have to plan for your future and retirement, and you can't rely on your 9-5. If you have the patience, due diligence and organization skills, you should figure out ways to monetize your talents. Make the time to focus on your craft, but only do it if you love it — because you don't want to face burnout.This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

27,This Non-Financial Skill Saved My Career — and We All Have the Ability to Harness It,"Mar 8, 2024",Ross Cameron,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/why-asking-for-help-is-the-missing-key-to-your-success/470460,"
The skill I'm talking about is asking questions. Too often, it seems like a risk to ask questions:""What if they think it's a dumb question?""""What if it was covered before, and I somehow missed it?""Or the more general: ""Smart people have answers; kids learning in school have questions.""I'm convinced that questions get into a deeper part of your brain than statements do. Statements elicit a reaction of: ""Is this true or not; do I believe this or not?"" in your brain.Questions open up a whole horizon of possible thoughts. For example, let's say I ask you: ""What's an example of something you previously thought was 100% obvious in your business, but you later discovered that the reality was much more nuanced?"" Your thoughts won't be about true/false. To answer that question, you need to go deeply into your experiences.



Related: The Most Successful People in the World Ask Questions Constantly. Here's How to Master the Art of Asking QuestionsHere's how asking the right questions saved my day-trading careerI threw myself into learning day trading and had some beginner's luck. The following year, I gave back all my profits and some. I was careful with my money, but no matter how hard I worked, the trend line was not good. At one point, I was heavily in debt, had sold everything I could on Craigslist, and was down to my last chance at day trading.


My desire to figure out how to survive as a day trader led me to ask the most fundamental of questions: ""I've made lots of trades over the last many months. What patterns or factors can I discover around my profitable trades that differ from those in my unprofitable trades?""I could ask this question because I kept a trading journal. I not only had my trade data but also wrote down my strategy at the time I took each trade.Long story short: I discovered that my profitable trades had five common denominators. They related to things like how much the stock was up compared to the closing price on the previous day, plus other factors concerning price, volume and news.Those insights were the key to righting my day trading boat. Since then, I have not only continued to trade but also have a business that involves day trading software, instructional material, and an active community of traders. Asking the right questions has continued to be one of my go-to tactics for gaining insights. In fact, it can be core to your competitive positioning.


Related: Get Your Ego Out of the Way and Ask for Help When You Need ItDefining your unique selling propositionYour ""USP"" is all about how you stand out among your competition. Day trading is a profession full of brash, boasting traders. Many of them brag about a few great trades. But how have they done, all trades considered? That's a question that few of my competitors have published an answer to. Even beginner traders know that no one enjoys an unbroken string of trading conquests. I therefore asked myself: ""How can I differentiate myself from all the other day-trading offerings?"" I found an answer to my question — be the most transparent. That led me to publish audited brokerage statements that cover every one of the 20,000+ trades I've made.I continue to do daily recaps of my trading, including when I get my butt kicked.Related: Asking for Help Might Be the Key to Your Success


Three other types of questions I ask1. Asking for confirmation. Let's say I've just gone over some detailed instructions and goals with someone in my organization. I don't have to wonder whether we're on the same page, because I can ask: ""We've gone over a lot. How would you state in your own words what we're trying to do?"" Very quickly I'll have my answer, and can make adjustments if necessary.2. Asking for targeted learning and troubleshooting. They say it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at something. But I've found it's not the sheer number of hours that counts; it's what you're doing in those hours. Are you mindlessly hitting a ball or practicing a specific swing? If you're trying to improve your sales chops, then deliberate practice involves asking yourself questions like: ""What are all the unique ways I can find where master salespeople address the objection of: 'I'll have to think about it and get back to you.'"" Another example: ""Why is my webinar attendance higher than ever, but my conversion rate is slipping?""3. Targeted planning. If I'm feeling overwhelmed by the hundred things on my list, I ask: ""What three projects will have the biggest effect on my goals?"" There's an even more fundamental question: ""Where do I want to be three months from now?""

The typical American household needs an extra $11,434 a year to maintain the same standard of living it did in 2021. And nearly half of those with revolving credit card debt say spending on necessities contributed to their balance, according to an annual report from NerdWallet.Now, for the first time in a decade, consumer credit scores are taking a hit. The national average FICO score was 717 as of October, down from 718 in July, per FICO, a data analytics company that focuses on credit scoring services.Related: 'Is This a Sign of Trouble Ahead?': Gen Z Is Missing Credit Card Payments, Running Up DebtThe last time scores fell was between April and October 2013, when they dropped from 691 to 690, according to FICO's report, which cites increasing missed payments and mounting consumer debt as contributing factors.""The apparent cumulative impact of higher interest rates, elevated consumer prices, and economic uncertainty has put a financial strain especially on those consumers who heavily rely on credit cards to cover everyday expenses,"" FICO senior director of scores and predictive analytics Can Arkali wrote in the report.



Related: I Went From Substantial Credit Card Debt to Millionaire Status. Here's How I Did It.If an average consumer credit score of 717 seems high, it's variable across generations; length of payment history is one important scoring factor.As of the second quarter of 2023, Gen Z (18 to 26) had an average credit score of 680, millennials (27 to 42) of 690, Gen X (43 to 58) of 709, baby boomers (59 to 77) of 745 and the silent generation (78 and older) of 761, according to Experian data reported by CNBC Make It.

More than half of Gen Zers and millennials have a side hustle, and 80% of them say they need the extra cash due to the state of the economy, according to a recent survey from LendingTree. From driving for rideshare services to teaching courses online, operating cotton candy vending machines, turning your backyard into a dog park, and so much more, there's something for everyone hoping to diversify their income streams — and anyone who might want to launch into full-time entrepreneurship, too.Sometimes, successful side hustlers grow their earnings to the point where they outpace the salaries from their full-time jobs, and it only makes sense to go all in on their new venture. But even people whose side gigs see less initial return might have an entrepreneurial spirit and clear vision that motivates them to commit in full, and with the right strategy and mindset, those businesses can also become highly profitable, hitting six- or even seven-figure months.Below are three women who did just that: Katherine Watercutter, founder and CEO of activewear brand Gold Hinge; Julie Berninger, co-founder of e-printables curriculum Gold City Ventures; and Danielle Cohen-Shohet, founder and CEO of booking and payments platform GlossGenius. Their journeys and areas of expertise are different, but they all know what it takes to go from a side hustle — maybe lucrative, maybe not — to a thriving multimillion-dollar business.

Katherine Watercutter: Gold HingeKatherine Watercutter is the founder and CEO of activewear brand Gold Hinge. When Watercutter was 23 and worked as a sales representative for a distribution company working with kitchen and bath designers around Indiana, she started the business as a side hustle. Lack of funding proved a major hurdle in the beginning, but today, Gold Hinge counts celebrities including Kristin Cavallari and Kaitlyn Bristowe among its fans. The brand also went viral during TikTok's ""RushTok"" trend, garnering 40 million hashtag impressions and sales in the multi-millions.Watercutter's advice: ""My advice may sound as cheesy as it gets, but don't give up. People in this day and age are impatient and sometimes quick to give up when they feel like they keep failing. There were a few times when I thought I hit 'rock bottom' and exhausted all options, but I found a way around it. I felt like I was failing consistently for three years, and I know many would have given up by then, but business is all about problem-solving.""Related: At 23, She Started a Side Hustle for 'Quick Money.'

Berninger worked as a project manager for large tech companies and planned to be in the industry long term, but the ""financial independence, retire early"" (FIRE) movement inspired her to start a side hustle. She opened an Etsy shop focused on the bachelorette party niche, then co-founded the online course business that teaches other entrepreneurs how to find success on the platform. She quit her 9-5 in 2021 when the income from her ventures replaced her salary.


Berninger's advice: ""Don't start a business by yourself! Pick a business partner and scale faster! Also, don't waste time trying to piece information together on YouTube.

In college, Cohen-Shohet did freelance makeup out of her dorm room, and she and her twin sister also collaborated on a digital receipts payments venture. Ultimately, she'd pull from those experiences to help self-care entrepreneurs run better businesses — and build a software company worth over $510 million in the process.Cohen-Shohet's advice: ""Be fearless. Don't take no for an answer. And, importantly, surround yourself with like-minded people. You might find this through a community like the one we've created for entrepreneurs with GlossGenius, or you might look to people closest to you. I've had many close supporters along the way, but my strongest collaborator is my twin sister, Leah. She has been a thought partner from day one and has played an invaluable role in expanding the company into what it is today. So surround yourself with people who get you.""

It's Leap Day: the extra day tacked onto the end of February, typically every four years, to account for the Earth's full 365-day-plus rotation around the sun.And it's Thursday, which is a traditional workday for employees and entrepreneurs alike. But does your annual pay reflect the fact you've worked an additional day in the year? Well, that depends — mostly on if you're an hourly or salaried worker.Related: Leap Year: How To Utilize the Extra Day As An EntrepreneurNaturally, employees paid by the hour will be paid for every hour worked; as a result, those bonus hours worked should show up in the next paycheck. Salaried workers, on the other hand, won't necessarily see any pay adjustment.In this case, are salaried employees getting the short end of the stick? Not exactly, according to CNN Business, as many of those employees will see work hours ebb and flow week to week depending on their projects, so it might work out in the end.But it's worth noting that a 2019 Gallup poll found that 52% of full-time workers reported working more than 40 hours a week, while 39% worked at least 50 hours a week, and 18% worked at least 60.Related: Want to Be More Productive?

When people talk about retirement, typically, they're referring to a linear path: Go as far as you can in your career, turn a certain age and leave the professional world for good. It might be the traditional model, but these days, it doesn't work for everyone — for several reasons.More than half (56%) of American workers believe they're behind on their retirement savings, according to a recent Bankrate survey.

35,This Former Statistics Professor Has Made Over $1 Million 'Investing' in Sports. These Are the 2 Tactics He's Using to Bet on the Super Bowl.,"Feb 7, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/2-tactics-a-retired-professor-uses-to-bet-on-the-super-bowl/469357,"
Former statistics professor David Beaudoin has always had a knack for numbers, and as a sports fan since age five, it wasn't long before he opted to merge the two interests: He placed his first sports bets as a teenager, though he admits ""he was not very good at it.""That changed when Beaudoin started to take mathematics classes at the university level and realized he could use what he'd learned to make a profit on sports. In 1999, Beaudoin found it ""quite easy"" to apply some of those strategies to arbitrage betting, which involves placing wagers on different sides of the same sporting event ""to guarantee a profit regardless of the outcome.""""If Team A plays Team B [and] the lines are very different between a couple of sportsbooks on that game, it is possible to bet Team A with sportsbook No.1, and you could bet Team B with sportsbook No. 2, and of course, you're going to win one bet and lose another, but by adjusting the amount, you are guaranteed to make a net profit at the end,"" Beaudoin explains.



Related: As the Sports-Betting Industry Transforms, Entrepreneurs May Find It Hard to Get in on Gambling Profits — but Related Businesses Will ThriveAfter several years of success with that tactic, it became ""more and more difficult to find good arbitrage opportunities,"" Beaudoin says. That's when he began using mathematical models to help him beat sportsbooks. It turned out to be a highly lucrative pivot; Beaudoin retired at age 43 from his 14-year run teaching statistics at Laval University — and says he has earned more than $1 million sports betting to date.


""The right mindset is very important. You really need to be disciplined with your bets.""Although Beaudoin ""would bet on any sport"" during his arbitrage stint, these days, he prefers to focus on sports he knows well, including the NFL, NHL, NBA, WNBA, MLB, college football and college basketball, because ""only using numbers without knowing the players or coaches [is] not going to be enough to be a winner.""Beaudoin is transparent about his track record on his website — over seven NFL seasons, he says his pick accuracy has never dropped below 50%, ranging from 50% to 75% each season — and acknowledges the fact that the level of success he's seen isn't accessible to everyone. Still, there are a couple of things that anyone can do to better position themselves and mitigate harmful outcomes.Related: The Moment This Online Sports Betting CEO Knew It Was Time to Take a Big RiskFirst, ""the right mindset is very important,"" Beaudoin says.""Some people just can't tolerate losing,"" he explains. ""Now, even if you make money every year, sometimes there will be a week, or sometimes maybe a full month, where you're going to keep losing. And that's inevitable. It's going to happen to everyone. But some people just go crazy when that happens and they start betting big amounts, trying to make up for prior losses. So you really need to be disciplined with your bets.""""You need to bet money that you view it as disposable income.""Second, Beaudoin cautions people against betting money they can't afford to lose.


""I never want to hear people saying, 'I just lost my rent money,'"" Beaudoin says. ""That makes zero sense to me. You need to bet money that you view it as disposable income — if you lose it, it's not going to affect the quality of your life.""In fact, Beaudoin doesn't consider himself a sports ""gambler"" or ""better"" at all. Rather, he calls himself a sports ""investor"" who doesn't feel the need to make bets every day. ""I only like betting when I have the strong conviction that I have an edge over sportsbooks or over casinos,"" he notes.Related: The NFL Will Not Allow Players to Place Bets During Super Bowl LVII Weekend in Las VegasAnd his pick for this year's Super Bowl champion?

He's been up and down in the playoffs, whereas [Patrick] Mahomes, he's been there, done that.""


But it's the ""hundreds and hundreds of"" proposition bets, where people put money on specific events — like if Mahomes will throw an interception — that have the greatest earning potential. And ""there is no way that sportsbooks can have accurate lines on each,"" Beaudoin says.""So there are always some great bargains,"" Beaudoin explains. ""Every year, I spend between 50 and 100 hours analyzing those Super Bowl prop bets, and to me, this is like Christmas. This is the most lucrative day of the year.""Since the Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in 2018, nearly 40 U.S. states have passed legislation to legalize sports betting.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Julie Berninger, Etsy shop owner and co-founder of Gold City Ventures with Cody Berman. What was your 9-5 job and/or primary source of income when you started your Etsy shop?I worked as a project manager for large tech companies. I have my masters in computer information systems and planned to work in the tech field forever.When did you start your Etsy side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?I listened to personal finance podcasts on my lunch break and commute to and from work. I was inspired by people who started Etsy and Amazon shops as side hustles. I was also inspired by the ""financial independence, early retirement"" (FIRE) movement, where people traded in office jobs for jobs with more lifestyle freedom. I loved my job, but I also loved to travel and wanted a bit more flexibility with how and where I worked.



Related: His Side Hustle Solved a Common Problem for Homeowners. Now the Business Brings in $3 Million a Month During Peak Season.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I picked a niche on Etsy that I knew very well: the bachelorette party niche because I was going to a bunch of bachelorette parties. I noticed how people were willing to pay for throwaway items for those events, and order quantities were high because so many people attended the event (usually groups of 15-20 women, with one person making the large purchase for the group). It seemed like a great niche for my shop. I started with temporary tattoos because I knew they would be easy to store in my tiny apartment in Silicon Valley. I didn't have room to sell larger pieces. I didn't have a budget for photography, but I put the tattoos on, went for neighborhood walks and took pictures in front of my neighbors' beautiful rose bushes. There are some gorgeously landscaped lawns in Silicon Valley!What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?


I was averaging around $15-$20 per order with the temporary tattoos, but I was stressed for time. I was squeezing in trips to the post office before and after work. I was also podcasting and interviewing eight guests per week about how they achieved financial independence. I met someone at a conference who sold printables on Etsy, and I was hooked. I switched my product line to selling bachelorette party scavenger hunts and was convinced digital products were the way to go going forward because they required less time. There is very little to no work done after the sale.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill. It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue, and at what point did the side hustle's income surpass that of your full-time job (if it did)?I made around $10,000 per year selling digital products as a side hustle on Etsy. My plan wasn't to leave my day job, though, since I loved working in tech. I didn't have a plan or the space in my life for selling on Etsy to become a full-time thing. Full-time entrepreneurship happened slowly over time. I was also a well-paid tech employee with a master's degree, so it felt very scary to take a leap — and it would have taken a while to replace my income. But I did make six figures total over a few years between Etsy and blogging about my personal finance journey. I eventually left my full-time job in 2021; by then, the money from my ventures replaced my full-time job.


When and how did that side hustle lead to Gold City Ventures? How does Gold City Ventures help aspiring side hustlers?The episodes on my podcast about my side hustles were always the favorite episodes with listeners. I recorded how I created and sold digital products on Etsy in YouTube videos first.I had my first kid in 2019, and I launched Gold City Ventures, my online course business, soon after with a business partner using those videos as the main curriculum. We've improved our curriculum over the years and now have the step-by-step course to start an Etsy shop for digital products.Over 15,000 students have bought the course, and some have achieved some amazing results. We've had students who make this their full-time job and have earned over $70,000 in one year on Etsy. It's been a lot of fun to help people start small businesses.


What I love about Etsy is that it brings the customers (90 million per year) to you, and digital products are a low-risk small business since it doesn't cost much to start, and you don't have to buy inventory; you are just spending your time. It's also good if someone only has a few hours extra per week and just wants a side hustle.Related: This Former Teacher Started a Side Hustle That Made More Than $22,000 in One Month: 'I Have Never Been More Fulfilled'How much average monthly revenue does Gold City Ventures bring in now?Gold City Ventures makes over $100,000 per month, and we've expanded to offer many additional services such as live coaching, a community and done-for-you templates.


What's your best advice for other side hustlers who hope to find success selling online?Don't start a business by yourself! Pick a business partner and scale faster! Also, don't waste time trying to piece information together on YouTube. Pay for a step-by-step program or a business consultant because your time is valuable.

38,Visiting Disney Can Be So Complicated That People Are Taking Classes to Get 'a Grip' — But This Simple Mistake Will Derail Even the Best Planners,"Feb 1, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/genie-plus-complicates-disney-visitors-take-classes-to-plan/469123,"
These days, planning a successful trip to Disney is no longer a walk in the park.Increasingly, visitors have to learn new lingo and strategies for optimizing their experiences amid an ever-evolving system at Disney parks, and some of them are even enrolling in classes to make it easier, The Washington Post reported.Related: Disney Is Suddenly and Without Warning Cracking Down on Third-Party Tour Guides, Some of Which Have Operated For Decades and Help Curate Park Experiences for Disabled Visitors



That's what Rob Kayris and his family of six did last year for a trip to Disney they were ""dumping a boatload of money on,"" according to the outlet. They took a class about the new ride reservation system Genie Plus — a paid service that opens up ""Lightning Lanes"" for visitors seeking speedy access to select attractions — not once but twice.""I feel like if you don't know how it works, you're going to waste probably two to three days before you have a grip on what's what,"" Kayris, a copy machine salesman who lives outside Philadelphia, told the Post.


Learning how to navigate a Disney vacation, which recently saw price hikes, can mean even more spending. Although some influencers and bloggers offer their insider tips for free, VIP tours at the parks can range from $450 to $900 an hour depending on the season, per Disney World's site.Genie Plus, introduced in 2021, replaced Disney's free ride reservation system with a cutthroat model that requires park-goers to begin reserving rides at 7 a.m., according to the online forum planDisney, which is run by Disney's team of advice-givers.Related: 'I Listen To You And To Our Guests': Disney Is Bringing Back Free Parking for Disney Orlando Hotel Stays, Plus Other PerksBut it's not just enough to know the rules — other factors, like slow Wifi, can throw a wrench into even the best-laid plans.

40,8 Simple Ways to Keep Your Finances in Check This Year,"Jan 31, 2024",Erica Dushey Sarway,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/8-simple-ways-to-keep-your-finances-in-check-this-year/468767,"
New Year's is a time when people set unrealistic goals, ones that mostly have to do with dieting or fitness. But if you're practical, a great way to start the year is by setting realistic goals that you can actually maintain.A great place to start is with your finances. Although financial resolutions may sound hard, they are easier than you think. Here are some tips and tricks to keep your banking and money in check this year.Related: 5 Personal-Finance Habits of Wealthy Entrepreneurs



1. Credit score is #1Your credit score is your financial reputation, and this is the year to work on building it up. No matter what your score is, there is always room for improvement. So much goes into a credit score, including timeliness, usage, limit, inquiries, etc. So, focus more on minimizing your debts rather than on opening new accounts and spending up to your limit without paying back. By slowly adjusting your credit habits, you will start to see a positive change in your score.2. On-time paymentsThis year is all about making your credit card or other loan payments on time. More often than not, people do not understand how important on-time payments are and what they can mean for their credit score. A huge part of credit is timeliness, and it becomes a large factor in raising or lowering your credit. Paying on time does not have to be a huge task either! Automatic payments can be your best friend. They make sure that your accounts are paid without having to think or do much.


3. Organize and budget your spendingUnlike last year, you should start writing down and accounting for every dollar in and out of your accounts. While this may sound redundant and boring, writing out the numbers can help you see where all your money is going. This will allow you to categorize your spending and see exactly where you can cut costs and budget. By keeping track, you won't recklessly spend and will be aware of what is always coming in and out of your accounts.4. Save! Save! Save! …. in a savings accountEveryone loves to discuss their savings and how they are always putting money away for the future. This does not have to be intimidating. After breaking down your spending, you'll be able to easily see how much you can save. This amount does not have to be an extreme or high number, it can be something small that will build up over time. If you put $20 each week, you'll have over $1,000 saved by the end of the year. With that, you can open a high-yield savings account that will earn you interest on the money you keep in the savings. This will not only help you save but also give you a return on saving.Related: How To Save Money: 10 Tips to Build Your Savings5. Think about investingIf Covid taught us anything, it's that investing in different things can help you in the long run. While you don't need to be an expert in the stock market or a crypto specialist, looking into different ways you can invest your money and diversify your portfolio may help build up your finances. But beware, investing is not a guarantee — make sure to not put your entire savings and trust into the markets.


6. Fewer inquiries in 2024Many people believe that the more credit cards they have, the better their financial situation will be. Well, that is not technically the truth. While having several lines of credit may be nice and useful, every time a credit card company makes an inquiry on your profile, they report it to the credit bureau. In turn, this can negatively impact your score by bringing it down. This year, we want to improve your score, not lower it! So, stop shopping for more cards and focus on using the card(s) you currently have.7. Improve your knowledgeStart making yourself familiar with the world of finance. You should not have to depend on someone else to give you advice on the best ways to save or spend your money. Find time to read more about credit cards, banking, investing, etc. Although it may seem boring, it can actually be very interesting to learn more about what you can do with your money to set yourself up for success. Make this year about becoming financially independent and confident in your financial decisions.Related: Improve Your Money Skills in 8 Minutes a Day8. Side hustles are all the rageIf you have learned anything from 2023, it's that side hustles are the new normal. People everywhere have been finding new ways to bring in a new stream of income passively or actively. This can help you give yourself a little more breathing room if money is a little tight, or it can be a great way to contribute to a savings account. There are plenty of websites and articles with examples of different hustles that you can start doing to build up your income.


By doing all of this, or even just one, you can drastically change your financial position in 2024. Whether it's improving your spending habits or saving more money, any of these tips can help bring you closer to financial freedom and success this year. Small adjustments can result in the biggest changes.

42,4 Cash Flow Trends To Know About in 2024,"Jan 26, 2024",Nick Chandi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/4-ways-to-improve-your-cashflow-in-2024/468245,"
Effectively managing cash flow is a key aspect of overseeing a business's finances, directly influencing its profitability, flexibility and overall financial well-being. This involves the continuous tracking, analysis and optimization of the money that comes in versus what goes out.When we think about the future in 2024, it's important to realize that many businesses struggle in their early years due to difficulties in managing cash flow. Out of every five businesses in the United States, one doesn't make it through the first year — they fail. And it gets even tougher: by the second year, another two out of every ten businesses close down, and by the fifth year, three more out of every ten go out of business. This underscores the vital role of skillful cash flow management for a business to survive and thrive over the long term.To overcome challenges and succeed in 2024, businesses should be ready to adopt new trends and technologies in managing their cash flow. Let's explore the important trends that will shape the financial landscape in the coming year.



1. Cash flow forecastingIn 2024, there is going to be a growing recognition among businesses regarding the pivotal role of cash flow forecasting, driven by the transformative impact of AI and machine learning technologies. These advanced tools empower organizations to analyze vast datasets, encompassing historical financial information, market trends, and economic indicators.As a result, businesses can now enhance the precision of their predictions and make well-informed decisions regarding future cash flows, marking a significant shift in the approach to financial planning and strategic decision-making.


2. Financial automationArtificial Intelligence and machine learning are bringing about a significant change in automating tasks for businesses. Automation will play a crucial role in streamlining routine financial tasks, such as invoicing, expense tracking and reconciliation. Businesses can reduce errors, enhance efficiency, and strategically allocate resources by automating these processes.For example, automating Accounts Payable (AP) and Accounts Receivable (AR) processes directly impacts cash flow. With AP automation, businesses can expedite invoicing, ensuring that invoices are sent out promptly. On the AR side, automation accelerates payment receipt by efficiently tracking and managing outstanding invoices. This speed in both invoicing and payment collection shortens the cash flow cycle, positively affecting liquidity.Moreover, AP and AR automation minimize errors in data entry and calculations. This increased accuracy reduces the need for time-consuming corrections and ensures that financial records align with actual transactions. By streamlining these financial processes, businesses gain real-time visibility into their cash position, allowing for better decision-making and proactive management of cash flow dynamics.Related: 80% of Businesses Fail Due To a Lack of Cash. Here are 4 Reasons Why Cash Flow Forecasting Is So Important


3. Instant payment technologyThe substantial impact of delayed invoices on 73% of businesses highlights the importance of timely payments. Traditional payment methods, which are both costly and time-consuming, taking 3 to 10 business days to settle, are being reevaluated. The launch of the FedNow Service in 2023 has fuelled the rapid growth of instant payments, with 331 institutions actively participating. Businesses, recognizing the importance of payment modernization, are investing in new accounts receivable (AR) and accounts payable (AP) systems.Businesses can improve their cash flow position by seamlessly integrating instant payment option. The focus on modernizing financial processes addresses the challenge of late payments and positions businesses for a more streamlined financial future.Related: Slow Payment Options Are Costing Your Business — Here's the Alternatives of the Future4. Outsourcing for cash flow optimizationMany small and medium-sized businesses are now seeking help from outside accounting firms for jobs like cash flow consulting and accounting. This smart move frees up their own teams from everyday tasks such as bookkeeping. Instead, they can focus on important financial planning, analysis, and taking care of customers. Surprisingly, 37% of small businesses now choose to outsource accounting and IT services. This shows a growing trend of relying on external experts for important tasks.


The money saved from not hiring and training in-house experts can be used to improve cash flow. Also, having access to special skills and advanced technologies helps make better financial plans. In the end, this way of doing things helps small businesses handle their money better, use resources wisely, and aim for more profits.Related: 4 Crucial Signs That Your Small Business Needs Funding The role of effective cash flow managementThese trends shed light on how technology is reshaping cash flow management. Success in today's business environment hinges on the ability to stay well-informed and adaptable. Despite the ongoing changes, the importance of effective cash flow management remains paramount, offering a critical foundation for success.Adopting innovation is key for small and medium businesses to survive in the competitive market. Those who seamlessly integrate fintech solutions into their cash flow management strategies gain a competitive edge, as these tools offer agility and responsiveness to market changes. Whether through streamlined invoicing processes or dynamic budgeting tools, the adoption of innovative financial technologies empowers businesses to optimize their resources, improve financial performance, and ultimately thrive in a dynamic and challenging business environment.

In my time and success, I've earned from experience that financial mastery comes from several approaches.Here are the four areas to focus on in your personal and professional finances for 2024:


1. Be ruthlessly accountableCategorize your expenses. List out everything. Create a clear and comprehensive budget that allows you to fully understand where your money goes and uncover spending patterns that could be costing you dearly. Many times, people have no idea how much money they are spending. The most timely and best practice is to use an Excel model where you input the data. This forces you to see each transaction a second time and type out the words of the actions you took.You leave money on the table if you are not accountable to this highly accurate degree. I guarantee you will gain insight into your financial health when you closely examine this detailed level.Related: 8 Ways to Stay Accountable With Your Goals2. Increase your marginThe next critical step in this process is to find a way to increase your margin. You can also apply the business principles of profit and loss to your personal life in what is known as a personal financial statement. Both of these figures, P&L and PFS, are critical because they empower you to manage your money more effectively and efficiently. They give you a snapshot of your financial health at any given moment.


In personal finance, consider this a detailed budget that includes all of your expenses, income, liabilities and assets. Document everything. Update it consistently. When reviewing this information on a routine basis, you will be able to make more informed financial decisions that can empower you to gain better overall control.3. Leverage debtYour next objective is to leverage debt, which you should do in business. Financial mastery comes the ability to strategically use debt as a powerful tool. For example, in business, you can use debt to leverage growth by acquiring assets or expanding operations. This allows you to earn more by wisely utilizing debt.Apply the same concept to your finances as well. Excessive debt is very risky in personal finance and must be managed with a careful level of attention. Now that you have a clearly outlined, concise budget, you can make better decisions about how to keep your money flowing. This can help you eliminate unnecessary purchases that then allow you to funnel your resources more effectively. This lets you free up some of those resources so you can pay down that expensive debt.Related: 4 Scenarios When It Makes Good Sense to Take on Business Debt


4. Stay disciplinedIt's challenging, but building wealth and achieving true financial mastery is worth the work. That means working these three steps but also surrounding yourself with those who can support your true growth. Seek out mentors, someone who has been through the process and achieved a better outcome. Join financial forms and attend workshops. Make this your goal on an ongoing basis so you can engage with those who have mastered financial health.It is never too soon to get started or too late to give up. The only mistake you can make in this process is not taking these steps and putting the hard work into the process.When we started Carbliss, we were prepared to lose money for the first couple of years. And by ""prepared,"" I mean that we are actually prepared to lose money. It was part of our plan. With this understanding, we could mitigate our worry over those inevitable losses. We trusted that if we just executed the plan, success would follow.You can achieve these goals within your business and financial well-being as well. Apply these ideas, make a plan, and don't give up, and you will be on your way to mastering your financial well-being in your personal and professional life.

45,3 Things Traders Must Do to Have Success With the Market in 2024,"Jan 19, 2024",Dan Rawitch,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/3-things-traders-must-do-to-succeed-in-2024/468211,"
Staying ahead demands a strategic approach in the dynamic landscape of 2024's financial markets. With the rapid evolution of trading technologies and methodologies, traders must adapt to maintain success. This means focusing on mentorship, AI-enabled trading bots and the principles of prosperity.Throughout my 40 years in the financial services industry, I've witnessed firsthand how these tactics can make or break a trader; here's what you need to know.Related: Strategies For Success: 10 Tips That Can Help You Trade Effectively



1. Adopt a mentorIn the complex world of trading, mentorship can be a game-changer. Having a mentor provides not just guidance but also a valuable perspective that only experience can offer. They can help navigate the often-turbulent financial markets and offer insights that are not readily available in textbooks or online courses.A few steps to get the most out of your relationship with a mentor include:


Identifying the right mentor: Look for a mentor whose trading style and success align with your goals. It's crucial to find someone who not only has the expertise but also the willingness to share their knowledge and experience.Establishing communication routines: Set up regular meetings or communication channels with your mentor. Consistent interaction ensures continuous learning and timely advice.Sharing your trading plan: Present your trading strategies to your mentor for feedback. This will help you refine your approach with expert input.Being open to feedback: Accept constructive criticism and be willing to adapt based on your mentor's suggestions. Remember, the goal is to learn and improve.Applying lessons learned: Actively implement the advice and strategies discussed with your mentor. Real learning comes from the application of knowledge.When engaging with a mentor, it's essential to set clear goals and expectations from the outset. These goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (SMART). Clear goals provide direction and focus, both for you and your mentor. They serve as a roadmap, guiding the mentorship and ensuring that both parties are aligned and working towards common objectives.Regular check-ins and feedback sessions are vital to the mentorship process. They offer an opportunity to assess progress, address challenges and recalibrate strategies as necessary. These sessions should be scheduled at regular intervals and should be used as a platform for open and honest communication.2. Utilize AI-enabled trading botsAI-enabled trading bots represent the forefront of technological advancement in trading. These bots leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to analyze market data, predict trends and autonomously execute trades. Their ability to process vast amounts of data rapidly and accurately gives traders a significant edge.


AI trading bots often adopt a conservative approach to trading, focusing on minimizing risks while seeking steady returns. This method aligns well with a long-term trading perspective, prioritizing sustainability over high-risk, high-reward strategies.When selecting an AI-enabled trading bot, a key criterion to consider is its drawdown level. Low drawdown bots are designed to minimize potential losses, making them a safer choice for conservative traders. It's important to assess the historical performance of these bots, understanding their risk management strategies and how they've performed in different market conditions.Related: How I Turned $583 into $10 Million by Day Trading3. Live by the laws of prosperityThe laws of prosperity, as outlined in popular financial literature, provide a framework for success not just in finance but in all aspects of life. These laws emphasize principles like positive thinking, smart financial management and the power of goal setting.


Incorporating the laws of prosperity into market trading means adopting a mindset that values long-term growth and sustainability. It involves being mindful of your financial decisions, setting realistic goals and maintaining a positive yet realistic outlook on your trading activities. These principles encourage a balanced approach to trading, one that considers both potential gains and risks.A few tips for integrating these laws into a daily routine include:Set clear financial goals: Establish specific, achievable goals for your trading activities. This focus helps in aligning your actions with your financial aspirations.Maintain a positive mindset: Stay optimistic but realistic about your trading prospects. A positive attitude can help navigate through tough market conditions.Practice financial discipline: Stick to your trading plan and avoid impulsive decisions. Discipline is key to long-term success in trading.Invest in continuous learning: Keep updating your knowledge about the market and trading strategies. An informed trader is often a successful trader.Balance risk and reward: Understand your risk tolerance and balance it with the potential rewards. This balance is crucial for sustainable trading.Related: Most Traders Lose Money — Mindfulness Can Help Change That


Emphasizing reliability in trading systemsA reliable trading system or bot is the backbone of successful trading. It should provide consistent performance, be resilient in various market conditions and align with your trading style and goals. Reliability in your trading tools allows you to trade with confidence and peace of mind.The adage ""Slow is fast"" emphasizes the benefits of a steady, methodical approach to trading. Rushed decisions often lead to mistakes, while a measured approach allows for thoughtful analysis and better decision-making.In the end, mentorship, AI-enabled trading bots and the laws of prosperity offer unique advantages and can provide a solid foundation for successful trading. Implementing these strategies is crucial for traders looking to succeed in the ever-evolving market of 2024. As the trading landscape becomes more complex and competitive, having a well-rounded approach is more important than ever. These strategies provide the tools and mindset necessary to adapt, grow and thrive in the financial markets of tomorrow.

46,9 Ways To Build a Secure Financial Future as a Single Parent in Modern Times,"Jan 19, 2024",Pierre Raymond,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/9-ways-to-build-a-secure-financial-future-as-a-single/468565,"
Households headed by a single parent are becoming more frequent in the United States, with younger generations, typically Millennials (born 1982-1996) and Generation Z (born 1997-2012), finding traditional nuclear family structures obsolete.Nowadays, many young parents opt to adopt or raise a child by themselves. The research found that nearly a quarter of American children under the age of 18 lived with one parent and no other adults in 2019. The U.S. has the highest share of children living with only one parent compared to other developed nations.Other statistics showed that in 2023, around 15.09 million children lived with their mothers, while about 3.05 million were being raised in a household headed by a single father.



All of this research points to the increasing awareness of more households in the U.S., either having a single parent or children sharing households among their parents. Although many often claim that divorce, separation, death, or having a child outside of a relationship are the biggest reasons for children being raised by a single parent, new studies have actually shown that younger parents are finding marriage and traditions as absolute.Roughly 46 percent of Millennials and 44 percent of GenXers (born 1965-1980) now say that marriage is becoming obsolete, looking to create a more blended family dynamic where children can be raised in single or dual-income households.Typical single household earningsAlthough many younger parents are looking to raise a child independently, without a partner, the financial implications of raising a child have become increasingly problematic, especially in the United States.New data suggests that around 32 percent of single moms earn $40,000 and more, while only 10 percent of single mothers bring home more than $80,000 per year.Other research by the Pew Research Center has found that single mothers or solo mothers have the highest poverty rate per household, with 30 percent living in poverty and only 17 percent of solo fathers.Around 16 percent of cohabiting couples are said to live in poverty, while the minority, 8 percent of married couple households, earn below the poverty threshold.


Most recent analysis showed that the U.S. poverty threshold for a family of four is $29,960, while with an individual that can be as little as $14,891 per annum.With the cost of living sharply rising over recent years due to record-high inflation, single parents have had the most challenging time adjusting to higher costs of essentials, including groceries, utilities, and housing. That excludes having enough money to cover other expenses such as child care, school fees, and transportation and having enough left to put away in an emergency fund.How to budget more effectively as a single parent in modern AmericaAs if being a single parent wasn’t already an expense, or hard enough, juggling both career and family responsibilities, rising costs, and economic uncertainty have only made a deeper dent in single-family households’ expenses in recent years.Having a budget is now more crucial than ever before, and for single parents, planning for their child’s future to help secure their future is becoming increasingly challenging for many.However, despite eye-watering costs, there are ways you can budget as a single parent and still have a bit of cash left each month to put towards an emergency fund, social security, or savings.Know where your money is goingOne of the best ways to start budgeting as a single parent is by knowing where your money goes each month. While you may have already been making some cutbacks, and trying to live as frugal as possible, without clear indication or proof of where all your money is being spent, you’ll have difficulty keeping track of your expenses.Gather as many bills, bank statements, and payslips as you have. By conducting an analysis of your income and keeping a score of your expenses, you’ll begin to have a better picture of everything you’ve received and all the money that has been spent.Consider how much you are making compared to how much you’ve spent. You’ll also need to look at things such as any debt(s) you may owe, and how much you are putting aside into your savings each month.


By visualizing your finances, you will begin to see where you may have been spending more money on things that you will need to cut back on, while other things, such as debt or savings can receive a bit of attention.Create a realistic roadmapOnce you’ve gathered all of the information, consider planning a possible roadmap that can help you better understand how you can begin to puzzle everything together in a way that makes sense to you.The four main budget categories to consider include:
Income
Expenses
Debt
Savings
For each paycheck you’ve received, consider how much money you’ve brought home and where those checks have been spent. By looking at your expenses, you’ll better understand what are the things that may be eating deeper into your pockets each month.On top of this, you can consider any debt which you may be carrying. Clearing any debt is one of the best and perhaps easiest ways to reduce any unnecessary expenses, and divert more cash towards other things.However, it’s essential to remain realistic about these things, as you don’t want to burden yourself or make too many lifestyle changes that could lead you or your children to live an even more uncomfortable lifestyle.Pay off small and high-interest debtAs a rule of thumb, one of the best ways to reduce your debt burden is to pay off any small accounts or high-interest-bearing debt as quickly as possible.Dusty McMullin, Vice President of Operations at Sibu Sea Berry Therapy, a specialty supplement and functional foods company, says, “One of the best rules our father taught my brother, Peter, and I about debt is to pay any small debt off first.”


Dusty and Peter McMullin are second-generation entrepreneurs now managing partners at their father, Bruce McMullin’s business, which he founded in 2004.Any small debt, whether $100 or $1,000, can become a heavy burden on your household’s finances each month. Creating a debt repayment plan will ensure that you can steadily begin to lighten the burden, making small monthly contributions or covering the accounts in full by paying a lump sum amount.However, before doing this, ensure you have enough cash in reserve to help carry you through the month or cover other expenses. Although it’s essential to pay off all debts you may have, doing so at the expense of your family can deter your financial well-being.Budget for debt and savings after expensesOn the topic of paying off debt, another easy way to begin balancing your household’s books is by following a simple equation that many people use to budget for their monthly expenses, including debt and savings.Following the 50/30/20 rule allows you to allocate enough of your income towards your household expenses (50%) and necessities, including debt (30%), and the remaining 20% is reserved for savings.Take your income, subtract your expenses, and you’re in the green if you have any cash left. Any remaining cash will then need to be divided into things such as your necessities, which can be purchased, such as services and goods, and also debt.Any remaining cash you have left can be deposited into a high-yield savings account separate from your existing checking account to ensure you don’t unnecessarily or knowingly spend that cash.Open a high-yield savings account“Saving for a rainy day, especially as you’re starting, is one of the best financial decisions any person can make,” says Dusty. He further says, “Having something to fall back on is crucial. And while it’s perhaps harder these days to save, seeing as high costs continue to eat into consumers’ disposable income, every little bit of money put towards a savings account can amount to something bigger in the long-term.”


A separate high-yield savings account would mean you can deposit any remaining cash into this account and leave it to grow. Using this account as a safety net, you can motivate yourself to save towards something that will provide you with a substantial return when you need it the most.Be more practical with your spending habitsWhile some things are more important than others, being more practical with your money would allow you to stretch every dollar and penny you have in your account.Things such as buying in bulk or doing your monthly grocery shopping at a wholesale food outlet would allow you to save more and instead stock up on necessary items that can last longer. Comparison shopping is also another way to ensure you get the best possible price for any item you may need.You can further purchase in-store brands instead of more specialized products or items. Buy things that will last longer in your fridge or freezer that won’t spoil too quickly, or plan your meals each week, indicating how much you can spend on groceries and other items.You can also make additional cutbacks around your home, such as canceling any expensive subscriptions, choosing more budget-friendly options for things such as streaming services, or splitting the costs with a friend or family member.For more significant purchases such as household items, search for better deals online or even on second-hand marketplaces. You can always shop for furniture at the local thrift store or a nearby hospice store.Get into the habit of controlling what you canAs a single parent, you already have a lot on your plate that you need to deal with in your day-to-day life, and having additional financial stress is perhaps the last thing you want to consider when going to bed at night.Dusty says, “At our business, the wheels can fall off at any moment, and while we always need to plan for these moments, however, during these times, we encourage our team members to focus on those obstacles they can control, before having to tackle additional problems.”


This can often be applied in our own lives as well. By focusing on those financial pain points we can control right now, such as having too much debt, or running out of cash each month because our expenses outweigh the money we make, we can actively do something to make slight improvements.Remember that everything takes time. While you may be making slight cutbacks here and there, you’ll eventually reap the rewards thereof in the near future.Talk to your children about moneyThis may be a subject that is often heavily debated among parents and caretakers, however, it’s important to talk to children about money, especially from an impressionable age.As a parent, you can decide for yourself what is the best way to approach the scenario, but taking the time to teach your children the value of money or how to work with an income and expenses can help them better understand how money works once they start making their own.According to experts at the Child Mind Institute — talking to children about money, whether this may be teaching them how to set up a budget, or even showing them how your household expenses work, will teach them financial responsibility.More than this, some suggest that teaching children about money from a very young age will help them make better financial decisions, allow them to know when to set limits, and reduce the urge to impulse buy.Whatever your parenting style or technique, consider finding a workable solution that allows you to share financial knowledge with your children. Try to make it fun for them to understand better, or look for ways to incorporate smart spending when you’re out doing a monthly grocery haul.Try to share expensesWhere possible, find a workable solution that allows you to share your household expenses with your partner, a friend, or a family member. While the topic of money can always feel like a sensitive subject for someone, addressing the elephant in the room will help clear the air, especially if there is more than one parent in the mix.


Try to find a way where both you and your partner can split certain costs, such as child care or other expenses related to the kids. If you’re a single parent with no other dependents, consult with a family member or friend and see whether they would be open to moving in together, allowing you to split rent and utility bills.Approaching a family member could be another option. Where possible, see if they can help you out by renting a bedroom or two in their house or maybe even allowing you to split other expenses, such as subscription costs or internet bills.While it’s not always easy to talk about money with others, informing others that you need help will perhaps encourage them to know that you are relying on them, at least until you can find your feet again.Wrapping UpBeing a single parent is perhaps one of the most challenging jobs in today’s economic climate, and things are only more challenging for those who have to endure these struggles themselves.As the main breadwinner of your household, you must ensure that you have complete control over every dollar you earn and spend each. As a parent, you want to ensure you can provide for your children and help them secure a prosperous future.Approach your financial situation with an open mind, and make the necessary cutbacks if needed. Rely on your instincts to make hard decisions and focus on what you can control right now.While these can all be challenging moments in your life as a parent, taking a small step forward each day begins to make a big difference in the long-term financial well-being of your family.Featured Image Credit: Photo by Kindel Media; PexelsThe post 9 Ways To Build a Secure Financial Future as a Single Parent in Modern Times  appeared first on Due.

47,A Step-by-Step Guide to Achieve a Year of Financial Freedom,"Jan 17, 2024",John Kitchens,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/a-step-by-step-guide-to-achieve-a-year-of-financial-freedom/468210,"
While many would agree that the past year has gone by so fast, we cannot deny that it hasn't been kind to everyone. It has brought on a rollercoaster of events that challenged the way we run our business and our lives. Everyone felt that it was a tough year, and it left many of us feeling uncertain and overwhelmed by the constant changes. However, whether the challenges were big or small, let's not forget that we are here and have successfully made it through 2023.So, let's all take a deep breath and give ourselves a pat on the back for making it this far. It may have been a rough year but now another chapter awaits us, and it's the perfect time to reset and remind ourselves that financial freedom is not a far-off dream. By starting the year with the right approach, it's always possible to take a step closer to our goals and achieve financial freedom.Related: 5 Steps to Gaining Financial Freedom



Step 1: Evaluating your current realityThe very first thing to consider is your current standpoint. Your status quo. Where are you currently at? What's your current reality? Learning where you are right now, financially, gives you a good look at your advantages and disadvantages. It reveals what you lack, and it reveals what cards you are able to play. This allows you to get an idea of the current structure of your financials.If you haven't been able to evaluate your financials, it's time to put a process in place wherein you're constantly reviewing your financials. What does it cost to run your life and your business? What does it cost to break even? What's the absolute dollar amount that you are spending? Are you getting returns on those dollars being spent for the most time? Do you have a strict budget? Are you focused on revenue targets? Are you focused on profit targets?


Once you get clear on these things, and when you know exactly where you are financially, it changes the way you look at your business. It allows you to see the bigger picture of your finances and gives you a better understanding of what needs to be done. This step is necessary as it becomes the basis of what your plan for the year should look like.Step 2: Starting with the end in mindHave you ever wondered why we rarely manage to fulfill our New Year's resolutions? A big part of the reason is that we don't have a clear vision or destination in mind. We simply list random goals that we want to start doing and forget that our goals should have a purpose. They should lead us somewhere and not just be a mere item on our list. You don't want to start doing things and hope that they will lead you to the path of success. Instead, we need to approach our goals with a clear and specific vision of what we want to achieve.Where do you want to be by the end of the year? What results do you want to see?We should be in a headspace where we have a specific end in mind. This mindset alone allows us to create a path and a structured plan towards our goal. So, from this point forward, we should set a target of what specific number of dollars we want to achieve for the year. Having a specific target provides clarity and makes it easier for you to strategically customize a plan that fits your vision.


""Shall we not, like archers who have a mark to aim at, be more likely to hit upon what is right?""― Aristotle, The Nicomachean EthicsRelated: 5 Actionable Steps to Pave Your Way To Financial FreedomStep 3: Building your planNow that you have established a starting point and an end goal, you should be able to create a plan that can lead you to your destination. A structured plan provides a clear roadmap of what actions you have to take for the year to reach your target. Many people fail to follow through with their plan because they tend to make it too complicated and unrealistic. Placing too many activities will overwhelm you and spread you too thin to be able to make real progress.


Do not swallow more than you can chew. Keep it simple and realistic.Remember that a plan is a tool that's supposed to help you progress easily. So forget about the unattainable ideas, and start by breaking down your yearly target into small manageable pieces. It is important to create milestones for your plan on a quarterly, monthly, weekly or daily basis. This will allow you to take challenges one step at a time and keep your progress at a steady pace. With a plan in place, you'll know exactly which steps to take, eliminating guesswork and providing you with a powerful tool to strategically move closer to your goals.Step 4: Setting your plan into motion""Vision without action is merely a dream. Action without vision just passes the time. Vision with action can change the world.""-Joel Arthur Barker, The Power of VisionImagine being a sailor with a map, but you choose to stay at the harbor instead of setting sail. The map is worthless unless you use it to navigate the seas. Similarly, your plans are only as good as the actions that follow them. Articulating your plans into reality requires more than just effort. It requires immense commitment from you. Many people do not fully understand what it means to be committed to the plan. Being committed is not just simply being able to follow through the steps. It means that you are willing to be consistent, willing to put in the work and willing to make yourself accountable every step of the way.When you look at people who are consistently achieving their goals, you see that it's not the big achievements that make them different. It's their commitment to their plan and their process.In essence, commitment is falling in love with becoming the person who does the work — to be able to have the passion to step outside your comfort zone and fall in love with the grind. All of these factors are essential ingredients for a successful execution.Related: The 4 x 4 Financial Independence Plan for Entrepreneurs


Step 5: Going above and beyondAs you venture on your journey towards financial freedom, it's crucial to understand that the path isn't always linear. Change is the only constant in life, and this applies to your financial journey as well. Economic conditions shift, personal circumstances evolve, and business landscapes transform. It's not a question of ""if"" these changes will happen, it's a matter of ""when."" Therefore, going above and beyond must involve anticipating these potential shifts and creating a strategy that would allow you to be flexible enough to adapt.Be sensitive to understanding external factors, remain vigilant about changes in your industry, and continually update your skills and knowledge to stay relevant. Always remember that prevention is better than cure. Investing in yourself and making sure that you're prepared for any changes is never a wasted effort. Sometimes, going above and beyond with your plan can be the difference between success and failure.So, as you embark on this journey, remember that you have the power to shape your financial destiny. It's your year to thrive, achieve and create the life you desire. Embrace it with confidence, and let your pursuit of financial freedom be a source of inspiration and empowerment in all aspects of your life.Here's to a year filled with financial success, personal growth and the realization of your dreams. The future is yours to create. Keep making it happen!

48,5 Surprising Ways to Cut Household Costs,"Jan 17, 2024",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/5-surprising-ways-to-cut-household-costs/468537,"
Are you feeling the pinch of rising living costs? Don’t worry, you’re not alone. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, American households had $17.29 trillion in debt, and the average household debt was $103,358.It goes without saying that many of us are looking for ways to save money and stretch our budgets. Although reducing household costs by cutting back on obvious expenses like dining out and entertainment is a good start, there are many other ways to cut household costs that you may not have considered.1. Be a pro at DIY.To become a DIY pro, you must invest time, effort, and willingness to learn. I’m not saying you’re going to be the next HGTV star. Even so, DIY can be very rewarding and fun. As a bonus, these DIY solutions can also save you money:




Learn basic repairs. Make minor household repairs yourself instead of hiring a professional.
Cook at home. Compared to eating out, preparing meals at home is much cheaper. Learn how to cook budget-friendly recipes.
Upcycle and repurpose. Instead of buying new items, give old ones a new lease on life. DIY projects can add value to your home and make it more functional.
Clean your home with homemade products. You can make your all-purpose cleaners with pantry items such as baking soda and vinegar. They’re very cheap and easy to make too.
Embrace the sharing economy. Instead of buying new tools or equipment, borrow them from friends or neighbors. You can reduce transportation costs by using services such as carpooling and bike sharing.
To get started, follow these steps:
Start small. You shouldn’t attempt to tackle a major project right away. Developing your confidence and skills will be easier if you begin with small, manageable tasks. If you want to start small, you can fix a leaky faucet or paint a small room.
Do your research. Whenever you begin a new project, it is important to do your research and gain as much knowledge as possible. By doing this, you can avoid mistakes and ensure the success of your project. Videos, books, and websites are available both online and in libraries.
Gather the right tools and materials. Your project will be much easier to complete if you have the right tools and materials. Before you begin, purchase everything you need from a hardware store or home improvement center.
Watch tutorials and read DIY blogs. Tons of online resources are available to learn how to do DIY projects. Watch YouTube tutorials, read DIY blogs, and visit websites like Home Depot and Lowe’s for project ideas and instructions.
Join a DIY community. You can find tips, advice, and inspiration from many DIY communities online and offline.
2. Hack your utilities. American households spend an average of $6,888 per year on utilities, including telephones, internet, electricity, and gas. As a result, it is not surprising that utility bills represent a significant expense for most Americans. Fortunately, you can reduce your energy usage and utility bills by taking these steps:Unplug energy vampires. Despite not being in use, these electronics draw power. Therefore, unplug your chargers, game consoles, and TVs when not in use. According to the DOE, you can save up to $100 per year by turning appliances off regularly.Invest in energy-efficient light bulbs. In addition to using around 70% less energy than traditional bulbs, LED bulbs can also last up to 25 times longer than traditional bulbs. As a result, switching to LED bulbs saves you money both on your electric bill and on replacement bulbs.Adjust the thermostat settings. If you adjust your thermostat seven to ten degrees from its normal setting for eight hours each day, you can reduce electricity costs by up to 10% annually. It is easy to schedule temperature changes with a programmable thermostat so that you use less energy when you are not using it.Conserve water. Don’t take long showers and fix leaky faucets. Also, replace your showerhead and faucet aerators with low-flow ones. When doing laundry and washing dishes, use full loads. And, if you want to water your plants or wash your car, consider collecting rainwater.Protect your home from leaks.Having air leaks can lead to your heating and cooling system working harder and consuming more energy. Keep an eye on your doors, windows, and vents to ensure that you aren’t paying for extra electricity. Caulk is a simple, low-cost fix for sealing these areas.


Get your chores done during off-peak hours. Take advantage of off-peak hours to save money on your monthly electric bill. It is common for power companies to charge lower rates before 3 p.m. and after 7 p.m. So, you might get a lower rate if you’re doing laundry at night or running the dishwasher in the morning.Make use of ceiling fans.In hot weather, ceiling fans can keep your home cool, and in cold weather, they can keep you warm. As a result, you will use less energy while staying comfortable.Negotiate a better internet deal. Ask your existing provider about any promotions, discounts, and subsidies. Alternatively, you can negotiate a price match or a waiver of price hikes. To save even more, consider bundling your internet with other services, such as phone or TV.3. Slash your grocery bill in half.The average cost of groceries for one person per month is $250 to $550. And that’s not counting how much people spend on takeout or eating. Therefore, reducing your grocery bill can save you a lot of money.
Plan your meals. Plan your weekly menu and stick to it. By doing this, you’ll avoid impulse purchases and maximize the amount of food you can consume.
Embrace store brands. Many store brands offer similar quality at a fraction of the price of name brands.
Buy in bulk. You can save up to 50% by buying in bulk.
Use coupons. Make use of coupons and cashback apps to save money.
Shop in season. You can often find cheaper and better-tasting seasonal produce. Visit farmer’s markets to find fresh, locally grown produce at competitive prices.
Reduce food waste. Minimize waste by learning proper storage techniques, planning meals based on portion sizes, and composting food scraps.
Get creative with food waste. You can make delicious and nutritious broth using vegetable peels and ends. Chicken bones can be used to make a delicious stock for soups and stews. To make French toast or casseroles, breadcrumbs can be made from even stale bread.
Together, these changes should result in a drastic decrease in your food costs.4. Talk cheaply.CNBC reported in June 2023 that the average monthly cost of a cellphone plan is $144, according to JD Power. Averaging over $1,700 a year, this is not a small expense. To reduce that cost, try the following:
Enroll in autopay. You can save between $5 and $10 on your wireless bill with automatic payments.
Consider bundling with friends and family. If you can involve a larger group, per-person costs will be lower. Verizon, for instance, offers a single line for $70 per person without taxes and fees under its “Start Unlimited” plan. A four-person plan will cost $35 per person without taxes and fees.
Prepay your phone. If you switch to a prepaid plan or carrier, you can avoid the credit check and the costs associated with postpaid plans.
Switch to an alternative low-cost carrier. Using a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), such as Mint Mobile, Consumer Cellular, or Republic Wireless, is often much cheaper than using a large carrier, such as Verizon or AT&T.
Change or remove your cell phone insurance. It is common for cell phone carriers to offer different protection plans. Almost any Bluetooth-enabled device in your home can be covered by extended warranties, insurance, and 24/7 tech support.
Don’t upgrade your phone. The average smartphone lasts over two years, but many people upgrade after 24 months.
Take advantage of discounts. You may qualify for a cell phone discount if you are a student, government employee, military service member, or employee of certain businesses.
Use Google Voice. You can place calls and send texts for free as long as you use your Google Voice number to communicate with other U.S. numbers.
5. Reduce your housing costs.Most likely, your biggest expense is housing. People earning below $50,000 spend at least 36.6% of their income on housing. According to financial experts, this is higher than the rule of thumb of 30%. Also, mortgage lenders prefer that applicants spend 28% of their pre-tax income on housing.In some cases, reducing housing expenses could seem like a drastic measure. However, it is something worth considering and possible to do.


There are many ways for renters to save money on their rent. Here are a few:
Find a roommate.
Park for free instead of paying.
In exchange for a break in rent, offer to do repairs yourself.
If possible, consider moving to a cheaper apartment or region in your region or even the country.
Those who own a home have the following options:
Your mortgage payment can be lowered by refinancing to get a lower interest rate.
Get rid of private mortgage insurance. You will have to pay PMI if you did not pay 20% down when you bought your house. After 20% equity is reached, it’s removed from your account. Even if you haven’t paid down much of your mortgage, check your area’s home values. When they’ve increased, your home’s value has increased as well. You may request your lender to cancel your PMI if the value of the property is high enough that you have 20% equity.
Consider renting out part of your home, or even the entire house, on a short-term basis.
The following options are available if you can’t refinance but are still underwater on your home loan:
If you are experiencing hardship, contact your lender. This is usually done by freezing repayments, freezing interest rates, or paring back payments. Please note that interest will continue to be added to your mortgage.
Interest-only payments. You might consider an interest-only loan if you’re looking for a more affordable mortgage than a fixed-rate loan. If you do not make principal payments at the beginning of your loan term, you will have a better cash flow from month to month.
Move to a new home. The cost of living can be reduced if you move to a cheaper area or buy a smaller house. Giving up your car and walking to work may even be possible if you can move closer to work. For those retiring early or approaching retirement, this is especially important.

In a world where economic stability can seem like a distant dream, taking control of your financial future is more important than ever. Passive income isn't just a buzzword; it's a strategic approach to diversifying your income streams and securing financial independence.At its core, passive income is about making your money work for you. It's income earned with minimal ongoing effort, a stark contrast to the 9-to-5 grind. The beauty of passive income lies in its ability to generate earnings over time, often with an initial investment of time or resources.Related: 5 Ways Passive Income Can Help You Change Your Financial Future



Understanding passive incomePassive income isn't synonymous with ""no effort."" It typically involves an initial investment of time, effort or capital. But once established, these income streams require much less active involvement compared to a traditional job.You will never be truly financially free if you are working. Financial freedom means you are free to pursue anything in life without financial constraints. This is how passive income is so monumental to your financial growth. To be financially free, you MUST have a passive income portfolio. Over time, these streams can grow and compound. This offers you not just stability but also the opportunity for exponential wealth growth.


Finding your Financial Independence Number (FIN)Your Financial Independence Number (FIN) is your monetary amount needed from passive income sources to not rely on traditional active income. In other words, it is the amount you need your passive income sources to make to cover your expenses and not have to work. To find your FIN you want to:Add your direct monthly expenses (food, utilities, transport, etc.)Calculate your indirect monthly expenses for one month only (e.g., mortgage: divide annual amount by 12)Add your monthly subscriptionsCreate a sum total of all three above categoriesAdd a 10% buffer of the sum total (e.g. $5000 = $500)Add the last two categories to create the grand total — this is your monthly FINUse your FIN number to analyze your investment goals. It is a great starting place to build your passive income portfolio.


Types of passive incomeThe concept of passive income can be broken down into two primary categories:1. Investment-driven income: This involves putting your money into assets or ventures like stocks, real estate or mutual funds.2. Resource-based income: This includes leveraging assets you own, such as renting out property or monetizing a skillset through digital products.10 strategies for building your passive income portfolioStarting doesn't necessarily require a hefty financial investment. Many passive income strategies can be initiated with minimal funds but require your creativity and commitment.


Energy investing (oil and gas): The elite tier of passive income, very lucrative market and high returns.Rental properties: Potentially lucrative but requires managementMoney market accounts: A lower-return interest-earning deposit accountIndex funds: A low-effort, diversified stock market investmentDividend stocks: Invest in companies that pay regular dividendsSmall business investments: Tap into equity stakes in local businessesContent creation: Leverage your expertise to create and sell digital productsCreative works: Monetize artistic talents through platforms like Etsy or ShutterstockAffiliate marketing: Earn commissions by marketing products on your blog or websiteAsset rentals: Generate income by renting out property, vehicles or equipmentRelated: Anyone Can Start a Passive Income Side Hustle For Easy Money — But Only If You Know These 5 Essential Tips First.Risk tolerance To understand the right passive income source to begin building your portfolio, you need to know your risk tolerance. Risk tolerance refers to how much risk you can take without impacting your financial security. There are some great risk tolerance calculators online that can analyze this for you. Make sure you complete this step before diving in.


Accredited investing — top-tier growthNow, just as all passive income streams are not created equal, some require you to reach specific milestones to engage with them. These streams often involve you needing to be an accredited investor. Put simply, being an accredited investor means you satisfy one of the two criteria below:You have an annual income exceeding $200,000 (or $300,000 together with a spouse) for the last two years, expecting the same in the coming year; and/orYou have a net worth exceeding $1 million, not including the value of your primary residence.Investments with higher returns typically require you to reach this status. This is because they are often off-market and carry higher risk compared to public investments. But just because they have higher risk, doesn't mean the risk in itself is high — it just means it is higher than publicly available investments. Start by educating yourself on what accredited investing is, and aim towards this as your long-term investing goal.

We can problem-solve for my clients' last-minute requests and also have the ability to help other notaries make additional income and grow their businesses. We also take pride in teaching and giving other newer notaries the opportunity for signings as these notaries become loyal to our business.Related: This Former Teacher Started a Side Hustle That Made More Than $22,000 in One Month: 'I Have Never Been More Fulfilled'What's your advice for other side-hustlers who hope to turn their ventures into successful businesses?Believe in yourself and simply go for it.

The people who put in the work will get the desired results. If you're the type of person who expects easy and quick results, you will fail at this, as you would fail with anything else.

51,Living Stingy: Making the Most of Every Dollar,"Jan 11, 2024",Deanna Ritchie,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/living-stingy-making-the-most-of-every-dollar/468197,"
As financial pressures mount, making the most of your money is more important than ever. This is especially true since we are constantly pressured to keep up with the latest trends. One way to resolve these issues is to be stingy.The concept of living a stingy lifestyle might seem outdated today. Making the most of your hard-earned money is something you should embrace, however.In addition, living stingy doesn’t mean denying yourself everything you enjoy. It’s about prioritizing what you value and making conscious decisions about your money. In addition, it’s about maximizing your resources without compromising your quality of life.



Living stingy is all about making the most of every dollar you have. Even though that may seem impossible, here are a few tips on achieving it.Tap into the Power of BudgetingFinancial success begins with a budget. A budget provides a clear roadmap for your income and expenses, ensuring that your money works for you rather than against you. Creating a budget is a simple yet powerful step towards financial freedom.Implementing a zero-based budget is one of the best ways to accomplish this. A zero-based budget ensures you don’t spend beyond your means by dividing your income by your expenses. Moreover, this system requires you to keep track of all your costs, even irregular ones.If your income is inconsistent month-to-month, this method can be challenging, but if you’re able, it can help you cut expenses and save. As your costs decrease, your savings will grow as you adhere to a strict budget.If you’re not looking to embrace stinginess long-term, your zero-budget savings can easily be turned into an emergency fund – a quick and easy method to save.Whatever budgeting method you use, here are some tips to help you succeed.


Track your expenses.Creating a budget begins with tracking your expenses for a month. Ultimately, this helps you determine what you spend your money on and where it goes.You can track your expenses in a variety of ways. A budgeting app like Mint or You Need a Budget (YNAB) can help you keep track of your spending. Keeping a running tally of your expenses through a spreadsheet is also possible.Prioritize essential expenses. Divide your expenses into categories such as housing, food, utilities, transportation, and healthcare to prioritize essential expenses. Expenses that need to be covered before discretionary spending can be considered are non-negotiable.Reduce discretionary spending.Discretionary spending includes spending on entertainment, dining out, shopping, and other items that are not essential. Identify ways to reduce discretionary spending, such as eating out less often, canceling unnecessary subscriptions, or choosing cheaper alternatives.Set realistic goals.Set realistic and achievable financial goals based on your current income and expenses. Building an emergency fund, paying off debt, or saving for a down payment could be among these goals.Review and adjust.Review your budget regularly and make adjustments as necessary.  Expenses and income may fluctuate, so make sure your budget remains current.Make Smarter Spending DecisionsWith your budget in place, it’s time to spend wisely. To achieve this, you must make conscious spending choices and avoid impulse purchases.Prepare a shopping list.Don’t forget to make a shopping list before you head to the store. This will prevent you from making impulse purchases and save you money on groceries.


Always compare prices.Consider comparing prices at different retailers or stores before making a purchase. It might surprise you how much you can save.Buy generic brands.Generic brands usually offer the same quality at a fraction of the price of name brands. Sometimes, a name brand is the same as a store brand.Generic and store-branded groceries, on average, cost about 40% less than name-brand items.Cook more at home.It can be expensive to eat out. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the average American household spends $3,600 a year on dining out. Remembering that a household also includes an individual spending only on himself/herself is essential.This makes cooking at home a healthier and more affordable option.Take up inexpensive hobbies.It is common for people to spend a lot of money on hobbies and entertainment. That’s not always a bad thing. However, you can cut back here if you’re trying to reduce expenses.Keeping yourself entertained without spending much money is possible in many ways. The following are some inexpensive hobby ideas:
Reading
Writing
Drawing
Hiking
Biking
Bird watching
Gardening
Cooking/baking
Sewing
Playing sports
Clearly, there is no shortage of inexpensive hobbies to choose from.


Invest in second-hand goods.The majority of things you need can be purchased second-hand rather than new. You can find great deals on gently used items if you’re willing to look for them.There are a few places where you can find second-hand items. Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, eBay, and thrift stores are all great options. Also, consider yard sales, flea markets, and auctions for great deals.Almost anything you need can be found at a fraction of the cost of buying a new one if you put a little effort into it. Often, the item works just as well as a new one.In addition to being cheaper, second-hand goods are also better for the environment. It keeps usable items out of landfills when you buy second-hand.Borrow from the library.You can borrow books and movies from the library instead of purchasing them.DIY.By finding someone less expensive to trade hair-cutting with, doing your own home repairs, or making your cleaning products and gifts, you can save money.Avoid impulse purchases. The cost of impulse purchases can quickly drain your bank account. Consider whether you really need something before making a purchase or whether it is just an impulse buy. If the urge persists, wait a few days or weeks before purchasing.Consider bundling.It is possible to save money by bundling your insurance policies. A discount of 5–25% is often offered by companies that bundle policies. The largest discounts are usually found on homeowner’s insurance.


Several factors affect your savings, including:
Where you live.
What is the number of policies you bundle?
Your credit rating
History of your claims
However, bundling isn’t just limited to your insurance policies. You can also bundle your streaming services.For example, The Disney Bundle, which combines Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, offers one of the best streaming deals. If you choose the ad-free package, you’ll save up to 49% on your streaming bill every month.Don’t miss out on discount and coupon offers.Whenever possible, look for coupons and discounts. Use loyalty programs and shop during sales if you want to save money on groceries, household items, and other purchases.To find the best online discounts, use a browser extension. With extensions like Honey or Capital One Shopping, you can find coupons and apply them automatically to your cart to save time and money.Download cashback apps.There are several ways to get cash back on your purchases. Rakuten, for example, lets you earn cashback online. After signing up, you can shop online as usual. Rakuten will then give you a rebate based on the amount you spend.In addition to Rakuten, Ibotta offers cash back. Before shopping, you select offers with Ibotta. Your receipt is scanned and submitted through the app after you make a purchase. Based on your chosen offers, Ibotta will give you cash back.The best thing about cashback apps is that they save you money on purchases you will make anyway. As a bonus, look for cashback credit cards that allow you to stack rewards. By doing so, you earn cashback twice.


Cancel unused subscriptions.Ensure your subscriptions are up-to-date, and cancel any that aren’t used frequently.You can, however, track your expenses, cancel unwanted subscriptions, and negotiate high bills with Rocket Money and Trim for free.Make smarter financial decisions.The best way to make the most out of your money is to make intelligent financial decisions. To do this, you must make informed choices, from buying a car to investing in your education.The following tips can help you make smart financial decisions:
Do your research. Research your options before making any significant financial decisions.
Get advice from a professional. You should consult a financial advisor before making any financial decisions.
Don’t rush into decisions. You should take your time and be sure to make the right decision.
Learn How to Save WiselyFor financial stability, it is essential to save money. You can build an emergency fund by building an emergency fund, paying off debt, and reaching your long-term financial goals.Automate your savings.You can automatically transfer funds from your checking account to your savings account. As a result, you’ll save money without even realizing it. And, more importantly, this will prevent you from spending it.Benefit from employer-sponsored plans.Don’t miss the opportunity to contribute to a 401(k) or other retirement savings plan offered by your employer. In many cases, these plans are matched by your employer.Invest in a high-yield savings account.Compared to traditional savings accounts, high-yield savings accounts offer higher interest rates.


According to national statistics, the average annual percentage yield on traditional savings accounts is 0.46% as of December 2023. Meanwhile, some high-yield savings accounts offer rates of around 6% APY.Invest your money.After setting up an emergency fund, investing can be considered. It is possible to grow your money over time by investing, but risks are also involved.One of the easiest ways to get started investing is with robo-advisors.A robo-advisor determines your investing goals and level of risk tolerance, then invests your money in a highly diversified portfolio of index funds, mutual funds, and/or bond funds that are low-cost and highly diversified. Using algorithms, robo-advisors continuously rebalance your portfolio and optimize it for taxes, especially on large balances.Additionally, most robo-advisors charge modest fees based on your account size and require very little upfront cash to get started.Save with a realistic goal in mind.Make sure your savings goals are realistic, and track your progress. As a result, you’ll be more motivated and stay on track.Protecting Your FinancesIt is just as essential to protect your finances as it is to save and spend wisely. Keeping your finances secure is easy if you follow these tips.
Create strong passwords. Make sure all your online accounts have strong and unique passwords. Passwords should not contain personal information, such as birthdays or addresses.
Beware of scams. Keep an eye out for phishing scams and other attempts to steal your personal information. Unsolicited sources should never ask for your personal information or ask you to click on suspicious links.
Monitor your accounts. To detect fraudulent activity on your credit card and bank statements, monitor them regularly.
Shred documents. To prevent identity theft, shred documents containing sensitive information thoroughly before disposing of them.
Consider identity theft protection. You can monitor your credit and alert you to any suspicious activity by investing in identity theft protection services.
ConclusionA stingy lifestyle does not mean deprivation or sacrifice. In other words, it’s about making choices that align with your values and priorities.

52,10 Unique Ways to Invest $100 and Grow it to $1000,"Jan 10, 2024",Jeff Rose,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/10-unique-ways-to-invest-100-and-grow-it-to-1000/468148,"
If you think $100 won’t be enough to invest, think again. With a little patience and discipline, you can grow that small sum of money quickly. After all, the amount you invest at first is not really what matters when it comes down to it. It’s all about getting started.So, without further ado, let’s take a look at ten unique ways to flip $100 into $1,000.



1. Buy fractional shares of stock.Investing in fractional shares is a way to invest a little bit of money. In fractional shares, each share of a company’s stock is divided into a “piece” or a “slice.”A company can issue fractional shares following a stock split, through dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs), or through other means.In addition to buying shares, some top online brokerage firms sell customers a percentage of those shares. As a result, investors can invest in stocks with high growth potential that are otherwise out of reach, like Tesla.Fractional SharesWith Robinhood, for example, you can purchase as little as 1/1,000,000 shares. In addition, Robinhood allows the purchase of fractional shares for as little as $1.With Acorns, you can invest fractional shares and build wealth through micro-investing. Linking up your credit and debit cards to Acorns rounds up your purchases and saves your spare change. Usually, fractional shares are included in your portfolio once you have $5 in your account.Fractional shares can be bought or sold over time, just like other investments. To build wealth in the long term, you can continue to add fractional shares to your arsenal, or in the short term, you can sell fractional shares to lock in profits.


Fractional shares are a good option for investors who want to diversify their portfolios as much as possible with a small amount of money.2. Invest in real estate with crowdfunding.Since you need tens of thousands of dollars to start buying up properties, the real estate industry has traditionally had a high barrier to entry. Therefore, I usually recommend real estate investment trusts (REITs) instead.REITs provide exposure to real estate without requiring owners to own individual properties or deal with grueling landlord duties. Once you choose a fund and invest regularly, you can grow your investment balance based on real estate profits realized over time.When it comes to REITs, Fundrise is my favorite platform. The company specializes in selling private equity REITs, known as “eREITs” — which is trademarked. My favorite part of Fundrise is how you can get started with as little as $10, and the starter account comes with auto-investment and dividend reinvestment.In my opinion, Fundrise is a great option for individuals who want to invest in real estate without dealing with the headaches of buying individual properties. Fidelity and Vanguard also offer REITs, so you have many options.3. Create an investment pie with M1 Finance.Investment PieAs a robo-advisor, M1 Finance lets you create investment “Pies.” Each Pie is composed of slices. The slices represent stocks, ETFs, or even existing portfolios, referred to as Expert Pies.A Pie can hold up to 100 slices per Pie, and each account can hold five Pies. With a $100 investment, you can get started right away.Those new to investing may wish to sign up and choose an Expert Pie that suits their topic or theme. By categorizing portfolios, you can pick one that fits your needs, whether you’re looking for a Pie for general investing, retirement, income, or responsible investing.


A mix of Expert Pies and their own investment strategy, or a mix of more Expert Pies, is likely to make the most sense for more advanced investors. For example, you could build a pie of 30% stocks and 70% expert pie.With these Pies, you can set your own risk appetite and investment goals at a low cost.4. Open an IRA.A Roth IRA can be opened alongside other retirement accounts like a 401(k) at work. You can invest after-tax money in this type of account, which will grow tax-free until you are ready to withdraw it. Roth IRA funds can be withdrawn tax-free if you’re at least 59 1/2 years old.You must open your own Roth IRA. But this can easily be done with any online brokerage firm. If you’re making a high income, you might not be eligible because income caps limit contributions.There are also contribution limits. The maximum Roth IRA contribution in 2023 is $6,500. However, those 50 and older can contribute up to $7,500.Where should you open a Roth IRA? M1 Finance, Betterment, and Stash are all good choices. You should research online brokerage accounts to find the best online brokerage account for your needs and goals.A Roth IRA makes sense if you want to save money for retirement or other goals. Also, people looking to access tax-free money later in life can withdraw money from IRAs without paying income taxes.5. Invest in books.In terms of your personal and professional development, books are a great investment. Buying a book for $10 or less can teach you something new, improve your skills, or help you become more financially literate.

6. Enroll in a course or certification.For less than $100, you can take thousands of online courses, including ones that can expand your knowledge in any subject. It doesn’t matter if you want to learn how to write better, how to use Photoshop, or how to become a speaker for hire.You can purchase online courses and certifications in virtually any industry on a variety of online platforms. I suggest you take a moment to consider what skills can benefit you in your professional and personal lives. Maybe a new skill will help you get a promotion at your current job, or maybe a certification will help you switch careers.Whenever I need to enroll in courses or certifications, MasterClass is my first choice. You can enroll in hundreds of courses on this online platform for a small monthly fee ($15 to $23). This platform can provide unlimited learning for more than six months with a $100 investment.Everyone can benefit from online courses and certifications, but if you’re unsure which courses you’d like to take, MasterClass is a good option. Until you find the right fit, you can take dozens of classes for a low monthly fee.7. Work together as a team.Many credit cards, banks, and brokerages offer generous bonuses to new customers. The catch? You’re only allowed to cash in on these bonuses once.But there is a way around this. Consider a membership transfer pool that rolls over over time.“The concept is relatively simple,” explains Brad Biren, an elder law attorney in Des Moines, Iowa, and founder of IQMOP.com. “You and your friends pool your money and open bank accounts with promotional returns like $300 if you open an account and do these five things within the first month. There is no law against working together to extract the greatest value from the greatest number of promotional bank accounts.”


“One could pool their money among six friends, open six accounts, two at each branch, and earn money in promotions,” Biren adds. “People used to do this in the 1970s with bank accounts to get free toasters and other giveaways because banks were limited in what they could give away.”8. Hire a mentor or coach.Mentors or coaches can be invaluable resources as you pursue your goals. Depending on the coach or mentor’s services and experience, their costs will vary. In some cases, mentors charge by the hour, while others may charge a flat fee.However, many mentors and coaches will meet with you for free for coffee or lunch. In addition, you can connect with a mentor or coach for free in these ways:
Get in touch with friends, family, and colleagues to see if they know anyone who could serve as a good mentor or coach.
Make use of your professional network to find mentors.
You can find a mentor on SCORE. A SCORE mentor is an experienced business professional who helps others start and grow their own businesses.
See what local entrepreneurial groups and events are taking place in your area.
Make connections with potential mentors through LinkedIn or at your local Small Business Development Center (SBDC).
9. Make therapy a priority.As important as investing in your physical health, it is equally important to invest in your mental health. When you are suffering from stress, anxiety, or any other mental health problem, therapy can be very helpful.Financial issues can also be addressed through therapy. Several types of therapy can help with money, including:
Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). It allows people to identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.
Financial therapy. This is a specialized type of therapy that combines financial and therapeutic aspects.
An hourly therapy session can range from $65 to $250, although it can vary.10. Invest in fun experiences.Invest in ExperiencesThe key to your happiness is to invest in yourself. Don’t be afraid to spend some money on fun experiences with your friends, family, and loved ones. In fact, a 20-year Cornell University study found that happiness is achieved by investing in experiences, not things.When it comes to growing your wealth, start investing early and consistently. It doesn’t matter how small the amount is; it can add up over time. So, whatever the amount, start investing today.

53,Will Artificial Intelligence Replace Human Interaction? 4 Ways AI is Impacting and Empowering Customer Experience,"Jan 8, 2024",Dmitrii Khasanov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/ai-vs-humans-how-ai-is-positively-impacting-customer/467336,"
Artificial intelligence is leading the way in shaping the future of customer service. Whether it's making burgers or taking drive-thru orders, AI is making a big impact. However, as we ride the wave of innovation, it's important to consider the ethical questions surrounding its development.In the realm of customer service, AI is shining bright. According to Capgemini, more than half of retailers use generative artificial intelligence to enhance customer service. Around 40% of organizations have even formed dedicated teams and budgets for this technology.A great example is Morgan Stanley, a U.S. financial institution, using an internal AI-powered chatbot to help employees access company knowledge. This platform allows workers to find the information they need from various sources in one place.



But with AI becoming more prominent in customer service, a big question arises: Could AI replace human jobs in this field? Let's explore this transformative journey and see how this new technology is already changing the way we interact with customers.Related: How to Use AI to Drive Growth and Improve Customer Interactions


1. Dynamic personalizationCustomers and brands alike are jumping on the conversational AI bandwagon, drawn to its ability to offer personalized experiences that are faster and more convenient than traditional methods of engaging with businesses. Additionally, AI comes to the rescue by smoothing out the bumps in the customer journey.Before AI: Generic recommendations based on broad demographics.Mass-marketing campaigns with limited personalizationStatic content that remains unchanged regardless of individual preferences.With AI: Tailored product suggestions, content and offers in real time.Adaptive marketing strategies that adjust based on user behavior and preferences.AI-driven chatbots provide customized responses and assistance.AI-powered recommendation engines that continuously learn and improve based on user feedback.2. Predictive customer supportIn contrast to conventional data analytics software, AI sets itself apart by not only analyzing customer behavior and data but also continually learning and enhancing its capabilities over time. Armed with this knowledge, AI can anticipate future customer behavior. This technological prowess empowers brands to deliver exceptionally relevant content, seize sales opportunities and elevate overall customer satisfaction.


Before AI:Reactive responses to issues as they arise.Limited ability to anticipate and prevent potential customer concerns.Lack of proactive communication about potential service disruptions or product issues.With AI: Proactive identification of potential problems, often resolved before customers notice.Predictive maintenance schedules for products and services, minimizing downtime.AI algorithms analyze customer usage patterns to anticipate needs and address concerns in advance.Related: How Generative AI Will Revolutionize The Future of Your Brand3. Hyper-personalized communicationBy harnessing the capabilities of AI and online decision-making to discern and comprehend a customer's intent from the data they generate instantly, brands can deliver an intensely personalized customer experience. Predictive analytics involves leveraging statistics, data mining, and modeling to make informed predictions. Thanks to AI's ability to rapidly analyze vast amounts of data, it employs predictive analytics to generate real-time, actionable insights that steer the subsequent interactions between a customer and a brand. Commonly known as predictive engagement, this approach relies on AI's proficiency in determining the optimal timing and manner of interacting with each customer.


Before AI:Mass emails with generic content.Manual segmentation of customer lists for targeted communication.With AI:Personalized messages align with individual preferences and behaviors.Automated personalized recommendations in email campaigns.Dynamic content in emails that adapts based on user interactions and preferences.Related: Are You Giving Your Customers Personalized Experiences? Here's Why You Can't Afford to Ignore It Any Longer.4. Efficient purchase processCustomers expect notable benefits when interacting with a company's AI-powered chatbot, with 47% prioritizing time efficiency and prompt issue resolution. Furthermore, 33% value the smooth transition from the chatbot to a live person, underscoring the importance of human intervention when required. Another 33% appreciate the chatbot's role in simplifying the overall service experience, emphasizing the expectation that AI should streamline rather than complicate customer interactions. These insights highlight the pivotal role of AI in providing efficient, user-friendly, and responsive customer service experiences.


Before AI: Lengthy checkout processes and manual product searches.Manual product searches require users to navigate through multiple pages.Limited assistance in finding relevant products based on individual preferences.With AI: Streamlined transactions, personalized product recommendations, and one-click purchasing.AI-powered recommendation engines suggest relevant products during the shopping experience.Dynamic pricing models adjust in real time based on user behavior and market conditions.Virtual shopping assistants guide users through product selection and purchase decisions.AI for customer experience involves the utilization of artificial intelligence technologies such as machine learning, chatbots, conversational user experience (UX), and advanced analytics to analyze customer data. The goal is to personalize customer interactions, enhance the efficiency of customer service, and expand self-service options. AI is also instrumental in optimizing business processes and improving key performance indicators like customer loyalty and engagement.Today, it is evident that artificial intelligence, along with its various technologies, is making a positive impact on user and customer experience. It has taken on functions that, just 5-7 years ago, required entire departments to manage. The intelligence embedded in smart algorithms allows technology not only to analyze current situations but also to predict future scenarios based on past events. We are witnessing the integration of AI into the public sphere, a development that was largely unseen just a few years ago.

As the holiday season winds down, many American consumers are turning to Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) options to alleviate the pressure of gift-giving amidst increasing credit card debts and surging inflation.BNPL options offered by companies such as Affirm, Afterpay and Klarna allow for purchases to be paid in installments, often in six-week interest-free payments — but it's not without drawbacks, especially for users who overextend their budgets, Fox Business reported.Related: Retailers Are Going to Shatter Discount Records This Holiday Season — But You'll Have to Shop the Right Way to Cash InAmericans are saddled with a record-breaking $1 trillion in credit card debt, per CNBC.And point-of-sale lenders are cashing in: Affirm shares have spiked more than 400% this year, outpacing all U.S. tech companies worth $5 billion or more, NBC New York reported.



Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at Bankrate.com, told Fox that BNPL is a form of debt with inherent risks, including potential interest rates as high as 30% APR. ""Sometimes I hear of people getting into trouble with BNPL plans because they trick themselves into thinking they're spending less than they really are,"" he said, noting that the plans can also complicate returns and refunds.However, it's not millennials, Gen Z or low-income consumers who are most likely to use these plans, according to a PYMNTS Intelligence research study.The study found that nearly 46% of high-income consumers — defined as those making more than $100,000 annually — have used store card installment plans in the last 12 months before being surveyed, on average using the plans twice during that period.Related: PayPal Co-Founder's Newest Startup Raises $100 Million to Reinvent CreditAll consumers should read the fine print of BNPL services carefully, understanding the length of the loan and interest rate, Rossman told Fox.

Reduced debt. By living frugally, you can pay off debt more quickly and increase your cash flow.
Greater financial security. The more you live within your means, the better prepared you’ll be for unexpected expenses.

Rather than discussing numbers, the book takes a deeper look at the concept of budgeting as a whole.Quote: “Undoubtedly, what came into your mind when you heard the word “budget” was simple: money. Money is a thing to be feared, to be saved, to be celebrated when it’s there and mourned when it isn’t. Budgeting, we are told, is necessary. When you live in a world where there is always one more thing to buy, being cognizant of the fact that you don’t have endless resources is just the practical thing to do. However, budgeting can be much more than this. To put it simply, money is only one of the resources that we should be managing in our lives, and possibly not even the most important one.”9.

59,The Role of Scholarships and Grants in Financing Education,"Dec 24, 2023",Devin Partida,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/the-role-of-scholarships-and-grants-in-financing-education/467507,"
Applying for scholarships and grants helps students pay for college. In some situations, these awards allow people to obtain a degree they wouldn’t be able to otherwise. Students who apply for various awards often find they help cover the costs of other college-related expenses.  Here’s a closer look at today’s college tuition, the importance of applying for scholarships and grants and how to get your hands on free money for school.The Rising Costs of Higher EducationAccording to 2023 data by the Education Data Initiative, public four-year in-state college tuition is $26,027 annually — $104,108 total for four years of attendance. Out-of-state students could pay upwards of $108,364 to obtain a degree. 



College expenses have risen by 4.94% since 2015 nationally. However, those costs don’t include school supplies, books, room and board, student life fees, clothes, health care, food and transportation. For some students, the rising costs of higher education make getting a degree unattainable.As a result, they could miss out on professional opportunities, a livable salary and greater health outcomes. A 2023 study from the Center on Children and Families at Brooking uncovered significant socioeconomic gaps in college enrollment — 51% of students from low-income households attend college, compared to 89% of students from higher-income families. 


Even with student loans, college can be a financial risk for individuals from underserved communities and low-income households. After all, many have to pay back astronomical loan debts following graduation. Scholarships and grants are advantageous for individuals with exceptional financial need. In most situations, these awards are nonrepayable. Therefore, financing one’s education with scholarships and grants is an excellent way to offset costs and reduce debt later.Defining Scholarships and GrantsAlthough scholarships and grants are both forms of financial aid for higher education, they have different meanings. For example, companies, schools and organizations will offer scholarships to students, while grants are provided through federal and state governments. Likewise, it is crucial to understand the different types of awards to know what you or your children are applying for. ScholarshipsScholarships are either merit or needs-based. Typically, students receive scholarship awards based on their academic performance, skills, athletics, extracurricular activities or program of study. For example, the Flywire Charitable Foundation awards $5,000 to students interested in sustainability, social justice and global health. 


Likewise, higher education institutions also reward students for making significant academic contributions within their program of study. You might apply for a scholarship through your college’s Bioengineering or Social Work departments with a recommendation from a professor.Sometimes, needs-based scholarships are available to outstanding students from underrepresented communities and groups, particularly those who are not financially secure or whose families cannot afford college tuition. In some instances, an awarding institution or organization will offer a prize for a semester, academic year or annually for the duration of enrollment.GrantsUnlike scholarships, government-issued grants are almost always needs-based. There are four primary types of college grants as follows:
Federal Pell Grants: Available to undergraduate students demonstrating critical financial need who have not earned a degree.
Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG): Also awarded to undergraduate students with financial need, with priority given to Federal Pell Grant recipients.
Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants: Awarded to students from low-income families pursuing an education degree to teach at public or private schools.
Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants: Ineligible students for Pell Grants whose parents served and died during active duty in Iraq or Afghanistan after September 11, 2001.
Unlike scholarships, you may need to repay part or all of a Federal Pell Grant or FSEOG under unique circumstances. For example, you might withdraw from the program you received the commission for or change your enrollment status from full-time to part-time. 


Likewise, you might have to repay a TEACH grant if you drop out of an education program or don’t fulfill your four-year teaching obligation after graduation.Positive Outcomes of Seeking Financial AidEarning scholarship or grant money means you’ll have less to repay in student loans. College debt remains a serious problem as student loan debt has risen 302% in the U.S. since 2004. On average, students accrue $32,731 in debt for their higher education. If college award money allows you to obtain a degree, imagine the positive outcomes of having one. Many people question whether a degree is worth it in today’s economy. Despite employers broadening their talent scope for more experienced-based hiring, 81% of college students believe going to college is beneficial.A degree is always going to deliver returns throughout your life and career. For instance, a bachelor’s degree holder can earn $30,000 more annually than someone with a high school diploma. 


College degrees also provide more stable job security, a broader professional network, better health care — from working at companies with excellent benefits packages — and greater life satisfaction. Searching for Scholarship and Grant OpportunitiesYou can find scholarships and grant opportunities by visiting or contacting your school’s financial aid office, visiting your local library or searching for them online. If you’re still in high school, your school counselor will be able to provide you with information about scholarships you’re eligible for.Other places to look for financial aid opportunities include the following:
U.S. Department of Labor’s free database of nearly 9,000 scholarships, grants and fellowships
State grant agencies
Nonprofit organizations, local businesses, religious organizations and charitable foundations
Professional associations related to your intended field of study
Colleges and universities
Cultural heritage organizations
Large corporations, your employer or your parents’ workplaces
How to Apply for Scholarships and GrantsWhile students must fill out applications for scholarships and grants, eligibility, requirements and deadlines may differ. Here’s how to apply for both types of financial aid for a more affordable college education.


Applying for ScholarshipsOnce you’ve found a scholarship — or more than one — you’d like to apply for, it is essential to read over the details immediately. You will want to create a checklist to ensure you cover and submit everything it asks of you. Eligibility The first thing you need to do is review the eligibility rules to ensure you match. Usually, you must be a U.S. undergraduate student, graduate student or incoming first-year student at an accredited school. Some scholarships only consider applicants from a specific program of study or particular interests. The award issuer might also require a minimum grade point average (GPA), which is why you must remain in good academic standing. Application RequirementsA scholarship application might ask for supplemental information to aid the issuer’s decision. For instance, some applicants may need to submit a video, essay, letter of recommendation, resume or other materials.


Additionally, proof of academic standing — such as a recent transcript — or evidence of the completed FAFSA form might be required, especially if a scholarship is needs-based.DeadlinesAlways apply for scholarships as early as possible to avoid missing the deadline. Organization is vital if you’re applying for several scholarships at once.A spreadsheet will help you track which scholarships you’ve already applied for, the status of your application decision and the outcome. It also makes it easier to see when deadlines are coming up for each pending application. Applying for GrantsA college financial aid advisor or high school counselor can help you or your child navigate the grant application process, including filling out the FAFSA form and determining which grants you might be eligible for based on the financial aid award letter you receive.


Eligibility You must complete the FAFSA form to be eligible for a college grant. FAFSA lets you know how much grant money you can receive.For instance, the government modifies grant amounts annually. The maximum Federal Pell Grant was $6,895 in the 2022-23 academic year and will increase by $500 to $7,395 in 2023-24. Eligible students will qualify for at least 10% of the maximum amount for the year.Students must also have excellent academic standing and not already have a college degree. Those pursuing a TEACH grant must graduate with at least a bachelor’s in education and are obligated to give back four years of teaching service. Application RequirementsWhereas scholarship specifications might ask students to submit additional materials, most college grants only require a completed FAFSA form. This is because grants are needs-based and only issued to those who need financial assistance to enroll in school.


Whether you apply for a grant or scholarship, students should never have to pay to search or apply for gift aid. If an issuing institution asks for a form of payment, it’s likely a scam.DeadlinesStudents are considered for a grant as soon as they complete their FAFSA form. FAFSA opens on October 1 annually.Submitting the form as soon as possible is critical since some schools offer aid on a first-come, first-served basis. Students might miss out on possible monetary assistance if they submit their grant applications late and there are insufficient funds.Tips and Reminders to Win Financial Aid for SchoolWinning a scholarship or grant award is a big deal. Every award amount counts toward gaining accessible and affordable education. You can up your chances of receiving financial aid for a college degree in the following ways:



Find opportunities to shine on your resume, including volunteer work and special projects.
Always apply for financial aid opportunities — including scholarships, grants and FAFSA — even if you think your family income disqualifies you.
Don’t settle for one opportunity — simultaneously apply to several scholarships and grants. 
Ask for one or two letters of recommendation from school counselors, teachers, college professors and mentors who can speak to your abilities.
Speak to your school counselor or financial aid advisor to find out if there are any opportunities you missed or are unaware of through the school.
Remember to apply for smaller scholarships and grants, too. While it would be nice to receive a six-figure scholarship, several award amounts are in the $300-$5,000 range. These smaller prizes are just as valuable for covering books, supplies and room and board. Making College Accessible With Financial AidAnyone who hopes to pursue higher education should be able to do so, regardless of economic or sociological barriers. After all, a degree can significantly aid individuals in launching a lucrative career and achieving personal and professional success. In this regard, scholarships and grants make education more accessible to everyone.The post The Role of Scholarships and Grants in Financing Education appeared first on Due.

60,Top 10 Tips for Living with Very Little Money,"Dec 22, 2023",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/top-10-tips-for-living-with-very-little-money/467450,"
Being on a very tight budget can make life challenging. But it can also provide an opportunity to be creative, resourceful, and resilient. Even so, in today’s world, where living costs seem to be rising constantly, you need to find more ways than ever to make your dollar stretch.Whatever your situation, whether you are a student, a young professional, or someone on a fixed income, there are many ways to maximize your budget. In this post, I’ll share 10 tips and tricks that can help anyone thrive when they have very little to no money.1. Mindset Shift: Reframing Your Relationship with MoneyIn order to effectively live on very little money, it’s often necessary to change your mindset. After all, having a scarcity mindset can make you feel like you will never have enough. This negativity can, however, be counterproductive. Rather than focusing on what you don’t have, focus on what you do have and the opportunities that come with it.



You can cultivate a positive mindset by following these steps:
Practice gratitude. You should take some time every day to reflect on the things you are grateful for, no matter how big or small they are. It could range from having a roof over your head to having family and friends who support you.
Focus on experiences, not possessions. Material things fade away, but experiences last a lifetime. Don’t spend your money on things you’ll soon forget. Instead, spend it on activities and adventures that will bring you joy. What’s more, numerous studies have found that spending on experiences instead of possessions boots happiness.
Challenge negative thoughts. Whenever you find yourself thinking about what you lack, reframe the thought by thinking about what you can do with what you have.
2. Budgeting and Planning: Your Financial RoadmapNow that you have shifted your mindset, it’s time to get to work on your budget. To make informed spending decisions, you need to keep track of your income and expenses.Listed below are some tips for budgeting effectively:
Know your income and expenses. A financial plan cannot be constructed without this foundation. Keep track of your income and expenses for a month to understand how your money is spent.
Choose a budgeting method that works for you. A variety of budgeting methods are available, such as the 50/30/20 rule, a zero-based budget, and an envelope budget. You should experiment with different options until you find one that works for you.
Use budgeting apps and tools. Tracking your income and expenses, setting goals, and staying on track can be a lot of fun with many great budgeting apps and tools. Personal Capital, YNAB, and Mint are some popular options.
Set spending limits. Make allocations for rent, groceries, transportation, and entertainment based on your income and expenses. Be realistic about your financial capabilities and prioritize needs over wants.
Create a financial buffer. If you can, try to save some money every month. When it comes to weathering financial storms, it’s important to have an emergency fund.
3. Slash Your Housing CostsHousing accounts for the majority of people’s budgets. As a matter of fact, housing accounted for the largest share of consumer expenditures (33.3 percent).As much as possible, you need to reduce your housing costs when you have little money to spend. Among the options you might want to consider are:
Downscale your living space. Your rent or mortgage payment can be significantly reduced by moving to a smaller apartment or even living with a roommate.
Refinance. Your interest rate can be lowered and your monthly payment can be reduced if you refinance.
House hack. Try housesitting, pet-sitting, or becoming a caretaker to earn rent-free or significantly reduced rent.
Relocate. Rent, mortgage, insurance, property taxes, and utilities can all be reduced by moving to a smaller house or location.
Negotiate your rent. If you’re renting from a landlord, don’t be afraid to negotiate your rent. Depending on your reputation as a good tenant, they may be able to work with you.
4. Master the Art of Frugal Food ShoppingFood can also be a big expense. You can save money on groceries without sacrificing nutrition with a little planning and creativity. These tips will help:



Plan your meals. Based on what’s in season and on sale, develop a weekly meal plan. As a result, you will be less likely to make impulse grocery purchases.
Embrace store brands. It is often possible to find generic brands at a fraction of the price of name brands.
Cook at home. Spending money on eating out kills your budget. It is possible to control the ingredients and portion sizes when you cook at home, saving you a considerable amount of money.
Utilize food banks and pantries. If you need help, don’t be afraid to ask for it. When people are struggling to make ends meet, food banks and pantries can provide them with essential groceries. You may also qualify for government assistance like SNAP benefits.
5. Ditch the Gas Guzzle: Smart Strategies to Slash Your Transportation CostsTransport costs per American household reached $12,295 in 2022. After housing, this was the second largest category of household expenditures.The good news? Depending on your specific situation and needs, you can reduce transportation costs from different angles. To help you decide what to do, here are some strategies:Shifting your mode of transportation:
Active transportation. For shorter trips, use a scooter, a bike, or a walk. In addition to being cost-effective, this is also environmentally friendly.
Public transportation. Whenever possible, use public transportation, such as buses, trains, and subways. For frequent users, monthly passes may be a good option.
Carpooling. Take a ride with a friend or colleague who commutes in the same direction. Also, carpool apps such as Waze Carpool can help connect you with others.
Ridesharing. Take advantage of ride-sharing services like Uber or Lyft on occasion, especially if you can split the cost with a friend.
Vehicle alternatives. It may be more cost-effective to rent a car or bike for specific needs instead of owning a vehicle full-time.
Optimizing your vehicle use:
Fuel-efficient vehicles. Consider fuel-efficient vehicles such as hybrids or electric cars if you need a personal vehicle.
Route planning. Avoid congestion by planning your trips efficiently. There are tools that can help, such as Google Maps and Waze. Also, consider combining your errands.
Maintenance. You can improve your car’s fuel efficiency and keep it running smoothly with regular maintenance.
Driving habits. Maintain a steady speed, avoid idling, and accelerate slowly as part of eco-friendly driving practices.
6. Finding Joy on a Budget: Entertainment, Leisure, and Personal GrowthEven when living on a tight budget, you can have fun and enjoy yourself. The possibilities for finding entertainment and leisure activities that don’t cost a lot are plentiful. Some ideas are as follows:
Free and cheap activities. You can attend free concerts and events, borrow books from the library, or have game nights with friends if you explore your city’s parks and museums.
Get creative. Whether you like to write, paint, draw, or play music, you can do it. You don’t need a lot of money to express yourself creatively.
Cut out streaming services. Netflix, for instance, now charges $15.50 for its standard plan without ads. Originally $5 a month, Apple TV+ is now $10.Streaming services like Disney+ and Hulu without ads went up in price, too. There are, however, services such as Pluto TV, Roku Channel, and Tubi TV that offer hundreds of shows for free in exchange for ads.
Learn new things. Consider taking free online courses, attending workshops, or joining a meetup group. If you want to expand your knowledge and skills without spending a lot of money, there are many ways to do so.
7. Sustainable Living: Saving Money While Saving the PlanetEco-conscious living often goes hand-in-hand with living frugally. You can save money and protect the environment by reducing your consumption and waste.
Reduce, reuse, recycle. Buy less, repair what you have, and compost food scraps to minimize your waste.
Go energy-efficient. When you’re not using electronics, unplug them and switch to LED light bulbs.
Embrace DIY. Rather than replacing broken items, learn how to fix them.
Grow your own food. To enjoy fresh, homegrown produce, start a small herb garden or vegetable patch on your balcony.
Become familiar with the secondhand market. Whether you are looking for furniture, clothes, electronics, and appliances, this can be another eco-friendly way to save money. For hidden gems, visit thrift stores, garage sales, consignment shops, and online marketplaces such as Facebook Marketplace.
8. Seek & Destroy: Identify Expenses That Are Sabotaging Your BugetIt’s easy for certain expenses to sneak in and wreck havoc on your finances if you’re not careful when budgeting. Listed below are some common culprits that deplete your budget quickly:Recurring Traps
Subscriptions on autopilot. Subscriptions to gyms you don’t use, streaming services you don’t watch, and other recurring charges can drain your account. Identify subscriptions that you are not using and cancel them.
Mindless spending. Over time, a daily latté, an impulse purchase, and a convenience item can add up. Spend a month tracking your expenses to uncover these hidden costs.
Dining out debt. A frequent habit of eating out can have a drastic impact on your budget. To avoid restaurant temptations, cook more at home, explore budget-friendly options, and pack lunches.
Financial Fangs
Unnecessary debt. Predatory lending, such as high-interest credit cards and payday loans, can cripple your finances. Avoid taking on new loans with unfavorable terms and pay down existing debt first.
ATM fees. A typical out-of-network ATM transaction costs $4.73. If you want to avoid these fees, use in-network ATMs or get cash back at the grocery store.
Ignoring bills. The cost of late fees and penalties can quickly add up, straining your budget. Be sure to pay your bills on time and prioritize essential payments such as rent and utilities.
Neglecting maintenance. In the long run, skipping car repairs, home maintenance, or preventive healthcare can result in costly problems. Make sure you budget for regular maintenance in order to avoid unexpected financial problems.
Lifestyle Leeches
Keeping up with the Joneses. When you compare your spending with others, you can end up overspending and feeling stressed about your finances.Don’t let lifestyle inflation take over your finances. Focus on your own financial goals..
Retail therapy blues. There’s no doubt that retail therapy can provide temporary relief, but it can quickly deplete your savings. Make a point of celebrating your accomplishments or finding healthier ways to cope with stress.
Vacation vortex. It is true that travel can enrich our lives, but extravagant vacations can derail our budgets.You should plan your trips carefully, set a budget, and look for budget-friendly travel options, such as traveling off-season. Alternatively, you may want to consider a staycation.
The key to a healthy budget is finding a balance between expenses and income. Once you identify these “expense killers,” you will be better able to manage your finances and build a more secure financial future.


9. Tap into the Power of Community: Your Secret Weapon for Saving MoneyIt’s not always all about tightening your belt and scrimping. What if you possessed a hidden superpower that was waiting to be unleashed? One of those superpowers is community.Your everyday connections can become your secret weapon to save money. How? Here are some powerful ways to get involved in the community and boost your finances:
Share and barter. Don’t spend money on things you don’t need. Instead, borrow or barter. In exchange for favors, offer to help with tasks.
Join community gardens or co-ops. Getting fresh food at a lower price and interacting with your community is a great way to remain connected.
Knowledge and resources sharing. Help your community by sharing tips, tricks, and resources. Create a workshop on budgeting, debt management, or investing. As we learn from one another, we become more capable of making smart financial decisions.
A group challenge and support system. Do you find it difficult to stick to your savings goals? Join a community of individuals who are also committed to saving. Encourage and support each other along the way by setting shared challenges and tracking progress. Having the support of others can help you stay on track when you are struggling.
10. Free Money? Not Quite, But Close Enough: Effortless Ways to Boost Your WalletIt’s hard to resist “free money” — especially when you have very little. Although the idea of earning an income effortlessly may seem impossible, there are ways to boost your income without breaking a sweat. Over time, these methods can add a substantial amount of extra padding to your wallet for minimal effort.Passive Income Power-Ups
Matching 401(k) funds. We’ll start with the easiest way to get free money — your employer. There are many companies that offer 401(k) plans for their employees to save for retirement these days. In addition, many companies offer 401(k) matching funds. You won’t get a 100% match, but they might chip in 50% of your contributions, up to 6% of your salary.
Investing. Although it isn’t totally hassle-free, investing can be surprisingly passive once it’s set up. For a hands-off approach, consider index funds or robo-advisors. For long-term success, patience is key.
High-yield savings accounts. Take advantage of better-than-average interest rates on savings accounts. Even if the returns aren’t life-changing, this is free money you wouldn’t otherwise earn.
Cashback apps and rewards programs. To earn cashback on your everyday purchases, download apps such as Ibotta, Rakuten, or Fetch Rewards. Basically, it’s like getting paid to shop.
Rent out unused space. Do you have a spare room, storage space, or even a driveway? With platforms such as Airbnb, Neighbor, and Stash, it’s easy to make passive income from them.
Effortless Side Hustles
Online surveys and microtasks. Prolific, Swagbucks, and Amazon Mechanical Turk are some platforms where you can complete surveys and small online tasks. It isn’t a lot of money, but it’s a fun way to earn some extra money.
Content creation. YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram are popular platforms for sharing expertise and hobbies. Passive income can be generated through ads, sponsorships, or even selling your own products once you build a following.
Freelancing. Is there a skill you have that others need? You can sell your writing, editing, graphic design, social media management, and other services on freelance platforms like Upwork and Fiverr.
House sitting or pet sitting. Get paid to take care of someone’s house and pets while they’re away. You can connect with potential clients through platforms like Rover and TrustedHouseSitters.
Sell unwanted items. You can sell unwanted items at garage sales or online to declutter your home. It’s one of the easiest ways to make extra money quickly.
Bonus tip. Whenever possible, automate! Invest in recurring funds, transfer automatic funds to savings accounts, and use reminder apps to stay on top of your side hustles.Final Words of AdviceYou can learn valuable life lessons about resourcefulness, creativity, and resilience by living with very little money.

If you're looking to kickstart a high-income side hustle in 2024, you're not alone. Nearly two in five, or 39%, of U.S. adults have a side hustle to supplement their incomes — and pay essential bills, according to a recent Bankrate survey.But where to begin? You might want to consider a side hustle that aligns with your interests or talents. For example, this teacher translated her passion for education into a lucrative online gig, and this 26-year-old's ChatGPT obsession led to a ""simple,"" $4,000-a-month side hustle.Of course, building a successful side hustle can be easier said than done. But millions of Americans are doing it — and can provide invaluable insights when it comes to navigating business ventures of your own.

Three of them — all of whom have made more than $20,000 per month at least once since launching their side hustles — spill their secrets to success below.

""Don't spend time, money and energy on building out a website and marketing that website without first knowing which product you are going to sell and where you are going to get that product from. Also, take note of what skills you learn when you start a side hustle. Many side hustles flop, and that's okay. You will learn many business skills trying a side hustle, and those skills are transferable to your full-time job, which can help you advance in your career. So don't worry about a side hustle failing. There is much to learn from failure.""

62,"Do This Simple Exercise to Build Better Money Habits in 2024, Says Financial Expert","Dec 19, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/do-this-exercise-for-healthy-money-habits-in-2024-and-beyond/467139,"
If you're planning any major life purchases in 2024 — maybe a first home or new car — it's time to take a good look at your finances to make sure you're in the best position to spend without overextending your budget.Although the purchasing process will vary depending on someone's individual financial circumstances, most Americans (more than half, to be exact, per CNBC) are living paycheck to paycheck — and will have to take on debt to afford some of life's biggest buys this year.Entrepreneur sat down with Chelsea Fagan, CEO and founder of cross-platform media company The Financial Diet, to learn more about how people should weigh those major purchasing decisions.

Fagan's own personal finance journey helped her become an expert on the subject. When she landed her first salaried job, she vowed to mend her ""very negative relationship with money"" and ""ruined credit score."" So, in 2014, she used the platform she already had as a writer to document the experience on her blog, ultimately growing it into the company she helms today.""We all have to make different major purchases, but they're not all created equal.""According to Fagan, there are some important steps to take when considering a significant buy. First, get a sense of the long-term value of the investment. ""We all have to make different major purchases, but they're not all created equal,"" Fagan says. For example, a home is likely to appreciate in value, but a car is not.But you also have to consider the flexibility you want in your budget — and how the purchase will impact that going forward, especially in high-cost-of-living areas.


Related: 10 Pieces of Financial Advice I Wish I Knew in My 20s""A lot of people don't think about their big monthly expenses as fitting into an overall budget,"" Fagan explains. ""They think of it as a standalone number. But it's extremely important to remember that each additional hundred or whatever amount of money is going to that big initial purchase is going to have a huge impact on the rest of your spending.""Using a budgeting app that maps 100% of your spending, like Kelley Blue Book My Wallet, can be a great way to stay on track and keep your big-picture budget in mind.""Every single purchasing decision is a trade-off.""Additionally, Fagan notes that ""every single purchasing decision is a trade-off."" A slightly less expensive home could be farther from work, which means a longer commute and more money spent on gas.Education is another major purchase some people might be navigating in 2024 — and Fagan cautions young people against investing in a program without analyzing its potential return in full.""I don't think that young people are taught to interpret the value of a given degree in the way that they would another investment,"" Fagan says. ""If you're going to buy a home, for example, you're typically going to go through like, What area is it in? What are the historical trends? What's my interest rate? How much am I likely to gain in equity over the next five, 10, 15 years? But usually, because it's teenagers making these decisions, people don't typically make those same analyses when it comes to their education.""Related: Do This to Make Your Money Work for You in 2022 and Beyond


""There's so much mindless consumerism that works its way into our spending.""Fagan and her team don't subscribe to the belief that you shouldn't spend on anything until you're debt-free but stress that any purchase — big or small — should align clearly with your values.And a simple exercise can help you accomplish that: Go through all of your spending on credit card and bank statements for the last three months and highlight any purchases you don't remember making.""A lot of us typically spend on things that don't have value to us, especially when it comes to ride-sharing, food delivery, going out for drinks, shopping for fast fashion, buying random stuff at the holidays,"" Fagan says. ""There's so much mindless consumerism that works its way into our spending that we don't even notice is happening. And when you think about the purchases and the spending habits that are actually valuable to you versus the ones that you don't even remember, it's always a huge wake-up call to look at our purchases and say; I spent $65 on that — I literally don't even remember it.""


The activity is a sort of ""psychological practice"" that can help lay the foundation for healthy money habits in the long term, Fagan says — setting you up for financial success in 2024 and all of the years to come.

    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

This story originally appeared on Under30CEO.comThe fintech sector has transformed the personal credit business, making unsecured personal loans more accessible and feasible for a broader spectrum of customers. Through the internet, marketplace lending, and continuous online access, the fintech movement has turned unsecured personal loans into a progressively viable solution for low-and moderate-income (LMI) borrowers. As a result, these borrowers now have a wider range of cost-effective options to choose from when seeking credit, enabling them to improve their financial circumstances and build a stronger credit history.The Fintech Revolution in Personal CreditThe innovative technologies employed by fintech companies have streamlined loan application processes, reduced approval times, and provided a more transparent lending experience that caters to the unique financial needs of LMI borrowers. This expansion has directly impacted the banking sector, as demonstrated by LendingClub and SoFi's acquisition of banks.



Related: Differentiate or Die Trying: What's Next For the Alternative Lending MarketUnsecured Personal Loan Industry: Growing Concerns and Rising DemandConcerns about the unsecured personal loan industry have grown as US consumer credit card debt exceeds $1 trillion. As a result, regulators are paying closer attention to lending practices, and financial institutions are scrutinizing borrowers more rigorously. Simultaneously, consumers are seeking alternative lending options, driving growth in the fintech sector and propelling digital lending platforms to the forefront.


Challenges and Obstacles: Addressing the Market's Escalating IssuesWith increasing demand for these loans among LMI customers, the market faces escalating issues like rising costs, stricter standards, and growing delinquency rates. As a result, financial institutions and policymakers need to work together to address these obstacles and create solutions that protect both consumers and the industry. By fostering an environment of responsible lending practices and effective regulations, there is an opportunity to make these loans more accessible and beneficial for LMI communities.Navigating the Complex Financial Landscape: Cooperation and CommunicationAs borrowers seek help in managing their financial affairs, both consumers and lenders must work their way through an ever-more complicated and uncertain landscape. Navigating this intricate financial terrain requires increased communication and cooperation between borrowers and lenders to ensure mutually beneficial outcomes. It is essential for both parties to stay informed about changing regulations, market conditions, and available resources in order to make well-informed decisions and maintain stability.Conclusion: The Future of Unsecured Personal Loans in the Fintech EraThe fintech sector's impact on the unsecured personal loan industry has, undoubtedly, been transformative for LMI borrowers, providing them with more accessible and cost-effective options. However, as the market evolves and policymakers implement stricter regulations, the industry must continue to innovate and adapt to its ever-changing environment. Through collaboration, communication, and responsible lending practices, the unsecured personal loan industry can continue to serve the needs of LMI borrowers while maintaining financial stability.

65,No Money for Christmas? 25 Tips for an Affordable Holiday,"Dec 3, 2023",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/no-money-for-christmas-25-tips-for-an-affordable-holiday/466277,"
We are all looking forward to the holiday season because it is a time of joy, cheer, and giving. At the same time, the holidays can also be a stressful time for some families financially. It can be stressful to buy gifts, decorate, and host celebrations, especially if you’re tight on cash.In fact, 54% of holiday shoppers expect some financial burden during the holiday season, according to Bankrate. Interestingly, 33% say they anticipate being pressured to spend more than they are comfortable with as a result of inflation, 25% say they are stressed over costs, 23% say they are concerned about budgeting, and 13% say inflation will change the way they shop.You don’t have to despair if you’re worrying about how you’ll enjoy Christmas this year. It is possible to create a fulfilling and memorable holiday without breaking the bank. The following are 25 tips for having an affordable and memorable Christmas.



1. Set a realistic budget.The first step to an affordable Christmas? Set a realistic budget.The first step is to track your income and expenses. Your Christmas spending plan can be created once you have a good understanding of your financial situation.Keeping up with the Joneses isn’t for everyone, so be realistic about what you can afford. It will be more meaningful to your loved ones if you show thoughtfulness and creativity than if you give them an expensive gift that they don’t really need.2. Decide what your spending priorities are.It is important to prioritize your spending after you’ve created a budget. Your finances should be allocated based on what’s most important to you and your family. For example, you might want to prioritize gifts for your kids. Alternatively, you might want to spend a little more on food and decorations if you’re hosting a family gathering.Additionally, make sure you don’t take on too much. To avoid feeling overwhelmed and stressed, focus on a few things and do them well rather than trying to do everything.3. Keep other expenses in check.For the first time since the pandemic, Deloitte expects spending to surpass pre-pandemic levels in 2023. According to the survey, consumers plan to spend an average of $1,652, up 14% compared to last year.


First of all, spending that much isn’t necessary. It is important to stay within your comfort zone this season and throughout the year.However, what about Christmas money? Perhaps you’re already set up if you’ve been shopping all year or putting money away for the holidays. However, if that isn’t the case, you’ll have to find alternative ways to pay.As a result, your budget might have to be adjusted. For example, spending less on eating out or subscription services in December to compensate for the extra holiday festivities.4. Get creative with gift-giving.The best gifts don’t have to cost a lot of money. This year, think outside the box when it comes to gift-giving. Some ideas are as follows:
Make homemade gifts. Unlike store-bought gifts, handmade gifts can be more personal and thoughtful. A wide variety of homemade gift ideas can be found online, from baked goods to crafts.
Give experiences over things. Material possessions are often more expensive than experiences, yet they can create lasting memories. Gift certificates for massages, spa treatments, or museum memberships are all wonderful options.
Shop second-hand. Buying gently used items from thrift stores makes great gifts. Books, toys, and clothes are all examples.
Take a look around your house. For example, has your child received a gift they’ve never used? It can be rewrapped and placed under the tree.
Give your time. Oftentimes, the best gift you can give is your time. Offer to do their errands, child care, or housework. Taking care of your loved ones is one of the best ways to strengthen your relationship with them. You can make your own coupons to make it seem like a gift.
5. Take advantage of free and low-cost activities.During the holidays, you can take part in many free and low-cost activities. The following are some ideas:
Take a walk in a local park or nature preserve.
Try hiking or biking.
Attend a free holiday concert or performance.
Watch holiday movies with your family or friends.
Volunteer your time to help others.
6. Make use of discount gift cards.Are you aware that you can buy discounted gift cards from hundreds of retailers? This includes realtors like Airbnb, Home Depot, Amazon, Panera, and Target — to name a few. Typically, discounts range from 5%-30% off face value. However, CardCash claims that you can save up to 35%.7. Use coupons. It is no longer necessary to spend hours cutting coupons. You can, however, take advantage of available store coupons.Discount codes and coupons make saving money easy today. Keep an eye out for coupon codes. For finding discounts and the best price online, I recommend Capital One Shopping as a browser extension.


8. Download apps for rewards, discounts and/or cashback.In addition to credit card rewards, Bankrate recommends checking out apps that can also earn you rewards and cashback. Often, cashback sites allow you to check prices for popular items to find the best deals.“To save money, aim to stack discounts,” says Bankrate Senior Industry Analyst Ted Rossman. “As in, combine a store promotion with a rewards credit card (which you hopefully pay in full to avoid interest) and an online shopping portal such as Rakuten or Shop Through Chase. A lot of the big airlines have these, too. Also, take advantage of unused gift cards (about half of Americans have them and the average value is close to $200.”Some of the most popular cashback apps are:
With special holiday savings at stores like Walmart and Nike, Rakuten offers both online and in-store deals.
With Ibotta, you can get big savings on grocery items and connect your grocery loyalty accounts.
With Dosh, you can book hotels and receive up to 40% cashback.
9. Don’t leave anyone out in the cold. Here’s where some candid conversations are required. Surely, your spouse/partner knows what you’re going through financially. But it’s important to be on the same page about Christmas. Take some time to discuss your holiday goals and desires, as well as brainstorm ideas together.You should then decide who in your extended family or friends should be informed.
Are there certain friends or family members with whom you usually exchange gifts?
Have you ever gone shopping with a friend or go out for a special night with another couple as part of a tradition that requires money?
It is not necessary for you to go into details. However, you can explain to them that you cannot afford to do those things this year. Don’t forget that there are probably free alternatives available.If you have kids, definitely talk to them too. In my opinion, younger kids are unlikely to notice the difference, so they do not need to know. Often, it’s not the presents that matter to younger kids, but the decorations, family traditions, and movies they will enjoy.However, you should talk to older children and teens about this issue. Let them know Christmas will still be great, but it won’t be about gifts. Even better? Encourage them to help. For example, they might be able to help you create Spotify playlists or come up with free holiday activities.


10. DIY decorations.While decorations can be an expensive expense, there are many ways to save money on them. For instance, use your creativity to make your own decorations, such as wreaths, garlands, and ornaments. You can do this by using items you already have, natural items like pinecones, or free holiday printables.Additionally, a dollar store or a craft store are also good places to find affordable decorations.11. Potluck-style gatherings.Think about hosting a potluck-style event for your Christmas party or gathering. By doing this, you can save money on food and drinks, and everyone contributes something to the party.12. Plan your meals ahead of time.You can save money on groceries by planning your meals in advance. Prepare an inventory of all the meals you’ll need to prepare, and then go shopping for the ingredients accordingly. When buying groceries, look for deals and discounts, and consider buying in bulk for items you use often.13. Don’t wait until the last minute to shop.Look for sales all year long, not just on Black Friday. Don’t miss out on that stuffed TRex on clearance in July for your nephew who loves dinosaurs. By spreading out your spending and stress throughout the year, you’ll reduce both the amount spent and the amount of stress you’ll experience.Did you miss the early shopping rush this year? Consider it when you plan your next Christmas budget in, wait for it, January.14. Implement the envelope system.You should leave your credit and debit cards at home if you are going out and about. Set aside a certain amount of money for each gift and place it in an envelope marked with the name of the recipient. Once it’s spent, you’re done shopping.After all, the last thing you want is a hefty credit card bill in January!


15. Don’t take part in random gift exchanges.You might look like you’re emulating Scrooge if you do this. Nevertheless, you should stop exchanging white elephant gifts at your workplace, small group, or book club.Even without these social pressures, Christmas is expensive enough. It’s okay to say no, but just be kind.16. Invest in a group gift.Even “token” gifts can add up when exchanging presents with a large group of people, such as at work. Instead, organize a “white elephant” exchange, a Secret Santa strategy, or a gift exchange with colleagues.17. Plan a Pollyanna or Secret Santa gift exchange. A Pollyanna, or Secret Santa if you prefer, involves people buying gifts for one another at Christmas. In fact, this is something that my siblings and I still do to save money. You can, however, use this at work or with friends.As well as helping you save money when you are broke, it makes shopping less stressful.18. This year, allow yourself to skip some things.Christmas shouldn’t have to cost us a fortune, right? Consequently, it might mean giving up expensive things and replacing them with free ones.Listed below are some things you can give up during the Christmas season without missing out on the magic:
Advent Calendars
Gifts for extended family and friends
Expensive gifts, like family vacations
New decorations and ornaments
Stocking stuffers
Although these options are all perfectly acceptable, you don’t have the money at the moment. If you feel guilty about skipping out on these unnecessary expenses, you can write yourself a permission slip.


19. Skip the Christmas cards.There is no better example of a deceptively expensive item than greeting cards. Most greeting cards cost between $2 and $5.Adding on the cost of postage and multiplying that by all your loved ones could add up to a steep bill.For a cost-effective Christmas, consider free and low-cost alternatives like:
Sending e-cards
Making your own Christmas cards
Buying your cards when on clearance or in-bulk
Calling or Zoomng a friend or family member
20. Save on wrapping paper. Each year, Americans spend over $12.7 billion on gift wrap. By 2030, the gift-wrapping product market is expected to reach $32,314.35 million, up from $19,493.67 million in 2021!Yikes.Here are a few alternatives to wrapping paper that won’t cost you a fortune:
Buy in bulk. A dollar store like Dollar Tree, Dollar General, or Family Dollar sells wrapping paper in bulk.
Shop after Christmas. It is common for retailers to clear their stores of bulky, inexpensive items such as wrapping paper after Christmas.
Check thrift stores. Wrapping paper is often available at thrift stores for $0.50 to $1 per roll.
Buy tissue paper. Rather than wrapping paper, you can use tissue paper and decorate it with ribbons or other decorations.
Use what you have. Aluminum foil and newspaper make great wrapping paper.
Make your own. To make your presents look seamless, you can make your own reusable gift bags or use double-sided tape.
21. Hit up the dollar store. Put pride aside. There is everything you need at a dollar store, including ornaments, decorations, wrapping paper, and even gifts. There are also candles, glass vases, and other home décor items available for just $1!Plus, you don’t have to pay for shipping like you would with Amazon.22. Make a list…and check it twice.You should make a list of gifts you plan to purchase and stick to it. It’s the same with any meals, decorations, or activities you’re planning.It’s important to remember that going off the list means overspending!23. Find extra money. As you’ve already figured out, my focus has been on ways to celebrate Christmas without spending money. However, you can still solve the problem by finding ways to earn extra income.In the same breath, I caution you against overstretching yourself during this busy time of year.As a helpful tip, I made use of the food in my freezer and cupboards during a “no-buy week.” By doing this, I saved money for Christmas.You can also sell things around your house that you are no longer using or start a side business.24. Celebrate late.It’s possible to stretch your budget further by celebrating Christmas late if you’re struggling to afford it.It is not uncommon for retailers to offer significant discounts in the days immediately following Christmas to sell their leftover inventory. If you want to stock up on non-perishables for next year, take advantage of these sales.It’s also a busy time around the holidays for travel. According to the 2023 Deloitte Holiday Travel Survey, nearly half of Americans plan to travel between Thanksgiving and the middle of January. In spite of this, you can avoid crowds by postponing your trip until January. In addition to cheaper flights, you can also find cheaper accommodations.


In short, airlines consider January and February to be dead zones. Therefore, this is the time of year to get the cheapest airfare. So, if you want to celebrate the holidays, you might just want to wait until the new year.25. Embrace the spirit of the season.There is more to Christmas than gifts and decorations. During this time of year, you can share joy and goodwill with family and friends. Spending less money on Christmas is possible if you pay attention to the real meaning of the holiday.It is most important to spend time with loved ones and create memories that will last a lifetime during Christmas. Take advantage of this special time of year by not letting financial stress get in the way. A budget-friendly Christmas can be achieved with some creativity and planning.FAQsHow can I plan an affordable Christmas?The following tips will help you plan a budget-friendly Christmas:
Set a budget. Make sure you know how much you can spend on gifts, decorations, food, and other holiday expenses before you begin shopping.
Start shopping early. Deals and discounts are more likely to be found if you start shopping early.
Make a list of who you need to buy gifts for and stick to it. Having a list of those you need to buy and sticking to it will prevent you from getting carried away when shopping.
Consider homemade gifts. You can make homemade gifts at a lower cost than buying store-bought ones, and they’re just as thoughtful and appreciated as their store-bought counterparts.
Get creative with gift wrapping. You don’t have to buy expensive wrapping paper and ribbons to make your gifts look festive. Make your own recycled materials or use brown paper and twine.
Cook a festive meal at home instead of eating out. Saving money by cooking a festive meal at home can be a great alternative to eating out.
Find free or low-cost holiday activities. Taking part in a local holiday parade or festival, going caroling, or visiting a free Christmas tree exhibit are some of the free or low-cost holiday activities you can enjoy with friends and family.
What are some affordable gift ideas?A few affordable gift ideas are listed below:
Homemade gifts. Gifts that are homemade are just as thoughtful and appreciated as gifts that are purchased from a store. There are many homemade gifts you can make, including baked goods, candles, soaps, and jewelry.
Gift cards. A gift card is always a safe bet, and grocery stores and drugstores often offer discounts on them.
Experiences. It is more memorable to receive an experience rather than a material gift. You can give the gift of an experience by purchasing tickets to a concert or sporting event, a massage or spa treatment certificate, or museum or zoo tickets.
Books. There is nothing better than a book as a gift for people of all ages and interests. Online retailers and thrift stores often sell books.
Gifts that give back. It is possible to make a donation instead of a gift to many charities. Giving back to the community and making a difference in others’ lives is the perfect way to give back.
How can I save money on decorations?For decorating on a budget, here are some tips:
Use recycled materials. By recycling cardboard, paper, and plastic bottles, you can create your own decorations.
Shop at thrift stores. At a fraction of the cost of new decorations, thrift stores offer gently used decorations.
Make your own decorations. DIY decoration tutorials are available on many blogs and websites.
Borrow decorations from friends and family. You may be able to borrow decorations from friends and family if you only need them for a few weeks.
Get creative with your decorating. Creating a festive atmosphere in your home doesn’t have to cost a lot. Utilize what you already have and get creative with your decorating.
What are some ways to save money on food?You can save money on food during the holidays by following these tips:
Plan your meals. You don’t need to buy more food than you need if you plan your meals ahead of time.
Cook in bulk. Whenever possible, cook in bulk and freeze leftovers.
Shop at discount grocery stores. The quality of food available at discount grocery stores is the same as that at name-brand stores but at a fraction of the cost.
Buy in bulk. Non-perishable items can be cheaper when purchased in bulk if you have the space.
Grow your own food. You can save a lot of money by growing your own food if you have a green thumb.
How can I make the holidays more about spending time with loved ones than about spending money?To make the holidays more about spending time with loved ones than spending money, follow these tips:



Focus on traditions and activities. Spend your time with your loved ones enjoying traditions and activities instead of buying gifts. You can bake cookies with your family, go caroling, and watch holiday movies as traditions and activities.
Volunteer your time. Making a difference in the lives of others by volunteering your time is a great way to give back to your community.

68,Robinhood CEO Says Big Banks Are Taking Advantage of Americans. Now His Company Wants to Put More Money Into Your Wallet — No Investing Required.,"Nov 16, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/robinhood-ceo-bank-customers-ripped-off-offers-5-apy/465512,"
Robinhood, the stock trading app that made a name for itself during the GameStop frenzy of 2021, is fighting to regain lost ground amid an exodus from the platform and falling stock prices.The company will now pay subscription customers a 5% annual percentage yield (APY) on uninvested cash — significantly above payments from traditional banks, which Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev says have long been duping customers, CNN reported.Image Credit: Getty Images. Robhinhood CEO Vlad Tenev.Related: Robinhood Has Made More Than $50 Million in Crypto Trades But Won't Invest Its Own Money. Here's Why.""Customers are beginning to wake up and realize that they have been getting ripped off by these traditional financial institutions,"" Tenev told the outlet. ""These banks are basically generating all of this revenue that they're not sharing with customers. We see an opportunity to correct that.""



Robinhood's 5% APY is one of the highest in the industry. Betterment, which offers a 4.75% APY; Wealthfront, which offers up to 5.5% APY; and Empower, which offers 4.7% APY, are among the other top contenders, per Investopedia.But unlike the others, which have $0 monthly maintenance fees, Robinhood customers can only lock in that 5% rate if they pay $5 per month for a Gold subscription. The rest will have to settle for 1.5% APY — no 5%, but still much higher than the national average of .58% reported by Bankrate.""It's sort of like banks have assumed that customers are not savvy or intelligent enough to realize that rates are changing, and they could be generating a higher risk-free rate of return on their funds backed by the US government,"" Tenev told CNN.Related: 13 Easy Investing Apps and Websites for Millennials


When the outlet approached the American Bankers Association for comment, spokesperson Jeff Sigmund noted that ""Robinhood can only offer FDIC protection on some of its products because it partners with FDIC-insured banks.""

69,20 Productive Things to Do When You Have No Money,"Nov 16, 2023",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/20-productive-things-to-do-when-you-have-no-money/465554,"
When you don't have any money, it can be stressful. Don't let that stop you from being productive. Even if you're on a tight budget, you can still improve your life and reach your goals.When you don't have any money, here are 20 productive things you can do.1. Hold a bill-lowering session.Are you looking for ideas on what to do instead of spending money or leaving your house? Make a list of all your recurring bills, such as utilities, car insurance, and home insurance, and compare them to see if you can get a better deal.



This may sound tedious. It's important to remember, however, that there is no existing customer loyalty these days. You'll probably end up paying more if you don't change.But, don't stop there. Be sure to only pay for subscriptions and memberships you use.The following 3 questions should be asked if you're stuck:How valuable is this service (or product)?Is there a cheaper option?Could I live without it for the time being?If any of these questions fail, they should be canceled. Even better? Use a tool like Trim or Rocket to find and cancel unwanted subscriptions for you.2. Establish financial goals.The purpose of setting financial goals is to provide direction, motivation, and clarity for your financial planning. By setting specific goals, you can make better financial decisions, stay on top of your budget, and save money for the future.The following are some of the key benefits of setting financial goals:


Direction. Having financial goals gives you a clear idea of what you are striving for. It can also help you stay focused on your priorities and make better financial decisions. By saving for a down payment and avoiding unnecessary debt, for example, you will be more likely to buy a house in five years.Motivation. Sticking to your budget and making financial sacrifices can be motivated by financial goals. Having a clear goal makes it easier to resist the temptation to spend money on frivolous items.Clarity. When you have financial goals, you can track your spending and identify areas where you could cut back. As a result, you will be able to use your resources more efficiently and save more money over time.Aside from these benefits, setting financial goals can also help you:Reduce your debt.Build wealth.Save for a down payment on a house.Achieve financial freedom.Plan for a comfortable retirement.In general, setting financial goals is an essential step toward financial success. Keeping specific goals in mind will allow you to make better financial choices, stay within your budget, and save money.3. Download a budgeting app. Even though budgeting can help you control spending and avoid debt, most people don't keep it up-to-date.An OppLoans survey, which was conducted in 2022, reported that 73% of Americans fail to adhere to a budget regularly. Moreover, 1 in 10 respondents don't even keep a budget.However, a budgeting app can solve this problem.The following are some of the benefits of using a budgeting app:Keeping track of your spending.Establishing financial goals.Understanding your income and spending.Providing automatic alerts.Giving you a complete picture of your finances.A budgeting app can also provide the following benefits:One place for real-time information.Budgeting made easy.Keep track of your progress.Avoiding mistakes.Reminders for bills.Tracking your net worth.Several budgeting apps can automatically download transactions and categorize spending by integrating with your bank account and credit cards. In addition to helping you reduce spending and increase your income, they can also advise you on how to cut back on expenses.


4. Declutter your home.When you lose a bill, throw away spoiled food, or miss your sunglasses, the cost of being disorganized becomes apparent. You can, however, save money by organizing your home.Overdue bills, late fees, and missed deadlines can all be caused by clutter in the home. In a chaotic home, finances can be destroyed, credit can be damaged, and productivity can be impaired.Some examples include:When your home office is disorganized, you might misplace bills, miss tax deadlines, or waste time looking for paperwork.It is possible to have expired food and an overcrowded pantry with a chaotic kitchen.When your closet is cluttered, you may spend money on duplicate clothes or items you don't wear because you can't find them.An untidy living area can block ventilation, leading to higher utility bills.5. Clean your house.Additionally, you should schedule time to do a thorough cleaning of your home. Cleaning your home can improve your overall health, mental health, and sleep. Furthermore, regular home cleaning will save you money over time.For example, air conditioners, refrigerators, and washing machines can operate at maximum efficiency if they are kept free from dust and lint, reducing electricity bills and extending the lifespan of these expensive appliances.Plus, you can sell the stuff you no longer need to make some extra dough.6. Plan your meals. In 2023, the average cost of groceries per person in America will be $415.53. Location, age, and personal eating habits can all affect this number. Regardless, when money is tight, this can be a burdensome expense.The good news is that you can save money on groceries with meal planning. Sure, it's not an exciting activity. However, this helps prevent you from buying unnecessary groceries, and more importantly, it keeps you from using the grocery store midweek.


Also, when you plan to use the food that's already in the freezer, fridge, and pantry, you'll have to make fewer grocery purchases and waste less food. In addition to leftovers, you can think about how you will use up the produce and other perishables that might end up in the trash.7.

70,"What's the Point of a Savings Account, Anyway?","Nov 15, 2023",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/whats-the-point-of-a-savings-account-anyway/465475,"
In a recent survey by GOBankingRates, 17.36% of Americans reported their lack of a savings account. In fact, a whopping 28.91% of those 55-64 years of age do not have a savings account. As this demographic approaches retirement age, that's particularly concerning.In contrast, only 13.51% of those aged 18-24 reported no savings accounts. In addition, the survey found that 18.31% of women and 16.25% of men did not have a savings account.It has been noted in the survey that Americans lack sufficient savings across demographic groups, emphasizing the need to build emergency funds and save.Still not convinced? Let's explain why and how a savings account can help you achieve your financial goals.What is a Savings Account?Here's a quick breakdown of what a savings account is for those of you new to finance.Typically, a savings account earns a modest amount of interest and lets you deposit your money. These accounts are federally insured up to $250,000 per account owner and offer a safe place to put your money while earning interest.A savings account is a deposit account with a bank or other financial institutions like credit unions that pay interest. These accounts, however, typically pay modest interest rates. The upside is that you can park short-term cash in them with their safety and reliability. In fact, these accounts are federally insured up to $250,000 per account ownerAnother perk? To open a savings account, you don't need much money. Also, you'll have easy access to your money — although you'll have a limited number of times per month to access it.Savings Accounts: How They WorkSavings accounts can be opened either in person or online at a bank or credit union. As with opening a checking account, the process is similar. An account will be opened once you have submitted your personal information and deposited funds.



You'll start earning interest on your savings account once you've deposited money. There are several factors that influence earnings, including your savings account APY, your deposit amount, and how long you keep your money.Depending on your bank's policy, interest can compound daily, monthly, quarterly, or yearly. The accrued interest is deposited into your account at the end of each compounding period. You will then begin earning interest on the balance of your new account (deposits plus interest).As an example, here is how a savings account could be used:You open a savings account with a $100 deposit.In this account, interest is earned at a rate of 2% a year.After one year, the balance in the account is $102.It is possible for the APY of your savings account to change at any time. However, money can be moved out of the account at any time without penalty. Most institutions limit the number of withdrawals you can make from a savings account per month to six.Why Everyone Should Have a Savings AccountYour savings account serves as a place to stash some of your money. In many cases, it is a starting point that enables them to pursue specific goals in life that are important to them but require discipline and financial planning.While there are several reasons why you should open a savings account, these are the main ones.Provides peace of mind when unexpected expenses arise.There are always unexpected expenses in life, such as car repairs, medical bills, and job losses. It's probably for this reason that 90% of Americans say financial considerations impact their stress levels, according to a study from Discover and Thrive Global's Thriving Wallet.Savings accounts can provide you with peace of mind knowing that you have a financial cushion to fall back on in times of need. In such a situation, you may be able to avoid incurring debt or selling assets to cover unexpected expenses.


Down payment savings for a house or car.The purchase of a home or a car involves a significant financial commitment. The benefits of having a savings account include preventing private mortgage insurance (PMI) and a higher interest rate on your loan.A typical down payment is between 5 and 20%, but this can be as low as 3%. However, PMI must be paid by buyers who put less than 20% down until they have 20% equity in their home.Savings for retirement.When you retire, you will no longer receive a regular paycheck. According to a Clever survey, retirees have on average saved $170,726 for retirement. It is also alarming to learn that 37% of retirees no longer have retirement savings, compared to 30% in 2022, and only 12% have enough to meet the recommended retirement savings target of $555,000 per retiree.It is therefore important to have a savings account to ensure that you will have enough money for retirement.Saving for a child's education.Every year, college costs rise. During the year 2022-2023, tuition and fees averaged $39,400 for private colleges. Thankfully, you can reduce your child's student loan debt by setting up a savings account to pay for their education.Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) and 529 Plans (also known as Coverdell accounts) are two types of tax-advantaged college savings plans. Tax-deferred growth is available with both types of accounts. Moreover, the money-including any gains and investment income-can be withdrawn tax-free as long as it is used to finance qualified education expenses, such as tuition, books, supplies, computers, and room and board.Savings for a vacation or other special purchase.There is nothing wrong with taking a little vacation every once in a while. You can save without going into debt for a special vacation or other special purchases thanks to a savings account.In order to build an emergency fund.Emergency funds can be used to cover unexpected expenses, such as job loss, medical bills, and home repairs. The amount of money you need in your emergency fund should be at least three to six months' worth of living expenses.


However, according to Bankrate, 57% of U.S. adults are unhappy with how much they have in emergency savings. More troubling? In 13 years of surveying, 22% of Americans do not have any emergency savings.Achieving financial goals.Having a savings account can help you achieve your financial goals, whether you are saving for a down payment on a house, retirement, or your child's education.To teach children about the importance of saving money.Spending, saving, and managing money is a valuable lesson your children can learn at a young age.A U.S. Government Accountability Office study found that low-income families with children enrolled in Children's Savings Accounts save four times as much money as those without children.Families may also have higher educational expectations for their children after contributing to a CSA. There is limited evidence that the long-term effects of parents expecting their children to attend college or other higher education are evident, according to a government study.Compared to checking accounts, higher returns are available.Most checking accounts do not earn interest and those that do tend to pay very low rates to savers. Most interest-bearing checking accounts earn a lower annual percentage yield (APY) than savings accounts.These days, it's not hard to find an account that earns a higher rate than 4% in a high-yield savings account. Typically, online banks offer these types of accounts, since they don't need to maintain branches and can pass the savings along.The safest way to store your savings.You are protected up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, per ownership category when you have a savings account at a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).


National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF), a federally backed fund, insures accounts held by members of the National Credit Union Association (NCUA). This insurance is capped at $250,000 per account and owner, just like FDIC insurance.How to Maximize Your Earnings from a Savings AccountA savings account typically offers a low-interest rate. The good news is there are plenty of ways to get the most out of your savings account:Shop around for the best interest rate. The interest rates on savings accounts vary from bank to bank, so compare them before you open one. Online banks and credit unions typically have the best interest rates, so make sure you check them out.Open a high-yield savings account. A high-yield savings account pays more interest than a traditional savings account. Savings accounts with high yields are available at online and brick-and-mortar banks.Consider a certificate of deposit (CD). Compared to savings accounts, CDs offer higher interest rates, but you have to keep your money in them for a while, usually 3 months to 5 years. Investing in a CD can be a good way to earn more interest if you're willing to tie up your money.Use a money market account. You can get higher interest rates and more flexibility with money market accounts. Money market accounts often let you write checks and use debit cards.Keep your balance high. You'll earn more interest if you have more money in your savings account. To avoid monthly fees, keep your balance at or above the minimum balance.Make regular deposits. It doesn't matter how small your monthly deposit is; it will add up over time. It is also possible to set up automatic monthly transfers from your checking account to your savings account.Besides the above tips, you may also want to consider:Use a savings account bonus. A bank may give new customers a bonus if they open a savings account and maintain a certain balance for a certain period of time.Ladder your CDs. When saving a large sum of money, ladder your CDs. Having multiple CDs with different terms allows you to have access to some of your money at any time.Avoid early withdrawal penalties. To avoid early withdrawal penalties, carefully read the fine print on CDs before opening. You will likely have to pay a penalty if you withdraw your money before the term is up.With these tips, you can get the most out of your savings account and reach your financial goals sooner.How to Open a Savings AccountIt is easy to open a savings account since most banks and credit unions offer them. Accounts can be opened online, in person, or by phone.It's important to compare interest rates and fees when choosing a savings account. Additionally, make sure the account has the features you need, such as mobile check deposits and online access.You can start saving money as soon as you open a savings account. Alternatively, you can make automatic deposits from your paycheck. Even if you save just a little, it's important to save regularly. A little bit goes a long way.FAQsWhat is a savings account?Savings accounts are types of deposit accounts that help you save money and earn interest. Compared to stocks and bonds, savings accounts typically have lower interest rates, but they also carry less risk. The main reason is that FDIC-insured banks insure individual depositor savings accounts up to $250,000 for each ownership category. In other words, you won't lose your money if the bank fails.An emergency fund should also be kept in a savings account since you can easily access it when needed.


What are the different types of savings accounts?Various types of savings accounts are available, each with its own advantages. There are several types of savings accounts, including:Traditional savings accounts. These are the most common savings accounts. Basic features include minimum opening deposits, minimum balance requirements, and monthly maintenance fees.High-yield savings accounts. Compared to traditional savings accounts, these accounts offer higher interest rates, but they may have stricter requirements, such as a higher minimum balance or a monthly withdrawal limit.Money market accounts. This is a savings account with checking features. Interest rates are usually higher than savings accounts, but minimum balance requirements may be lower and withdrawals may be more flexible.Certificate of deposit (CD) accounts. In exchange for higher interest rates, CDs require you to keep your money in the account for a specific period of time, such as six months, one year, or five years. A penalty may apply if you withdraw before the CD matures.What are the drawbacks of having a savings account?The following are some drawbacks of savings accounts:Low interest rates. The interest rate on savings accounts is usually low. As a result, your money will not grow as much as it would in stocks or bonds.Fees. You may have to pay ATM fees or monthly maintenance fees on savings accounts. Before opening an account, compare the fees.Withdrawal restrictions. There are withdrawal restrictions on some savings accounts, like a monthly withdrawal limit. Understand withdrawal policies before opening an account.How do I choose the right savings account for me?A few factors to consider when choosing a savings account are:Interest rate. Choose an account with high interest.Fees. Before opening an account, compare fees.Withdrawal policies. Check withdrawal policies before opening an account.Other features. A savings account can offer additional features, such as ATM access or mobile check deposit.

The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau notes that opening a checking or savings account takes $25 to $100.The Balance found that banks and credit unions have the following minimum deposits:National banks: Between $25 to $100Community and regional banks: Potentially less, often $0 to $50Credit unions: Between $1 and $10Online-only banks: Often, $0 minimum depositGenerally, you need to deposit at least $25 to open a savings account.The post What's the Point of a Savings Account, Anyway? appeared first on Due.

71,Successfully Living on One Income: 12 Tips and Strategies,"Nov 14, 2023",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/successfully-living-on-one-income-12-tips-and-strategies/465387,"
The number of U.S. households with dual income has risen from 51.9% in 2010 to 53.3% in 2019. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, however, 61.1% of married couples with children have both parents working. At least one parent in 97.4% of married-couple families with children was employed in 2022, and 65.0% of these families had both parents employed.Of course, this isn't all that shocking.MagnifyMoney senior content director Ismat Mangla points out that dual-income households in the U.S. have been increasing for decades. As a result, it is not surprising that this trend has continued during the past decade.



One reason for this increase can be attributed to the Great Recession that started late in 2007 and lasted until June 2009. This resulted in many young adults having difficulty finding employment during this period, which prevented them from paying off student debt and saving for the future. Playing catch-up may have been easier with two earning members in the household.Moreover, Mangla says more and more families need two income earners to remain middle class. The cost of housing and child care has continued to rise while wages have remained relatively stable.""However, at the more affluent end of the spectrum, often the desire to maintain a certain lifestyle pushes couples to earn dual incomes at the expense of time,"" Mangla notes.In general, dual-income households experience less financial stress and higher incomes. However, sacrifices must also be made. A dual-income couple, for instance, tends to have higher fixed costs as well as a more difficult time balancing work and family obligations.With that said, here are some tips and strategies to help you successfully live on one income.1. Take it slow at the beginning.The cold-turkey approach rarely works when trying to quit a bad habit. Rather, take your time and make a plan.


""To begin weaning yourself off the second salary, take stock of your expenses,"" says Snigdha Kumar, personal finance expert and head of product operations at Digit. In order to prioritize your spending, Kumar recommends categorizing your monthly expenses. ""Identify the ""must-haves' and eliminate some of the ""nice-to-haves' and consider paying the ""must-have' expenses with the higher salary,"" she advises.Kumar recommends using the higher salary ($50k) to pay for living expenses and saving the other towards retirement, an emergency fund, or a down payment for a house.""Many dual-income families take on expenses based on the money both partners earn. There is nothing wrong with this approach, but if couples want to turbocharge their finances and gain some form of financial independence, make sure a single salary can cover basic living expenses,"" she continues.2. Update your budget.It is helpful to figure out your new monthly budget before you downsize to one paycheck, so you can make any necessary adjustments. Take into account how much you'll save by not having to commute, buy dry cleaning and lunches, as well as other expenses you'll stop having, such as child care.Budgeting should not only include your day-to-day expenses, but also your savings plan. For example, long-term goals, such as retirement, should be saved. You may be eligible to contribute to both employer-sponsored retirement plans and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) if you're married and file a joint federal tax return. Nonworking spouses may be able to contribute to separate, tax-advantaged spousal IRAs.3. Live below your means.Arguably the most important thing you can do is live below your means if you want to survive on one income. In other words, you should spend less than you earn. Although it may take some time to adjust your lifestyle, it will be worth it in the end.In order to reduce your expenses in various areas of your life, here are some suggestions:Housing:


Move into a smaller house or apartment if you can.If you own a home, consider renting out a room.Find a roommate.Get a lower interest rate on your mortgage by refinancing.Pay off your mortgage early by making extra payments.Food:Instead of eating out, cook more meals at home.Save money by buying in bulk.If you have the space, grow your own food.Don't miss out on coupons and discounts.Transportation:Whenever possible, walk, bike, or take public transportation.Reduce the number of trips you need to make by combining errands.Consider carpooling with friends or neighbors.Invest in a fuel-efficient vehicle.Other expenses:Don't waste money on unnecessary expenses like cable TV, gym memberships, and eating out.Whenever possible, look for cheaper alternatives to the products and services you enjoy.Negotiate your bills.Cancel unused subscriptions.4. Get the most out of your savings.When one partner stays at home, commute and childcare costs may be reduced. As a result, any savings you make from situations such as that should be deposited into an interest-bearing savings account.Your savings account can be maximized if you follow these steps:Find the highest interest rate. Find out which savings accounts offer the best interest rates. Traditional savings accounts usually offer very low-interest rates. An account with a high yield offers a higher interest rate, however, which can increase the growth rate of your savings.Build a CD ladder. Open several CDs that mature at different times. Each month, you could open a CD for a year.Buy savings bonds. Unlike other debt securities, Series I bonds are backed by the government of the United States and earn interest for a period of 30 years.Automate your savings. Ensure that your checking account is transferred automatically to your savings account on a regular basis. As a result, you will be able to save money without even thinking about it.5. Increase your income.You may need to consider increasing your income if you are having trouble making ends meet with only one income source. The following are some suggestions for increasing your income to achieve this:Start a side hustle. A side hustle can take many forms. Among your options are freelance work, starting a blog, and selling products online.Get a part-time job. You can increase your income by getting a part-time job if you have the time.Ask for a raise at your current job. You may be able to negotiate a raise with your employer if you have been performing well at work.6. Designate responsibilities.In the beginning, Monica Louie struggled with the idea of not contributing to her family's finances. By optimizing the household's day-to-day finances, she soon found another way to contribute, even though she was no longer earning income.""My role in taking control of our finances has allowed me to feel like I am contributing financially to my family because my husband gives me credit for staying on top of our budget to make sure we're paying as much toward our debt as possible each month,"" Louie shares.


7. Get rid of high-interest debt.In many cases, high-interest debt, such as credit card debt, can have steep interest rates. In fact, the average credit card interest rate in America is 24.46% today – the highest rate in 2019 when LendingTree began tracking them. Buying things with plastic when you carry a balance means you'll pay significantly more than the receipt says because you'll be paying a hefty annual percentage rate (APR).Here are some tips for removing high-interest debt:Make more than the minimum payment. Whenever possible, try to pay more than the minimum on your debts each month. As a result, you'll be able to pay them off more quickly.Use a debt snowball or avalanche method. When paying off your debts, the snowball method involves paying off your smallest debts first, while the avalanche method involves paying off your highest-interest debts first. Generally, the debt avalanche method is more cost-effective than the debt snowball method for paying off debt.Negotiate with your creditors. It may be possible to negotiate a lower interest rate or monthly payment with your creditors.Consider consolidating your debt. It may be possible to save money by consolidating multiple debts with high-interest rates into one with a lower rate.Take advantage of hardship programs. If you are struggling financially, some creditors offer hardship programs that can help you make smaller payments or avoid interest payments.8. Consider tax withholding.You may need to adjust your income tax withholding due to your smaller annual income. If you increase your allowances, less money will be taken from your paycheck every month.Consult a tax professional or contact the IRS directly if you're unsure whether you need to adjust your withholding. In the event that your net income is affected by withholding changes, make sure to adjust your budget accordingly.9. Be responsible when using credit cards.If you can't pay off the balance every month, don't use credit, not even for gas or food. Unless you do, you will incur a growing amount of interest.You can use the wait-and-see method before making a big, unexpected purchase by walking away for 48 hours to 30 days, and then deciding if you still want it after some time has passed. It may turn out that you really don't need to make such a large purchase.Are you still struggling with debt? Consult a non-profit organization like the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC).10. Be prepared for emergencies.The possibility of an unexpected expense always exists, even if you live within your means. Suffice it to say, that in case of an emergency, you should have a plan in place.


You can do this by setting up an emergency fund. If you lose your job or suffer a medical emergency, you can tap into your emergency fund to cover the expenses.It is also important to have adequate insurance coverage in case of an emergency. A variety of insurance policies are included here, such as health insurance, auto insurance, and homeowners insurance.11. Seek out free or low-cost activities.If you want to cut expenses, you should avoid dining out, attending expensive concerts, and attending costly sporting events. Consider alternatives that are free or low-cost instead. Enjoy family walks, board games, and streaming movie nights with your loved ones.12. Be flexible and willing to make changes.There are times when things don't go as planned. When you live off of one income source, you must be flexible and willing to change as you see fit.Losing your job, for instance, may require you to reduce expenses or find a new job quickly. You may need to use your emergency fund or take out a medical loan in case of a medical emergency.It is important to prepare and be willing to make changes when necessary. However, living off one income makes this even more important.FAQsIs it possible to live on one income?Yes, it is possible to live off one income. It does, however, require careful planning and budgeting. You must be honest with yourself about your expenses and determine whether your income will cover them.Various ways can be found to reduce your expenses, including cutting back on unnecessary spending, cooking more at home, and finding cheaper alternatives.


How do I create a budget for one income?In order to create a budget for one income, you must first track your spending. If you do this, you will be able to see where your money is going and identify areas where you can make savings.By learning how you spend, you can create a budget that allocates your income to essentials like housing, food, and transportation. Also, make sure you budget for savings and unforeseen expenses.What are some common challenges of living on one income?A single income can present a number of challenges, including:Making ends meet. When you have a lot of expenses, it can be challenging to make ends meet on one income. Discipline is crucial when it comes to spending and avoiding overspending.Saving for the future. When you are living on one income, saving for the future, such as retirement or a down payment for a house, can be difficult. No matter how small your monthly savings might be, it is important to make saving a priority.Dealing with unexpected expenses. For families living on one income, unexpected expenses, such as job loss or medical emergencies, can be financially devastating. Having an emergency fund in place can help you deal with these types of expenses.Keeping up with others. With only one income, keeping up with others can be difficult. As everyone's financial situation differs, it is important not to compare yourself to others and to focus on your own goals.What are some resources for people living on one income?For people living on one income, there are many resources available. Here are a few examples:Government programs. People living on one income can benefit from a variety of government programs, including food stamps, Medicaid, and low-income housing.Nonprofit organizations. People living on one income can find a variety of services offered by nonprofit organizations, such as financial counseling, job training, and childcare assistance.Online resources.

This story originally appeared on Under30CEO.com As you move towards retirement, it is crucial to strategize and get ready for your financial needs once you've retired. To guarantee you can sustain your preferred way of life without exhausting your savings, ponder over these three essential questions: Firstly, take a moment to examine your anticipated expenses in retirement, including housing, utilities, food, healthcare, and leisure activities. By creating a detailed budget based on these costs, you can better understand how much income will be needed to maintain your desired lifestyle during retirement.Understanding Retirement Expenses1. What amount of income will I truly require?To successfully prepare for retirement, devote time to reassessing your living expenses, factoring in retirement costs like travel, medical care, home upgrades, and potential assistance for relatives. Keep in mind that due to inflation, this figure is likely to increase over time, especially with respect to health care costs.



2. Create a detailed and realistic budget.To determine the amount of income you will need in retirement, it is crucial to create a comprehensive budget that covers all your potential expenses. Be sure to include items such as utilities, groceries, insurance, taxes, and personal expenses, as well as allocate some funds for leisure activities and unexpected costs that may arise in the future.3. Factor in multiple sources of retirement income.When calculating your necessary retirement income, remember to consider various income sources, such as Social Security benefits, pension plans, investment returns, and possible part-time work. By diversifying your financial resources, you can better ensure financial stability and minimize reliance on any single income source during your retirement years.


Sources of Retirement IncomeAn essential aspect of retirement planning involves arranging for dependable revenue streams, such as Social Security, pension schemes, and mandatory retirement plan minimum distributions (RMDs) to address your basic necessities. To enhance your income, look into more adaptable sources like stock dividends, interest from bonds or CDs, and part-time employment.Related: You Must Understand This Crucial Retirement Benefit If You Want Your Money to Withstand Inflation — Whether You're 25 or 75Additionally, consider exploring passive income opportunities, such as real estate investments or peer-to-peer lending platforms, which can provide a steady cash flow without significant time commitment. It is vital to diversify your income sources to minimize risks and ensure greater financial stability during your retirement years.Annuities can also provide extra cash flow; speak with a financial consultant to identify the most appropriate annuity for your requirements. There are various types of annuities available, such as immediate, deferred, fixed, and variable, each with its own benefits and risks. A financial consultant can help you evaluate these options based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline, ensuring that you make an informed decision best suited to your needs.


Asset Protection and ManagementPreparing for unforeseen situations, such as illness or death, is critical to avoid causing stress to your family and financial difficulties. One effective way to safeguard and manage your assets is by creating a comprehensive estate plan that includes essential legal documents like a will, trust, power of attorney, and healthcare directive. This ensures that your wishes are followed, assets are distributed according to your preferences, and your loved ones are taken care of in case of any unexpected events.Healthcare Coverage in RetirementAssess your Medicare insurance choices and think about acquiring additional coverage, like Medigap or Medicare Advantage bundled plans, to ensure you're ready for future medical expenses. As you evaluate your options, it's crucial to compare the coverage, benefits, and costs of each plan, taking into consideration your current and anticipated healthcare needs. Moreover, understanding the enrollment process and deadlines can help you avoid potential penalties and ensure a smooth transition to a comprehensive healthcare insurance plan that suits your requirements.It is crucial to begin exploring your insurance options early since different plans have specific enrollment periods. Understanding the various insurance plans available and their respective coverage will help you make an informed decision based on your personal needs and budget. Assessing your options in advance also ensures that you have ample time to gather all necessary documents and complete the enrollment process without missing deadlines.

74,12 Things to Do to Become Mortgage-Free Sooner,"Nov 7, 2023",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/12-things-to-do-to-become-mortgage-free-sooner/465030,"
Getting rid of your mortgage is one of the biggest financial goals for many people. After all, once you are mortgage-free, you'll be able to relax, be more financially flexible, and plan for retirement sooner. Although there is no one-size-fits-all solution for becoming mortgage-free faster, there are a few things you can do to speed up the process.1. Make larger monthly payments.The simplest way to become mortgage-free sooner? Make larger payments than the required minimum. Of course, how much extra money you can devote to your mortgage will determine this. However, if you can pay $50 or $100 more each month, it will add up over time and help you pay off your mortgage more quickly.Using a mortgage calculator, you can calculate how much faster you can pay off your mortgage by making larger monthly payments. But, let's give you an example.



Let's say that you bought a house for $250,000 and have a 30-year mortgage at 7% interest. If your monthly payment is $1,663.26 and you tack on an extra $1,000, you'll pay off your mortgage in 4 years, 7 months sooner. Plus, you'll save $27,179.51 in interest.However, here's what you'll need to know before you make extra payments:


Consult your mortgage company first. Some companies may impose prepayment penalties or extra payments may only be accepted at certain times.If you make an extra payment, note that you would like it to be applied to the principal balance and not to the next month's payment.Be careful not to get sucked into a mortgage accelerator program, like biweekly payments. You can accomplish the same goal with focused attention and intention.2. When rates are low, refinance.It is possible for mortgage rates to fluctuate over time. As such, a refinance may allow you to shorten the duration of your mortgage without significantly increasing your monthly payments if rates have fallen since you signed the mortgage.Suppose you could reduce your repayment schedule by six years by converting your 30-year fixed loan to a 15-year loan. In this case, you will only end up paying a few hundred dollars more each month to shed that debt much sooner, making it possible to be mortgage-free by retirement by securing a low mortgage rate.3. Make a lump-sum payment.In the event of a windfall, like an inheritance or large tax refund, you can pay off your mortgage in one lump sum. By doing so, you would save money on interest and shorten your repayment timeline all at once.Let's say you inherited $10,000 and decided to throw it on your mortgage. If you have a loan of $200,000 with a 7% interest rate, you will pay it off 19 months sooner and save $21,895 in interest charges.


4. Pay down your mortgage before you buy a home.What, wait? Hold one, let me explain.As soon as you think about buying a house, you should start paying off your mortgage debt. By doing this, you'll be able to get a bigger mortgage and a lower interest rate.In addition to avoiding private mortgage insurance (PMI), saving up a 20% down payment will also save you hundreds of dollars every month.5. Live below your means.Clearly, living below your means is one of the best ways to reach your financial goals. In other words, you should spend less money each month than you earn.The extra money you save or put toward your mortgage can be put towards your savings or other financial goals when you live below your means.Of course, this is sometimes easier said than done. But, here are a couple of suggestions to free up some money for paying off your house early.Budget your groceries more carefully. You probably spend the most on groceries outside of housing — especially if you have children. If possible, change stores, shop sales, and buy in-season produce to save money. And, also master the art of couponing.You may want to cancel some subscriptions. Subscription services are easy to accumulate these days. So, determine which streaming services you can live without and cancel them. You can then put the money toward your mortgage.Reduce your energy consumption. You can lower your monthly bills and help the environment by reducing the amount of energy you consume. The easiest way to reduce energy consumption is to unplug electronics when they're not being used, change to LED lights, and lower your thermostat during colder months a few degrees.Take a look at your insurance coverage. It may be possible to get a cheaper price on your insurance coverage if you work with an independent insurance agent who shops rates from multiple providers.6. Live on 50% of your income.""At the start of our marriage, we paid off $48,032 of consumer debt,"" writes family finance coach Andy Hill. ""Since that time, we've consistently lived on about 50% of our income."" In some years, the Hill family has spent more, while in others, they've saved more. Generally, though, they save about half and spend about half as a couple.""It definitely helps when you have a six-figure household income,"" he adds. ""During our mortgage payoff process, we averaged around $170,000 per year for our household income.""


Their goal was to become mortgage-free within 5 years. ""We had prepared ourselves for this reality and it wasn't bad when we were both employed,"" Andy explains. A lot of things changed when Andy's wife Nicole left her job to stay home with our two kids.7. Get a roommate or rent out a portion of your home.You can generate extra income by getting a roommate or renting out a portion of your house if you have the space.For example, you could rent out a spare bedroom for $1,000 per month if you have one. This could be used as that additional monthly mortgage payment I discussed earlier.If you don't want to have a roomie or tenant, you could list any extra space you have on Airbnb or Vrbo.


8. Start a side hustle.A side hustle might be the perfect way for you to make extra cash to put toward your mortgage. Freelancing, blogging, and selling products online are all ways to make money on the side. You could also sell your wanted items on Facebook Marketplace, eBay, Decluttr, or Poshmark.9. Get a part-time job.A part-time job can also help you make extra money towards your mortgage if you have the time.Working a few hours a week can add up over time, even if it's a small amount. As an example, if you earn $20 per hour and work 10 hours per week, you could earn $2,000 more each year.10. Ask for help from family or friends.Your family or friends may be able to help you with your mortgage payments if you are struggling. There is a possibility that they will lend you money or give you a financial gift.


In the event that family or friends provide you with financial assistance, you should make sure to formalize it and create a repayment plan. Any future misunderstandings or conflicts can be avoided by doing this.11. Downsize. The idea of downsizing your house may seem a bit extreme. However, a smaller, less expensive home might be a better option if you want to pay off your mortgage faster.Even better? You may be able to purchase your new home with 100% cash from the sale of your bigger house. But, you will still end up with lower payments even if you do have to get a small mortgage.Remember, your goal is to eliminate that new mortgage as quickly as you can. Use the lower payments and smaller balance you get from downsizing to pay off your home faster. After all, it's not an excuse to pocket money in the short term and defer repayment.


12. Consider government programs.Several types of government-backed loans are available, including VA loans, USDA loans, and FHA loans. FHA loans are backed by the Federal Housing Administration, USDA loans are targeted at rural homebuyers, and VA loans are designed specifically for veterans.A government-backed mortgage can often be more affordable than a conventional mortgage. If you are low-income, have less-than-perfect credit, or cannot afford a large down payment, they can be a good option.FAQsWhat is the best way to become mortgage-free sooner?To become mortgage-free sooner, it's best to make extra principal payments. In order to do this, you can:When you buy a home, if you make a larger down payment, you will have a smaller mortgage balance and pay less interest.Make even a small increase in your monthly mortgage payment.An annual lump-sum payment on your mortgage, such as a tax refund or bonus.In the event that interest rates have fallen since taking out your mortgage, you may be able to refinance to a lower rate.In general, the more debt you have, the more you'll have to pay on a monthly basis. Don't take out other debts, such as personal loans or credit cards.How much money can I save by paying off my mortgage early?If you pay off your mortgage early, you can save a lot of money, depending on factors such as your interest rate, loan amount, and extra monthly payments. It is possible, however, to save thousands of dollars on interest simply by making an additional payment each month over the course of your loan.


What are the other benefits of paying off your mortgage early?Paying off your mortgage early has a number of other benefits, including:A greater sense of financial freedom and flexibility.The ability to invest more money for retirement or other goals.Getting your monthly expenses down.Increasing your credit score.Are there any risks associated with paying off your mortgage early?It is possible that paying off your mortgage early will cause you to lose out on investment opportunities. If your mortgage interest rate is low, investing your extra money may be more financially advantageous than paying it off early.Refinancing your mortgage to a shorter term can speed up the repayment process. It is important to note, however, that you will likely have higher monthly payments. Additionally, you should ask your lender if there are any prepayment penalties on your current loan.In any case, such decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis.


How do I know if paying off my mortgage early is right for me?Depending on your individual financial situation and goals, you may want to consider paying off your mortgage early. To get personalized advice on paying off your mortgage early, you should speak with a financial advisor.The post 12 Things to Do to Become Mortgage-Free Sooner appeared first on Due.

75,How to Stockpile Food in Times of Shortage,"Nov 1, 2023",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/how-to-stockpile-food-in-times-of-shortage/464744,"
Having an emergency plan is more important than ever in today's world. Among the ways to accomplish this is by stockpiling food. In other words, you should have food on hand if there is a shortage or disruption of the food supply.Why would you want to stockpile food? There are a number of reasons for this, including:Natural disasters. There are many natural disasters that can disrupt the food supply, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and wildfires. During these times, you may need a stockpile of food to survive.Pandemics. Food supplies can also be disrupted by pandemics, like we experienced during COVID-19. Stockpiling food can ensure your safety and health during these times.Economic instability. Food shortages can occur as a result of economic instability, such as a recession. Stockpiling food during these times can help you weather the storm.Based on your individual needs and circumstances, you will be able to determine the best way to stockpile food. However, to get started here are a few general tips.



1. Determine your needs.Identifying your specific needs is the first step. How much food should you stockpile? Several factors will determine this, including:How many people live in your household?Dietary requirements.How long do you expect to be self-sufficient?After you've determined your needs, you can begin stockpiling your food. However, according to the CDC, all Americans should keep at least a three-day supply of food and water in their homes, and at least one gallon of water per person per day. Keeping food and water on hand for a week is a good idea if you have the space.


2. Choose the right food.It is also important to understand that not all food is created equal. There are some foods that are better suited for stockpiling than others. As such, the following factors should be considered when deciding what food to stockpile:Shelf life. The shelf life of some foods is longer than others. The shelf life of canned goods is several years, while the shelf life of fresh fruits and vegetables is only a couple of days.Nutritional value. Choosing foods that are nutritious will give you the energy and nutrients you need.Personal preferences. You should also choose foods you and/or your family enjoy.You should eat nutritious foods that will help you maintain your health if the emergency is caused by a disease. Moreover, since you'll only have a limited supply of foods in your emergency preparedness kit, you should choose higher-quality foods and consume fewer of them.""In a disaster or an emergency you want those calories,"" Barry Swanson, professor emeritus of food science at Washington State University, told Real Simple. ""You want some nutrients and some fiber—something to keep your diet normal.""""In an emergency, generally you tend to think of meeting more basic needs than preferences and flavors,"" says Elizabeth Andress, professor emerita and extension food safety specialist at the University of Georgia. ""But if you plan right, you can have a great variety of foods and nutrients.""


3. Store your food properly.After choosing the right food, make sure it is stored properly. By doing so, you can extend the shelf life of your food and prevent it from spoiling.In general, food should be stored in a cool, dry place, even though there are a number of different ways to do so. In addition, 40° to 70°F is the ideal temperature.When storing food, it's also recommended that you:Avoid storing foods near ranges or refrigerator exhausts. Foods that are exposed to heat spoil more quickly.Make sure food is stored away from petroleum products, which include gasoline, oil, paints, and solvents. It is possible for some food products to absorb their smell.Ensure that food is protected from rodents and insects. A box or paper carton that is heavily wrapped or stored in a waterproof, airtight container will keep items longer.Various methods, such as canning, drying, and freezing, can be used to preserve food.Depending on how long you plan to store the food and what type of food you are storing, you will need to store it differently.


4. Rotate your stock.A regular rotation of your food stock is essential. You can keep your food fresh and ensure that nothing goes to waste by doing this.It is recommended that you rotate your canned food stockpile every two to four years and your dried food stockpile every two to three years.First-in, First-Out (FIFO) is an effective way of rotating your food. By using this method, the oldest inventory will be used first, and the newest inventory will be used last. In addition to frozen and refrigerated items, dry storage items can also be sorted by the FIFO method.Rotating your food stockpile also involves:


In order to maintain the best quality, canned goods should be used within a year of purchase.Ensure that dried foods such as beans, flour, sugar, and oats are rotated every two to three years.Dry foods should be stored in large waterproof containers and used as soon as possible after they have been opened.Inspect display and storage areas for damaged stock and remove it.5. Be prepared to use your stock.Having food on hand when you need it is the entire point of stockpiling food. Therefore, it is crucial to prepare your stock for use.Having an emergency plan for how you will use your food is one way to do this. If you have stockpiled food, you may want to have a list of recipes you can use.You can also prepare yourself to use your stock by practicing cooking with the foods you have stocked up. As a result, you will become familiar with the food and how to use it.Also, make sure you have the right equipment to prepare and cook the food. For example, to open your canned goods, you'll need a can opener.


Additional food stockpiling tips:Start small. Don't stockpile too much food overnight. Each week, stockpile a small amount of food. For example, purchasing canned beans when they're on sale or you have coupons. As time passes, your stockpile will increase.Buy in bulk. You can save money by buying in bulk. Be sure, however, to only buy foods that you will have space to store and that you can consume before they expire.Use a food storage calendar. With a food storage calendar, you can keep track of your stockpile and rotate your stock regularly.Label your food stockpile with the date that you purchased it. This will make it easier to rotate your food stockpile.Let your family know about your food stockpile. It is important to inform your family if you have a food stockpile. Having this information will help them to know what to do in the event of an emergency or disaster.Stockpiling food can help you be prepared for natural disasters, economic collapses, and food shortages. With the tips above, you can stockpile food safely, efficiently, and affordably.FAQsWhat food should I stockpile?Stockpiling food should include nonperishable, nutrient-rich foods. Ideally, this means foods that are high in nutrients and last a long time.The following foods are good to stockpile:Canned goods. For stockpiling, canned fruits, vegetables, meats, and fish are all good options.Dried goods. You can also stockpile nuts, seeds, dried fruits, and vegetables.Grains. Rice, quinoa, and oats are also good options for stockpiling grains.Beans and lentils. Among the best sources of protein and fiber are beans and lentils.Hardtack. Hardtacks are biscuits made from flour, water, and salt. The material is very dense and can last for a long time.Water. Having a water supply on hand is crucial in the event of a shortage. It is possible to stockpile water either by purchasing bottled water or by filling up jugs with water from the tap.How much food should I stockpile?Depending on the size of your household and the amount of time you expect to be without food, you will need to stockpile food.


During an emergency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommends that each household have at least a three-day supply of food and water. If you live in a disaster-prone area or have special dietary requirements, you may want to stockpile more food.If you have the ability, stockpile enough food to last seven days or more. As a result, you will have more flexibility if an emergency lasts for a long time.How do you store your food stockpile?Make sure your stockpile is stored in a cool, dry place. Do not store your stockpile in an area that is prone to flooding or other damage. Additionally, keep your stockpile from direct sunlight or heat sources. A food's shelf life can be shortened by heat and light.What is the best way to rotate your stockpile?Regular rotation of your stockpile is essential. To accomplish this, you should eat the oldest food in your stockpile first and then replace it with new food. As a result, your food will always be fresh and safe to consume.

76,What's the Deal With These 'Snowball' and 'Avalanche' Debt Repayment Methods? Here's How to Know Which One Is Right For You.,"Oct 24, 2023",Entrepreneur Staff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/debt-snowball-vs-avalanche-method-choose-the-right/464134,"
Living with debt can be a heavy burden, affecting your financial well-being — and peace of mind. In fact, in the second quarter of 2023, household debt in the U.S. rose to a whopping $17.06 trillion, led by credit card balances, according to the Federal Reserve. Fortunately, there are methods to help you tackle debt systematically and regain control of your finances. Two tactics for managing debt are the Debt Snowball and the Debt Avalanche methods. Here, we'll break down these methods and how they work and help you decide which strategy might be right for your financial situation.What's the Debt Snowball method — and how does it work?The Debt Snowball method is a debt repayment strategy popularized by financial expert Dave Ramsey. The core principle of this method is to start by paying off the smallest debt first and then gradually moving up to the larger ones. Here's a quick rundown of how it works:List your debts: Begin by making a list of all your debts, from the smallest to the largest. This list could include credit card balances, personal loans or other outstanding debts.Minimum payments: Continue making minimum payments on all your debts to maintain your credit and avoid penalties.Focus on the smallest debt: Allocate any extra funds you have to pay off the smallest debt while continuing to make minimum payments on your other debts.Celebrate small wins: Once the smallest debt is paid off, you'll experience a psychological boost. Celebrate this victory and use the money you were paying toward the smallest debt to add to the minimum payment for the next smallest debt.Repeat: Continue this process until you've paid off all your debts.The Debt Snowball method is popular because it provides quick wins, boosting your motivation as you clear each debt. It's a psychological approach to debt repayment that emphasizes the emotional satisfaction of closing accounts, even if the interest rates on the debts are not necessarily the highest.



Related: Americans' Debt Just Exceeded $17 Trillion for the First Time — Here's the Smartest First Step to Fix Your FinancesWhat's the Debt Avalanche method — and how does it work? Unlike the Snowball method, the Debt Avalanche method prioritizes paying off debts based on their interest rates, starting with the highest-interest debt and working down. Here's how it works:


List your debts: Like the Debt Snowball, list all your debts, but this time, order them from the highest interest rate to the lowest.Minimum payments: Maintain minimum payments on all debts.Focus on high-interest debt: Allocate any additional funds to paying off the debt with the highest interest rate. Continue to do so until it's completely paid off.Roll down the interest rates: Once you've paid off the highest-interest debt, move to the next-highest interest-rate debt, applying the freed-up funds from the previous one. Continue this process until you've paid off all your debts.The Debt Avalanche method is financially efficient because it minimizes the overall interest you pay, as you're targeting the most costly debts first. This method might not offer the same psychological wins as the Debt Snowball, but it can be more cost-effective over the long run.Related: Average 401(k) Account Balances Plummeted Last Year. How Does Yours Compare to the Typical American's?So, which debt repayment method is right for you?The choice between the Debt Snowball and the Debt Avalanche method depends on your personal financial situation, goals and preferences. Here's a handy breakdown of both strategies and who they might be best for:Debt Snowball:Ideal for individuals who need motivation and quick wins to stay on track.Well-suited for those who have several smaller debts that can be paid off relatively quickly.Helpful for people looking for a psychological boost as they eliminate debts one by one.Debt Avalanche:Recommended for those who want to minimize the total interest paid and are willing to focus on the most financially efficient approach.Effective for individuals with higher-interest debts, such as credit card balances.Appropriate for those who can maintain motivation without the immediate emotional rewards of closing accounts.In the end, the ""right"" method is subjective. You can even combine elements of both strategies by paying off a small debt first to gain motivation and then transitioning to the Debt Avalanche method to minimize interest costs. The key is creating a plan that aligns with your financial situation, preferences and goals. Whichever method you choose, the most crucial step is to take action and stick with your plan. Commitment and consistency are the keys to successfully managing and eventually eliminating your debt.

If you're looking for ways to earn some extra income during the holidays, there are plenty of opportunities available. Retail sales associates, customer service representatives, and gift wrappers are in high demand during this time of year. For those with hospitality experience, bartending can be a lucrative side gig. If you love winter sports, becoming a ski instructor or working at a ski resort could be a fun and profitable option. In this article, we'll explore these side gigs in detail to make some extra cash from the holiday season.



1) Retail Sales AssociateRetail sales associates are a critical component of the holiday shopping experience, and working as one is a great way to earn extra cash during the season. Many retailers offer part-time and seasonal positions to help with the holiday rush, and these jobs can provide flexible hours that work around your existing schedule.Working in retail sales during the holiday season can be an excellent way to earn additional income, particularly if you enjoy working with people and have a knack for sales. Many retailers offer incentives and bonuses to their seasonal employees, including employee discounts and performance-based bonuses. Some companies even offer the possibility of turning the seasonal job into a permanent position.


Overall, working as a retail sales associate during the holidays is one of the easiest ways to earn extra money, gain valuable experience, and have some fun in the process. 2) Customer Service RepresentativeCustomer service representatives play a critical role in helping customers with their purchases, returns, and other inquiries during the holiday season. Many retailers and online shopping platforms hire seasonal customer service agents to ensure they can handle the increased volume of inquiries during this busy time of year.As a customer service representative, your responsibilities will include answering customer questions, providing support and assistance, and resolving any issues that arise. You'll need to have excellent communication skills, be patient and empathetic, and be able to think on your feet.Working as a customer care agent during the holidays can be a good idea if you need to bolster your income. With 69% of Americans reporting feeling ""house poor"" and 73% struggling to meet household expenses, this part-time side gig can help relieve some of that financial stress. 


Many companies offer competitive pay rates, incentives, and bonuses for exceptional performance. Additionally, some companies offer the possibility of flexible hours, which can be helpful if you have other commitments during the holiday season.3) Gift WrapperWorking as a gift wrapper during the holiday season is another good way to earn extra money while spreading holiday cheer.

However, some stores offer incentives and bonuses for exceptional performance, such as tips or employee discounts. Some gift wrappers may also earn more based on their experience or skills. 4) BartenderIf you have some experience in the hospitality industry, you could get a side gig working as a bartender.

Bartenders can earn a significant amount of money from tips during the holidays, with weekend tips often ranging from $200 to $500 or more, depending on the location and type of establishment. You should be prepared to work long hours, but the extra income is usually worth the time investment. 


With your earnings, you can save more money for the holidays or add to your retirement fund. If you want to boost your investment portfolio, you could put that extra money into stocks, ETFs, or even try trading. With the Forex market operating 24 hours a day, you have plenty of opportunities to grow your capital.5) Ski Instructor / Ski Resort WorkerWorking at a ski resort or as a ski instructor during the holiday season can be the perfect way to earn additional income while also enjoying the winter sports season. Ski resorts are busy during the holidays, with many people taking time off to hit the slopes. As a ski instructor, you'll have the opportunity to share your love of skiing with others while getting paid for it. Many ski resorts are often short-staffed too.Ski instructor pay varies depending on the resort and location, but you can typically earn around $20 per hour. However, some resorts offer incentives and bonuses for exceptional performance, such as tips or performance-based pay.


Some ski resorts offer employee housing, allowing you to save money on living expenses while working there. Additionally, many resorts offer employee discounts on ski passes, rental equipment, and other amenities.With the potential for incentives, employee specials, and the opportunity to continue working during the summer season, working at a ski resort can be a lucrative and enjoyable supplemental income opportunity.The Bottom LineThere are plenty of opportunities to earn extra cash during the holiday season, whether as a retail sales associate, customer service representative, gift wrapper, bartender, or ski resort worker. Each job offers unique benefits and pay rates, so it's important to consider your skills and interests when deciding which job is right for you.

79,'Not Much Financial Education' — Yet Millennials Have Boomers and Gen X Beat When It Comes to Retirement Savings. Here's Why.,"Oct 4, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/millennials-have-more-retirement-savings-than-gen-x-boomers/463137,"
Millennials might be behind on homeownership and earnings rates compared to older generations, but they're ahead in another significant way.New data from Vanguard suggests they're saving more for retirement than Gen Xers and the youngest baby boomers, The Wall Street Journal reported.Related: Retired Couple Books 51 Back-to-Back Cruises, Sails for 2 Years



When older millennials now earning a median salary hit retirement age, they'll be able to replace 60% of their pre-retirement income with Social Security and savings from other sources like 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts, according to the data. In contrast, Gen Xers and the youngest baby boomers are on track to replace roughly half of their paychecks in retirement.Many older millennials are in a better position for retirement thanks to an increase in default 401(k) plans, as automatic enrollments contribute to earlier and more significant savings — money baby boomers and Gen X employees who waited to enroll missed out on, per the research.


And it's a good thing, too: Millennials have far less retirement security than their parents or grandparents due to a combination of social security solvency concerns and the widespread replacement of pension plans with defined-contribution plans like 401(k)s, factoring investment decisions into retirement income, USA Today reported.Related: How to Retire Early With These 10 Money-Saving Tips | Entrepreneur""There's not that much financial education in college, which is why automatic enrollment is helpful,"" 34-year-old Kenneth Adams, who was automatically enrolled in a 401(k) when he graduated from college in 2012 and started working as an engineer at a tech company, told the WSJ. ""It gives you a default savings option until you educate yourself on what the 401(k) can do for you.""

80,Grandparent's Guide to Paying for College: Creative Financial Strategies for Your Grandkids' Education,"Oct 4, 2023",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/grandparents-guide-to-paying-for-college-creative/463126,"
As a grandparent, you are probably among the 94% who generously contribute to their grandchildren's financial well-being. Statistics reveal that such monetary support averages out to around $2,562 annually. It's an act of love, demonstrating that the family tree's roots run deep.The largest chunk of your support, as borne out by a 2019 report,  likely finds its way into buying gifts. With 86% of grandparents opting for this avenue, it's a significant expenditure, averaging $805 annually.  However, the nature of this financial support may be diverse. Among 62% of grandparents supporting their grandchildren financially, 40% cover the basic expenses, 29% pay for education, 15% help develop savings, and 21% take care of medical bills or wedding expenses. 



Whether your resources are substantial or limited, what matters most is that your contributions align with your financial landscape and personal values. So, if you're planning to fuel your grandkids' education and help them develop a secure financial future, this post may come in handy! It reveals six unique and tried-and-true strategies for your grandchild's education. Read on and find everything involved. 6 Strategies To Fund Your Grandkid's EducationLeverage ROTH IRAsDid you know that Roth IRAs can be your ideal tool for securing a robust financial future for your grandchildren? Although typically seen as a retirement nest egg, the Roth IRA can double up as a strategic education funding resource for them.Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars. Besides, they allow you to withdraw your contributions tax-free and penalty-free once the account is five years old. It's like having a secret weapon that lets you support your grandchildren's education while safeguarding your retirement.Let's imagine a tangible scenario. Suppose you're a grandparent in your early sixties with a grandchild who's just entered their teenage years. You've wisely allocated a portion of your after-tax income to a Roth IRA. Let's say you contribute the maximum limit of $7,000 (as of 2023) each year.Over time, this yearly contribution grows, not only from your additions but also from the compounded interest. After five years, when your grandchild prepares for college, your Roth IRA will have a principal amount of $35,000 — tax-free and penalty-free.


Now, for instance. The tuition fee for your grandchild's preferred college course is $30,000. You could withdraw this amount from the Roth IRA, leaving a balance of $5,000 in the account.However, the story doesn't end there. As you continue contributing towards the Roth IRA, the balance of $5,000 will also keep growing until your retirement. Plus, the earnings on the principal, which aren't included in this calculation, will continue accumulating. You can withdraw that tax-free amount once you reach the age of 59.This way, you can fulfill your desire to support your grandchild's education while ensuring a financially secure retirement for yourself. It's a classic win-win! Few things to keep in mindHowever, to make the most of this strategy, you need to keep three essential aspects in mind.Roth IRAs have income limits. If your income exceeds a certain threshold, Roth IRA might not be an option. However, you're good to go as long as you're within the limit.There are also contribution limits. While it might not fully cover the costs of a private school or college for multiple grandchildren, every bit helps, and these funds can make a significant difference.Once you withdraw the contribution dollars, you can't put it back into the account. It's a one-way street, so careful planning ensures you're not compromising your retirement funds.Take Advantage of 529 Plans529 plans can be a powerful catalyst in your strategy for amassing assets to manage your grandkids' future education costs. Named after their respective section in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), 529 plans allow you to contribute post-tax dollars into a state-sponsored account. These accounts are usually invested in mutual funds, and you can utilize them to pay for qualified educational expenses.Although originally intended for higher education, the versatility of 529 plans has expanded over time. They now allow you to spend up to $10,000 per year per beneficiary on tuition fees for grades K-12 without incurring federal income tax.Let's take an example to illustrate this.Suppose you start contributing $15,000 annually to a 529 plan when your grandchild is born. With an assumed annual return on investment of 6%, by the time they turn 18, the plan will grow to approximately $500,000. 


This broadened reach of 529 plans can be particularly beneficial if you're considering transitioning your grandkid from a public to a private primary or secondary school. However, withdrawing funds early for primary or secondary school tuition could potentially exhaust your 529 plan funds before you use them for college.529 plans offer flexibility. If you can't utilize the funds, you can change the beneficiary. This way, you can reallocate the money for other members' education.However, starting as soon as possible is wise if you plan to leverage a 529 plan to finance education costs. The benefits of tax-free growth are maximized over long-term investment horizons.Consider Security-backed Credit LinesBesides Roth IRAs, security-backed credit lines can also help you gather enough money for your grandchildren's education. Officially called Securities-Backed Lines of Credit or SBLOCs, this approach can help you access the liquidity required to cover full or partial college fees, utilizing the value of their non-retirement asset portfolio.In many ways, SBLOCs are akin to a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) – both permit borrowing against an owned asset's worth. The primary difference is that your home secures a HELOC, while your taxable investment portfolio forms the foundation for an SBLOC. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) punctuates this strategy with an advisory note. It warns that if your securities' value declines to a level insufficient to back your line of credit, you will be issued a ""maintenance call.' This is essentially an alert that you need to either provide additional collateral or repay the loan within a specified timeline, usually spanning two to three days. If you fail to meet these conditions, it could lead to a forced liquidation of your securities, using the proceeds to settle the maintenance call.


For instance, you have a portfolio of stocks valued at $200,000. You've secured an SBLOC against it to fund your child's $50,000 college education. If the value of your stock portfolio falls drastically, say to $80,000, this may trigger a maintenance call. Now, if you cannot furnish additional collateral or repay the loan promptly, the firm may sell off your stocks to recover the outstanding credit.Given this, you should be careful when using SBLOCs. Indeed, they offer a tactically efficient way to fund college costs without disrupting your wealth accumulation, but you shouldn't overlook the risks associated. Therefore, thoroughly understand these intricacies and assess your risk appetite before proceeding with this financing method.Create a Trust for EducationTrusts are an incredibly flexible mechanism you can use for various purposes in wealth management and estate planning. You might create a trust to optimize tax savings, shield assets from creditors, cater to disabled family members, or nurture and safeguard wealth over numerous generations. Put simply, as a trustee, you will be responsible for managing and investing the assets within a trust. Those assets will then be utilized for the benefit of designated beneficiaries based on the trust agreement's specifications.Setting up a family trust can help you fund your grandchildren's education. Even if you don't embark on the trusts for educational purposes, you still have options. You can modify them through avenues like  ""decanting' laws or non-judicial or judicial settlements to include clauses permitting distributions for education.As you contemplate strategies involving gifts to trusts to optimize estate and gift tax exclusions, consider adding trust provisions that allow for the fund- allocation towards education.For example, you could initiate a trust with $200,000 for your newborn grandchild, specifying that the funds can be used for their education. Assuming an average return of 5% per year, this trust could grow to approximately $530,000 by the time your grandkid starts college. 


In many states, you can set up these trusts as perpetual trusts, bypassing future estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer taxes (GSTT). This approach could make such trusts a potent resource for providing educational benefits to multiple generations of your family.Count On Series I BondsYou can extend your investment alternatives by considering another enticing option to fund your grandchildren's higher education – the strategic use of inflation-indexed Savings Bonds, specifically Series I Bonds. An appealing aspect of these inherently low-risk bonds is their robust performance during inflationary periods. In addition, they offer significant tax advantages when used for educational expenditures.Series I Bonds combine a fixed interest rate with an inflation-adjusted rate, recalibrated semi-annually. Currently, they boast a remarkable 9.62% annual yield for the initial half-year, subject to adjustment every six months according to the prevailing inflation. When you use them for qualified higher education expenses, the interest earned from these bonds can be exempted from federal taxes.Consider this scenario –  you've invested $10,000 in Series I Bonds, and it's currently earning 9.62% annually. After one year, your investment would grow to approximately $10,962. If these proceeds are used for eligible educational costs, the $962 earned as interest would be exempt from federal taxes.You can also consider Series EE bonds, but their current interest rate is a mere 0.1%. Hence, they may not be an attractive option for funding education.Ask Your Grandkids to Use Federal Tax CreditsThe U.S. Federal Government provides several compelling incentives to help manage higher education costs. One of these is the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC). The AOTC could grant your college-going grandkids a federal income tax credit of up to $2,500 for specific educational costs. These include tuition, fees, and course materials. 


Up to 40% of this $2,500 credit is refundable, potentially providing up to a $1,000 federal income tax refund even if your grandchildren don't owe any federal tax.For instance,  if your grandkid spends $4,000 on qualified educational expenses, they could claim the full $2,500 credit. This could effectively reduce the tax bill or increase the tax refund by that amount.However, eligibility for this credit is income-dependent. Single taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $80,000 or less can claim full credit for eligible education expenses. The credit diminishes if the MAGI exceeds this threshold and phases out entirely when the MAGI surpasses $90,000. Furthermore, it's crucial to remember that the AOTC can only be claimed for a maximum of four years. Besides AOTC, Your grandchildren can also consider the Lifetime Learning Credit. It allows you to claim up to $2,000 for qualified education expenses for all eligible students.Unlike the AOTC, the Lifetime Learning Credit can be claimed indefinitely. This credit, however, is not refundable, meaning it can only reduce the tax liability. The credit amount is also gradually reduced if the MAGI falls between $80,000 and $90,000. FAQsHow can gifting strategies be utilized to fund my grandchild's education?Gifting strategies can effectively help you pay your grandchild's tuition.  Under current IRS rules, it doesn't count toward the annual gift tax exclusion. Alternatively, you could use an annual gift tax exclusion (up to a certain limit per person per year) to contribute to a savings or investment account in the child's name. This strategy can potentially lower your estate's value while assisting in your grandchild's education funding.What are the tax implications of setting up a 529 plan for my grandchild?Contributions to a 529 plan are not deductible on your federal tax return. Still, any earnings in the plan grow tax-free, and distributions used for qualified education expenses are also not taxed. However, if the funds are used for non-qualified expenses, the earnings portion of the withdrawal may be subject to federal income tax and a 10% penalty. 


Can I establish a trust fund for my grandchild's education and control how it is used?Yes, when you set up a trust fund for your grandchild's education, you can determine the terms of how the trust is managed and when distributions are made. A trust fund can provide flexibility and control, allowing you to specify the conditions under which the funds can be accessed.Can I use my IRA to help fund my grandchild's education? Yes, if you are 59.5 or older, you can take distributions from your IRA without penalty and use those funds for your grandchild's education. However, these distributions may be subject to income tax. Additionally, if you have a Roth IRA, you can withdraw your contributions (not earnings) at any time, tax-free and penalty-free, for any purpose, including education.

Here are 8 questions to ask yourself before making a purchase:1. Why do you need life insurance?Life is an unexpected journey. With so many twists and turns, there's no telling what might occur. Having life insurance can give you peace of mind that your family will be cared for if the worst should happen. Here are some reasons you need life insurance:



Financial Protection: Life insurance provides financial support to your loved ones in the event of your death. It can help cover funeral expenses, pay off debts, or replace lost income.Related: 4 Personal Finance Tips Every Entrepreneur Should Know


Income Replacement: If you're the primary breadwinner a policy can provide a source of income for your loved ones after you're gone. It can help replace your income, ensuring that your family can maintain living costs.Debt Repayment: Life insurance can be used to pay off any outstanding debts, such as a mortgage or credit card debt. This can prevent your loved ones from being burdened with these financial obligations after your death.Education Expenses: If you have kids, you can help cover expenses like tuition fees, books, and other needs.Business protection: life insurance can help ensure your business's survival after your death. It can provide funds to cover any business debts, pay off partners, or provide a financial cushion during the transition period.


2. How much cover do you need?No amount of cover is enough to replace a life. However, the amount of coverage a family needs can vary. What might suit one family may not be enough for another,Generally speaking, the amount of coverage you need should be enough to replace your income and cover any outstanding debts. It should also provide a financial cushion for your family to maintain their living standards.Another thing worth protecting is your home. If you have a mortgage, you'll want to ensure it's covered in full. Your family can avoid extra burdens or be forced to sell their home.3. What type of life insurance is best for you?There are several types of life insurance to choose from, depending on your specific needs.


Term life insurance covers you for a specified amount of time, such as 30 years. There are three different levels of cover: decreasing term, level term, and increasing term. While it's usually more affordable, the policy only pays out if you die within the agreed term.Whole life insurance provides cover for your entire life. It also has a cash value component, which means you can use the funds to cover unexpected expenses or retirement planning. This type of policy can be expensive, but you have a guarantee of payout.Suppose you're entering old age and want to set aside something for your children or grandchildren. Then, an Over 50s policy may be more appealing. It's also important to assess your circumstances and consider what you want your payout to cover.Related: 5 tips that will help you improve your personal finances


Choosing the right policy depends on your specific needs, the amount of coverage required, and the desired duration. For example, if you have a mortgage with 20 years remaining, a decreasing term policy may be suitable.4. How much will life insurance cost?Before you get into any commitment it's wise to keep an eye on the cost. Once you take out a policy you're expected to make regular payments. So it's vital to ensure you can afford the premium.The cost of life insurance varies on a range of factors:The type of policy you select – For example, term policies may be cheaper than whole life policies as they only cover you for a specific period.Your age, health, and lifestyle – Older individuals and those with pre-existing health conditions usually have more expensive premiums.The amount of coverage – If you're looking for higher levels of coverage, the premium is likely to be more expensive.Your insurer's rates – Different insurers offer different rates, so shop around to find the most competitive one.5. How long do you need life insurance for?How long you need life insurance depends on your specific situation and the reason for getting it. The duration of your policy could be shorter or longer depending on your needs.


If you plan on covering a mortgage, it's suggested to have cover for the remaining length of your mortgage term. This helps to ensure your loved ones can pay off the mortgage if needed.For those who have family members, the policy should provide cover until they are no longer financially dependent. This is usually until the youngest child turns 18, or before retirement.6. How can you lower your premiums?If you're worried about high premiums, there are a few ways to keep the costs down:Take out cover early – The younger and healthier you are, the lower your premiums may be. So if you decide to take out a policy, it's best to do so as soon as possible.Shop around – Don't be afraid to compare different policies and insurers. This allows you to assess what's available and find the most competitive deal for your situation.Opt for a lower level of cover – You may not need to opt for the highest level of cover. Choose one that's appropriate for your needs.Quit smoking – Smokers typically pay higher premiums than non-smokers. Quitting could make the policy more affordable.Take out joint cover – Ideal for couples as it offers protection for both parties. So if one partner were to pass away, the other would benefit from the same cover.7. What is the claim process for life insurance?The claim process varies depending on the insurer and type of policy you have. Generally, it involves providing evidence that the insured has passed away, such as a death certificate. You may also be required to provide other documentation, such as the original policy documents or proof of identity.


Once you've submitted the necessary documents and information, your insurer will assess your claim and decide whether to approve it. If your claim is accepted, the payout will be paid to your beneficiaries within a few weeks or months.8. Do I need to take a medical exam to get life insurance?Medical exams are often required for applicants looking for high levels of coverage or who have pre-existing health conditions.The exam usually involves a doctor taking your vitals and asking questions about your medical history and current well-being. Depending on the insurer, the results may be used to determine your premiums or eligibility.

83,5 Entrepreneurial Mindset Principles That Empower Financial Literacy,"Sep 30, 2023",Ben Sever,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/5-entrepreneurial-mindset-principles-that-empower-financial/456380,"
An entrepreneurial mindset encourages individuals to view their personal finances as an opportunity for wealth creation and growth. This mindset emphasizes the importance of investing, whether in stocks, real estate, or other assets, to generate passive income and build wealth over time. That being said, developing your own foundational belief systems around your relationship with money is just as important as the financial vehicles themselves.One should remember that financial literacy is a journey, and it requires consistent effort, practice and application of these foundational principles to enhance your understanding and improve your financial wellbeing. When it comes to money, adopting certain mindset philosophies can help shape your relationship with wealth creation and guide your decision-making. Here are five imperative viewpoints to consider:1. View money as you would view a currentWhile the term ""currency"" is derived from the Latin word ""currere,"" which means ""to run"" or ""to flow,"" the concept of money flowing like a current is metaphorical rather than a literal representation. The term ""currency"" primarily refers to a system of money that is used as a medium of exchange for goods and services.



However, the metaphor of money flowing like a current can be used to describe the dynamic nature of money and its movement within an economy. Money circulates through various transactions, changing hands from one individual or entity to another. It flows through the economy, enabling economic activity and facilitating trade.Similar to a current in a river, money is constantly in motion, connecting different participants in the economy. It can be earned, spent, invested, and transferred, creating a continuous cycle of transactions and economic interactions.


This metaphor highlights the importance of understanding and managing the flow of money. Just as currents in a river can be strong or weak, money can fluctuate in terms of its availability, value, and the speed at which it circulates. By being aware of this flow and managing their finances effectively, individuals and businesses can navigate the economic currents and make the most of their financial resources.Related: We Need a Real Commitment to Mental Health at Work. Here's How (and Why).2- Don't allow the limits of your past to have any bearing on your futureEmbracing an abundance mindset involves believing that there are plentiful opportunities for wealth and success. It is about focusing on possibilities rather than limitations. With this mindset, you approach money with a positive and optimistic outlook, recognizing that there is enough for everyone and that your financial situation can improve through hard work, smart choices and abundance mindset-based actions.Many emerging thought leaders have recently endorsed the ideology of ""mindset monetization."" With these new, but logical shifts, countless case studies across the nation validate that financial empowerment begins with shifting your paradigm. And thus, by challenging the rigid, conservative ""work, spend, save"" 9-5 mindset and evolving from thinking like an entrepreneur rather than an employee, one can drastically uplevel their monetary milestones.


3. Pivot — don't pause The philosophy of financial independence centers around achieving freedom and control over your finances. It involves building a solid financial foundation that allows you to support yourself and pursue your desired lifestyle without being reliant on others. This mindset encourages you to take ownership of your financial situation, prioritize saving and investing, and develop multiple streams of income.Take the pandemic, for example; leaders who adopted remote skills, studied macroeconomics and understood what sectors were poised for growth not only weathered the pandemic but significantly improved their business and personal growth.4. Continuous learning to stay updated on the latest financial trends An entrepreneurial mindset prioritizes continuous learning and improvement. When it comes to financial literacy, this means actively seeking out resources, courses, and information to enhance your understanding of financial concepts, investment strategies and personal finance management. The post-Covid era has democratized online certifications from individual subject matter experts to academic institutions, so there is now a level playing field regardless of your geographical standpoint. Engaging in lifelong learning allows you to stay updated with the latest financial trends and adapt your financial strategies accordingly.The philosophy of delayed gratification, in tandem with a commitment to learning, involves prioritizing long-term goals over immediate satisfaction. It requires resisting impulsive spending and prioritizing saving and investing for future financial security and goals. By delaying gratification, you can make wiser financial choices, avoid unnecessary debt, and accumulate wealth over time.

Practice mindful spending and asset allocationMindful spending involves being intentional and conscious about how you allocate your financial resources. It means aligning your spending with your values and priorities as well as the emerging, lucrative sectors that require attention. With this mindset, you take the time to evaluate your needs versus wants, track your expenses, and make deliberate decisions that reflect your financial goals. Mindful spending helps you avoid impulsive purchases, stay within your budget and make more conscious choices with your money.

84,Striking the Right Balance: Managing Student Loans while Saving for Retirement,"Sep 27, 2023",Devin Partida,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/striking-the-right-balance-managing-student-loans-while/462302,"
Managing your student loans while saving for retirement can feel like an uphill battle. Although it can be a long and complex process, there are many ways to fast-track it. If you make the right choices, you can boost your savings and work toward eliminating your debt for good.Why Prioritize Paying and Saving Simultaneously?It's essential to prioritize paying and saving simultaneously when you have student loan debt to pay off because both are long-term, time-sensitive goals. Plus, you don't want to skip out on managing your repayments properly because you'll stack debt and potentially push your retirement further out.As the federal pause on interest accumulation ends and payments begin again, coming up with a plan is essential. If you want to secure your future financial stability and create a strong safety net, managing your loans while saving for retirement is necessary. Once you find the right balance, you can watch as your savings grow.



How Much Do You Need to Save?While the amount you need to save for retirement depends on your lifestyle, location, and existing savings, you can base your goal on the average. Generally, it costs upwards of $1.8 million to retire. That number might seem impossible to reach given how student loans eat at your potential savings, but it's more than possible with the right approach and mindset.Most experts agree you should save 20% of each paycheck and keep the rest for yourself. A good rule of thumb is to listen to the classic 50-30-20 rule, which recommends you put 50% toward needs and 30% toward wants. Even if you aren't able to put one-fifth of your earnings into your savings account, you should try to get as close as possible.


How Does Your Student Loan Type Affect You?The kind of student loan you have affects how you should repay it and save for retirement. The four types include subsidized, unsubsidized, PLUS, and private. Since each accumulates interest at different points, your first step should be to find out which you have.Direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans are very common because they're available through the free application for student aid form. Although interest accumulates differently for each, you don't have to start making payments on them as long as you stay enrolled in school. They also make you eligible for a host of assistance programs and plans.If you have private loans, you'll have to take a much different approach to student debt management. Most importantly, you aren't eligible for federal programs that could help you limit interest, pause payments, or lower your monthly bill. They often have higher interest rates and start generating interest immediately, so you want to pay them off quickly.How Can You Save while Managing Your Loans?To save for retirement while managing your student debt, you have to determine your cash flow and interest rates. Since you already know the average amount you need for retirement is around $1.8 million, you must figure out how to balance everything to meet that goal.


Figure out how much student loan debt payments will take out of your paycheck to see how much you can save each month. After subtracting necessities like utility bills or groceries, you can decide how much you want to put into your savings or investment accounts.You can calculate how much you'll need to save each month to break down your goal into reasonable chunks. Starting with the amount you want to save for retirement, subtract your existing savings and add your estimated student debt cost. Divide that number by your monthly savings, then divide again by 12 to see how many years it will take you to reach your objective.If you want to retire in fewer years than your calculation shows, you have to increase the amount you save each month. You must consider enrolling in retirement plans if you can't afford to take any more money directly out of your paycheck. What Retirement Plans Should You Consider?Since most of your earnings go toward your student loan debt, you have to boost your income elsewhere if you want to save while paying it off. Employer-sponsored retirement plans are one of the best ways to go about this since they offer a variety of tax benefits.


A 401k puts some of your pre-tax earnings from your paycheck into a special account. Your employer can match your contributions, dramatically increasing your savings over time. Since it's automatic, you don't have to work it into your budget continuously or remember to put money into it.The government even passed legislation to tie your 401k to student loan debt. The SECURE 2.0 Act lets employers make matching contributions when you make a payment on it. While it won't go into effect until 2024, it will give you a fantastic way to save during repayment.If your employer doesn't offer a 401k or you work independently, an individual retirement account (IRA) is still an option for you. The amount you can put into it annually is lower, but you have more freedom. Whichever you choose, making contributions as frequently as you can will maximize the amount you save.Even plans that don't directly relate to retirement can help you save for it. For example, a Health Savings Account lets you save for medical expenses with your pre-tax earnings. Your contributions are tax-deductible, health-related withdrawals are tax-free and your funds roll over annually. Plus, you can take money out for any reason once you reach 65.


Ways to Save While Paying off Your LoansHere are some of the best ways to save for retirement while managing your student loan debt.1. Try Low-Stakes InvestmentsLow-stakes investments are ideal when you're saving for the long term. While you can take higher-risk approaches and maximize your earnings early on, they're not nearly as secure. You don't want to lose your current savings while pursuing your future financial security.There are plenty of investment options if you want a low risk and solid reward. For example, a fixed annuity guarantees a set interest rate, securing a steady income stream for you. On top of being one of the safest investments, it ensures you get a payment. Even though it doesn't provide an enormous cash flow, it's an excellent choice.2. Use the SAVE PlanWhen the Supreme Court struck down sweeping student loan debt forgiveness, the Biden administration created the Saving on a Valuable Education Plan. It's similar to an income-driven repayment plan, where your earnings determine your monthly payments.


If your individual income is less than $32,800 annually, you won't have to pay anything at all. Even if you make more, you'll save thousands of dollars annually. Plus, interest won't accumulate on this plan. Although it won't go into effect until July 2024, you can apply for it now.3. Always Pay the MinimumAlways make the minimum monthly payment when repaying your student loans to prevent interest from accumulating. You can only save for the future if you work on reducing the amount you owe. Even though it's best to pay off as much at once to get the principal down quickly, you at least want to meet the lowest requirements.4. Use an IDR PlanAn income-driven repayment plan is a federal debt forgiveness program. The government knows it can be challenging to pay off your student loan when it's such a large amount and interest accumulates so quickly, so they offer this as an alternative.An IDR plan is beneficial because it lowers your monthly payments and gives you a set date for forgiveness. Although it takes about 10 to 25 years, it gives you much more flexibility with retirement savings and lets you save money in the meantime.


If you lower your adjusted gross income on your tax return, you can secure lower monthly payments and pay less in taxes. Every contribution to a 401k or an IRA reduces it, so putting in as much as possible grows your retirement savings and shrinks your bills.5. Become Financially LiterateMany people feel like they can't look out for their future selves while simultaneously dealing with the pressure of student loan debt. Around 67% of people feel like they can't properly save for retirement because of it. Even though it can feel like a lot to handle, becoming financially literate can make it easier.Around 15% of Americans lost $10,000 or more in 2022 because they weren't financially literate enough. To maximize your earnings and savings, you need to understand the mechanics of student loan debt and retirement. You should also learn everything you can about your situation to ensure you make the right choices during repayment. Save for the FutureIf you use federal programs, make secure investments, or enroll in a retirement plan, you can save more money for retirement and simultaneously pay off your student loan debt. Even though it might take a while to see progress, you'll feel much more confident in your future if you start as soon as possible.

85,Money Talks: How to Negotiate a Raise and Boost Your Bank Accounts,"Sep 25, 2023",Deanna Ritchie,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/money-talks-how-to-negotiate-a-raise-and-boost-your-bank/459652,"
Is there nothing more daunting than getting a raise? However, it is worth it if you are able to secure a significant salary increase. In the end, a raise means more money in your bank account. This can be used for paying down debt, saving for retirement, or simply enjoying a better quality of life.The thing is, negotiating a raise doesn't have to be so intimidating. After all, you deserve fair compensation for your work. But, it all starts with preparation. As such, with these tips, you can increase your chances of getting a raise and boost your bank account at the same time.1. Do your research.To start, discover what the average starting salary for similar roles is for your position. For a free salary comparison, check out Salary.com and PayScale to find out how your current salary compares to similar positions at other organizations. You can also find great information on this through LinkedIn. In addition to reviewing job postings, LinkedIn also offers average salary ranges on its site.



But, that's just scratching the surface. Here are some other factors that determine a raise:The industry you work in. Growing industries often offer higher salaries not only to attract employees. But also to retain them to help them grow. The majority of companies with greater growth are able to offer their employees higher compensation due to a steady stream of income. Pay raises are less likely in industries with slow growth.Geographic location. Depending on the cost of living in the city, some employees in a certain area may receive a raise that's even higher than the national average, while others in a different area may receive a raise that's even higher.Current job market. Employers may offer you a raise if they recognize your unique occupation in the industry.The organization you work for. You are highly likely to receive a raise based on your company's success and regulations. A raise may not be available to you if you already meet the predetermined range set by your employer for salary increases. A successful company is more likely to give you a raise.Also, consider asking local recruiters and hiring managers to consider your resume for a realistic salary goal based on your experience and position. It is possible to use this information as leverage when you seek an increase in your compensation if yours is below par.2. Quantify your value.You should also know your value to the company and be able to quantify it. To do so, you must articulate the value you contribute. Here are some questions to get you started:How have you helped the company save money through your projects?Have you brought in any new clients?What have you done to improve the bottom line of the company?FYI, it is best to be as specific as possible. Your boss will gain a deeper understanding of why you deserve a raise and what you've done for the company.3. Decide on a reasonable target.If you want to be successful at salary negotiations, you need to establish a reasonable target. Overly ambitious requests are unlikely to be granted. However, if you ask for too little, you'll leave money on the table.What is a good way to set a reasonable target? Consider your current salary as a starting point. Again, you should also research salaries for positions similar to yours in your industry. You can begin negotiating after you know what the market is like.


4. Develop a strong argument.You need to prepare a strong argument for your raise once you've done your research and quantified your worth. The following should be included in this argument:How much you are currently earning.What your market value is.Contributions and accomplishments you have made to the company.Your reasons for deserving a raise.Don't forget to tell your boss what's in it for him or her. Why? You may want to take a vacation or pay off your mortgage, but your boss does not care. Instead, bosses care about their own interests.As you've already stated, you've done a lot for the company. However, you should also explain what your future plans are. Give them an overview of your goals and why they are important to the company, as well as how you plan to accomplish them.5. Practice asking for a raise.Using role-playing with a family member or friend can help you prepare and calm your nerves. Practice answering questions about:Your research on standard salary figures.How many hours and amount of money you've saved the company?What you've done to improve productivity.When you need feedback on your tone, body language, or eye contact, a friend is the perfect person to ask. It is important for you to show your conviction when asking for a raise. Why should your boss believe you deserve it if you don't think you deserve it?6. Always have a backup plan.Although you've taken all the right steps, your boss still refuses to give you a raise. Now what? Well, if you're interested in a raise in the future, do not be afraid to ask.If your manager is not ready to give you a raise, you should ask what specific actions would be required and then set a date for your review. If budgets are tight, a one-time bonus may be an option, either right away or after some time. You could also compromise and meet your boss halfway.Also, in order to position yourself for a raise in the future, talk to your boss about your long-term goals. You can also expand your skill set and connect with others to increase your visibility. In the future, you will be able to ask for a raise during a performance review or milestone.


Additionally, you might be able to accept some alternative benefits instead of money. Among the examples that can be considered are:A weekly or daily option of working from homeSchedules with different hours or more flexibilityIncreased paid time offOptional shares7. Choose the right time for your meeting.In general, you should use common sense when asking for a raise — even if there is never a perfect time. In sensitive situations such as layoffs, poor numbers in your department, or a challenging personal situation for your boss, don't ask for a raise.It is also important to consider how your company currently handles pay increases. It is best to approach your boss in November or December if they typically give raises at the beginning of the year. Rather than asking them to change their decision after being informed of your rate increase, you'll give them an opportunity to consider your request and work with their bosses as a result.What if there is no standard practice for raising salaries? Your request should be made at a time that is ""good"". Examples include when your boss is happy with your work, when the quarter is going well, or when the season isn't too stressful.8. Follow up.Make sure you follow up with your boss after your negotiation. By doing so, you're demonstrating your commitment to getting a raise.Make sure you thank your boss for their time and reiterate your request for a raise in your follow-up. Also, you might want to send a copy of your research or achievements.9. Have the courage to walk away.Don't be afraid to walk away from your negotiations if you don't like the outcome. This does not mean you have to leave your job. However, it does mean you're willing to leave if you're not being paid as much as you should be.Your boss will see that you are serious about getting a raise if you are prepared to walk away. Additionally, it gives you more negotiating power.


What to do after a salary negotiation.When negotiating salaries, the goal is to get a raise or other benefits that you're satisfied with. This money can then be wisely used by:Pay off your debts. Your raise can be used to pay down high-interest debt, such as student loans or credit card debt. In the long run, you'll save money and have more income available for other expenditures.Build your emergency fund. In the event of an unexpected expense, such as car repairs, medical bills, or job loss, an emergency fund can be used. Make sure your emergency fund is large enough to cover 3-6 months of living expenses.Contribute to your retirement savings. A 401(k) or IRA is a great way to start saving for retirement if you don't already have one. Over time, even if all you can afford is a small contribution each month, it will add up.Automate your savings. You can make sure you're saving money by automating your savings. Each month, a set amount is automatically transferred from your checking account to your savings account. There is no way you will miss it!Invest in yourself. By taking classes, getting certified, or networking with other professionals, you can use your raise to advance your career.What if your raise wasn't approved? Consider giving your employer some time and revisiting the subject later if they seemed open to it but couldn't accommodate your request right away. It might be time to look for a new job if you feel totally ignored or not given what you deserve.FAQSHow to Negotiate a RaiseWhat is the best time to ask for a raise?Asking for a raise is most effective after a successful performance review or after achieving a major goal. Also, you should be prepared to negotiate, which means knowing the average salary for your position and level of experience is a good idea.How much should I ask for?It is common for pay raises to be 3%. Generally, a good pay raise ranges from 4.5% to 5%, and anything above that is considered extraordinary.Your request for a raise could range from 10% to 20% depending on the reasons you cite and how long it has been since your last raise. Your reasons should, however, be stronger the higher the percentage you request. Asking for 20% isn't unreasonable if you have significantly changed your duties since you accepted the position.You should, however, start with a more reasonable percentage if it's been more than a year since your last salary increase and you've been performing well in your regular duties. It is still important for you to get a raise, but you should balance your request with the reality of your performance.What are some negotiating tips?Here are a few tips for negotiating a raise:Preparation is key. Learn what the average salary is for your position and experience level by doing your research.Have confidence in yourself. Don't let fear stop you from negotiating a raise. Be confident in your abilities.Don't be vague. Provide a clear statement of your salary goals and be ready to justify them.Walk away if you need to. It is okay to walk away from a negotiation if you are unhappy with the offer.How to Boost Your Bank AccountsWhat can I do to make and stick to a budget?Boosting your bank account begins with creating a budget. It will be easier for you to identify where your money is going if you track your income and expenses. Also, by setting up a budget, you can begin to make changes to your spending habits and save more.


What is the fastest way to pay off my debt?It is best to pay off your debts as soon as possible — especially your high-interest debt. In order to pay off debt, you can use a few different strategies, such as:The debt snowball method. By using this method, you pay off your debts from smallest to largest, regardless of their interest rates. When you see your debts starting to disappear, you will gain momentum and motivation.The debt avalanche method. Using this method, you pay off your debts based on their interest rates. You may save more money in the long run, but if you have large debts with high-interest rates, it might be harder to stay motivated.Where can I invest my money wisely?The best way to increase your wealth is to invest your money. To make an informed decision, you should do your research and invest in assets that are suitable for your needs.There are, however, a few popular options, including:High-yield savings accounts. Compared to traditional savings accounts, these accounts offer higher interest rates.Certificates of deposit (CDs). With a CD, you know how much you'll earn based on a fixed interest rate.Money market funds. A money market fund is a mutual fund that invests in short-term debt securities. Cash is more liquid than savings accounts, but they don't offer the same interest rate.Government bonds. Because government bonds are guaranteed to be repaid by the government, they are considered safe investments.Corporate bonds. Compared to government bonds, corporate bonds are more risky since they are issued by corporations. They can, however, offer higher returns as well.Mutual funds. Investing in mutual funds allows you to take advantage of a wide range of stocks or bonds at one time. As a result, you can reduce your risk and diversify your portfolio.Exchange-traded funds (ETFs). A mutual fund is similar to an ETF, but it trades on the stock exchange like individual stocks. Because of this, they may have higher fees than mutual funds, but they are more liquid.Real estate.

86,Equity vs. Debt Allocation,"Sep 25, 2023",Albert Costill,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/equity-vs-debt-allocation/459644,"
How you allocate your assets between equity and debt is one of the most important decisions you'll make when investing. In addition to being riskier, equity investments, such as stocks, also offer higher returns. Compared to equity investments, bonds offer a lower return, but they offer a lower level of risk.What's the ideal equity-to-debt allocation for you? Depending on your personal circumstances and risk tolerance, that will differ. However, you can make an informed decision if you follow some general guidelines.



Equity 101An equity investment is a form of ownership in a specific company. In essence, you are buying a small piece of the company when you purchase a stock.If the company does well, your stock value will rise. As such, you can sell it at a profit. In the event that the company performs poorly, though, the value of your stock might decline. Consequently, you might lose money.


Over the long term, equity investments can provide higher returns than debt investments. However, they are also more risky. It is always possible to lose money when you invest in stocks due to their short-term volatility.Pros:Over time, higher returns are possible.Potential for long-term growth.Capital appreciation potential.Dividends and interest income are potential sources of income.Cons:Investing in equity is more risky than investing in debt.It is possible for prices to fluctuate more volatilely.Illiquidity.It is possible to lose money.Debt 101A debt investment is a loan you give to a company or government. Bonds, for instance, are essentially loans between buyers and sellers. Over a set period of time, the issuer will repay the principal and interest on the bond.


The most common examples of these fixed-income investments are treasury bills, commercial papers, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds, and government bonds.While debt investments are less risky than equity investments, they offer lower returns. Stocks are more volatile than bonds, so you have a lower risk of losing money if you invest in them.Pros:Investing in bonds is less risky than investing in equity.There is less volatility in prices.In most cases, the principal is repaid.Income stability.Liquidity.Cons:


A lower potential return.There is less potential for growth.Capital appreciation is less likely.Dividends and interest are not possible.There is an interest rate risk.How to Choose the Right AllocationWhen it comes to allocating your assets between equity and debt, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Generally, your risk tolerance and individual circumstances will determine the ideal allocation for you.In making your decision, you should consider the following factors:Age. Younger investors can afford to take on more risk because they have more time to ride out market volatility. Due to less recovery time from losses, older investors may choose less risky assets.Income. Taking on more risk may be easier if you earn a high income. On the other hand, low-income investors may want to invest in assets with less risk.Risk tolerance. What is your comfort level with risk? In the case of risk-averse investors, conservative assets might be a better choice. Investing in more aggressive assets, however, may be a good idea if you are more comfortable with risk.Equity-Debt-Allocation Based on the ""100 Minus Age"" RuleIn asset allocation, your investments are divided among different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and cash. To determine the percentage of your portfolio that should be allocated to stocks, subtract your age from 100. For example, a 30-year-old should allocate 70% to stocks and 30% to bonds.What is the rationale behind 100 minus age? The younger the investor, the more time they have to recover from losses. Therefore, the younger investor can afford a bigger risk. By allocating more of their portfolio to bonds as they age, investors can reduce their risk exposure and recover from losses faster.


You could follow these general guidelines:Young investors. 70% equity, 30% debtMiddle-aged investors. 60% equity, 40% debtOlder investors. 50% equity, 50% debtIt is important to keep in mind that the 100 minus age rule is only a guideline. You may need to adjust your asset allocation based on your individual circumstances.For instance, if you have a high-paying job and won't retire for many years, you may feel comfortable with a higher stock allocation. On the flip side, if you are planning to retire early from a low-paying job, you may want to increase your bond allocation.As part of an investment strategy, asset allocation is just one component. Investing decisions should also take into account your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.


Among the pros and cons of the 100-minus-age rule are:Pros:It is simple and easy to remember.Assists in determining asset allocation.Adaptable to individual needs.Cons:Investors' risk tolerance and financial goals are not taken into account.Not suitable for all investors.Some investors may find it too simplistic.In addition to these asset allocation guidelines, you may wish to consider the following:The rule of 110. According to this rule, you should allocate stocks a percentage of your portfolio based on your age subtracted from 110.Asset allocation is based on age. Using this approach, your portfolio is allocated according to your age and risk tolerance. The portfolio of a 30-year-old investor with a high-risk tolerance might contain 80% stocks and 20% bonds.The target-date fund. In this type of mutual fund, assets are automatically allocated as you get closer to retirement.It is important to note that these are just general guidelines. Financial advisors can assist you in determining your right allocation.How to Rebalance Your PortfolioYou may drift away from your target asset allocation over time. You may experience this due to market fluctuations or a change in your circumstances. To ensure that your portfolio remains aligned with your goals, you should rebalance it periodically.


Investing in assets that underperformed can be rebalanced by selling those that outperformed. By doing so, you will be able to keep your portfolio balanced and reduce your risk.To rebalance your portfolio, follow these steps:Determine your asset allocation. Ideally, your portfolio should include a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash. Investing goals and risk tolerance will determine your asset allocation.Track your portfolio's asset allocation. You may find that the asset allocation of your portfolio drifts away from your target asset allocation over time. The reason for this is that individual investment prices fluctuate.Rebalance your portfolio when it gets out of balance. Rebalancing your portfolio can be done in two ways:Sell high-performing investments and buy low-performing investments. As a result, you will achieve your target asset allocation for your portfolio.Contribute new money to your portfolio in a strategic way. It may be a good idea to devote all your new money to your underweighted asset classes until you have a more balanced portfolio.Regularly rebalance your portfolio. Keeping track of your risk tolerance and asset allocation will help you remain on track.The following tips will help you rebalance your portfolio:Set a rebalancing schedule and stick to it. Maintaining discipline and avoiding emotional investment decisions will help you avoid making poor investments.Use a target-date fund or other automated rebalancing service. You can easily and conveniently rebalance your portfolio this way.Don't be afraid to sell winners. When investments are performing well, it can be tempting to hold onto them. But, it may be time to rebalance your portfolio if these investments have taken up too much of your portfolio.Consider using tax-advantaged accounts for rebalancing. You may have to pay capital gains taxes if you sell investments in a taxable account. A tax-advantaged account, such as an IRA or 401(k), can help you avoid this problem.Rebalance your portfolio after large investments or withdrawals. You will be able to maintain an asset allocation that is aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.Rebalance gradually. Your portfolio doesn't need to be rebalanced all at once. It is possible to gradually rebalance your portfolio by selling some overweight assets and buying some underweight assets.To achieve long-term success, it is important to rebalance your portfolio periodically. This helps you stay on track with your investment goals and risk tolerance.ConclusionA well-diversified portfolio should include both equity and debt. Based on your personal circumstances and risk tolerance, you will need to determine the ideal equity-to-debt allocation for you. When allocating your assets, you should carefully consider these factors.


Additionally, asset allocation is not a static strategy. Your asset allocation may need to be adjusted as your financial goals and risk tolerance change.Finally, you can develop an asset allocation strategy that's right for you by working with a financial advisor. You can work with an advisor to determine your investment time horizon, risk tolerance, and financial goals. In addition, they can guide you in choosing the right mix of equity and debt investments.FAQsWhat is equity?Investing in equity means owning a part of the company. In other words, the stock you buy represents a portion of the company. An equity investment can yield higher returns than a debt investment, but it is also more risky.What is debt?A loan that must be repaid with interest is called a debt. By investing in debt, you are lending money to companies or governments. Debt investments tend to be less risky than equity investments, but their returns tend to be lower.


How do equity and debt allocations differ?Investing in equity securities, such as stocks, is a percentage of your overall portfolio. An investment portfolio""s debt allocation refers to its percentage allocated to debt securities, such as bonds.How do you decide how much to allocate to equity and debt?In response to this question, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Your investment goals, risk tolerance, and age will determine the best equity and debt allocation for you.What are some factors to consider when making an equity vs. debt allocation decision?An equity vs. debt allocation decision needs to take into account the following factors:Age. To reduce your risk, you may want to allocate more of your portfolio to debt than equity as you age.Risk tolerance. For risk-averse investors, debt may be a better choice than equity in their portfolio.Investment goals. To achieve higher long-term returns, you may want to allocate more of your portfolio to equity.Current economic climate. Equity vs. debt allocation decisions are also influenced by the current economic climate. For instance, it may be a good idea to allocate more of your investment portfolio to equity if the economy is doing well.How often should you rebalance your equity vs. debt allocation?Investing in equity and debt should be rebalanced regularly, once or twice a year. By doing so, your portfolio will remain aligned with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

87,Student Loan Forgiveness is a Myth: Here is Everything You Need to Know Today,"Sep 24, 2023",Deanna Ritchie,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/student-loan-forgiveness-is-a-myth-here-is-everything-you/459579,"
In most cases, private student loan forgiveness doesn't exist. Although it may sound morbid, certain private lenders will forgive your loan balance if you die or are permanently disabled. In contrast, income-driven repayment plans and other federal student loan forgiveness programs allow you to partially or fully forgive federal student loans.Even so, President Biden's student loan forgiveness plan has raised a lot of controversy recently. On the one hand, in times of financial difficulty, it may seem necessary to assist borrowers. However, some people feel they are being unfairly treated because they did not go to college — some because it was too costly to attend the university — so why should they pay for your loan? You borrowed the money, not someone else. Many others got busy and paid off their student loans.Regardless, the Supreme Court will decide President Joe Biden's plan to cancel up to $20,000 in student debt. As a result, students will find out whether they'll be able to resume payments this fall with a reduction in their balances — or if they'll have no relief from their debt this fall.



Arguments against student loan forgiveness.Generally, student loan forgiveness has been opposed on the grounds of:Fairness. People who have already paid off their student loans or who did not attend college because of the cost in the first place are unfairly penalized. In essence, these people would be subsidizing other people's loans.Incentives. With the possibility of student loan forgiveness, colleges may increase tuition prices because they know that the government will eventually forgive their debts. As a result, students would have a harder time affording college in the future.Cost. Forgiveness of student loans is a costly government program. According to the Congressional Budget Office, Joe Biden's plan to cancel federal student loan debt up to $20,000 would cost about $400 billion. However, the Penn-Wharton Budget Model estimates that forgiving federal college student loan debt over the next ten years will cost $300 billion to $980 billion. More than 60 percent of the debt is held by borrowers with high incomes.Arguments in favor of student loan forgiveness.The following principles are generally used to defend student loan forgiveness:


Relief. In the current economic climate, student loan forgiveness would provide much-needed relief to borrowers who are struggling to repay their loans. It may help them improve their financial health and allow them to focus on other financial goals, such as saving for retirement or buying a home.Economic Growth. If student loans were forgiven, borrowers would have more disposable income to spend on goods and services, boosting the economy. As a result, demand would increase and jobs would be created.Equality. By forgiving student loans, socioeconomic backgrounds would be equalized. When it comes to repaying their loans, students who come from families who can't afford to help them pay for college are often at a disadvantage.With that said, in this article, we examine the complexities surrounding student loan forgiveness and offer insight as to why it isn't as viable as it seems.There is no guarantee that student loans will be forgiven.Typically, the thought process when trying to pay for college goes like this: I'm desperate. I need to take out loans to go to school because that's the only way I'll be able to afford it. But it's cool—I can get them forgiven later, Kristina Ellis writes for Ramsey Solutions.Unfortunately, it isn't that simple. The government is always going to disappoint — or at least confuse — you at some point.Even if President Biden's plan goes through, certain borrowers will only see a portion of their federal student loan debt forgiven. It may offer some relief, but it won't solve most people's problems. How about those who owe more than $20,000 in loans? Can private student loans be repaid? Getting forgiveness like this isn't something you can expect to happen multiple times, Ellis explains.


Additionally, applying for student loan forgiveness traditionally involves a lot of fine print and is constantly changing, so the process is complicated. The truth is that way too many people spend ten years working in low-paying public service jobs merely to find out that they're not eligible for loan forgiveness.It has even happened that forgiveness has been granted, but then a denial letter is received afterward. Ultimately, they were only able to restructure their loans by suing the Department of Education.Remember, your student loan lenders won't help you out of the goodness of their hearts, adds Ellis. In reality, they'll do anything to keep you in that system, including changing the requirements for forgiveness at will.Most student loans aren't forgiven.""Loan forgiveness"" is often sought by borrowers who can't make payments, but the possibilities are few:


After making 120 qualifying payments, borrowers who work for government or qualifying nonprofit organizations can qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness.In a standard income-driven repayment plan, after 20-25 years of payments, the loan is forgiven.In the event of permanent disability, death, or other qualifying events, borrowers may qualify for a loan discharge.Impact on the economy.The adverse economic implications of student loan forgiveness are one of the main reasons why it is a myth. To forgive all outstanding student loans, which currently amount to trillions of dollars, the government would have to pay.The consequences of such a huge financial burden may strain the economy, causing tax increases, funding cuts, or even further national debt accumulation. At the end of the day, this could cause harm to the very persons it is supposed to help.It is morally hazardous.According to advocates, forgiveness of student loans would encourage students to take on even more debt, knowing they will eventually be forgiven. Students' debt could rise continuously, increasing taxpayers' burden and creating a moral hazard.In addition, this might discourage students from making informed financial and educational decisions.


Non-borrowers are unfairly treated.Forgiveness of student loans benefits borrowers primarily, leaving out non-borrowers who may have chosen a different path. It raises questions of fairness to provide financial relief exclusively to those with student loans.Many people have worked multiple jobs, attended community colleges, or enrolled in less expensive institutions in order to avoid or pay off their debts. By granting blanket forgiveness, these responsible choices are not acknowledged.An effective and targeted approach.Furthermore, student loan forgiveness can be effective in addressing the underlying causes of student debt. This issue is primarily caused by rising tuition costs, financial literacy issues, and easy credit availability.In other words, forgiveness alone does not address these fundamental issues. To achieve long-term solutions and improve access to affordable education, a more comprehensive approach is needed.


The impact on higher education.Universities may suffer unintended consequences if student loans are forgiven. If colleges and universities are assured of loan forgiveness, there may be little incentive to cut costs or make education more affordable.Without market pressure, rising tuition fees could persist, exacerbating the student debt crisis.What the future holds for student loan forgiveness.It is uncertain what the future holds for student loan forgiveness. No program to forgive student loans is guaranteed. For years to come, the issue is expected to remain a hot topic of discussion.It is likely that student loan forgiveness will only benefit a small group of borrowers if implemented. The program could target public sector workers or borrowers with certain income levels, for instance.


There is also the possibility of student loan forgiveness as part of a package of reforms to the student loan system. For college to be more affordable, tuition costs may be reduced or financial aid may be increased.There is no way to predict whether student loans will be forgiven in the future. However, this is a complex issue that can't be solved easily. In order to make the right decision regarding student loan forgiveness, one must carefully consider all the arguments for and against it.FAQsWhat are the different types of student loans?Generally, there are two types of student loans: federal loans and private loans. Private student loans are issued by banks or other financial institutions, while federal student loans are issued by the government.What are the different repayment plans available for student loans?In addition to standard repayment plans, graduated repayment plans, extended repayment plans, and income-driven repayment plans are also available. It depends on your income, your debt load, and your financial goals what repayment plan you should choose.


What are the different forgiveness programs available for student loans?Student loans can be forgiven through several different programs, including the public service loan forgiveness program, the teacher loan forgiveness program, and the Perkins loan forgiveness program. In order to find out which forgiveness programs are available to you, you will need to research each program's requirements.Do student loans affect your credit score?It is true that student loans affect your credit score. In the future, getting approved for loans or credit cards may be more difficult if you default on your student loans or make late payments.How can I get help with my student loans?There are several resources available to you if you are having trouble repaying your student loans. Depending on your situation, you may need to speak with a financial advisor, a student loan counselor, or the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS).Featured Image Credit: Cottonbros Studio; Pexels; Thank you!The post Student Loan Forgiveness is a Myth: Here is Everything You Need to Know Today appeared first on Due.

88,Tens of Thousands of Americans Could Be Billionaires Right Now If Their Wealthy Families Didn't Make This All-Too-Common Financial Mistake,"Sep 18, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/there-would-be-more-billionaires-if-not-for-this-common/459050,"
If the wealthiest American families of centuries past had managed their fortunes differently, tens of thousands of U.S. billionaire heirs would grace today's rich lists. So, what happened?That's a complicated question, but Victor Haghani and James White's recently published book Missing Billionaires: A Guide to Better Financial Decisions focuses on one critical answer: the poor risk decisions made in both investing and spending.""Wealthy families tended to have investments which were not well diversified, had high fees and costs, and were overly risky relative to the families' spending policies, which were not typically very flexible or sensitive to the ups and downs of their investment portfolio,"" White tells Entrepreneur.

89,Steps to Take to Protect Yourself if you are a Victim of Identity Theft,"Sep 16, 2023",Chaim Geller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/steps-to-take-to-protect-yourself-if-you-are-a-victim-of/459139,"
Did a thief get their hands on your personal finances? Did someone scam you? Do you see fraudulent activity on any of your accounts? Then you may be a victim of identity theft.What is identity theft?Identity theft is ugly. To be a victim of identity theft is really no fun.Identity theft is when a thief gets access to your personal and financial information. Through dark and mysterious activity, they find ways to break into your personal and financial space. Your SSN, legal name, credit card accounts, bank accounts, tax files, you name it. They make themselves at home and take on your name and details.



Once they carry your identity they can do anything in your name. They may deplete your bank accounts of its funds. Thieves may apply for new credit lines, rack up balances, and leave you with the balances. They may steal your tax refunds, or better yet, file fraudulent tax returns.Wherever they can pull dollars from, they will. All in your name. That can be devastating to your financial status in every way. Be it due to debt they leave you with, the effects of damage to your criminal records, or simply the money it takes to clean up an identity theft mess.Can you Protect Yourself from Identity Theft?Just to think of what it is like to be a victim of identity theft is enough to make you shudder.If it happened to you, there are several steps you can take to protect yourself further. Even if someone stole your identity, you don't have to let them walk away with more than you can prevent. That said, there are several types of identity theft. For each one, I will advise what you can do to protect yourself further.Let me warn you upfront. It is a headache. Protecting yourself against identity theft requires lots of paperwork. It requires you to speak up quickly. You may need to fight for refunds. I hope this post will make the process as smooth as possible. And rest assured, you will make it through.First file a police reportBefore you do anything, first file a police report. Or as it may be called, a fraud affidavit.That is an absolute must for step 1.  This report is to prove to all that you are a victim of identity theft. It will make it easier for you to fight the fraudulent activity if you have this official report. It will also help you restore your losses more easily.You can file a fraud affidavit online. When you do, fill it out carefully. The information should be as accurate as possible. You want to ensure it goes as smoothly as possible. You don't need extra headaches or delays due to wrong information on your fraud affidavit.


In order to file a fraud affidavit, visit this link. It is on the Federal Trade Commission website. You will be prompted to click the get started button. Do so and then follow the prompts.A fraud affidavit gives you the opportunity to report the theft and start the road to recovery. It's important you take this step immediately to make the recovery easier.Now, we're ready to dive into each identity theft type you may have been a victim of. Read what you can do to protect yourself further.1. Protect Yourself from Fraudulent Banks AccountsOne thing a hacker may do after they steal your identity is open bank accounts in your name.They can literally apply for accounts with the banks you bank with. Thieves may open new accounts to use for checks. They can write out a bunch of checks and leave you to deal with bounced check fees. The debt can pile up from account fees.They also like to use the accounts for criminal activity. If they perform a crime through your bank account then it leaves their personal name out of the crime. But you are left with enormous debt and you are not at all anonymous. The new bank accounts belong to you after all.The good news is that you are protected under federal regulation for this sort of identity theft. You will not have to swallow the general fees, the overdraft fund fees, or fees for the bounced checks.Regarding the crime committed through the bank account, we will discuss later if you need to take responsibility for the resulting loss.So, what can you do to prevent this from happening again?You can check your bank account activity report.There are companies that note bank account activity. That includes when you open and close bank accounts. Most banks report to these companies and you can see it all on your bank account activity report. These reports also list if you had bounced checks, overdraft protection, and more.


Federal law mandates that you can get your report once a year for free. Definitely check your report once a year. Look out for new bank accounts that you don't recognize opening. Search for fraudulent activity on your report. If you already are suspicious of fraudulent activity, check your report twice a year. The first time you will get it for free but you should order it a second time for a small fee. It is important to do so to ensure you don't miss fraud if there is.These are some companies from whom you can order your bank screening reports:AskCertegyChexSystemsCrossCheckFirstDataEarlyWarningCheck your soft inquiriesThere is another thing you can do to prevent fraudulent bank accounts in your name.Many banks do a soft pull on your credit before they open a new account for you. They do it in order to check your credit file before they entrust you with an account.Banks that offer overdraft protections and similar services are even more likely to check your credit before they choose to grant you an account. Just like an employer interviews a potential employee, the bank wants to scan your credit life before they approve you for a new account.This can work in your favor if you suspect fraudulent bank accounts. You can check to see recent soft pulls and look out for fraudulent ones.A fraudulent inquiry is one from a bank that you know you have not opened an account with. Or if there are multiple from a specific bank you know you don't have so many accounts with.You can view your soft inquiries on your credit report. You can view your credit report at annualcreditreport.com for free, once every 12 months. Make sure that all inquiries you see are from bank accounts you opened. If there are some you don't recognize, look into it to make sure those are not fraud accounts opened through identity theft.2. Protect Yourself from Fraudulent Credit CardsAnother popular treat for identity thieves is to open credit lines. This includes credit cards and loans.They can open these up in your name as soon as they have your personal information. With your social security number, name, address, and date of birth, they can go party and apply for credit lines. The rest of the information they need to apply is simple for them to make up or figure out. That includes facts such as your income and housing expenses.


A thief may open credit cards under your name, swipe thousands of dollars, and then go fly off. You are then left with all that debt to pay up.Your credit score is also at stakeNot only are you left with debt, but the thief can also subsequently ruin your credit. Following are some aspects of a credit score that can be affected if a thief messes with credit lines in your name.Too many new accounts openedCredit scoring models do not like to see so many credit cards opened in one shot. As a matter of fact, each time you open a new card, your score will drop a bit. This is due to a couple of factors.One reason is that when you apply for a new card, the bank does a hard pull to your credit. This is the act of them accessing your credit report to look it through.The bank will do this before approving (or declining) you for a card. Whether you get approved or denied the card, a hard inquiry will show up on your credit report. Each hard inquiry will push your credit score down by a few points. That is a general rule. That is because it is bad to have too many recent inquiries. No lender wants to see that you applied for so many new accounts. Why would they trust you to be responsible with yet another credit card after opening so many?Do you see where we're going with this? Do you think had the thieves realized they were doing this much damage they would have kept away? If only.Another reason a new account affects your score is this. Automatically, once the new account reports to your credit, your score will drop a bit. The credit models want to see how you will take this new account. Can you handle the new credit line or not? After an approximate period of up to 30 days, your score will go up again. If the thief opens multiple accounts, the effect it has on your credit score will be much stronger. Negatively, that is. Due to the hard credit inquiries and simply for having new accounts.High credit utilizationThis is yet another way identity theft affects your credit. The thief opens new credit cards, swipes tons of money, and leaves you with unpaid balances. There goes your credit utilization.Credit utilization is the ratio of the credit limit on your credit card and the card balance. If the balance is high in regards to the available credit, then your credit utilization is high. That is not good. Credit utilization should ideally be low. Even as low as a balance that is only up to 9% of the credit limit on the card.Seems the thieves didn't know this rule. They likely used a lot more of the available credit on your credit cards.Credit utilization likely shot up from those balances. And that obviously can cause your credit score to shoot downwards.Dealing with the debt and sour credit scoreThis is a two-edged sword. On one end you have credit cards with huge balances, and on the other end, you have blue and black bruised-up credit.Lucky for you, you do not have to pay the balances. In most states, the law claims you are not responsible for debt on fraudulent accounts that were opened in your name. So that's good. It helps you financially so that you don't have to pay those credit cards.And about your credit, the Fair Credit Report Act (FCRA) demands that the credit bureaus remove any account from your report that was opened without your consent. But, the damage done to your credit is done. It is difficult to go back on it, even once you remove the accounts.Here is how you can protect yourself further to ensure no thief touches your credit. It is too demanding to risk it otherwise.Freeze your creditFirst things first, freeze your credit. I'll explain what that means. When you apply for a new credit line, the lender will pull your credit report before they approve you. This, as we mentioned above, is to help them decide if they want to extend credit to you.Now, you can freeze your credit report. If you log in to your online credit report with any one of the credit bureaus, you can easily place a freeze on your credit. This locks your report and everyone but you loses access to your credit report. So if a thief applies for a card in your name, the bank will try to pull your credit. But if there is a freeze, they will not be able to pull your credit. Thereupon, they will not be able to approve the new card account.Ha, thief, caught you right there! When you freeze your credit you elegantly keep the thieves' hands off your credit. They will be unable to open new credit lines in your name in such a manner.According to the FCRA, you have the right to freeze your credit for free whenever you'd like. You can, at any time, freeze or unfreeze your report. So it's not like you're locking yourself in forever. If you need to apply for a new card, you can unfreeze the report for the time being.Place a fraud alert on your reportSecondly, to protect yourself from fraudulent credit lines, you can place a fraud alert on your credit report. When a lender pulls your credit before they approve you for new credit, they will get a message to be extra cautious. The message may be similar to this: ""Identity security ALERT: Fraudulent applications may be submitted in my name or my identity may have been used without my consent to fraudulently obtain goods or services. Do not extend credit without first verifying the identity of the applicant.""


So if a thief is trying to apply for a new credit card, they may be hit with additional security verification steps. The lender may ask for more documents, security questions, and more. The thief will have to work harder to prove your identity and may fail. If the bank cannot confirm your identity, they will not extend the credit. You can call each of the credit bureaus to ask for a fraud alert on your report. You can also contact the credit bureaus online. It is free to place a fraud alert on your credit report.Please note: If you place a fraud alert, it may give you a hard time to apply for legitimate accounts. The lenders will double down on the security for you as well. After all, they can't prove at the onset if you are the legit applicant or not. So it may be difficult to apply for credit if you have a fraud alert. I therefore would not suggest you put a fraud alert as a first step. Do so only as a last resort, if a credit freeze is not enough.To remove a fraud alert, you will have to mail a request to all three credit bureaus. You will need to provide identifying documents.Apply for credit monitoringYou can get alerts from your credit report even more simply with a credit monitoring service. This will not cause complications as a fraud alert may.There are companies who can monitor your credit report for free. They can alert you of every action that is done on your report. If there is a new inquiry on your report, they will notify you. If the inquiry is not from an account you applied for, you can notify the consequential bank immediately. They will cancel the application and not extend the credit. That's called to nip it in the bud.When you are alerted before the act is finished, you can make sure the account does not even get opened.There are many companies that monitor your credit for free. Each one reports from some or all of the credit bureaus. The companies also differ in terms of the frequency in which they update their info. See which one works for you.Here are a few options:Credit KarmaCredit SesameFreeCreditScore.comNerd WalletWallet Hub3. Protect Yourself from Theft with your Credit Card RewardsThere is another dimension to credit card identity theft. That is when thieves break into your online account and steal your credit card rewards. Your hard-earned credit card rewards. Many credit cards offer rewards on certain purchases you make with your credit card. For example, a card may offer 1 point per each dollar spent on office supplies.The approximate value of a point is 1 cent per point. The rewards you earn can be redeemed as cashback, for travel, and more. It can take time, thought, and money to rack up a significant amount of points. Besides it is upsetting to lose all your rewards, there is nothing to do to protect your points from being stolen.


I'm sorry! If you lose your rewards to identity theft, there is not much you can do. However, do reach out to your credit card lender. Sometimes, you are able to get your rewards back as a courtesy of the bank.So if you lost rewards from an Amex credit card, reach out to Amex. If you lost Chase points, reach out to Chase, etc.4. Protect Yourself from Fraudulent Activity in your Bank AccountsIdentity thieves may trample your existing bank accounts. All they need is your checking account number or debit card number. Even simply having the login to your online banking can give them access to your accounts. Once they can access your bank accounts they can easily drain your accounts from the money in it. They can transfer funds out of your accounts and use the funds for whatever they please.Since that can be devastating, here are some practical ways to protect yourself and prevent this from happening.Set up alertsYou should have the option with most banks to set up alerts. You can preset which type of activities you want to be alerted of. Activities may be; when a transaction surpasses a certain amount, your personal information such as your address or phone number change, when you get a transfer of funds going in or coming out of your account, and more.These alerts are great for monitoring fraudulent activity. If you get alerted for something you know wasn't you, you can crack down on it immediately. Call the bank, stop the transaction, whatever it takes to prevent fraud.Review your bank statementsAlways review your bank statements carefully. If you ever suspect fraudulent activity, get in touch with your bank immediately. If there are transactions you don't recognize, make sure to act upon it and let the bank know.Set strong credentialsThis is definitely a must for online accounts. Set a strong password so that it should be harder for thieves to crack in. You can opt for two-step verifications to give them an even harder time. Don't go easy on those identity thieves! These are ideas to prevent identity theft from occurring.But what if you are already a victim? You can be protected from your loss if you act quickly.If you contact your bank as soon as possible after you notice fraud, you stand the chance of being protected. With Federal banking regulations, it all depends when you report fraudulent bank transactions. If you report within 2 days of when you receive your statement then you will be protected. There will be a $50 liability. If you report on the third day then your liability will jump to $500. If you report transactions past 60 then you will not be protected. That means that you will be protected for transactions that happened within the first 60 days, but nor for transactions past 60 days.


You can understand from here that it is crucial to report fraud ASAP when it comes to bank activity. If you wait too long, your liability will increase and you may even risk not being protected at all.5. Protect Yourself from Fraudulent Activity with your TaxesThere are two things in life that you can't avoid, correct? Death and taxes.And taxes is a looming headache.Do you know how you can turn taxes from a headache to a magnified migraine? When you add tax identity theft to the mix.Identity thieves can hack into your tax files. They may file fraudulent tax returns in your name. Then they may take your tax refund and go home. They can even exaggerate the tax returns for an inflated refund.Tax identity theft involves many issues. First of all, the thief walks off with tax credits under your name. That means that you either miss out on your legitimate tax refunds or that your refunds get very delayed. That is a monetary loss.Plus, there is loads of paperwork you have to deal with to sort out the mess. To get your files back in order, correspondence with the IRS, and much more.The bad news is that if you are a victim, you have to deal with all of the above. Fortunately, though, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself and prevent this from happening again.File taxes as soon as you canThe IRS will accept the first tax returns that come in for any given person. Make sure you are the first one to file taxes under your name.You hope to be the only one but in case someone has got their dirty hands on your file, this tactic can save you. File your taxes as soon as you possibly can. Make sure you beat any fraudulent tax returns that may come in under your name.


First come, first serve. This is a matter a lot more crucial than pizza and fries, to ensure you're first in line for!Get an IP PINAnother way to protect yourself is to get an IP PIN.An IP PIN is a six-digit code you can get from the IRS. The IRS usually will assign an IP PIN to any victim of identity theft.You may even get one if you are a possible victim.A new PIN will be generated for you each year. You use the IP PIN when you file taxes to prevent anyone else from filing your taxes.It's your secret passcode to your tax returns. It is assigned just to you and should stay confidential. Obviously, if you have a tax professional file your taxes you will need to share your PIN but keep it at that. No one but the IRS and the filer need to know your PIN.You can check this out for every detail you need to know about IP PINs.6. Protect Yourself from Fraudulent Employment or UnemploymentOne thing you may wish for is to have a robot go to work instead of you. Let the machine be the one to wake up early and operate 9-5.But as long as you get the green bills at the end of the day, huh?So some thieves will come in and take the cash, but leave you to work. This is known as employment identity theft. Or unemployment identity theft, when they file unemployment for you and cash in on the cash.


Either way, it's nasty. Whether they work under your name and get paid, or file unemployment and get your insurance checks. Luckily, the IRS will bear the brunt of your loss for all things money. But it's a lot to sort out in terms of paperwork and filing.Here are a few things you can do to investigate and protect yourself.Request a wage transcriptJust like you can ask for a bank account activity report, you can ask for a wage transcript.Ask your accountant to request from the IRS your wage transcript. There you can view all wages under your name. Search for fraudulent wage reports if you suspect identity theft.Once you review that and come across fraud, these are 3 places you should report to:Your employer: Report the fraud to your employer so they know what is going on. Keep copies of all communications.U.S. Department of Justice's National Center for Disaster Fraud: Also known as NCDF. You can report your fraud either online here or call 1-866-720-5721.U.S. Department of Labor: Report fraudulent unemployment here.7. Protect Yourself from Fraudulent Criminal RecordsThis is a tough one, though not that common. Imagine if you have stained criminal records done by some stranger lurking out there.Identity thieves may actually commit crimes using your information. That equals crime done in your name. Thieves may commit the crime under your name or even give over your personal information, standing in for their own, to a police officer. No one can be the wiser if you were the one to commit the crime or not. It is a tough tangle to crawl out of.Criminal identity fraud can hit you in the face when you try to apply for a job. If your potential employer pulls a police report, they will see the black marks. The criminal records will show up even if it's fraudulent.The mere fact that you have criminal records under your name can put you at risk of being called on by higher-ups. It's not pretty and it is downright shameful. Plus, you have to pay to clear your name.If you are a victim, here is what you can do to protect yourself:


Get in touch with an attorney. They can give you legal counsel.Sign up for web monitoring services. There's the dark web hovering behind everything. Sign up for a dark web monitoring service. They will alert you to any activity that happens in connection to your personal information on the dark web. This can help keep you in the know when your personal records are tampered with.Sign up for identity theft insurance. Some dark web monitoring may come along with a $1,000,000 identity theft insurance. That can go towards any fees you pay for legalities or for professionals to clean up from identity theft.8. Protect Yourself from Fraud with your Medical RecordsWhere else will identity theft reach, you're thinking.But identity theft may reach your medical insurance's pockets.Medical identity theft is what happens when thieves use your personal information to receive medical insurance. They may actually stage a medical occurrence under your name just to be able to receive medical insurance.The greatest damage this may have is to your medical records. There may be false medical incidents and information in your medical files. So number one, if you are a victim of identity theft or suspect fraud, please alert your doctors to it. They should know to check in with you regarding all details about your medical history before they make any medical decision.What may also occur due to medical identity theft are credit collections. When a medical bill is not paid, the company can report it to the credit bureaus. The credit bureaus then place the unpaid bill on your credit report as a medical collection.Medical collections are a delinquency on your credit report and your credit score will be affected negatively. Your credit score may drop if a new medical collection gets reported. Whatever medical tragedy the thief comes up with may evolve into a medical collection.If you come across fraudulent medical collections on your credit report, report it as fraud and have the accounts removed. You have every right to dispute fraudulent accounts with the medical companies.Check out this page to find out exactly how to get in touch with medical providers.

90,Some Retirees Are More Likely to Face This 'Life-Destroying' Event — Here's How to Keep Your Savings Safe No Matter What,"Sep 15, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/retirees-should-do-this-to-avoid-a-catastrophic-financial/459099,"
Americans with retirement accounts believe they need an average of $1.8 million socked away to retire, according to a Charles Schwab study reported by CBS News — and about 55% of them say they're behind on saving, per a recent Bankrate survey.For women, that feeling is even more common, with 50% of them saying they're not on track with retirement savings compared to just 35% of men, a new report from Goldman Sachs revealed.What's more, women are more likely to face challenges that could throw them even further off the savings course — from losing a spouse or partner to becoming a caregiver, according to recent research from financial services firm Edward Jones and aging research provider Age Wave, CNBC reported.

Assuming a caregiver role also disproportionately affects women; a majority of them said it was a ""life-destroying"" event both from a financial and life standpoint, Lena Haas, head of wealth management advice and solutions at Edward Jones, said.Women are also more likely to need more retirement savings: 57% of all those ages 65 and older are female, and the average lifespan is about five years longer for women than men in the U.S., according to Harvard Health.Related: Top 20 States For Retirees That Are 'Better' Than FloridaThe best way to safeguard your finances no matter what happens?

91,Is Passive Income Really Passive – Uncovering the Truth,"Sep 14, 2023",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/is-passive-income-really-passive-uncovering-the-truth/459037,"
When you think of long-term wealth creation, it's hard to overlook passive income. Thinking of personal finance, passive income promises a steady financial inflow even when you aren't working anymore. Some sources of passive income even promise the dream of earning money while you sleep, taking you close to your financial freedom.However, have you ever wondered whether passive income is really passive? This has been a highly debated topic in personal finance. It's enticing to explore the concept of generative wealth passively. However, establishing reliable channels to earn passive income requires strategic planning and active involvement.In this article, we are going to delve deep into this discussion and find out the realities of passive income.



What is passive income?Passive income refers to the money you earn with minimal ongoing involvement and effort. Establishing consistent channels to earn passive income requires some initial work. Affiliate marketing, for instance, is one of the most common instances of earning passive income. Often, passive income channels are associated with business ventures and investments that generate cash flow consistently without requiring active management.What makes passive income lucrative is its potential to assure financial security. Most individuals largely rely on some kind of passive income to attain financial freedom. This way, they can focus on other priorities in their lives.However, it's crucial to understand that growing multiple passive income streams require active involvement. The ideal strategy to attain financial independence is to prioritize both active and passive income.The importance of stewardship in passive incomeA wide misconception about passive income is that it doesn't require any monitoring or involvement. In reality, earning passive income requires proper stewardship, protection, and management. Growing passive income is just like nurturing a seed. To grow into a plant, a seed needs continuous care and monitoring.The same applies to passive income streams. With responsible stewardship and attention, you can grow your passive income. This implies you need to actively manage your investments to protect your money and make informed decisions to ensure long-term growth and sustainability.Why do you need to manage your passive income?Different types of passive investments require their respective degrees of management. For instance, you might consider real estate investments a source of passive income. However, you need to manage multiple properties that call for oversight and, sometimes, decision-making. At times, real estate investors even outsource property management services.


On the other hand, you might consider investing in mutual funds to be a more hands-off approach. Still, it's crucial to monitor your investment portfolio and rebalance the funds from time to time. Therefore, passive income isn't any ""get rich' scheme. Even when you invest in stocks to build your portfolio, the process involves intensive research.Why is it important to balance passive income with active cash inflow?There's no denying that passive income can take you closer to financial freedom and stability. However, you cannot afford to overlook the importance of active income altogether. Whether you earn your active income through business ventures or employment, it serves as your economic engine, fuelling financial growth.Through active income, individuals get the opportunity to explore different streams of passive income and invest in them. Therefore, you need active income to create a balanced and sustainable financial portfolio of passive income.On the other hand, passive investing requires you to clearly understand the involved risks and investment vehicles and make timely decisions. In case you incur losses while investing in passive sources of income, you need active income to replenish the funds. There's no better example than investing in dividend-earning stocks in this context.How to capitalize on passive income?Although managing your passive income streams involves active involvement from your end, it's possible to strike a balance to stride ahead to your financial freedom. These tips will make passive income work for you.Educate yourself financiallyYour financial literacy goes a long way in understanding different investment options and strategies. That's why wealth coaches recommend some of the best financial blogs and books to investors. Cultivating financial resilience from an early age defines your approach to handling money. Naturally, financial education can help you make informed decisions and mitigate potential risks.Diversify your streams of passive incomeNever rely on a single source of passive income; it can be a substantial risk to your financial freedom. It's wise to invest in multiple income streams to diversify your portfolio. So, check out different investment avenues such as real estate, cryptocurrencies, bonds, stocks, mutual funds, or peer-to-peer lending. Besides, online businesses such as affiliate marketing can also stream in handsome amounts as passive income.Diversifying your passive income sources empower you to capitalize on different market conditions. Thus, if a particular market fails to deliver returns, it won't be a major setback for your financial goals.


Go for reliable and reputable investmentsBefore investing in any avenue, it's imperative to do your research. The same applies to passive income opportunities too. As you eye consistent returns through passive income channels, carry out thorough research and choose reliable investment instruments.For instance, if you are willing to invest in mutual funds, choose an asset management company with reputed fund managers. Go for trusted platforms with an established track record of delivering consistent returns. Consider factors like investment strategy, historical performance, transparency, and charges. Due diligence happens to be the key to mitigating risks and makes your passive income streams reliable.Maintain active involvementThe prime goal of passive investments is to minimize your ongoing effort. However, this doesn't mean you can let your investments earn consistently. It's imperative to regularly monitor these investments and evaluate their performances.Stay abreast with the market trends, economic aspects, and any changes that may affect your portfolio. Also, you need to review your investment strategy and adjust the same to optimize returns and mitigate your risks. A proactive stance on your end to engage with your investments can help you take advantage of the opportunities and make informed decisions.Leverage technology and automate investmentsLeverage technology to streamline your passive income streams and manage your investments. Use online analytics tools and platforms to track your finances and obtain reports. Besides, financial experts recommend automating recurring investments or processes such as SIPs for mutual funds, reinvesting your dividend, or rent collection. Leveraging technology can save you time and effort while you manage your passive income sources.Learn and adapt continuouslyThe financial landscape keeps evolving continually. Thus, it's imperative to stay ahead of your learning curve. This explains the value of financial literacy so that you can stay informed about new tax strategies, investment opportunities, and financial trends.Also, read financial books, follow reputable finance blogs, and attend seminars to boost your financial knowledge. Embrace a growth mindset and be open to adapting your investment approach from time to time. When you stay informed and adaptable, you can maximize the potential of your passive income streams.Exploring different streams of passive incomeTraditional sources of passive income, such as dividend stocks or rental real estate, continue to draw investors. However, it's crucial to explore alternative investment avenues to diversify your income sources. Exploring different streams of passive income reduces your risk of concentration, besides exposing you to lucrative opportunities.


Let's check out some of the alternative streams of passive income that you might consider.Peer-to-peer lendingIn recent years, peer-to-peer lending platforms have gained traction as a viable option for passive income. These platforms connect lenders to borrowers, eliminating the need for financial intermediaries. You can earn interest when you lend money to small businesses or individuals.However, peer-to-peer lending comes with risks like the lack of creditworthiness of the borrowers. Therefore, it's wise to conduct due diligence and weigh these risks before lending.Investing in dividend-earning stocksInvesting in dividend-earning stocks continues to be one of the most reliable forms of generating passive income. It pays to invest in stocks of companies that distribute a part of their profits to their shareholders in the form of dividends.Investors need to research and choose dividend-paying stocks from established and reputed companies. Make sure that the company has a consistent track record of increasing its dividends over time.Create digital products and monitor themCreating and monetizing digital products has become an excellent source of passive income in the digital age. Consider developing and selling online courses or e-books in your area of specialization. Besides, many individuals are developing software applications to cater to a particular audience.While you need to create digital products just once, you can sell them as many times as you want. This brings in a consistent stream of income over time.Affiliate marketingAffiliate marketing is one of the most reliable forms of passive income streams. This is a mechanism where you need to promote the products or services offered by other entrepreneurs. When you manage to sell, you earn a commission on each product.


Identify a niche or industry that aligns with your expertise or interest. You may also look out for affiliate marketing programs offering lucrative commission structures. Affiliate marketing brings you an opportunity to make the best use of your marketing skills and leverage your online presence.Explore REITsConsider investing in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) to foray into real estate investments without directly investing. This is an alternative to owning and managing properties directly. REITs own, operate, or finance income-generating real estate assets. When you invest in REITs, you can enjoy the benefits of real estate investing without making a large investment in the real estate sector. Moreover, you do not have to spend to manage the property.Passive isn't passive!With a proactive and strategic approach, you can maximize your passive income. Develop a holistic financial plan and explore alternative income streams to consolidate your finances. Also, leverage your real estate investments and deploy risk management strategies by diversification to enhance your passive income. This defines your path to long-term wealth creation.Remember, passive income is not entirely passive. Even after putting in your initial effort, you need to continuously monitor your investment strategy and make informed decisions. With dedication and persistence, you can develop a robust portfolio to earn passive income and financially stabilize yourself. No wonder a realistic approach to maximizing your passive income largely defines your financial freedom.FAQCan I generate passive income without investing a lot of money upfront?Yes, you can generate passive income in several ways with a small upfront investment. For instance, you can create digital products and sell them, start an affiliate marketing website, or simply rent out your property on Airbnb to earn a consistent rental income.How can I optimize my tax efficiency when I earn passive income?Invest in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k) plans to optimize your tax savings. Also, understand capital gains and dividend tax rates properly. This way, you can strategize your investments to earn consistently while capitalizing on your tax benefits.What is the best way to minimize risk while investing in passive income sources?The best way to minimize your risk while investing in different avenues to earn passive income is to diversify your portfolio.

Without food and water, humans can only live for several days. However, according to one survey, most people could only survive a few hours without their electronics and WiFi.According to a survey of 2,000 American adults, besides food and water, people cannot live without:Medicine (55%)Electricity (53%)Gas and heating (51%)Electronics (48%)WiFi 46%)Some people might find it bizarre that electronics and WiFi are considered basic necessities. But, is it really?



The U.S. Public Interest Research Group Education Fund published a report titled ""Repair Saves Families Big II"" that found American households spent about $1,480 annually in 2019 on electronics like appliances, phones, and computers. In 2021, spending on electronic products rose 19%, and the average household spends $1,767 annually on new devices.Additionally, the average American spends seven hours and four minutes a day staring at a screen. Research has shown that it can still have damaging effects, such as digital eye strain, sleep disturbances, and worsened mental health.

Identify the products and services you use most often. Your best bet is to keep these products and services. In my case, I work mostly from home. That means having a laptop and a solid internet connection is a must. Plus, since music helps me focus, having a premium Spotify account is worth it.Determine which tech tools are redundant.A typical American household contains 24 pieces of electronic equipment. It is possible that you have tech tools that have similar functions to other tools. If so, you can easily remove these tools.Sell or donate unused devices.Donate or sell your old devices if you do not need them anymore. As a result, space will be freed up and some extra money will be generated.The same is true for items that you rarely use. You can recycle, donate, or sell these products.

In this way, you may be able to reduce the number of devices that you own.Also, try to share subscriptions. For example, you could share your Max password with a family member in exchange for their Disney + password. The only catch is that these services are beginning to crack down on password sharing.


Find free or low-cost alternatives to paid products. Popular tech products can be replaced with free or low-cost alternatives, such as open-source software. For example, instead of paying for Microsoft Office, you can use free alternatives like Apache OpenOffice or LibreOffice.Group similar products together. As a result, you will be able to find and use products more easily.Choose a unified platform.Whenever possible, choose a unified platform that can replace multiple tech tools. By doing so, you will avoid paying licensing fees and maintenance fees. The Hubspot platform, for example, offers a little bit of everything for entrepreneurs and small business owners. As your business grows, you can use it for marketing, live chat, and eCommerce.Set up a system for managing your tech. In order to keep track of your subscriptions and devices, you may want to create a spreadsheet or use a cloud-based tool.


Wait to embrace new technology. I know that you want to get your hands on the latest iPhone or viral gadget. But, in most cases, you're better off waiting.Why? When gadgets are first released, they are the most expensive. Each year, however, these gadgets become cheaper.

Social security, the federal program that nearly 67 million Americans count on to fund their income in retirement, is running out — fast.Ten thousand Baby Boomers retire every day, and by 2033, the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund will run dry, CNBC reported. Social Security won't disappear completely, but some retirees will likely get the short end of the stick.Related: How a Grandma Who Made $35k Earns 7 Figures in RetirementWorkers will continue to pay Social Security payroll taxes and fund the program, but with no action from lawmakers, roughly 77% of promised benefits would be payable if the fund empties, per the outlet.That means a bleak outlook for many Americans. On average, Americans have saved only 78% of the amount they'll need in retirement, and 52% of U.S. households may not be able to pay for essential expenses in retirement, according to a 2023 Fidelity report.Although Congress is expected to address the issue, ""there are going to be losers,"" David Blanchett, head of retirement research at PGIM, the asset management arm of Prudential Financial, told CNBC.Related: Protect Your Retirement Fund Against Inflation With This BenefitAnd who will those ""losers"" be?

96,The 7 Stages of Financial Independence,"Sep 6, 2023",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/the-7-stages-of-financial-independence/458601,"
There are lots of reasons why people want financial independence. Some of the most common are:Escape the rat race. It's getting harder and harder to make ends meet working long hours at jobs you don't like. Financial independence lets you pursue passions or choose your own work.To have more control over your life. Financial independence means you're not dependent on your boss or the economy. There's no worry about losing your job or struggling to pay your bills, and you can spend your time how you want.Spend more time with family and friends. You can travel more, take more vacations, and spend more time with your family when you're financially independent. Also, you can get more involved in volunteer work or other activities.Pursuing your passions. Having your passions in your life is easier when you're not stuck at a job you hate. If you want, you can start your own business, write a book, or travel.Giving back to others. Being financially independent can give you the power to change the world. If you want to help others, you can donate to charities, start your own foundation, or volunteer.This is where Grant Sabatier's 7 levels of financial freedom come in – a roadmap for assessing and improving your finances so much that you become financially free.To achieve your financial goals, pay your bills, and most importantly, enjoy your life, you must feel confident, independent, and secure. The problem is, how can you live with high living costs, exorbitant debt interest, and everything else eating into your wallet? However, you can build wealth, pay off debt, or save for a vacation if you follow these seven steps.



1. ClarityIf you didn't know the responsibilities of a new job, you wouldn't accept it, right? Financial independence is no different. Therefore, Sabatier's first level of financial freedom is clarity, which is understanding your current financial situation and improving your financial literacy.Gaining clarity begins with assessing your current financial situation and deciding where you want to go. In order to achieve clarity, follow these simple two steps:Calculate your net worth.What is your ""why' for achieving FI (financial independence.)Using Betterment, You Need a Budget, or Personal Capital, you can calculate your net worth. Through these programs, you can connect bank accounts, investment accounts, credit cards, auto loans, mortgages, and student loans. In turn, this should give you a solid idea of where you stand financially.What about your ""why?'Well, there's no right or wrong answer. It's really up to you. For some, they'd like to become financially independent so they can travel or spend more time with their families. Regardless, consider your reasons and write them down.2. Self-SufficiencyBeing solvent or self-sufficient is the next step toward financial independence. To put it another way, you must be able to meet your financial obligations without getting into debt or requiring the assistance of third parties.


The truth is, living on credit will keep you in a dependence phase and one step from disaster. Why? Since a bank isn't like your parents, it will demand repayment.There is still a possibility to generate financial freedom at this stage, but it is limited. For example, you can invest, review unnecessary expenses, and reduce your electricity usage.3. Breathing RoomHere, we get a chance to take a breather. After all, if you've ever lived paycheck to paycheck, you know how suffocating it can be.But what exactly does breathing room mean? Once essential expenses are covered, you have some extra money to invest in stocks or for an emergency fund. In addition, you have more wiggle room to cover unexpected expenses like a big vet bill or home renovations. Then again, you might have a few debts eating up much of your income.Despite reaching level 3, you may still desire more from life. But those days of living paycheck to paycheck or relying on financial assistance from your parents or credit cards are over.4. StabilityAt Level 4, people have paid off high-interest debt, like credit card debt, and have saved six months' worth of living expenses for emergencies, notes Ryan Ermey for Grow. By building up emergency savings, you ensure that unexpected circumstances won't disrupt your finances.""At this level, you're not worried if you lose your job or if you have to move to a different city,"" Sabatier says.Rather than just factoring in your regular, everyday expenses when calculating how much you should have saved, financial experts recommend thinking about how your finances might look in an uncertain financial future.


""If you have a job loss, you'd make some changes. You'd probably cut your gym membership and get rid of your subscriptions, for instance,"" Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar, told Grow. ""Think about the bare minimum you'd need to get by.""5. FlexibilityA person who reaches this stage can live with their wealth for at least two years. In this situation, you could think about changing jobs voluntarily or taking a sabbatical year.Simply put, you have the freedom to organize your life and time according to your preferences and you are not limited to certain environments at work. Obviously, within a limit, which will define the years of financial freedom you enjoy.Between this stage and the next, it is possible to reach a level of financial independence known as Lean FIRE, which we can translate as ""frugal or meager"". As a result, you may be able to live off your savings by stopping working. However, your lifestyle will have to change and your expenses will have to be drastically reduced.6. Financial IndependenceWhile flexibility is great, you can't really kiss your day job goodbye forever. In order to accomplish that, you'd have to become financially independent. When you reach Level 6, your investments generate interest, income, and appreciation for you to sustain yourself.These people rely on either a sizable investment portfolio that generates interest or a real estate investment that generates rental income.As you progress through the levels of financial freedom, you'll need to work hard. In this case, you might need to adhere to a strict budget and invest more money. The more time you have after financial independence, the better your chances are.7. Abundant Wealth""Every $1 invested today is worth hours, if not days, of your freedom in the future,"" Sabatier writes. By investing $1 every day throughout the year, you would not just have $365. Sabatier understood that investing your money is the only way to regain control of your finances once he got broke and retired early (all within five years).


Level 6 might have allowed your lifestyle to be sustained by investments. In order to maintain a smooth day, you monitor your peaks and dips carefully.Once you've reached level 7, you no longer have to worry about finances, and you have more money than you could ever need. The fruits of your labor are at your fingertips, so you can pursue your passions without feeling stressed.However, how do you manage to pay for the daily necessities? You won't go broke if you stick to the retirement rule of 4% each month from your investment portfolio.ConclusionIf you are willing to work hard and make smart financial decisions, Sabatier says you can achieve financial freedom. Financial Freedom and The Financial Freedom Course, both of which Sabatier provides online, are two tools that he provides for people seeking financial freedom.To move up the 7 levels of financial freedom, follow these tips:Set financial goals. With your money, what are you hoping to accomplish? Is it your goal to retire early? Would you like to purchase a home? Are you ready to travel the world? By identifying your goals, you will be able to develop a plan to reach them.Create a budget. Every month, you should prepare a budget for how you will spend your money. Saving money for your goals can be achieved by tracking your spending and identifying areas for saving.Pay off debt. In order to achieve financial freedom, debt is a major obstacle. By paying off your debt sooner, you can save and invest more money.Invest for the future. For a successful retirement, you need to start investing early and regularly. As your money grows, you can benefit from compound interest.Live below your means. Living below your means is one of the best ways to achieve financial freedom. You need to spend less money than you earn in order to achieve this.Be patient and persistent. In order to achieve financial freedom, you must put in time and effort. If you don't see results right away, don't get discouraged. As long as you keep working toward your goals, you'll eventually achieve them.FAQsWhat is financial independence?As the name implies, financial independence is defined as being able to maintain one's lifestyle without relying on active employment or traditional jobs to support themselves.Why is financial independence important?There are a number of reasons why financial independence is important. It can provide you with:Peace of mind. You can enjoy life without worrying about money when you know you have enough to support yourself. As a result, you will feel happier and more relaxed.Freedom. When you're financially independent, you're free to decide what you want to do with your life. To make ends meet, you don't have to work a job you don't enjoy. It's also possible to follow your passions and live a life you're passionate about.Security. You can avoid financial hardship if you are financially independent. You won't have to worry about paying for unexpected expenses if you lose your job or get sick.Opportunities. You can discover new opportunities when you are financially independent. There are many things you can do, such as starting your own business, traveling the world, or volunteering to support causes that are important to you.How can I achieve financial independence?To become financially independent, you must save and invest wisely, reduce debt, live within your means, and create passive income sources. In order to achieve this, careful financial planning and disciplined money management are often required.


How much money do I need to be financially independent?Depending on your situation, you need a certain amount to be financially independent. You should consider your current expenses, your desired retirement lifestyle, and your risk tolerance.In general, however, in order to be financially independent, you need 25 times your annual expenses saved. Known as the ""4% rule,"" this allows you to withdraw 4% of your savings each year without running out of money over the course of a 30-year retirement.If, for instance, you spend $50,000 a year, then you need $1.25 million saved to become financially independent. It may be necessary to save more if you intend to retire early or live a more luxurious lifestyle.You can calculate your financial independence by using the following tips:Track your expenses. For an accurate estimate of how much you spend each year, you should track your expenses for at least three months. To keep track of your spending, you can use an app or spreadsheet.Set retirement goals. Your retirement goals can be established once you know how much you need to spend each year. If you were to retire today, how much would you like to spend each year? Would you like to travel? Are you considering buying a second home?Consider your risk tolerance. Withdrawing more or less money each year is up to you; the 4% rule is a conservative guideline. Stick to the 4% rule if you're risk-averse. Depending on your comfort level with risk, you may be able to withdraw more money each year.Get professional help. A financial advisor can help you determine how much money you need to become financially independent. Financial advisors can assist you in assessing your finances and creating a plan to achieve financial independence.The journey to financial independence is more important than the destination. Time, effort, and discipline are required. However, if you're willing to work hard, you can achieve financial independence.Is financial independence the same as retirement?In some cases, financial independence leads to retirement, but not always. When you achieve financial independence, you no longer need a traditional job in order to sustain your desired lifestyle. In retirement, you step away from full-time employment.The post The 7 Stages of Financial Independence appeared first on Due.

DankoListed as a bestseller by The New York Times, this book is the result of a study by the two authors on American millionaires.According to the authors, two groups of people have different behavior: underaccumulators (UAWs) and prodigious accumulators (PAWs). According to their research, millionaires are disproportionately clustered in middle-class and blue-collar neighborhoods rather than in more affluent or white-collar neighborhoods.

It is possible to save money and achieve your long-term goals through mortgage refinancing. Taking advantage of favorable market conditions and understanding the refinancing process is an effective way to potentially save thousands of dollars.As you read this guide, you will discover the steps involved in refinancing your mortgage, explore the benefits and considerations, and get practical tips to ensure a successful refinance.Understanding Mortgage RefinancingWhat is mortgage refinancing?When you refinance your mortgage, you replace your existing loan with a new loan that has different terms and conditions. There may be a lower interest rate, a longer loan term, or a modified repayment schedule with the new loan.



In general, refinancing a mortgage is the same as getting a new mortgage. A lender will require documentation of your income and assets, as well as a credit check. Your old mortgage will be paid off by the lender if you are approved for a new loan.If you're considering refinancing your mortgage, keep these things in mind:In order to obtain a new loan, you must pay closing costs. You should factor in these costs when making your decision, as they can be several thousand dollars.Secondly, you should make sure that the new interest rate is lower than your current one in order to save money.Last but not least, you will need to think about the term of the new loan. A shorter term will increase your monthly payments, but you will pay less interest over time.Individual circumstances determine whether refinancing makes sense for you. You may be able to save money by refinancing if you have a high-interest rate on your current loan. A refinance may not make sense if you have a low-interest rate or plan on staying in your home for a short period of time.Why should you consider refinancing?As the name implies, refinancing involves replacing an existing loan or mortgage with one that has better terms and conditions. If you are considering refinancing, there are several reasons for doing so:Lower interest rates.You may be able to lower your interest rate by refinancing if market rates have dropped. This may reduce your mortgage payment and save you money over the loan's term.Reduced monthly payments.When you refinance, you can extend the repayment period of your loan, which can help you lower your monthly payments. You can free up cash flow by spreading out payments over a longer duration, thereby reducing the cost per month.Shorter loan term.In contrast, refinancing can also shorten your loan term. Paying off your debt faster and saving on interest payments can be achieved by opting for a shorter loan term.


Debt consolidation.A refinance can be an effective way to consolidate credit cards or personal loans if you have multiple high-interest debts. You can simplify your finances and reduce your overall interest expenses by combining your debts into one loan with a lower interest rate.Changing loan types.Usually, refinancing allows borrowers to convert their adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to fixed-rate mortgages. In the event that you are interested in a fixed-rate mortgage after having an ARM, you can refinance to a fixed-rate mortgage. Conversely, if you anticipate a decrease in interest rates in the future, you might consider refinancing into a hybrid mortgage.Change in financial situation.Taking advantage of better terms can be possible if your financial circumstances have changed since you first obtained your loan. You may be able to qualify for a loan with more favorable conditions if your credit score or income improves.Access to home equity.Homeowners with equity can tap into their equity through refinancing and access cash for various reasons. A cash-out refinance involves borrowing more than your current mortgage balance and receiving the difference as a lump sum.Consider the associated costs, such as closing costs and fees, before you decide to refinance. And determine whether the potential benefits outweigh them. A mortgage expert or financial professional can also provide you with advice based on your specific situation.When is the right time to refinance?Your individual circumstances and financial situation will determine the appropriate time to refinance. There are, however, a few general considerations to keep in mind:Current mortgage rates. Your current mortgage rate may be lower than your current mortgage rates. However, refinancing may not be a good option if rates are higher.Your financial situation. The interest rate on your current mortgage may be lower if your financial situation has improved since you took it out. In the long run, you could save money.Refinancing costs. In general, closing costs range from 2% to 5% of the loan principal. You could pay $4,000 to $10,000 in closing costs for a $200,000 mortgage refinance. These costs should be considered when refinancing.Your future plans. It may not be worth refinancing if you plan to sell your home soon. It is likely that closing costs will outweigh any savings.In these specific cases, refinancing may make sense:The interest rate is high. Refinancing your mortgage could save you a lot of money if you have a high-interest rate.Your mortgage has a variable rate. It is possible to lock in your interest rate by refinancing to a fixed-rate mortgage.You'd like to shorten your loan. Short-term loans could save you money if you want to pay off your mortgage sooner.You want to access your equity. A cash-out refinance can provide you with cash if you need it. You will gain access to equity in your home, but your monthly payments will also go up.Ultimately, refinancing is a personal decision. To choose what's right for you, weigh the pros and cons carefully.Factors to consider before refinancing.To determine whether refinancing your loan is the right decision for you, consider several factors. A few key factors to consider:The rate you're paying now. In order to save on your monthly payments, you must factor in this factor. Even a small reduction in interest rates can result in significant savings over the loan's life.Refinancing costs. When refinancing, closing costs must be taken into account. Depending on your new loan terms and the lender, refinancing costs may vary.Estimated savings. If you refinance, determine how much you'll save. You can use this to determine whether refinancing is worth the cost.Your future plans. Refinancing may not make sense if you're planning on selling your home soon. In addition to the closing costs, you may not save enough money on your monthly payments to offset them.Your credit score. Before refinancing, you should improve your credit score to get a better interest rate.Employment status and income. It's also important to consider your income and employment status. A refinance may not be possible if you've lost your job or your income has decreased.State laws. Mortgage refinance laws vary by state. Before you start the refinancing process, check your state's laws.You should compare mortgage rates from several lenders before refinancing. It is also important to understand the closing costs and the savings you can expect.


The Refinancing ProcessLike your original mortgage application, refinancing follows a similar process. An assessment of your financial situation will be conducted by the lender. This section explains the refinancing process in more detail.Identify your goals.Defining your objectives is the first step of the process. Would you like to lower your monthly payment, lower your interest rate, shorten the term, or cash out some of your equity?Then you can shop around for lenders based on your goals.Review your current loan.Take a look at your current loan. The interest rate, remainder balance, and repayment terms are included.You should also consider any fees or penalties associated with early repayment.Check your credit score.When refinancing, lenders consider your credit score. Having a low credit score may result in lower rates. Conversely, if your credit score has improved since you took out the original loan, you may qualify for better refinancing terms.Make sure your credit report is accurate by requesting a free copy at AnnualCreditReport.com.Research lenders and loan options.Always get quotes from different lenders and compare them. Rates should be competitive, terms aligned with your goals, and closing costs should be low.It is also important to factor in traditional financial institutions like banks and credit unions, in addition to online lenders.Obtain all necessary documents.Get the required documentation ready. These documents may include proof of income (pay stubs, tax returns), bank statements, proof of homeowners insurance, and others.


The application process can be sped up by preparing these in advance.Apply for refinancing.Your application should be submitted to the lender of your choice. It is important that you provide accurate and detailed information about your financial situation and the property that is being refinanced.During this stage, an application fee may be required.Appraisal and underwriting.To determine the property's current value, the lender will order an appraisal. Your application is evaluated by the lender, your financial information is reviewed, and the risk associated with refinancing is assessed.It is important to know this since you will be able to borrow based on the appraised value. It usually takes a few days or even a few weeks for this process to be completed.Loan approval and closing.Once your application has been approved, you will receive a loan offer that outlines the terms and conditions of the loan. Pay close attention to the terms of the offer, including the interest rate, the closing costs, and any potential penalties for prepayment.Sign the closing documents if you're satisfied.Pay off the existing loan.After the new loan is approved, the existing loan will be paid off with the funds from the new loan. Until the refinancing process is complete, make sure you keep making payments on your current loan.Start repaying the new loan.As per the loan terms, start making payments on the new loan. Be sure to keep track of the new loan's details, including the repayment schedule and any changes to the interest rate.Depending on what kind of loan you're refinancing and which lender you choose, the refinancing process can vary. To make sure refinancing aligns with your long-term financial goals, it's important to carefully review the terms and costs.


Benefits of Mortgage Refinancing.When you refinance your house, you replace your existing mortgage with a new one, usually to get a lower interest rate. Although refinancing has its benefits, it can also have its downsides.In this section, we'll discuss the advantages and disadvantages of refinancing your home.Pros:Lower interest rates. Generally, this is the reason people refinance their homes. By refinancing, you could save a significant amount of money if interest rates have declined since you took out your original loan.Pay less each month. By extending the term of your loan, you may be able to lower your monthly payments even if you don't get a lower interest rate.Reduced loan term. Lower interest rates may allow you to shorten your loan term and pay off your mortgage more quickly. In the long run, you will save money on interest.You can lock in your interest rate. A fixed interest rate mortgage (FIRM) is often preferred by borrowers who have adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). Refinancing your current loan can result in a lower fixed rate when an interest rate adjustment period is approaching.Get rid of private mortgage insurance (PMI). When your down payment is less than 20% of the purchase price of your home, your lender will require you to purchase PMI. In some cases, you can refinance and eliminate PMI if you've built up enough equity in your home.Access to cash. Refinancing can help you get cash out of your home if you've built up equity. You can use this to pay for college tuition, home improvements, or debt consolidation.Cons:Costs associated with closing. Refinances usually involves closing costs, including fees for applications, appraisals, title searches, and other services. These costs may outweigh the benefits of refinancing. To determine if refinancing makes sense from a financial standpoint, it is important to take the break-even point into account.An extended loan term. If you refinance to reduce your monthly payment, the loan term may be extended. Despite lowering your immediate payment, you may end up paying more interest over time.The clock has been reset. A refinance means starting over with a new mortgage, regardless of how long you've paid down your current mortgage. As a result, you may have to delay your mortgage-free status until the clock is reset on your loan repayment.Requirements for credit approval. It is necessary to meet certain income and credit requirements before refinancing. If your financial situation has worsened since you obtained your original mortgage, you may not qualify for favorable terms or a lower interest rate.Penalties for early repayment. If you pay off your mortgage loan early, you may be charged a prepayment penalty. It is imperative to check with your current lender if your current loan carries such penalties since they can make refinancing unfeasible.When refinancing your home, it's important to consider the costs and potential savings and evaluate your specific financial situation. You can get personalized guidance from a mortgage professional.Considerations and Potential Costs Under the right circumstances, refinancing is a smart financial move. A new mortgage with more favorable terms replaces your current one. For example, it has a lower interest rate or different repayment terms. Before refinancing, keep several considerations and possible costs in mind.ConsiderationsYour current interest rate. Refinancing is all about the current interest rate. You will save money over the life of the loan if you get a lower mortgage interest rate.The length of your current mortgage. Refinancing your long-term mortgage into a shorter term may save you money. The reason? Over time, you will pay less interest.Your credit score. The interest rate on a new mortgage will be based on your credit score. You're more likely to get a lower rate with a good credit score.Your future plans. Refinancing may not be worth it if you plan to move soon. If you buy a new home, you will have to pay closing costs again.Potential CostsClosing costs. Mortgage refinancing costs are called closing costs. Among them are appraisal fees, title insurance fees, and origination fees. Typical closing costs for refinances are $5,000.Loan origination fee. Lenders charge this fee to process loans. An average lender fee can be between 1% and 2% of the loan amount.Appraisal fee. Appraisers charge this fee to determine your home's value. Single-family home appraisals typically range from $300 to $450, though this can vary depending on the size of the home, its value, its condition, and its level of detail. It will usually cost more to appraise a large property. It may cost $500 to $800 or more in larger cities and areas with higher living costs.Title insurance. You can use this policy to protect yourself from title problems. Costs typically range from 0.5% to 1%.Recording fees. A county charges these fees to record your new mortgage. At closing, homebuyers pay an average of $125 for recording fees.Prepayment penalty. In some mortgages, if you pay off your loan early, you will be charged a prepayment penalty. You should check your current mortgage to see if there is a prepayment penalty before refinancing.Interest rate. You will pay more interest over the loan's life if you receive a higher interest rate. If you're thinking of refinancing, compare interest rates.Tax implications. Refinancing your mortgage may have tax implications. Cash-out refinances, for instance, may have tax consequences.You can reduce your monthly payment or shorten your loan term by refinancing your mortgage. However, you should consider all the factors involved before refinancing. There may be tax implications and high closing costs. Whenever you are considering refinancing, compare rates from different lenders.Tips for a Successful Refinancing ExperienceWant a successful refinancing experience? Here are some tips to keep in mind.Improve your credit score before applying.Interest rates are heavily influenced by your credit score. Knowing your credit score is essential when applying for loans. Every year, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion offer free copies of your credit report. You can also check your credit score for free at annualcreditreport.com.Low credit scores may prevent you from getting the best rates. In this case, you can improve your credit score by:Pay bills on time. Your credit score is determined by your payment history. Pay all bills on time, including credit cards and loans. Using automatic payments or reminders can help you stay on top of your payments.Reduce credit card balances. Your credit utilization ratio can be negatively affected by high credit card balances. Make sure your credit card utilization is below 30%.Strategically pay off debt. The highest interest rate or smallest balance debts should be paid off first if you have multiple debts. Managing your debt responsibly will improve your credit utilization ratio.Don't open new credit accounts. You may temporarily lower your credit score if you open multiple new credit accounts in a short time. Don't apply for new credit cards or loans until after you've refinanced.Diversify your credit. Your credit score can be positively impacted by a healthy mix of credit accounts. Be careful not to open new accounts solely for this purpose.Keep old accounts open. If you close old credit cards, your credit history may shorten and your available credit will be reduced. Keeping old, no-fee accounts open is generally a good idea — even if you don't use them much.Limit credit inquiries. Your credit report generates a hard inquiry when you apply for new credit. You can lower your credit score by making multiple hard inquiries. During refinancing, minimize unnecessary credit applications.Shop around and compare multiple lenders.Make sure you don't stick with one lender. In other words, shop around and compare multiple refinancing offers. Don't just focus on interest rates; consider closing costs and loan terms. By collecting multiple quotes, you can make a more informed decision.Ideally, you should compare rates and terms from three different lenders.


Negotiate closing costs and fees.When refinancing, here are some tips on negotiating closing costs:Do your research. Negotiating closing costs begins with understanding what closing costs are and which are negotiable. Loan Estimates, which are required of you by lenders before you close, include this information.Get quotes from multiple lenders. After determining what closing costs are negotiable, start comparing lenders' quotes. You'll get a good idea of how much you'll save by doing this.Be prepared to walk away. Don't let a lender trick you into paying closing costs or fees you don't want. It's not necessary to settle for a bad deal when there are other lenders.Be polite and professional. Professionalism and politeness are key when negotiating. Keep in mind that the lender is trying to make a sale, so don't burn bridges.Ask for a discount or waiver. Ask your lender for a discount or waiver if you don't like the closing costs or fees. If you're refinancing with the same lender or have a good credit score, explain why you deserve a discount.Consider other options. In the event you cannot negotiate a lower closing cost, you have other options. A no-closing-cost refinance or asking the seller to contribute to closing costs are examples.Understand the terms and conditions of your new loan.Again, refinancing your mortgage is like borrowing money to pay off your old loan. As a result, you will be agreeing to new terms. Before you sign, make sure you understand these terms and conditions.Terms and conditions that are important to understand include:Interest rate. Your monthly mortgage payment is determined by this factor. Lower interest rates mean lower monthly payments.Loan term. This is how long it will take to repay your loan. Generally, the longer the loan term, the lower the monthly payment, but you will pay more interest.Closing costs. You will incur these fees if you refinance your mortgage. You can expect closing costs to vary depending on the lender.Prepayment penalty. If you pay your loan off early, you may have to pay a prepayment penalty.Early withdrawal penalty. Early withdrawal penalties apply to some loans, like home equity lines of credit (HELOC).Also, it is important to understand the terms and conditions of your escrow account. In your escrow account, you pay your property taxes and homeowners insurance. Whenever you refinance, you'll need a new escrow account. Monthly escrow payments will be determined by the lender.Understanding your new loan's terms and conditions will help you decide if refinancing is right for you. Refinancing can reduce your interest rate and lower your monthly payment. In some cases, though, refinancing is not worth it if the closing costs are too high.Consider working with a mortgage broker.When refinancing your mortgage, you should work with a mortgage broker. Mortgage brokers can compare rates and fees from multiple lenders because they have access to a variety of lenders. You can also get assistance with paperwork and applications.Working with a mortgage broker has the following benefits:Access to multiple lenders. Mortgage brokers can compare multiple lenders' rates and fees because they have access to a wide range of lenders. You can find the best refinance deal this way.Expertise. Brokers are mortgage industry experts. Their expertise can help you understand how refinances work. The paperwork and application process can also be handled by them.Time-saving. By comparing rates and fees for you, mortgage brokers can save you time. If you're not familiar with mortgages, this can be helpful.Using a mortgage broker has some potential drawbacks, however:Fees. Brokers usually charge a fee. Fees can vary depending on the broker and refinance type.Length of time. Using a mortgage broker takes longer than refinancing directly with the lender. Since the broker has to shop around for lenders, they compare rates and fees.Refinancing with a broker may save you money overall. Nevertheless, you should compare rates and fees from multiple lenders, including mortgage brokers.Before you work with a broker, ask them these questions:


What fees do you charge?What are your qualifications?Which refinance options do you offer?What is the average refinancing time?Do you have any references?Your mortgage broker should be able to help you get the best deal on your refinance by asking these questions.Avoid taking on new debts before or during the refinancing process.Before or during the refinancing process, avoid taking on new debt. Why? A refinance will consider your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). The higher your DTI, the higher your mortgage payments. Also, you may not qualify for the lowest interest rate if you take on new debt before refinancing.The following reasons explain why you should avoid taking on new debt before or during refinancing:You may have trouble qualifying for a refinance if your debt-to-income ratio increases.This could lower your credit score, which could make refinancing harder.After refinancing, your monthly payments could go up, making it harder to afford your mortgage.In short, consider the pros and cons carefully before taking on new debt. Taking on new debt can hurt your chances of qualifying for a refinance, so make sure you can afford the payments.To avoid taking on new debt during or before refinancing, follow these tips:Set a budget and stick to it. Keep track of your spending and don't go overboard.Reduce your debt. Refinancing will be easier when your debt-to-income ratio is lower.Keep impulse purchases to a minimum. Buying something on credit is probably out of your reach if you can't pay cash for it.Don't rush. You shouldn't refinance right now unless you're in a better financial position.ConclusionRefinancing your mortgage is one of the smartest financial moves you can make over time to save yourself thousands of dollars in interest. The best way to take advantage of this opportunity is to carefully consider your goals, understand the process, and make the most of the favorable market conditions.Prior to making a decision, make sure to assess your financial situation, compare lenders, and weigh the costs and benefits. Using the right strategy and well-executed plan, you can refinance and save thousands on your mortgage.FAQsWhat is refinancing?A refinance is when you take out a new mortgage to replace your old one. It can be done to get a lower rate, a shorter term, or a cash-out.When is it a good time to refinance?Refinancing isn't for everyone, but here are some things to think about. Among them:The current interest rate. It's possible to save money by refinancing your mortgage if interest rates have fallen.The balance of your mortgage right now. You may qualify for a shorter term or a lower interest rate if you have lots of equity in your home.Closing costs. It can be expensive to refinance thanks to closing costs. It is common for closing costs to include appraisals, credit reports, origination fees, title insurance, and recording fees. As such, make sure the savings from a lower interest rate outweigh the closing costs.Your financial situation. You're more likely to get a good refinance rate if you have a stable income and good credit.What are the different types of refinancing?You can refinance in a few different ways, each with its own pros and cons. They include:


Rate and term refinancing. Most refinances are like this. Your mortgage will go down and/or you'll get a shorter term.Cash-out refinancing.

For a specified period of time, you only have to pay interest on your mortgage. If you get a short-term loan, you'll save money. If you get a long-term loan, you'll have to pay back the principal.How long does it take to refinance my home?Your lender and refinance type will affect how long it takes to refinance. However, it usually takes 30 to 45 days.Is refinancing right for me?Refinancing might be right for you, but there are a few things you need to know first.

100,When Should You Take Out a Personal Loan?,"Aug 23, 2023",Eric Rosenberg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/when-should-you-take-out-a-personal-loan/457920,"
A personal loan is a lump sum of money you can borrow from a financial institution and slowly repay with regular monthly payments plus interest. Most banks, credit unions, and online lenders offer different personal loans that can be used for almost anything. People use personal loans to pay for overdue hospital bills, emergency repairs after an accident, and happier occasions like extravagant vacations or home renovations. But there are certain things you usually can't take out personal loans for and certain things that may disqualify you. In this article, we'll attempt to answer the question, when should you take out a personal loan? Spoiler: the answer will depend on you and your finances, but there are general things everyone should know before applying for one of these types of loans. Key Takeaways



You can take out a personal loan for almost any reason, but loan consolidation is one of the most popular. Loan consolidation is most financially beneficial when your new APR is lower than the APR you were paying on existing debt. Having bad credit may disqualify you from taking out a personal loan, but you may be able to obtain one without exorbitant interest rates if you have a co-signer or agree to a secured loan. Check to make sure you can afford the monthly payment and any credit check and origination fees. Don't agree to a loan you won't be able to pay back each month. What is a Personal Loan? A personal loan is a lump sum of money you receive from a financial institution and agree to pay back in monthly chunks with interest. Most personal loans are unsecured, meaning you don't have to add collateral to your loan agreement. A secured loan, like a mortgage or auto loan, comes with collateral the lender can take if you don't make payments. Some of the most common reasons people take out personal loans include paying for medical debt, car repairs, home renovations, dream vacations, unexpected accidents, and weddings. A personal loan is usually very flexible with what it can be spent on, though there are exceptions. 


Many lenders will not allow you to use a personal loan on business expenses. Similarly, some lenders won't allow you to spend your loan on college tuition. This is because the U.S. government has certain requirements for lenders loaning money to people for those purposes, and some lenders prefer to circumvent those restrictions. You are usually also precluded from using a personal loan on a down payment for a house. This is because of lending requirements set by the FHA and conventional mortgage lenders. For most other purposes, though, a personal loan can be a tool to get that extra bit of financing you need to afford something. What Should I Do Before Applying for a Personal Loan? The two things you should absolutely do before applying for a personal loan are check your credit report and check your finances. Lenders will run a credit check and gauge your debt-to-income ratio before offering you a loan. If you've had an unstable employment history or bad credit, there's a possibility you'll be rejected for a personal loan. It's therefore important to check your credit and dispute anything you think is inaccurate. After that, check to make sure you can actually afford to take out a loan. Understanding the repayment schedule is important before agreeing to a loan. Also, factor in any origination fees and credit check fees the lender may charge. 


As you research and prepare to inquire into different personal loans, remember that when lenders run hard inquiries into your credit history, it can ding your credit score. However, if you do your rate shopping within a 45-day period, multiple credit inquiries will be grouped together as a single inquiry and only impact your score once. The Steps to Applying for a Personal LoanLet's break down the steps for applying for a personal loan, from initial planning to actually receiving the money. Research Once you've determined that you need a loan, start researching different online lenders, credit unions, and traditional banks to see what kind of loan you could get. Try to identify the following things when assessing an offer: fees, interest rates, collateral requirements, and spending requirements (can you use the money for business expenses, for example).Don't be afraid to reject some options. You should have more than one option, especially if you have fair or good credit. 


If you've had an account open at one bank for a significant amount of time, consider going to them first to inquire about personal loans. They may offer you better rates if you have a good spending history with them. Applying/Assembling Documents Now that you've selected a loan option you'd like, you'll need to apply. The application process will be different for every lender and may require you to go in person to a bank branch or credit union. You'll need to provide documentation showing proof of income, place of residence, and legal ID. You'll also need to explain what you intend to use the loan for. Once you've given your lender everything they request, they'll consider your application and choose to approve or reject you. At that point, you can consider their offer and the loan terms and then (if you choose) finalize your paperwork. Receiving the Funds Once you've done the final paperwork, you can expect to receive your funds within five to seven business days. Sometimes a lending institution can give you same-day funds, though it's not guaranteed everywhere. Paying Back A Personal Loan You should expect to make regular, monthly payments to your lender with interest after taking out a personal loan. Interest rates for personal loans can vary widely. Some lenders will make loans with interest rates as low as 6%, while others can go above 30%. It will largely depend on your creditworthiness and debt profile. 


If you're someone with bad credit who's interested in taking out a personal loan but aren't in a rush, it might be worth delaying taking out your loan and trying to build up your credit instead. Having good credit will allow you to earn a better interest rate and can keep you from needing a co-signer or collateral as part of your loan agreement.    Who Should Take Out Personal Loan? Any adult can take out a personal loan, but of course, it's better to never have to take out loans. Interest can be expensive in the long run, so avoiding it altogether is often a smart financial move. However, it's also true that not all debt is bad debt. Paying off a mortgage, for example, requires you to go through a set number of years in debt, but it's an investment that can turn quite profitable for you down the road. When it comes to gauging whether you should take out a personal loan, consider how important the thing you want to purchase is to you. Are you trying to fund a vacation you've been wanting to take for years but haven't had the money for? While that may not be as essential a reason to take out a personal loan as, say, paying off medical debt, it may be important enough to you to take the risk.If you're young and unsure how you should divide your paycheck, consider the 50/30/20 rule, which suggests you should spend 50% of your paycheck on essential purchases, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings. Sometimes a lack of finances can be solved by better budgeting and money management before turning to loans. 


FAQsWhat is loan consolidation? Some people take out personal loans to consolidate debt. This involves paying off existing debts using money borrowed from a different lender, who is hopefully giving you a lower APR than your existing debt. By consolidating debt, you can save money over time by paying less in interest to lenders. Do I need collateral to get a personal loan? No. Most personal loans are unsecured and therefore do not require collateral. If you have bad credit, though, looking for a personal loan that is secured may be an opportunity for you to secure a more competitive interest rate. How quickly will funds to distributed once I've been approved? Once you've completed your final paperwork, you should receive your funds within a week, though you should talk to your specific lender to better understand the timeline. What can I not use a personal loan for? Some lenders don't allow you to spend money from a personal loan on education, a down payment on a house, or business expenses. Look at your specific loan terms and speak to your lender to make sure you'll be using the money you're lent in an acceptable way. 


The Bottom Line Personal loans can be used for many different things, but you should only take one out if you're confident you can pay the required monthly amount and any associated fees. Having good credit will typically give you a better interest rate on your personal loan. Be sure to shop around for different rates before deciding on a loan to take out.

101,10 of the Best Low-Risk and High Return Investments Right Now (2023 and Beyond),"Aug 22, 2023",Jeff Rose,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/10-of-the-best-low-risk-and-high-return-investments-right/457855,"
Not to fearmonger. But, the U.S. could be headed for a recession in 2023 due to high inflation and an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. Thankfully, by having some less-risky assets in your portfolio, you can help weather market volatility.While lower risk exposure reduces investment returns over time, the tradeoff is lower returns. If you're aiming to preserve capital and generate regular interest income, that might be fine.However, what if your goal is long-term growth? Should you consider investment strategies that match those goals? Then you're in luck. Stocks, for instance, can have segments (such as dividend stocks) that provide high long-term returns while reducing relative risk.



So let's dive into the 10 best low-risk and high-return investments for 2023 and beyond.1. High Yield Savings AccountTo begin with, we need to cover the safest option first; high-yield savings accounts.As you may already know, a high-yield savings account is an insured savings account under the federal government. There is a higher interest rate on these accounts than the national average — which makes them appealing to many people.Most of these accounts earn between 0.40% and 0.50% annual percentage yield. The annual percentage yield paid by some banks is between and based on aggregate account balances. In comparison, Bankrate's June 7 survey of institutions shows an average yield of 0.25 percent APY for savings accounts.


A high-yield savings account doesn't offer all that much excitement, but it does offer a significant rate. On top of that, you won't need to put in any extra effort to increase your balance Besides, you can easily open an account online with Chime, Marcus, Alliant, Discover, or Varo.As an example, let's say you are able to open an account at 0.50% APY. With $10,000 in your account, you can earn around $50 per year. Even if you don't make billions with this account, it's much better than the five dollars you'd make with a 0.25% APY2. Certificate of DepositIf you search hard enough, you will not find a more boring investment than a Certificate of Deposit. The purpose of a Certificate of Deposit (CD) is to deposit your money for a specific period of time — usually between 3 months and five years. If you exchange your money for a guaranteed return, you will get it regardless of any interest rate changes.Make sure you buy your CD from an FDIC-insured financial institution (up to $250k is protected). In general, the longer the CD's duration, the higher the interest rate.The 11-month No Penalty CD from CIT Bank is a good choice for a quick low-risk turnaround with 4.15%.3. Short-term BondsA short-term bond fund invests in securities that mature in a year to three years. Besides commercial papers and CDs, they invest in long-term securities and government bonds.In addition to the government issuing short-term debt (bonds), investment corporations and companies rated below investment grade can also issue short-term debt (bonds). It is also possible to purchase bonds for dividends or growth.Why are short-term bonds so popular? Bonds with a short maturity date have a lower interest rate risk than those with a long maturity date. This makes short-term bonds less sensitive to market fluctuations.


Additionally, they have higher yields than money market funds, ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%+.Just be aware that investing in short-term bond funds can lead to the loss of principal for investors. Similarly, corporate bond funds aren't government-insured.4. Series I Savings BondsUnlike other savings bonds, Series I savings bonds are issued by the government and backed by it. Normally, they pay interest every month. Inflation-based interest rates are calculated twice a year and combine a fixed interest rate with a variable interest rate.The interest rate is 4.30% until October 2023. Even though you can cash in savings bonds as early as one year after purchasing them, they continue to earn interest for 30 years. Cashing them in before their expiration date will incur an interest penalty of three months.5. Dividend StocksA dividend stock is an investment in a company that pays its shareholders a regular dividend. Typically, a dividend is paid quarterly, but can also be paid semiannually or annually. A dividend yield is a ratio of the dividend amount to the price of the stock, expressed as a percentage.Investing in dividend stocks may also enhance the stability of your portfolio since dividend-paying companies are likely to be well-established. As a result, they're considered low-risk investments.A good example is Texas Instruments, which made the calculator you used in high school. Most of the company's revenue now comes from semiconductor manufacturing. In terms of analog chips, it is the world's biggest manufacturer, notes Cory Mitchell in Forbes.


The Morningstar rating for TXN's financial health is ""A"". Over the next five years, it is expected to grow EPS by 10% a year. Over the last five years, the company has steadily increased its dividend amount by 14.9%.6. AnnuitiesSome investors are concerned about annuities because they were over-marketed to them by shady financial advisors who didn't understand what they were buying.However, they do not have to be frightening. In fact, annuities are a good option for investors whose portfolios need long-term stabilization.Be aware of the risks of annuities, however, and speak with a good financial advisor before making a decision.Why? In addition to being complex financial instruments, annuities have a lot of catch-up clauses. So, the most important thing you need to know about your annuity is how it works.Although there are several types of annuities, purchasing one is the same as negotiating with an insurance company. You are being charged a lump sum of money.In exchange, they promise a stated return rate. Depending on your annuity, your return might be fixed (with a fixed annuity), variable (with a variable annuity), or equity-indexed (with an equity-indexed annuity).The risk is greatly reduced if you're getting a guaranteed return. You are not protected by the Federal government when you acquire an annuity. Instead, you are protected by the insurance company that holds the annuity (perhaps by another company that further insurers the annuity company). These complicated products are generally very safe for your money, however.


My recommendation is to purchase a fixed annuity, such as Due, where you'll get 3% a month.7. Real EstatePeople tend to view investing in real estate as a high-risk venture. That's fair enough. You must deal with tenants, handle repairs, manage payments, or learn by trial and error how to invest in real estate.However, there are low-risk options as well. As an example, you can purchase Real Estate Investment Trusts through ETFs.The one option I've loved over the years because it's easy, simple, and has returned good money to me is Fundrise.Fundrise is an online platform for crowdfunding Real Estate Investment Trusts. The Fundrise team takes care of your money while you sit back and watch it grow.In addition, Fundrise lets you start a well-diversified portfolio of commercial, condos, single-family homes, and multi-family properties for as little as $10.8. Money Market FundsMoney market accounts are mutual funds designed to protect your principal from losing value. In addition to paying interest, the fund tries to make parking your cash worthwhile by offering a little bit of return on investment as well. Generally, funds are aimed at maintaining a $1 per share Net Asset Value (NAV).There's no guarantee these funds will work. Nevertheless, they have a solid pedigree when it comes to protecting your money.


In rare cases, the NAV can fall below $1. In a money market fund, where can you park your cash? You can usually do this with a great broker like TD Ameritrade, Ally Invest, and E*T RADE or with the same banks that offer high-interest savings accounts.You may not earn much interest on your investment, but you won't lose much of it or worry about market fluctuations.9. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)A TIPS bond, not a tip you would leave a waiter or waitress, is a type of U.S. Treasury bond specifically designed to protect investors from inflation. At Treasurydirect.gov, you can purchase them in $100 increments with a $100 minimum investment. TIPS can also be purchased through a great broker like Ally Invest or TD Ameritrade.The growth of these bonds can be achieved in two ways. First, there's a fixed interest rate that doesn't change over the bond's lifespan. The second is government-guaranteed inflation protection.As an example, you may want to invest in TIPS today, which offers 0.35% interest rates. Compared to certificates of deposit and even basic online savings accounts, that's a lot less.Until you realize your investment value will grow with inflation over the term of the bond and give you a higher return, that doesn't seem very appealing.TIPS can be purchased individually or you can invest in a mutual fund that, in turn, invests in a basket of TIPS. The latter option makes managing your investments easier while the former gives you the ability to pick and choose with specific TIPS you want.10. YourselfInvesting in yourself is another way for you to invest with low risk and high return.The reason? There is no better way to get a high return with very little risk than to invest yourself. As a matter of fact, this is the best investment with the largest potential return.It all starts with investing in your education and enhancing your experiences. By reading financial books, taking online courses, or talking to a financial planner, you can improve your financial literacy.Additionally, it's all about improving yourself mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, or whatever that looks like to you.FAQsWhat are low-risk investments?Low-risk investments are those with little chance of losing money. In general, lower-risk investments offer lower returns. However, investors who are looking to protect their capital tend to consider these investments safer.Are there any low-risk investments that offer high returns?Investing in low-risk items can produce high returns. Among them are:High-yield savings accounts. Compared to traditional savings accounts, these accounts offer higher interest rates.Series I savings bonds. Besides offering a fixed interest rate, the bonds are indexed to inflation and are issued by the U.S. government.Short-term certificates of deposit (CDs). Short-term CDs offer higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts.Money market funds. A short-term debt fund, such as a Treasury bill or commercial paper, invests in bonds for a short term.Treasury bills, notes, bonds, and TIPS. In addition to offering a variety of maturities and interest rates, these securities are issued by the U.S. government.What are the risks of low-risk investments?While low-risk investments are relatively safe, there are still risks involved.

102,25 Things Frugal People Do (That You Aren't Doing and Should!),"Aug 21, 2023",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/25-things-frugal-people-do-that-you-arent-doing-and/457817,"
Frugality is not a dirty word, even though it's gotten a bad rap. Why? There is a misconception that being frugal means being cheap. However, that's not really true.Rather, a frugal person keeps an eye on their spending and does not take on more debt than is necessary. In fact, this is a trait many millionaires possess.According to Thomas Corley, who studied rich people's habits for five years, wealth is built by avoiding lifestyle creep and focusing on frugality. As a result, 64% of the millionaires he interviewed described their homes as modest. All of them owned their homes, and 56% owned them for more than 20 years. Used cars are purchased by more than half, 55%.



In their spare time, they also adhere to this frugal mindset. 96% of respondents indicated they spend less than $6,000 a year on vacation, and 41% spent less than $3,000. Further, 84% said they had never gambled.In order to develop a frugal mindset, you should ask yourself the following question: ""Can I save money here if I put in a little extra effort and/or sacrifice?"". In a world where temptation is all around, having a frugal mindset can be very helpful when it comes to being an American consumer.For help getting started, here are 25 things frugal people do that you might not, but should.1. Admit that you need a budget. There's no way around this. To succeed financially, you must create and stick to a budget.Although budgeting isn't always fun, it is essential to managing money. When you stick to a budget, you can prioritize what matters and ruthlessly eliminate what doesn't. However, almost 30% of Americans fail to budget because they don't see the need for it.While creating a budget may seem complicated, it's actually a fairly straightforward process. Furthermore, once you have one, the bulk of the work is already done, and you can make minor adjustments as you change your spending habits or income. In order to get started, you can use websites and apps that can help you create a budget, or you can make your own spreadsheet.


If you've never created a budget, here's how to get the ball rolling:Find out what your net income is, which is the amount you earn less taxes.List your monthly expenses, like rent or mortgage payments and entertainment.Make a list of your monthly expenses and mark them as fixed or variable. Rent, utilities, transportation, insurance, food, and debt repayment are all fixed expenses. A gym membership, for example, or how much you spend on dining out, are examples of variable expenses.Provide a breakdown of your monthly expenses. Check your bank and credit card statements to see what you've spent.Identify your monthly expenses and net income. You'll need to adjust your budget if your expenses exceed your income.2. Search for deals and discounts.Coupons and sales are always on the radar for frugal people. In addition to comparing prices, they shop during sales seasons and use apps that offer cashback and rewards. In fact, Warren Buffet, Lady Gaga, Suze Orman, and Carmelo Anthony have been known to use coupons.Shopping for groceries? Plan your meals based on what's on sale for the week. For even more savings, you can find coupons on your local grocer's app for everything from frozen veggies to toilet paper.Is it time to change your oil? A digital coupon can be found by doing a quick Google search.Planning to stay at a hotel? Check for ""stay three nights, get one free"" deals.For virtually every product and service, there are discounts and deals available – it's just a matter of finding them and taking advantage of them.3. Rethink your meals.Those who plan meals in advance save time and money by making a shopping list in advance. In addition to reducing food waste, they also avoid impulsive purchases. Also, they save money by cooking more often at home.Why is that last point important? It can be costly to eat out. According to BLS data, Americans eat out 5.9 times a week, and they spend about $3,500 every year on eating out — or just under $300 per month.Don't be afraid to experiment with recipes, use leftovers creatively, or pack a lunch for school or work.4. Keep your home clean for a cheap.There is a perception that a sanitary home must have expensive laundry soap, all-purpose spray cleaners, dishwasher detergent, foaming bathroom cleaner, fabric refresher, and other specialized toilet cleaners. It's no surprise, then, that the average American family of four spends at least $680 per year on cleaning products.A thrifty homemaker knows that vinegar, baking soda, borax, washing soda, and Dawn dish detergent are great household cleaners (or can be used together).


5. Don't be fooled by ""Get Rich Quick"" schemes.Repeat after me. You can't get rich quickly. Wealthy people have realized this.Our friend Thomas Corley found that ""16 percent of the wealthy gamble on sports at least once a week versus 52 percent of the poor."" Additionally, ""9 percent of the wealthy play the lottery every week versus 77 percent of the poor.""In short, don't waste your time trying to amass large amounts of wealth quickly. There is little to no chance of that happening. Instead, make your money work for you by investing it or paying off debt6. Use every drop wisely.Those who are frugal squeeze every last drop of toothpaste and face cream from their products. Additionally, they drain jars of olive oil and maple syrup. In addition, leftover bones can be simmered into stock, and Dijon mustard dregs can be used to make a vinaigrette. For greasing cake pans, they store butter wrappers.7. Purchase used items.A frugal person doesn't always have to buy new items. Their buying habits often involve buying used items, which saves them a lot of money. Online marketplaces, garage sales, and thrift stores are all places where used items can be found.In order to save money, they often check thrift stores, the ReStore, local auctions, consignment stores, and online swap sites like Craigslist and Freecycle before buying anything new. Their default action is not to buy new, but they often wait or purchase the item if they can't find what they want.9. Do-it-yourself (DIY).A frugal person is usually handy and can do most things themselves. It is common for them to fix their own cars, paint their own homes, cut their own hair, or build their own furniture. As a result, they save money on labor costs.10. Understand that time is money.The previous tip may not apply in some cases. Sometimes it is more cost-effective to hire a service rather than do it yourself.It is possible for people to be skilled in different areas. For example, it's time to call the plumber if the leaky faucet has become an unstoppable waterfall.11. Price match.Even though most of us make big purchases once or twice a year, they can eat up a large chunk of our budget and keep us from saving. In the case of car purchases, fridge replacements, home repairs, or family vacations, shopping around will pay off in the end.When it comes time to make a big purchase, frugal people shop around before buying the first thing that meets their immediate needs. You can often find the item you're looking for at a substantial discount when you compare prices and options at different retailers.Comparing prices from multiple sources can help you find coupon codes, discounts, or price matching that will reduce your purchase costs. If the deal doesn't work for you, you can negotiate and be willing to walk away. Taking a stand can save you a lot of money.12. Combine errands.Combining your errands is still essential, even though gas prices have dropped. To save gas, money, and time, I try to hit all the stores in one area at once. For example, if I have to run to the grocery store, I'll also drop off my dry cleaning or pop in for a haircut while I'm out.13. Make friends with like-minded people.Having an overspender in your life will regularly derail one's savings goals faster than anything else. On the flip side, you can stay on track, share tips, and hold each other accountable by finding frugal friends.However, you can also increase your savings capacity by utilizing your friends.Take advantage of group rates. Take advantage of group rates when watching a movie with your friends or going on a vacation with your friends.Shop together for groceries. Buying things in bulk usually saves you a lot of money over buying them individually.Organize potlucks. Instead of going, host a dinner party where everyone brings a dish.Swap possessions. Instead of buying stuff, why not swap it? Consider swapping books or clothes that you no longer use with your friends.Make saving a competition. When it comes to motivating yourself to reach a goal, nothing beats competition.14. Trade services with others.You may have a friend who is passionate about cooking. You might be better off asking them for assistance for a small family event rather than hiring a caterer. Enlist the help of a neighbor if they know how to fix cars or do household chores.


To avoid them feeling used, do them favors as well. In return, offer to watch their kids or do something similar.15. Engage in low- and no-cost hobbies.It's easy to spend an arm and leg when having fun. You can often have just as much fun without spending too much.Frugal people have found ways to reduce entertainment costs. Here are some low- and no-cost hobbies and pastimes you can try:Reading. Visit your local library and check out some books, or download books to your e-reader using your library's free app.Walking. Get your sneakers on and head outside for a walk around the block or a walk through the local park.Listening to podcasts. It doesn't matter what you're interested in, there's a podcast for it.Meditation. For beginners, free apps and YouTube videos offer guided meditations.Playing games. You can play board games and card games over and over again, even if they are expensive at first.Volunteering. Taking part in a volunteer program is a great way to meet new people and help your community at the same time.16. Invest in quality products.A quality item won't need to be replaced as often as a lower-quality item, so I prefer to pay a little bit more for it. In other words, I know the quality brands and prefer them when making a purchase. As a result, I use higher quality brands if I can — even if that means paying full price.Instead of skimping on a mattress, spend a little more on a quality mattress. Choosing the right mattress not only makes you feel refreshed, but it also relieves back neck, and joint pressure.17. Saving on utilities.In order to reduce their utility bills, frugal people actively look for ways to cut costs. As it turns out, according to the U.S. Energy Department, the average family spends nearly $1,400 per year on utilities.The good news? You can reduce your utility bills in a number of ways. The following are some ideas to get you started.Turn off lights when not in useSwitch to compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) and LED bulbsUnplug electronicsSwitch air filters every 60 to 90 daysUse a programmable thermostatUpgrade old appliances to energy-efficient onesSeal air leaks around windows and doors.18. Know when to buy in bulk.I recommend checking the unit price whenever possible. In most cases, you don't get the best value from the smallest container.


As such, buying in bulk can be much cheaper for some items. Paper products would be a good example. In contrast, stockpiling fruits and veggies that will rot isn't such a good idea.19. Reuse, recycle, and upcycle.The concept of extreme frugality can be illustrated by reusing and upcycling items.Plastic resealable baggies should be washed and reused.The foil from one casserole dish can be used for the next one.If you need to store other foods, keep glass jelly jars and plastic yogurt containers on hand.Use the cottage cheese container to grow your own herbs.You should be aware that excessive frugalness can lead to hoarding. You should hang onto items that you will use in the future, but throw them away if you won't use them.20. Never buy a new car.When you buy a used car for cash, you won't have to make a car payment. However, keep an eye on your budget to make sure you have enough money for unexpected repairs and maintenance. Typically, used cars aren't covered for these costs, and older vehicles can be costly.Ultimately, it's a matter of preference. If you had a fixed vehicle cost each month, what would you prefer, a car loan or a lease? Do you prefer occasional car repairs or more frequent ones?It's estimated that new car payments are $716 per month on average! Even with occasional repair costs, driving a used car could save you hundreds per month. If you must buy a new car, opt for a certified pre-owned one.21. Travel on a budget.Traveling frugally is one of my favorite frugal living tips. Why? While saving money, you can also see the world.Make sure you travel during the ""off-season"" and opt for accommodations with a kitchen so you can prepare some of your meals. You can also save hundreds of dollars by purchasing discounted airline tickets or fares. Also, instead of purchasing souvenirs, take pictures.


22. Think about tomorrow.""I'm not out here buying the latest cars. I don't have the biggest house on the block. I have a moderate house on the best block,"" Emmy-nominated actor Anthony Anderson told Kiplinger.com.""My parents always stressed planning for the future,"" Anderson says. ""It's not about the here and now. It's about 30 years from now — be aggressive about funding these various accounts while I'm young, so I'll have money coming in later in life.""In addition to saving money, frugal people invest it well as well. Saving money for retirement, children's education, and other future goals is a priority for them.23. Examine your bank statements.Is counting your calories part of your weight-loss plan? That's a given. Meals would be portioned out and you would log your food. Although it seems like common sense, most people don't apply it to their finances.Keeping an eye on your spending is essential if you are trying to be more frugal. If you print out your statement, you can highlight some of the expenses that stand out.Are there any streaming subscriptions that you haven't used? Get rid of some of them. Do you spend too much money at Starbucks? It's time to cut back.A person who tries to save money and become frugal without considering their spending is like a person who wishes to lose weight without examining their diet.24. Keep your bills to a minimum.It is not possible to negotiate all bills, but you should try to negotiate the ones that you can. If you want your cable bill to be lowered, call your cable provider. or, better yet, switch to a free streaming service.


You should let go of the landline if you primarily use your cellphone. Get a better deal for your cellphone or car insurance by calling and seeing what plans are available. It only takes a few minutes of your time to save money by talking to a helpful agent.25. Do not carry cash or plastic with you.It will be harder for you to spend money on items that you do not really need if you leave your credit card at home and don't have a large amount of cash. In fact, according to U.S. News & World Report, it's been found that ""86 percent of people who spend cash on luxuries like expensive cars, jewelry, and electronics are non-millionaires trying to act the part by purchasing luxury brands.""Take a cue from T. Boone Pickens and follow his example. Carry only the cash you'll need for your specific purchases on a shopping list. By doing so, you avoid adding to your debt. If you can't pay off your credit card or make a purchase without cash, then you probably can't afford it.FAQsWhat is frugality?An individual who is frugal avoids unnecessary spending and is thrifty. In other words, it's about getting the most out of your money.Why is it beneficial to be frugal?Saving money. You can save money by being frugal for your future goals, such as retirement, a house down payment, or a vacation.Reducing debt.

103,Loans 101: A Graduate's Guide to Taking Out and Paying Off Loans,"Aug 15, 2023",Eric Rosenberg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/loans-101-a-graduates-guide-to-taking-out-and-paying/457488,"
Most of us understand the basics of loans already. You need a certain amount of money, so someone lends it to you, and you eventually pay them back with interest attached. However, the process of taking out, consolidating, and repaying loans is much more complicated.In this article, we'll review some of the essential information you should have as a young adult considering taking out a loan. We'll focus on a type of loan you may have already taken out – a student loan – and loans you may need to take out in the future, like a home loan.Key Takeaways



Student loans can be subsidized or unsubsidized. The former means students don't accrue interest on their loans while they're in school and during a six-month grace period. The latter accrues interest throughout the entire life of the debt.The payment pause will come to an end this fall. At that point, students will have to resume making loan payments, unless they see their debt wiped out by Biden's forgiveness policy before then.A secured loan – like a mortgage – carries collateral your lender can seize in the event you don't make your monthly payments.Student Loan BasicsCollege tuition has become increasingly expensive over the years. Recent data has shown average tuition costs for four-year public universities climbing above $25,000 for out-of-state students. Because of this, taking out a student loan may be essential to your attending college.Public LoansThere are two types of student loans you can take out: public or private. A public loan, also referred to as a federal student loan, is taken from the U.S. government, with interest rates set by Congress. Within this category are two additional categories of loans: subsidized and unsubsidized.


A subsidized loan allows you to take out money without owning interest while you're in school and during a six-month grace period after graduating. An unsubsidized loan accrues interest throughout the borrower's time in school. Though they can decide whether to pay it off during or after school, the borrower is fully responsible for the interest payments.Note that only undergraduates qualify for subsidized student loans. If you're a graduate student applying for a federal student loan, it will be unsubsidized. To apply for a federal student loan, you must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).When paying off your public student loan, there are a few things you can do to save money. You can pay off your debt immediately, pay more than the minimum monthly balance, and set up an automatic debit feature, which may marginally lower your interest rate.Remember that the cost of your debt will continue to increase as long as interest is applying, so paying off your student loans faster translates to spending less money overall.


Private LoansPrivate loans can be taken out in a similar way, but you'll go through a private lender rather than the federal government. The private lender will consult your credit report when gauging how much they want to lend you. If you're young and don't have a robust credit report, the private lender may request a co-signer for your loan.Taking out a public loan before a private one is generally advisable since interest rates tend to be lower than the former. However, every person's situation is different, which may not be the case for you. Generally, people take out private loans when the amount of their public loan is insufficient to cover tuition costs.Another benefit of public loans is extra flexibility in the repayment period. If you take out a public loan, there are often options for a graduated repayment plan, meaning the minimum monthly balance starts small and grows over time. Extended repayment is also an option, allowing you more time than the typical 10-year repayment period.Public loans also have the potential for forgiveness, especially if you take a public-service job. Private loans may offer some of these features for repayment, though it's less common. So if you're considering refinancing your public loan (selling it to a private lender), consider that you'll likely lose this flexibility.


Current Events Affecting Your Student Loan RepaymentRecently, many students and graduates have enjoyed not making student loan payments because of ""forbearance,"" the payment pause put into place during the pandemic. That interest-free period, though, will come to an end this fall.Per the latest federal debt ceiling bill guidance, the payment pause will end 60 days after June 30, 2023. That means interest will resume on your accounts starting September 1, so payments will be due again in October of this year.At the same time, President Biden's federal student debt cancelation policy is being debated in the Supreme Court, with a verdict to be announced later in June or July of 2023. It's possible your student loan debt will be canceled entirely because of this policy, but we'll have to wait and see what the Supreme Court decides.Personal Loan BasicsA type of loan you likely haven't encountered yet but may sometime soon is a personal loan. This kind of loan can help you pay for a one-time, large purchase. Some people take out personal loans to pay for home repairs, a useful purchase since it will hopefully raise the value of your home.


Most personal loans are unsecured, meaning any collateral doesn't guarantee them. A secured loan, like an auto loan or mortgage, includes collateral (your car title or house) that allows the lender to have more confidence you'll pay them back. Unsecured loans are riskier for lenders and often carry higher APR rates as a result.Repayment periods for unsecured loans can range from two to seven years – though some people may be offered a repayment plan of up to ten years.Another type of personal loan you can take out is a debt consolidation loan. This type of loan allows you to bundle multiple unsecured debts into one and is useful if the new loan will give you a lower interest rate than those attached to your existing debts.It's generally not advisable to take out a personal loan to pay for a large, discretionary purchase like a vacation, or for emergency expenses. It's often better to build an emergency fund that could cover up to six months' worth of living expenses.


Home Loan BasicsWhen applying for a mortgage as a first-time homebuyer, you'll need certain things ahead of time to be approved. First, you'll need proof of income for a minimum of two years. Lenders will want to see if you can pay the mortgage amount. You'll want to be able to make a down payment of at least 3.5% and have a credit score of 620 or higher.As a first-time homebuyer, getting around one or more of these requirements is possible, though it's generally better if you meet all three.If you can qualify for a conventional home loan, that's ideal. Conventional loans usually carry lower interest rates than loans backed by the government. However, you'll need a higher credit score, lower debt-to-income ratio, and a more significant down payment to qualify.Conventional loans can be divided into two categories: conforming and nonconforming. Conforming loans can be sold on the secondary market and meet specific requirements set by government-sponsored enterprises like Freddie Mac. Nonconforming loans have their guidelines set by the person underwriting the loan, and, therefore, can't be sold on the secondary market.


The more common loan option for first-time homebuyers is a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan. An FHA loan allows for a lower down payment and also requires borrowers to pay a mortgage insurance premium.Fixed- and Floating-Rate MortgagesAnother consideration you'll have to make when getting a home loan is whether you want a fixed- or floating-rate mortgage. The former is a more safe option, as you'll know how much you'll pay toward the loan for the entirety of its existence. If you secure a fixed-rate home loan when rates are low, it will be locked in for the entirety of the loan's lifetime.A floating-rate mortgage is helpful to first-time homebuyers because they usually come with a lower introductory rate that slowly increases over time. If you expect your income to increase over time, this kind of mortgage may be right for you. However, they carry additional risk, since your loan's interest rate may jump higher than a fixed-rate mortgage, depending on the market.There are many considerations to consider when applying for a home loan. The critical thing to remember is that the more you're ready to put into a down payment, and the higher your income, the greater your negotiating power with lenders.


Tackling Debt: Snowball vs. Avalanche MethodThere are many ways you can approach repaying debt. Two popular methods are the snowball and avalanche methods. The snowball method involves paying extra toward your smallest debt first, then redirecting the money you put into that debt toward the next smallest debt. The avalanche method involves paying off debts with the highest interest rate first, then moving on to the debt with the next highest interest rate.The method you choose will depend on the kind of debt you have. Consulting with a financial expert may be a good idea as your finances become more complicated.The Bottom LineMost of us will take out a loan at some point in our lives. Student loans can help you attend college, and may not carry interest for a time if you can secure subsidized loans. Personal loans are a good option for large, one-time purchases, allowing you to consolidate debt. There are many different types of home loans, and you'll want to conduct extensive research before applying for one as a first-time homebuyer.Featured Image Credit:The post Loans 101: A Graduate's Guide to Taking Out and Paying Off Loans appeared first on Due.

104,Tips for Teaching Your Children About Money,"Aug 10, 2023",Eric Rosenberg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/tips-for-teaching-your-children-about-money/457240,"
Money is a foundational part of our lives. But it's also a subject many children are expected to understand intuitively just by watching their parents when they're young. The result is that many children don't learn about more complex financial concepts until they're teenagers or young adults.Seasoned investors know that having more time is a huge benefit. It's, therefore, essential to teach your kids earlier than later about important personal finance concepts that will earn them extra wealth in the long run.If you're a parent or guardian trying to fill the gaps in your child's understanding of money, this article is for you. Teaching your kids about money isn't just about learning how to budget or understanding the value of a dollar. It's also about instilling lifelong habits that will lead to greater financial independence and responsibility. Here are our tips for giving your kids a thorough financial education.



Key TakeawaysChildren will have gaps in their knowledge that you'll need to fill. Concepts like insurance, mortgages, and inflation may be incredibly confusing to a child, but they're essential to developing financial independence.Making your child do chores when they're young can teach them patience, responsibility, and time management.Consider opening a Roth IRA in your child's name and teaching them about saving early on retirement.What to Do When For Kids (Age 5-9)Assign them choresHere's a simple one that you've probably already done. Assigning your kids chores is an excellent way of teaching them early on the idea of work translating to wages earned. Chores can be foundational to a child's education in more ways than one. They can teach kids humility and respect for manual laborers. Shoveling snow for my parents growing up taught me both patience and made me physically stronger.


If you pay your kids an hourly wage (or half-hourly wage), they should quickly learn that more work should translate to more significant compensation.Introduce concepts like savings and investingOnce your kids start earning money from chores, it's also an opportunity to teach them the importance of saving. Encourage them to set aside a portion of their earnings for future needs or wants.By doing this, kids can learn delayed gratification and that saving is a way of eventually being able to afford more expensive things (maybe encourage them to save for a new pair of shoes or a bicycle). Having a visual aid like a piggy bank or a glass jar may also encourage saving.If you have a particularly bright kid, it might be worth introducing them to investing. Maybe have your young child give their money to an older sibling, with a written agreement that the older sibling will pay interest for every day they don't return the money. If you get your older child to agree to this, it could be a learning opportunity for both of them, teaching them about the risks of taking out a loan and money's ability to work for itself.


What To Do For Tweens (10-13)Introduce more advanced financial topicsAs your child enters the tween years, it's the perfect time to introduce more advanced financial concepts like stocks, bonds, and basic business fundamentals. Though these topics are complex, they can be broken down into more bite-sized bits to make them approachable.For example, you can teach a child about the basic concepts of growing a business. Explain that businesses need to generate funds to operate, and can obtain said funds from people in exchange for partial ownership of the company – a stock. By purchasing stocks, investors essentially buy a piece of the company and become a shareholder. As the company grows, the value of the stock increases.On the other hand, bonds are loans that companies or governments borrow from individuals. You can frame it as the opposite of a bank loan – instead of you borrowing money from the bank, the bank (or a company or the government) borrows money from you. The bond issuer promises to repay the loan amount — plus interest — after a certain period.One strategy for making these ideas more palatable for children is to use companies or brands they're already familiar with. Try to use concrete nouns (Nike store) rather than more abstract ones (large company) to explain topics. It may also be worth teaching your kids how different investments are more or less risky than others. Investing in the stock market is riskier than investing in a bond, but the added risk also translates to greater potential for reward.


Your kids should already understand some of these concepts by now, so hopefully, you won't have too many gaps to fill.What To Do For Teenagers (14-17)Make them get a summer jobEncourage your kids to get a summer job when they reach their teenage years. A job will keep them social and active during the summer months and allow them to earn their own money and gain valuable work experience. Having a summer job like lifeguarding, scooping ice cream, or even just babysitting can teach a teen about responsibility, time management, and professionalism, all essential skills for their future careers.Open a Roth IRA for themWith your teen's money from their summer job, you could consider opening a Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA) in their name. Though you'll have to open a custodial account for your minor child, a person of any age can invest in a Roth IRA. Having a Roth IRA is an opportunity to teach your child about investing in their future early on. The sooner they start contributing to a retirement savings plan, the longer the investment has to grow.With this, you could also teach your teen about the importance of having a retirement savings account and go over some of the different options they may have over the years. In today's digital nomad age, it may be worth going over retirement savings options for self-employed workers, like solo 401(k)s and SEP plans.


Remember that withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free at retirement, adding financial security in their later years.Introduce them to the world of creditThough a minor technically can't open a line of credit in their own name, they can become an authorized user on a parent's credit card (though some age limits may apply). You can also consider getting your teen a prepaid debit card to let them practice paying with plastic. Having a card will help them learn how to use ATMs, withdraw money, and use card readers at stores.Having a joint debit card with your teen is another way to get them access to a card. The important thing is to find ways to help your child start building good credit early on. Because the amount of time you've had your oldest account factors into your credit score, getting your child to open an account or join your account earlier on is a great financial decision.Teach them even more advanced financial topicsSome topics risk being too confusing to preteens that you should definitely make sure a teenager understands. Some of these include topics like inflation and how more complex loans (like mortgages) work.


Making your child read the newspaper is one way of introducing them to things like inflation and monetary policy. For example, you could direct your child to an article about the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, and use that as a gateway to discussing the importance of the Fed funds rate in influencing how banks loan each other money, which influences how expensive debt becomes, how investors spend their money, and business revenue.Understanding the complexity of these topics can be daunting to someone who's just 12 years old. But for a 17-year-old, it may be worth forcing them to sit down and really understand it.General Finance Tips to Teach Your KidsEven if you don't end up following the above tips, there are certain money-related principles you should try to teach your child from a young age. Teach your kid about budgeting and the importance of living within their means. Teach them that not all debt is bad and that knowing how to manage it is crucial. Introduce them to insurance, taxes, and inflation concepts, and how these play into their financial planning.Every child will use money at some point in their young lives, so they'll learn many of these principles intuitively. There are many other lessons you teach your child that will impact how they learn to use their money. Teaching patience, caution, and thoughtful risk-taking will impact how your child spends in the future.


The Bottom LineChildren learn about money intuitively and by watching their parents and peers. But there are always gaps in their knowledge which you'll want to fill over time. Encourage your child to save money, invest money smartly, take on jobs before they leave high school, and potentially open a retirement savings account to start saving early.Featured Image Credit: Photo by Julia M Cameron; Pexels; Thank you!The post Tips for Teaching Your Children About Money appeared first on Due.

105,8 Easy Things Every Young Adult Should Do To Save Money,"Aug 8, 2023",Eric Rosenberg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/8-easy-things-every-young-adult-should-do-to-save-money/457094,"
Everyone wants enough money to do the things they like. Sometimes that requires us to do a bit of planning. Sometimes it means doing tedious stuff we'd rather not. Young people are in a unique position when it comes to saving money. They have the time and flexibility to take greater investment risks than older people but are also less likely to be seriously interested in managing their finances.In this article, we'll go over eight simple things every young person should do to save and get better acquainted with their money. We've picked something that should be relatively easy and time-friendly.As a young person, it can be easy to put off certain essential activities related to your financial future. But when it comes to saving, the earlier the better. Waiting to start saving until later in life can be a costly and stressful mistake.



#1: Use Your Credit Cards SparinglyNot all young people understand the concept of the credit utilization ratio. Your credit utilization ratio refers to how much of your credit line you're using at any given moment. For example, if you have a credit line of $1,800 and put $400 worth of purchases on that card, your utilization ratio would be 22.2%.As a general rule of thumb, keeping a low credit utilization ratio is better for your credit score. You may have heard of the ""30% rule,"" which suggests the optimal utilization ratio is at most 30%. While it's true a 30% ratio is a good goal and perhaps a more reasonable target than, say, 10%, it's generally true that the lower your ratio, the better.


Your credit utilization ratio will impact your credit score, a significant number because it can influence the interest rates you earn later in life and your ability to take out loans.#2: Automate Your Credit Card Payments Every MonthAs an addendum to the previous tip, automating your monthly credit card payments is a good idea and can save you money in the long run. You should pay off as much of your credit debt each month. If you carry a balance each month, you'll start to accrue interest charges that will cost you money.Currently, most banking apps allow you to set up automatic payments. These are generally a good idea because they don't require you to remember to make payments every month and require less initiative (the greatest obstacle to saving, in our experience). Look at the app for your bank and see if you can set up payments to pay your credit card balance in full every month.Carrying a balance can also negatively impact your credit score, the importance of which we've already touched on.


#3: Track How Much Money You Spend Every MonthOne of the more tedious money-saving tricks on this list, but equally important, is budgeting. Making a budget not only makes you more aware of how you spend money every month, but it also makes you more conscious of what you can afford to give up. The steps to creating a budget are relatively straightforward.First, print out or download copies of your monthly transaction histories from all of your cards (both debit and credit). Get a highlighter or two and break up transactions into different categories. Categories could include groceries, restaurants, transportation/travel, clothing, alcohol, rent, or utilities.Consider which categories you spend the most in. Are they categories that are daily essentials, or more recreational? Compare these numbers with your total monthly income. If you can identify a certain number of discretionary purchases you think you could live without, you could set yourself a goal of contributing that amount to a retirement savings plan instead.While we still recommend having a good time and not being too tight-fisted when you're young, making a budget, at the very least, makes you more aware of how you spend your money and what you spend the most on.


#4: Set a Savings Goal for YourselfHaving a savings goal keeps you focused and accountable for your spending habits. Though many people feel they're too young to start thinking about retirement, it can be a helpful exercise to consider your priorities in your later life.Do you want to retire at a young age? Do you want to retire in a large city? If you answered yes to either of those questions, starting your savings journey at a younger age is even more critical.Even if you don't have a clear sense of where you want to be when you retire, setting a savings goal for the time being can be helpful. For example, let's say you spend $200 at restaurants each month. Maybe next month, try to only spend $150 — and put an additional $50 into a savings account (more on that soon).Having a concrete savings goal is also better than having an abstract one. Knowing that you want to earn at least $75,000 per year in retirement gives you a much clearer sense of where you need to be, and helps put in perspective where you are now.


#5: Start an Emergency FundAccording to recent data, a majority of Americans (57%) cannot afford a $1,000 emergency expense. Anyone who has dealt with an unexpected medical issue (a sudden attack of appendicitis was mine) or a car maintenance problem likely understands the importance of an emergency fund.Most experts believe you should have 3 to 6 months' worth of living expenses on hand in case of an emergency. In 2022, thousands of tech workers were laid off. Two years earlier, thousands more lost their jobs because of the global pandemic. In such situations, having money to pull from while you readjust your circumstances — is absolutely essential.#6: Research Retirement Savings PlansThe most essential and complicated tip we're offering is researching retirement savings plans. Many options are available to you, and if you're a gig worker or freelancer, the options become more complicated.There's a chance your job as a young adult will offer you some retirement savings plan – usually a 401(k) – and sometimes that plan will include company matching for your contributions or a stock-related perk. For most people in their early 20s, though, retirement savings plans may require a bit more independent work.


More people are working in today's economy as freelancers and independent contractors. If you fall into this category, you may want to consider options like a SEP plan or a solo 401(k). While the latter allows for both salary deferrals and employer non-elective contributions, you may opt for a different type of plan depending on your needs and income.Putting money towards retirement savings as early as possible is an intelligent decision. You don't want to have any risk of running out of money when you're old, so start planning for it now!#7: Consider Different Investment OptionsAs a young person, you have what's called a long time horizon before retirement. You can therefore take greater risks with your investments, as taking a big hit when you're young is more feasible since you have more time to recover and recoup losses. As you age, you'll need to be constantly monitoring what's called your asset mix.An asset mix is the breakdown of assets within your portfolio. When you're younger, investing heavily in things like stocks (which carry greater risk, but historically offer greater rewards) is a really great decision. The stock market has consistently increased over time, so investing money early and letting it sit until you're older will usually translate to a great yield.


As you get older, though, your asset mix may become more defensive. This could mean investing in things like certificates of deposit, which typically don't earn you as much money on your investment but are much safer.#8: Educate YourselfThis may seem like an obvious tip, and you'll naturally follow it as you age, but try to educate yourself about different financial topics. It's useful to understand how the stock market works, how different investments affect your portfolio, and how macroeconomic concepts like inflation and monetary policy affect your daily spending and interest rates.The more experience you gain, the more you'll understand and be able to apply it to your own financial situation.The Bottom LineYoung adults often resist taking the time to develop their financial independence. In this article, we've gone over eight simple things all young people should do as they leave college or enter the workforce. Classic financial tools like making a budget and setting savings goals are already familiar to most of us, but remembering to automate your credit card payments and set up regular contributions to a retirement savings account requires some extra effort.


Don't be intimidated, though. You've got a wealth of information online and friends or family around you to help you along the way.Featured Image Credit: Photo by RDNE Stock project; Pexels; Thank you!The post 8 Easy Things Every Young Adult Should Do To Save Money appeared first on Due.

106,California Freelancing: How AB5 can change the freelancing game?,"Aug 1, 2023",Deanna Ritchie,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/california-freelancing-how-ab5-can-change-the-freelancing/456762,"
The gig economy is booming, and there's no denying that traditional workers are inching toward this independent lifestyle. Being a freelancer or independent worker, you love celebrating your free-flowing income and self-regulated work schedule. Thanks to the internet, the gig economy holds plenty of promise for freelancers and contractors.Well, changes in federal or state laws have their respective implications on the country's workforce, and freelancers aren't shielded from this impact. The AB5 Law, introduced in California in 2020, further complicates the association between freelancers or gig workers and their clients.What is the AB5 bill?Also referred to as the gig worker bill, Assembly Bill 5 closely defines how businesses should classify their workforce as freelancers or employees. The prime intention of AB5 was to empower freelancers with more rights. The bill wanted companies to reclassify freelancers based on the nature of their work. The concept was to provide the workforce of businesses such as Instacart or Lyft with better access to the minimum wage requirements and protections and uphold other workers' rights.



However, not everything that legislators plan works out to perfection. Although AB5 intended to uphold the interest of the gig workers, creative freelancers working in California faced certain unintended consequences. For instance, Vox Media, a NY-based company, discontinued contracts with hundreds of freelance journalists. The company wasn't sure whether or not they could adhere to the terms of the new law.Understanding the gig worker bill of CaliforniaAs a freelancer or a part of the gig economy, you might have plenty of questions about how the AB5 bill will influence the freelancing game. Even if you aren't a freelancer but a California-based company hiring freelancers, you would feel the impact.


The AB5 bill establishes a three-part mechanism through which companies must test whether they use their workforce as employees or freelancers. The concerned worker needs to fulfill all three conditions below to be considered a freelancer. Otherwise, the business has to consider the individual as an employee.The worker reserves the right to deliver services without the company's direction or control.The worker lies outside the usual course of business activities of the company and carries out the assigned work tasksCustomarily, the worker must be engaged in a business, occupation, or an independently established trade of the same type.As per the implications of AB5, most freelance writers and designers need to fulfill these conditions to retain their status as independent contractors. However, media businesses encounter a hurdle with the second clause. Suppose a freelance content writer crafts blogs for a landscaping company. However, writing blogs doesn't come under the ambit of the business. Therefore, the freelancer would be exempt under ordinary circumstances. However, suppose the landscaping company hires the writer to develop stories for a landscaping magazine. In that case, they must classify the freelancer as an employee, as story writing is common for magazines.


Who is excluded from the AB5 bill?The AB5 law mentioned more than 100 professionals that would be excluded from the implications of the new norms. This list included dentists, doctors, insurance agents, real estate agents, accountants, doctors, hair stylists, architects, engineers, marketing professionals, travel agents, and photographers, among others.However, the law states that freelance writers and creative professionals need to submit at least 35 articles to a company or single client per year to get employee status. This has sparked widespread debate among gig workers. This submission criterion has led to outrage as well as a legal protest from freelance writers. They consider the rule to be unfair and a threat to their livelihood.The introduction of AB2257 and Proposition 22Freelance business owners, groups, and independent contractors appealed to get into the list of exemptions. They feared that they would lose clients since businesses would be reluctant to hire freelancers. Besides, many independent workers wouldn't like to get the ""employee' status and limit their opportunities.Besides, many businesses heavily relying on freelancers or gig workers tried to obtain an exemption status. This way, they could continue working in the usual manner. After a long-drawn appeal and several lawsuits, the AB5 exemption list was updated. Consequently, freelancers should be aware of AB2257 and Proposition 22.


AB2257AB2257 is one of the most famous modifications of the bill—this empowered freelancers with the freedom to create. CA Governor Gavin Newsom signed this bill on 4th September 2020. This update added lots of exemptions for freelancers to the bill. This also included creative professionals like photographers, videographers, writers, illustrators, photo editors, and cartoonists.Besides, AB2257 eliminated some criteria that were previously mentioned to become eligible as a creative freelancer, such as the 35-piece content submission per year criteria.After passing AB2257, as many as 109 worker categories no longer had to appear for the test to be considered freelancers or independent contractors.Proposition 22Many big companies hiring gig workers, such as Lyft or Uber, weren't happy with AB5. The new law required them to consider drivers as employees. This implied that the companies had to provide a comprehensive range of benefits to gig workers that only employees should be getting. Therefore, these companies wanted gig drivers to be exempted from AB5. They also demonstrated to the public that the law would increase transportation prices. This explains the background of Proposition 22. 


Proposition 22 was yet another update to the AB5, made in November 2020. California voters passed this proposition to empower gig workers. Efforts were reversed so that gig workers wouldn't be considered employees. A large section of gig workers voted for the Proposition since they feared losing contracts if a company hired them as an employee.The Proposition assured that gig workers would continue to enjoy some benefits like health insurance subsidies, guaranteed minimum hourly wage, and disability and medical coverage.How can AB5 benefit freelancers?Now that AB5 has overcome the initial opposition through amendments and updates, it holds tons of promise for freelancers and gig workers. Following the policy reforms, these independent professionals are better poised to enjoy their job security.A sizable section of gig workers and independent contractors will gain access to similar rights as long-term employees. Besides, individuals in some professions would also get a guarantee of minimum wage rates.


Let's look at what AB5 has in store for freelancers and independent workers.Guarantee for minimum wageOvertime payFamily leaveSick leaveWorkers compDisability insuranceUnemployment insuranceSocial security benefitsSexual harassment protectionMedicare benefitsOther workplace discrimination protectionAs these benefits look great from the perspective of gig workers and freelancers, other states are looking forward to following suit.How important is AB5 for the US economy?With more workers switching to the gig economy and freelancing, AB5 is likely to significantly impact employment trends and the country's economy. A survey reveals that by 2027, freelancers are likely to constitute the majority of the US workforce. Evidently, the gig economy is likely to grow, as evident from these figures.The last five years have witnessed the freelancer market shoot up by 7%.As much as 47% of the millennial population is freelancing, which is way higher than any other generation.80% of the individuals prefer working on remote assignments. Besides, 50% of all jobs in the US can be done remotely.In 2022, independent professionals in the US earned $286 billion, around 10% higher compared to the previous year.Now that the new legislation has significantly bridged the gap between the work status of freelancers and employers, the gig economy is likely to get a boost. Freelancers are also teaming up to form businesses, which is yet another trend that would dominate the US economy. AB5 has brought about this shift, and it holds tremendous promise to transform how freelancers and independent contractors work. 


Is it possible for Proposition 22 and AB 2257 to coexist?Well, not everything can work in watertight compartments, and chances are high that both AB 2257 and Proposition 22 will coexist. Although AB 2257 will be applicable, the businesses for which it was formulated are no longer compelled to adhere to its key provisions.With Proposition 22, delivery service providers and rideshare drivers at Delivery Network Company, Doordash, Lyft, and Uber can continue to work as independent contractors. They may choose not to be considered as employees.Now, by exempting some businesses categorically, the Proposition guts the actual intent of AB5. However, the proposition has provided workers with the freedom to choose their work status. Freelancers who take on other types of tasks are likely to be reclassified unless these workers fulfill the exemption requirements under AB 2257.How the plan backfired!The clauses under AB5 will continue to evolve to suit the needs of freelancers and a larger gig economy. The original intention behind AB5 was positive as the bill tried to protect freelancers and independent professionals and provide them with equal or similar working stature as employees. The Californian government also tried to ensure that contractors and freelance business owners paid their taxes. This would bolster the state's revenue.


However, after the formulation of Proposition 22, AB5 is doing exactly the opposite of what it was intended to do. Ultimately, this is hurting freelancers who carry the power and knowledge while working with companies. The bill has undergone several changes since its inception. It remains to be seen how comfortable freelancers are with the current state of affairs related to benefits, taxation, and job security. FAQWhy are some freelancers reluctant to be considered as employees?The nature of freelancing jobs comes with several perks, such as flexibility and independence. Unlike regular office jobs, freelancers need not work at stipulated office hours. This implies they are free to set their schedule throughout the day to boost their productivity.Besides, freelancers are entitled to sign contracts with multiple vendors or clients simultaneously. However, when they get the ""employee' tag, they would lose this privilege. Working with one business rather than multiple companies puts their profession at risk, besides leading to loss of productivity. This explains why some freelancers are reluctant to be considered as employees.Is AB5 disrupting the gig economy?Yes, AB5 has been disrupting the gig economy significantly, but it's too early to decide whether this disruption would benefit freelancers or turn out to be a problem. With Proposition 22, freelancers and gig workers can choose their work status and opt out of the ""employee' tag if necessary. Rather than making the norms a compulsion, the current state of the norms offers a good deal of flexibility to gig workers and freelancers.


How important are freelancers to businesses?Many businesses, such as designing, digital marketing, affiliate marketing, blogging, content development, ridesharing, and marketing, find freelancers valuable and cost-effective resources. Working with freelancers does not require businesses to provide regular benefits like insurance. However, they can count on this pool of talent for cost-effective and high-quality services.Can freelancers start their businesses?Of course, hundreds of freelancers from different industries have already registered their businesses. You may decide to register your freelancing business as a sole entrepreneur or proprietorship. Make sure to stay abreast with the legalities and tax implications when you transform your side hustle or freelancing job into an established business.Why are so many traditional workers switching to freelancing?Freelancing brings you the privilege of choosing whom to work for and how much time to allocate to each client. Likewise, you get to decide your hourly rates, payment terms, and whether or not you would accept assignments. This flexibility, along with the benefits of working remotely, appeals to most workers. This explains why so many traditional workers are embracing freelancing careers. The post California Freelancing: How AB5 can change the freelancing game? appeared first on Due.

107,How to Keep Track of Multiple Credit Cards,"Jul 25, 2023",Chaim Geller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/how-to-keep-track-of-multiple-credit-cards/456359,"
Credit cards can be the best tool to help you rank up your credit, earn rewards, and increase spending power. If you have multiple credit card accounts, you can get even more credit, rewards, and spending power.Many people, in fact, do have multiple credit cards. According to a statistic by Fortune.com, an average American consumer has 3.84 credit cards. But having too many credit cards can often be too much to juggle. It can lead you to lose track of some of your credit cards which can be a devastating mistake. You may have a bulging wallet filled with credit cards and be happy. But if you don't know when the card fees are due on each one, that wallet and its plastic contents are almost worthless. It can even be detrimental to your credit. It can cause you to miss payments on credit cards. Also, you may simply lose track of the benefits the cards have to offer. Many cards have high annual fees but the benefits on the card counteract the high fee. However, if you lose track of the benefits then you will have to pay a high annual fee and you won't even reap the benefits.You want to access the complete realm of benefits that credit cards have to offer. Therefore, you will need to keep track of your cards in an organized fashion. In this post, we'll explore various ways to keep track of multiple credit cards.



Let's first double-click on why it's crucial to keep track of your cards.Paying Your Credit Card Balances TimelyWhy is it detrimental to your credit if your credit cards are a mess, you ask? Each credit card you have is unique in many aspects.Firstly, in regards to when the card statement must be paid up. No two cards will necessarily have the same payment due date. So let's say you have three credit cards. You need to pay one of them on the 1st of the month. The next card you have to pay on the 13th of the month. And the last one you must pay each 22nd of the month.So three days out of every month, there are three super important payments you cannot forget to make to each credit card bill. The Perfect Time to Pay Your BillTo add to that, there's that perfect time to pay a credit card bill. It is best to pay a card balance after the card statement prints each month. That makes it clear to the credit bureaus that your card is active and being used. If your card has no balance for a few months, it is seen as inactive by the scoring models. At that point, the will no longer help your credit scores. But you still must make a payment before it is due. Otherwise, you risk missing the due date. Once you miss the due date, the payment is considered late and the credit bureaus mark your account in red. Red marks, or delinquencies in its more common term, have a negative impact on your credit. Paying a balance 30 days after the due date is not as bad as paying it 60 days late. It's also better than not paying at all. But even a few days late is not so good. Why mess up a clean credit report at all if the credit bureaus see that negatively? Especially if your credit score can drop because of it.


See why making timely payments is critical?How you can Get SidetrackedI assume sitting and making credit card payments is not the only thing going on in your life. You are juggling a bunch of other financial things. Plus personal matters, family goings-on, work, and events. Also everything you most probably have to add to your list. A credit card bill can so easily flip off your mind. It can fall to the bottom of the list of things to take care of. Especially if all you could think about on a given 13th of the month is making it to the dentist on time. That's why, if you have multiple credit cards, you need a strategy of how to keep track of your cards. Will get to explore some great ideas soon.Paying the Card's Annual FeeWe talked about paying a credit card bill timely. On top of that, many credit cards have an annual fee. An annual fee is a fee that a cardholder has to pay. It is usually a lump sum once a year. You need to pay the fee in order to remain a member of the card. The fee usually automatically gets added to the credit card balance. That is how you pay it up. If you end up missing a credit card payment because you weren't keeping track of your cards, the annual fee due on your card that is included in your balance does not get paid either. That means you haven't paid the fee for the card. Your card won't get closed down if you don't pay the fee. But, your credit can definitely be marked with a delinquency if you miss the card due date due to negligence. Or being unable to keep track of when a payment is due.The only way of being in control of the multiple dates and amounts that your cards balance come along with, is by constructing an organized manner in which to keep track of your credit cards. Managing your credit cards well will ensure that you make your payments on time. Then, your credit score won't take a dip for the bad due to delinquent marks. Those marks come from missing credit card payments. If you are diligent about paying your bills timely then your credit score can reach great heights. Tempted to start taking care of being organized?


Maximizing RewardsAnother aspect you would lose out on if your credit cards are out of hand, is on card rewards. Many cards have amazing reward structures and earn points on many categorized purchases such as travel, dining, groceries, gas, shopping, and more.A card that earns 3% cashback at gas stations is best to use when you fill up your tank.Knowing how to use Your CardsIn order to earn the cashback, you have to actually pay for the gas with the card. But if you've got no clue that you can earn cashback when you use the card for gas, you'll be missing out on those rewards. If you are oblivious to which rewards your card earns and which card to swipe for each purchase you make, you gain nothing from the card rewards. Which is a shame.However, imagine having a clear list of the credit cards you own and the amount of reward points you earn in each category. So you clearly see that Card A earns 5 points on every dollar used at groceries and 3 points on every dollar used at restaurants. You would simply go ahead and take Card A out to swipe when you go get your weekly groceries, right? And you would know to use the same card when you generously offer to foot the bill of your friends birthday bash held at their favorite dine-out, correct?Where it Gets ConfusingHow about when you book a flight to Hawaii? Would you remember off-hand to use your Hawaiian Airlines Mastercard to make the reservations? You would get 3 points for every dollar paid for the flight. Or would you by default, mistakenly use your luxury travel card, the Chase Sapphire Preferred? You would only earn 2 points on travel.However, it would be smart to use your Chase Sapphire Preferred card for the Hawaiian ticket if you were to book your flight through Chase Travel. Then you would earn 5 points with the Sapphire Preferred card.Do you get the gist of how many details are involved? The rewards structure is intricate and there is a lot to remember. Your rewards bank can become bigger once you know which specific card to use for every purchase you make.That is part of keeping track of your cards.


Reaping Card BenefitsMany credit cards also have benefits which may enhance your traveling experience. This includes auto rental insurance, lost luggage reimbursement, no foreign transaction fees, and more. There are also benefits that come in handy when shopping. Purchase protection, extended warranty, and price protection, are some examples.These benefits are nice and you want to get all this glee when you can. It takes some forethought to be in the know about what benefits your cards have in order to gain. Because for many benefits, you need to put the charges on the card in order to later gain from it.Let's say you want to rely on your card's auto rental insurance coverage on your next outing in a rented Kia. You will need to use that credit card when you reserve the car for your upcoming trip. If you use a different card to reserve, you will not be able to get the coverage from the first card.So it's super important to know what benefits each card holds. In this way, you utilize them appropriately and when necessary. Particularly given that each card has such clear terms, it is imperative that you understand them all. Then you can use each card's benefits and coverages to their fullest potential.Earning Welcome BonusesHere's yet another reason to keep track of your cards.Banks attract consumers to credit cards by offering credit card welcome offers. With the offers, you can earn bonus points by completing certain requirements. Most welcome bonus requirements include spending a certain amount of money within a given set of time.A sample of an offer can be earning 50,000 points after you spend $3,000 within the first 3 months of account opening. Don't Lose Track of the Spending RequirementsYou need to meet the spending requirements to earn the welcome bonus. So you have to track when you opened your card so that you know how much time you have left. You have to spend the full amount of money within the given time. The $3,000 spent within the first three months part of the offer (of the example mentioned above) is very important to earning the bonus. If you don't spend the required amount within the required time, you will not earn the bonus


This can get confusing and you can easily lose track of how much you already spent towards the welcome offer. You also might lose track of how much time you have left to spend. Also, often, you anyways spend the amounts of money needed to earn the bonus points. However, if you miss the deadline by a day, you lose out on earning the bonus.So take that, and all of the other reasons we mentioned above, into account. Can you see why it's so necessary to keep track of your credit cards?Nonetheless, it's confusing, time-consuming, and tedious, to manage a credit card. Let alone multiple cards.But I'm here to tell you that being in control of your credit cards can be simple. Here are four ways you can keep track of multiple credit cards. You won't believe how seamless paying bills and earning rewards can be.Option 1 – Use an Excel SpreadsheetThis is the simplest way to keep track of your credit cards. It's old fashioned at its best!What you would do is create your personal Excel sheet. You can fill in the general details as shown in the above sample, including the credit card name, the due date for the monthly statement, the annual fee amount, and the annual fee due date.


Keep this sheet handy. You can check it once a week to look out for upcoming due dates so that you know upfront what bill is coming up. If you notice there's a due date in the coming week you'll be ready to pay on time and not get hit with a late payment out of the blue for sheer lack of forgetting to pay.This sheet is an excellent and neat method to clearly keep track of all your credit cards and upcoming payments. As you open more cards, keep adding them to your spreadsheet so that nothing falls through the cracks.More Options to Customize Your SheetYou can even add a column where you check off once you pay a monthly/annual fee or statement. However, you would have to uncheck it though once a new cycle or new month comes and you need to make a payment once more.You can, if you'd like, add notes for yourself alongside each card row, to nickname the cards. You can nickname cards based on their features. If you label a card as a luxury travel card then you will know to look through its rewards and benefits before you travel to see how you can maximize the card. And if another card is labeled a great cashback card then you will definitely be on the lookout for stores where you can use the card and earn a lot of cashback.Pros: This method of using an Excel sheet is good for various reasons.It's clearVery simple to set upHandy, you can store it in Google Drive, download it on your phone, or even printSo easy to personalize.Cons:You need to actually fill out the details and keep updating it if anything changes. So you have to be able to trust yourself not to forget any important facts about the cards you own. And you have to make sure not to get lazy about updating the sheet.Option 2 – Designate a Time to Make PaymentsAnother really great way of keeping track of multiple credit cards without missing payment due dates, is to set aside a designated day in the month when you make all your credit card payments.


Let's say, on the 1st of the month, or every 15th of the month, you designate the morning or evening to go through all your credit card statements and pay them. How it Works to Have one Day a Month to Pay Your BillsYou may be surprised that you can choose just one day a month to pay all your bills, after we've mentioned earlier how due dates are crucial to ensuring you pay your cards timely. But don't forget that we said there's a period of time each card cycle that is a good time to pay a card balance; between the time after the statement prints and before the due date. So given that info, you can find one day a month that coincides with all of your credit cards' best payment dates.Having a designated day and time to make payments will ensure that you don't forget to pay your credit cards. It'll become ingrained in your mind that at so-and-so time you take care of it.Make sure that the time you choose is convenient for you so that it remains a long term plan. If the time is inconvenient and a hassle, you'll just procrastinate and it may cause you to miss payments.Pros:This method does not require you to do much which may make it more attainable for you.You can choose a payment date based on when you know you have the most funds available.Cons:You are the one who has to sit and calculate what you have to pay and what the due dates are.There can be circumstances that leave you no choice but to push off payment time, such as a sick day, and then you forget to pay the bills.If you get a new credit card, there is nothing to remind you that you have a new card to payOption 3 – Set up Automatic PaymentsA very obvious and straightforward method of keeping track of multiple cards while making timely payments is to set up automatic payments for your credit cards. If you have automatic payments then you will not even have to remember to pay the balance. The payment will be made automatically. Once you set up autopay in your bank settings, the credit card issuer will automatically charge your account and retrieve funds towards your credit card bill.It is very simple to set up autopay for your cards so this is convenient and simple.Pros:This is a reliable method for timely paymentsCons:If you are missing the funds in your bank account, the bank will not have from where to retrieve funds which may lead to your bill not being paidIf autopay has a glitch in the system, payment may be missed without you even noticing until you see a missed payment mark on your credit reportOption 4 –  Sign up for Credit Card Tracking AppsThe last method I'd like to mention for keeping track of your cards is to sign up to apps that do the work for you.There are apps out there that keep track of your credit cards and all its details so that you don't have to be the one remembering all of it. What the Apps FeatureThese apps work vaguely as follows. You can set up an account in the app and then add all the credit cards you have open. According to the version you use, you would add details along the lines of the date you opened the card, your responsibility (meaning if you are the card owner or simply an authorized user on the card), and so forth.From there on, the apps are set to display the current welcome offers on your cards and if you are eligible for the welcome offer. The app can calculate how much time you have left to meet the spending requirements for the welcome bonus.


Depending on the specific features each app offers, it may track when you have to pay the annual fees on your cards, where you can earn rewards given the cards you have, credit card balances, some apps even integrate your checking account balances, and more.This takes a huge burden off you. You literally can rely on an app to keep track of all your credit cards for you and you won't miss any important dates or rewards!A couple of apps of the sort are Mint.com and CardRight.com. You can sign up for them to start tracking your multiple credit cards.Pros:These apps encompass many details; such as card benefits, rewards, welcome offers, annual fees, etc.They are easy to useThe app does all the calculating and tracking for youMost apps have a free version Cons:You have to add your cards and all details to your portal in the app.You have to trust the apps with your bank login information.Fed up with Having Multiple Credit Cards?Some of us have better organizational skills than others. Organization plays a big role in keeping track of credit cards. If, even after reading about the several methods you can use to track your cards, you are still fed up with having to deal with so many cards, you may find yourself toying with the idea of closing some of your credit cards.Should you Close Credit Cards or not?The answer would be no to a consumer who is managing their payments well and is using each card to its maximum.But I would say, definitely yes to looking into closing some of your cards if you're finding it difficult to handle so many. You're better off carefully finishing with some of your cards than trying to be a pro and stumbling with credit card payments. 


Close Some Cards but Keep the Three Oldest OpenBefore you close cards at random, here is a guideline to keep by so that you impact your credit as little as possible.Don't close your three oldest credit cards. Your credit history starts when you open your first credit card. The longer your crest history, the better it is for your credit score. If you close one of your three first cards, you're cutting your credit history short.Because let's say you have a card opened ten years ago and a card opened five years ago. If you close the ten-year-old one, you're cutting your credit history short by five years.So try to close newer credit cards instead of older ones. It's always best to leave your first three credit cards open forever.Once you have fewer cards open, you might find it a lot easier to keep track of them!What it Means to Credit Scoring Models Just a word about how credit scoring models, those who tally up your credit score (such as FICO), view closed accounts. When you close a credit card, it will remain on your credit report for the next ten years as a closed account. It does not help your credit in any way, even if you see it on your credit report. Also, credit scoring models only count cards that are active within the last six months. Closed accounts do not fall off your credit report until ten years later but it does not help your credit score to have the account on your credit report as its inactive.When you close a card, it automatically ceases activity. After six months of no activity, the scoring models will stop counting it as part of your credit.


TakeawaysKeeping track of multiple credit cards is not easy. However, it is worth the hassle so that your credit can stay healthy and so that you reap the benefits and rewards your cards have to offer.And after reading this post, you get to realize that managing your cards does not even have to be a hassle. It gets straightforward if you choose to follow one, or some, of the methods we visited.And rest assured, if you do find it challenging, you can follow the strategies we spoke about in the post to get rid of some credit card bulk.The post How to Keep Track of Multiple Credit Cards appeared first on Due.

108,Dark Truths of Financial Independence Nobody Tells You,"Jul 19, 2023",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/dark-truths-of-financial-independence-nobody-tells-you/456064,"
There is no greater personal finance goal than financial independence. After all, quitting your job, traveling the world, and living as you please is what many people dream of.But, here's the reality.In the United States, young adults are taking longer to achieve economic independence from their parents and live on their own — according to a Pew Research Center analysis.



In 2021, fewer adults under 21 held full-time jobs, were financially independent, lived alone, or were married.In a separate survey, four in ten Americans said they don't think they will be financially independent in five years.


Furthermore, 42 percent of respondents reported significant financial difficulties within the last three years. Among 2,000 Americans surveyed, 68% blamed rising living expenses. Among other hardships, 59% of respondents experienced unexpected medical expenses, 53% faced pay cuts, 49% lost their jobs, and 41% had high levels of personal debt.Are these really bad things?Despite financial independence sounding appealing, it is not all sunshine and rainbows. Rather, there are some dark truths about financial independence that nobody tells you.In this post, we'll discuss some of these dark truths, like the challenges of financial independence, the sacrifices you'll have to make, and the fact that it's not always easy.


1. Financial independence is not a destination, it's a journey.What's one of the biggest dark truths about financial independence? It's a journey, not a destination.You'll still need to manage your money once you achieve financial independence. After all, you still need to keep your budget in check and avoid overspending. You may think you're financially responsible. However, it's not uncommon for people to spend more when their income grows, aka ""lifestyle creep.""Aside from that, you'll have to deal with the unexpected, like medical bills or losing your job. You also have to consider inflation. As pointed out over at Money Under 30, the early financial independence interest-only model means you're living on $50,000 for the rest of your life. With 3 percent inflation a year, that's $8,486 a year in 60 years. And, we won't even talk about taxes!2. You'll have to make sacrifices.Financial independence also means making sacrifices. For example, you'll need to decide whether to live a frugal lifestyle now for the benefit of your future financial freedom later or if you're living for the present.


You'll also have to sacrifice your social life if you want financial independence. This means you won't have to spend as much time traveling, going to parties, and doing other costly activities with friends or family.In general, if you want to achieve financial independence, you must change your lifestyle. It may mean spending less on frivolous things, eating out less, driving a cheaper vehicle, or working a second job.3. It's not always easy.Sure, there are many stories of people who achieved financial independence in their 20s and 30s. In reality, these stories are rare, not the norm.The reality? In order to achieve financial independence, hard work, dedication, and sacrifice are required.


To put it simply, achieving financial independence is not always easy. Occasionally, you will want to give up. Also, the temptation to spend money you don't have will come up from time to time.However, you can achieve financial independence if you stay focused and persistent.4. You'll have to learn to say no.Having the ability to say no is an important skill when it comes to achieving financial independence. Examples include:Decling social invitations, like grabbing lunch with a friend or attending a concert.Not purchasing new clothes.Splurging on expensive assets, such as new vehicles.Avoiding unnecessary expenses, like a new streaming service.When it comes to achieving your goals, saying no can be challenging — especially in a world where we're glued to social media. But it is essential.


5. You'll have to be comfortable being uncomfortable.Financial independence requires you to go beyond your comfort zone. It will require you to change your lifestyle and habits.Financial independence involves learning to be happy with less, for example. As such, you may find it difficult to adjust to a simpler lifestyle when you're used to one. However, happiness is not found in material possessions.As you take on new challenges, you'll learn different things and develop new habits. It is possible for you to achieve financial independence, though you need to be willing to endure discomfort.6. It's not for everyone.Some people are not suited to financial independence. There are people who are content with living a comfortable life while working a 9-to-5 job. However, if you wish to achieve more in life, financial independence may be your best option.


What's more, financial independence is difficult and requires a lot of commitment. Without sacrifice and hard work, financial independence isn't for you.7. There's no guarantee.As Clint Eastwood said in the movie The Rookie, ""If you want a guarantee, buy a toaster.""No matter what you do, financial independence isn't guaranteed. There are times when things go wrong, like losing your job, getting sick, or fluctuating markets.However, if you are prepared for the unexpected, you will be more successful.


8. It's not the end of your problems.Sure, money solves some problems, such as food and shelter. But you will still have problems after reaching financial independence. In life, you'll still have to deal with:Happiness — research shows it comes from other sources.Attending to your physical healthFailed relationshipsDeath of loved onesAcquiring new skills and talentsNatural disastersUsually, more money can make our lives easier. However, money isn't a cure-all solution for all our problems.When it comes to money, a healthy view is to put it in its place without giving it too much power. To put it another way, money can help us build our ideal lives. However, it won't do everything.9. You'll have to be patient.There's no quick and easy way to financial independence. The journey takes years of dedication and diligent work. As such, you have to be patient and persistent.


ConclusionMany people dream of becoming financially independent. Before starting your journey, you should be aware of the dark truths. Financial independence is a journey, not a destination. There will be sacrifices and patience required.However, the work is worth it if you put in the effort.FAQsIs financial independence really possible?Yes, financial independence is possible. However, it is not an easy task.Working hard, being dedicated, and making sacrifices are essential to achieving financial independence. In order to become a successful investor, you will need to learn how to budget, save money, and invest wisely. As part of the process, you will also have to be willing to make changes to your lifestyle, such as living below your means and delaying gratification.


Are there any dark truths about financial independence?Often people don't talk about some of the dark realities of financial independence. Among them are:Despite what it seems, it's not always glamorous. It's likely you won't be able to do everything you want at times, and you'll have to make sacrifices.It can be lonely at times. As you become financially independent, you may find that you have less in common with your friends and family who are still employed.Happiness isn't guaranteed. In spite of the fact that financial independence can give you more freedom and control over your life, it will not solve every problem you face.Why doesn't anyone discuss these dark truths?The dark truths of financial independence are often overlooked for a few reasons. For one, when you hear about the challenges involved in financial independence, it can be discouraging.Also, some people may not want to talk about the difficulties of achieving financial independence because they don't feel good enough to do so.How can I overcome financial independence's dark truths?If you want to be prepared for the dark truths of financial independence, here are a few tips:


Make sure your expectations are realistic. It won't be an easy road to financial independence. Therefore, don't expect to become financially independent overnight. Motivate yourself by setting small, achievable goals.Don't be afraid to make sacrifices. To become financially independent, you'll have to give up some things you enjoy.Maintain a strong support system. Your journey to financial independence will be made much easier if you have people who support you and believe in you.Don't lose sight of the reason you're doing this. Things can get tough when you get discouraged. However, you should never lose sight of the reason you are striving for financial independence. What do you hope to accomplish with your financial freedom? Whenever you feel down, remember this.What is the silver lining to financial independence?Although financial independence is not without its dark truths, it can still be a very rewarding achievement. Here are a few silver linings:Your life will be more flexible and free.Money will be less of a stressor for you.It will be possible for you to retire early and enjoy your golden years.Your loved ones will be able to inherit your legacy.The post Dark Truths of Financial Independence Nobody Tells You appeared first on Due.

109,How to Make Money Management a Blast (or At Least a Breeze),"Jul 18, 2023",Peter Daisyme,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/how-to-make-money-management-a-blast-or-at-least-a-breeze/456001,"
Money management can be exhausting, intense, and stressful. But is it possible to make the experience fun?Despite the high stakes of the wealth generation world, you don't have to sweat bullets every time you move money around. It is, indeed, possible to amp up your energy and enjoy the process a bit — at least, it's possible if you have the right perspective, tools, and strategies in place.If you're a wealth worrier, here are a few tips and suggestions to help you have a blast with your money management responsibilities — or at the least, make the process of managing your money a breeze.



1. Start By Learning About (and Accepting) RiskWhether they realize it or not, most people are familiar with the concept of financial exposure. This refers to the uncomfortable understanding of how much money you stand to lose from your investing or money management activities at any given moment.Financial exposure is a term that finds expression in phrases like, ""If this investment goes south, I'm toast."" or ""I'll go bankrupt if this doesn't pan out.""


While it's important to understand the risks involved in your financial circumstances, fear of over-exposure shouldn't be the only factor you're considering. You also want to learn to be comfortable with and even accept risk at times.In fact, the phrase ""accepting risk"" is a legitimate financial term replete with its own unique money-related definition. It means consciously exposing yourself to financial loss or unwanted outcomes in the deliberate attempt to gain a particular payoff or other reward.To put it another way, accepting risk refers to the attempt to be okay with taking calculated and understood chances with your money. If you want to feel comfortable and even enjoy your money management journey, take the time to learn about and accept that risk is a realistic part of the experience. Your job isn't to avoid risk like the plague. You just have to make sure it doesn't get out of hand.2. Use Goals, Benchmarks, and Personal ChallengesThere's nothing like an end goal to motivate a person. When you establish a clear picture of what you're trying to reach, it can breathe purpose and focus into what you're doing now, in the present.


The thing with goals is that they're nuanced. You can't simply set a 10-year goal of ""making a lot of money"" or ""getting out of debt"" and stay focused every time you do your bills or choose a new investment strategy.Instead, you want to take the time to study how to set healthy financial goals. These should be both SMART goals and short and long-term in nature. The SMART goal acronym stands for:SpecificMeasurableAchievableRelevantTime-boundThese parameters can ensure that each of your goals is crystal clear and capable of motivating you with precision.When it comes to setting short and long-term goals, you want to consider both of these critical pieces of financial success. Short-term goals are relatively urgent. They might be setting up an emergency fund, paying off a wedding, or saving for an upcoming trip or home improvement project. In most cases, short-term goals don't go further than a few years into the future.


Long-term goals are the big-ticket items. Retirement, saving for your kid's college, buying your dream home — these are the things you're willing to work toward for months and years at a time without giving up.Consider what your short and long-term aspirations are. Then set those objectives using the SMART goal methodology. The result should be a financial blueprint that streamlines your financial activity and keeps you motivated and even excited as you go along.3. Gamify the Money-Making ExperienceSetting goals can give you motivation and make money management more rewarding. However, if you truly want to amp up the excitement level, you can go a step further by gamifying the entire experience.You can start this transformation by changing your verbiage. Rather than referring to something as a goal, call it a ""quest."" Don't just pay a bill. Consider your paycheck your personal army and see if you can win each billing battle of attrition. Set up a personalized reward system for yourself if you reach a certain benchmark. Challenge your significant other to see who can save more money over the course of the next month.


If you're struggling to come up with ideas on your own, you can use apps to get those creative juices flowing. (More on fintech apps and tools, in general, in the next section.) The Envie app, for instance, is a simple and fun way to gamify your savings right on your phone.The free app allows you to set up fun goals, like a vacation, and see your daily progress toward that benchmark. It also lets you track your progress and earn cash rewards, like the Goldie.You can even take pre-set challenges. Envie is the digital version of the 100-envelope challenge, so each of its five challenges are designed to help you reach your goal in 100 days. Whether you're using an app or playing by your own rules, gamifying the money management experience is a great way to stay positive and encouraged over time.4. Find Tools to Simplify Your Management ActivitiesIt's a lot easier to manage your money if you have a strong system in place. Fortunately, we live in an era where there are countless tools and resources to help.


Sometimes, these are as simple as an online calendar. This can help you schedule important events, remember when payments are due, and even get into a healthy rhythm for consistent budgeting.Speaking of budgeting, it's also worthwhile to find a budget system that truly fits your personality and lifestyle. The 50/30/20 budget, for instance, is a straightforward option (50% of income toward necessities, 30% toward wants, and 20% toward savings and debt.) Zero-based budgeting ups the ante by assigning an up-front purpose to every penny that you make. Keep in mind that the kind of budget that you choose can factor into your gamification efforts, too.Other less ""sexy"" tools that can still have a major impact include things like spreadsheets to track expenses and online banking portals to streamline money management. Remote check deposit mobile features and auto-bill and direct deposit options are all powerfully simple tools, as well.These may not have a direct impact on how enjoyable your money management is. Nevertheless, the menagerie of fintech tools available can go a long way in keeping you on track, organized, and de-stressed.


5. Prepare for Disappointment (and Take Steps to Stay Inspired)Thomas Edison is famous for saying, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" Winston Churchill uttered the infinitely inspiring words, ""Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm."" C.S. Lewis reiterated a similar message when he wrote, ""Failures, repeated failures, are finger posts on the road to achievement. One fails forward towards success."" The list of inspiring quotes goes on.There will be failures and disappointments along your financial journey. Investments won't pay off. You'll lose your job at some point along the way. Perhaps you won't be able to pay a bill or may even have a larger catastrophe, like losing your car or home.Whatever your financial hardships might look like, it's important to keep your emotions and perspective clear on what failure is in the first place. It isn't a stopping point or place of shame and despondency. Failure is a lesson. It's a reset. It's a chance to pick yourself up, learn from the past, and do better on your next try. The more you understand that, the more you'll be able to manage your money through the ups and downs of life without, as Churchill would say, losing that all-important enthusiasm.As a final note on all of these quotes, one emotional tool that can help guard against the fear of failure is the wisdom of the past. Take the time to find your favorite inspiring quotes like those listed above — famous sayings that pertain to financial activity, failure, success, and so on. Then create a list of your favorites to reference when you're feeling thrown off or overwhelmed.


Finding the Fun in the Fiscal Parts of LifeTaking care of your finances is not an inherently glamorous activity. On the contrary, even when you're building wealth, it can be an overwhelming and intimidating part of life.But it doesn't have to be.If you take the right steps, you can turn the humdrum activity of doing your budget into an exciting challenge. You can transform the fear-filled moments spent managing your investments into confidence-building points in your daily life. From understanding risks and disappointments to setting goals, finding the right tools, and gamifying the entire experience, there are plenty of ways to make money management a blast — or at least a breeze.The only thing getting in the way is yourself. So assess your situation and consider where you're lacking inspiration, creativity, or direction. Then use the tips above to turn your finances into one of the greatest adventures of your life.
