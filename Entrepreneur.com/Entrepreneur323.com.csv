0,An Innovative Financing Technique is Gaining Traction — And It's a Big Factor in the Potential $9.5 Billion Subway Acquisition,"Apr 2, 2024",Alicia Miller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/this-finance-method-is-key-in-the-95-billion-subway-deal/471506,"
If Roark Capital completes its acquisition of Subway for approximately $9.5 billion, the deal will include nearly $5 billion of debt, provided by a group of several banks working together. This will represent one of the largest whole business securitizations (WBS) ever completed. Subway has around $725 million of EBITDA to support debt payments. Roark is perhaps the foremost in franchising WBS transactions, having repeatedly returned to the market using this technique across many of its other holdings to fund expansion initiatives and dividend payouts.Ironically, Subway's CEO, John Chidsey, recently discussed debt in his main stage remarks at the annual Restaurant Finance and Development Conference in November 2023, which I attended. He mentioned that he was grateful for having no debt while the business was privately held because the extra cash flow could be devoted to the business, and he didn't have to worry about debt service.Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now to find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.What is whole business securitization?Whole business securitization is debt supported by operating assets, such as franchise royalties and supply chain rebates. Over the last fifteen years, there has been a massive shift toward this capital structure approach in the largest franchise brands. WBS is an efficient approach to borrowing money because the interest rates can be lower. Royalties are shifted into their own bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity. For this reason, the entity can enjoy a higher credit rating (and thus lower interest rates) compared to the parent company. In addition to being capital efficient, it makes interest payments more predictable, and there is more prepayment flexibility. The market can be tapped again and again as the business continues to grow. The debt is usually portable if there is a change in control.



For these reasons, WBS is now the preferred structure in the largest franchise systems, whether publicly traded, PE-backed, or privately held. While large restaurant franchises are the largest users of WBS, the use of WBS by non-restaurants expanded 75 percent in the last four years, nearly double the growth rate of WBS in the restaurant sector. I cited this statistic, from Guggenheim Securities, in my book, Big Money in Franchising: Scaling Your Enterprise in the Era of Private Equity.Debt in franchisingThe use of debt in franchising has backed off the higher levels previously seen when junk bonds were in vogue decades ago. The market has gotten comfortable with securitization and prefers to see equity investments approaching 50 percent – consistent with PE deals outside of franchising.There are several implications for stakeholders, especially franchisees, in systems using the WBS approach:


Preservation of outlet count is paramount to the franchisor. For turnaround brands like Subway, this means an aggressive bet on international expansion to offset potential closures still to come in the US.Expansion markets will receive investments in support and franchise development to ensure all those new units get open and ramped up.Unless a unit's location is no longer viable, franchisors will generally fight closures and push for transfers instead.The push for transfers instead of closures in most large systems, tends to increase PE consolidators at the franchisee level. But Subway hasn't attracted PE consolidators because of unit level economics. Only improvement in unit profitability will open this potential.Transfer requirements may be more stringent.Development agreements will be more strongly enforced.New development agreements may have smaller unit commitments to ensure follow-through.Franchisors will more aggressively push remodels to preserve and boost royalties.Supply chain rebates will also be protected. Suppliers will find it difficult to make adjustments that negatively impact franchisor income streams if these have already been securitized.PE sponsors can withdraw hundreds of millions of dollars in distributions from large-scale brands often by adding debt to the business. If there is little or no corporate reinvestment in the future of the brand, franchisees must speak up. This is best managed in a professional, coordinated, and assertive manner via the independent franchisee association. Stall outs can and do occur when inertia creeps in and corporate milks cash flow too long. Franchisees must continue to assert themselves via the association to ensure shared reinvestment in the future.Smaller franchisesNote that in smaller franchise acquisitions, debt often isn't used at all. As PE has swept through franchising, there are fewer unaffiliated scale brands available to acquire. The result splits the players and their approaches. In larger deals, lower interest rates recently simultaneously fed price inflation and encouraged the use of debt, including securitized debt.But smaller deals are more likely to be all-cash, especially if tuck-in acquisitions within multi-brand platforms. The larger platform cash flow can always be securitized later when scale is achieved. Emerging brand PE sponsors are thus focused on accelerating growth, adding support infrastructure, building shared platform resources and, eventually, multiple arbitrages to help lift overall business valuation. The use of debt is not a core strategy to create value for the sponsor in these deals. In theory, this creates a close alignment of franchisee and sponsor interests within emerging brands and platforms.Prospective franchisees should assess where a brand is on the spectrum of activity and how much the use of debt is a core part of the value creation strategy for the sponsor itself. As long as appropriate investments in the future of the business are made, there is nothing wrong with the use of reasonable debt in an efficient capital structure. But when parent distributions significantly outweigh new investments in the business in a fast-changing marketplace, caution flags should be raised.

1,I Specialize in Exit Planning — You Need to Make These 5 Moves Before Selling Your Business,"Apr 1, 2024",Mark Kravietz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/you-need-to-make-these-5-moves-before-selling-your-business/470750,"
It's never too early to prepare your company for a sale. The business landscape is evolving rapidly, and entrepreneurs considering selling their businesses must adapt to the changing market dynamics. Strategic planning and timely decision-making can significantly impact the success of selling a business. In this article, we will explore five crucial moves business owners should make in preparation for selling their business in 2025.1. Embrace technology and digital transformationIn the digital age, technology plays a pivotal role in business operations and value proposition. As of 2022, businesses that fully embrace digital transformation are more likely to attract higher valuations when it comes time to sell. According to a study by McKinsey, companies that invest in digital capabilities experience revenue growth rates 2.5 times higher than their counterparts.To position your business for a successful sale in 2025, focus on enhancing your digital infrastructure, adopting advanced technologies and staying ahead of industry trends. Leverage data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to streamline processes, improve efficiency and demonstrate the scalability of your business to potential buyers. Most importantly, help ensure your employees are using this technology responsibly; implement an AI policy to protect your customers and employees.



Related: How Much Time Do I Need to Sell My Business? First, Consider These 7 Factors.2. Strengthen financial performanceA robust financial performance is a key driver in determining the value of a business. Prospective buyers closely scrutinize financial statements, profitability, and cash flow before making acquisition decisions. They also look for growth of earnings. I'm working with a client whose business was off significantly in 2020 and 2021 and just started to come back in 2022. There will be excellent growth from '23 to '25 and he is looking to sell by the end of '25. It was his patience, cost-cutting and streamlining of his products that turned things around. I believe he will have a successful exit.


To help maximize the value of your business, focus on improving profitability, minimizing debt and maintaining a healthy cash flow. Implement cost-cutting measures, optimize operational efficiency and diversify revenue streams. By presenting a solid financial foundation, you will increase the attractiveness of your business to potential acquirers.3. Build a strong and adaptable teamBuyers are not just acquiring a business; they are inheriting a team. Having a skilled and adaptable workforce is crucial for the long-term success of any business. According to Deloitte, organizations with strong leaders are 2.3 times more likely to financially outperform their peers.Invest in training and development programs to upskill your employees and help ensure they are equipped to navigate the evolving business landscape. Provide each employee with an annual budget for continuing education and make sure they use it! Every employee that attends a conference should present their key learnings to the company so everyone can benefit.A skilled and adaptable team adds significant value to your business, making it more appealing to potential buyers who are looking for a seamless transition.


4. Enhance customer relationships and brand equityCustomer relationships and brand equity are intangible assets that greatly influence the perceived value of a business. Additionally, a strong brand can command premium prices and create a competitive advantage.Invest in customer satisfaction initiatives, gather feedback and address any issues promptly. This is not a one-time thing, but something that must be done on a regular basis. Cultivate a positive brand image through effective marketing and public relations strategies. These initiatives take time and funds to implement, so start early and make sure to budget accordingly to keep the momentum going. By enhancing customer relationships and brand equity, you not only improve your business's market position but also make it more attractive to potential buyers who seek a reputable and customer-centric acquisition.Related: You Sold Your Business. Now What? Embracing a New Chapter with Care and Purpose5. Engage professional advisors earlyNavigating the complex process of selling a business requires knowledge and experience. Engaging professional advisors early in the process can significantly impact the outcome of the sale. In an Exit Planning Institute NY Chapter's State of Owner Readiness Survey, 78% of business owners indicated that they had a formal transition team. This shows the importance of creating a team of professionals.


Seek the assistance of financial advisors, legal professionals, merger and acquisition specialists and investment bankers. Make sure your financial advisor has experience with exit planning; the Certified Exit Planning Advisor (CEPA®) has proficiency in helping business owners sell their businesses. Their insights, negotiation skills, and market knowledge can be invaluable in maximizing the value of your business and ensuring a smooth transaction.Selling a business in 2025 requires strategic foresight and proactive measures. By embracing technology, strengthening financial performance, building a strong team, enhancing customer relationships and engaging professional advisors early, business owners can position themselves for a successful and lucrative sale. The statistics and industry insights mentioned in this article underscore the importance of these moves in the context of the evolving business landscape. As you prepare to sell your business, remember that early preparation and strategic decision-making can make all the difference in achieving a favorable outcome in the competitive market of 2025.

2,Is Franchise Ownership Your Next Wealth Move? Here's How It Compares to Four Other Income Streams,"Mar 27, 2024",David Busker,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/is-franchise-ownership-your-next-wealth-move/470620,"
Regardless of business model, industry or motivations, it's no secret that most aspiring business owners are interested in entrepreneurship to make money. But there are a plethora of options available when trying to develop your wealth portfolio. After all, anyone who is considering business ownership has likely made money in other ways — traditional jobs, passive investments, real estate, private investment syndications through friends and family, private deals or being a partner in independently owned businesses.One option for consideration lies in franchise ownership. In fact, franchises can behave like these income streams listed above but might offer additional benefits. Let's explore how owning a franchise business stacks up against four alternative income streams: a corporate job, real estate investments, non-franchise business ownership and passive investments.Related: Which Franchise Model Is Right for You? Here's How to Choose1. Franchise vs. Corporate jobMost franchise owners have a history of employment, often in corporate America — and it's a major asset, providing experience and business acumen. In terms of the number of work hours, ability to work with a team and management skills, owning a franchise is comparable to a corporate position, with key differences. Primarily, the differences stem from four major pain points that impact corporate employees:



Autonomy: It can be difficult to control your destiny (outcomes) in a corporate position, with many factors outside of your control.Flexibility: In a corporate position, you are often working on someone else's schedule, making it harder to manage your personal life.Purpose/passion: If your job doesn't provide fulfillment or you aren't satisfied selling widgets, it can be difficult to maintain an executive focus.Financial security: Corporate positions used to be the safe and secure path to building income and wealth; however, in the modern economy it becomes risky as you approach middle age and you're still in middle management.In these four areas, franchise ownership offers alternative options that allow for more control both on a broad scale and in day-to-day life.2. Franchise vs. Real estate investmentsSimilar to investing in real estate, franchising requires a certain level of upfront costs and investment. Like rental properties, owning a franchise is a big responsibility that will require upkeep, ongoing costs and hands-on management.However, franchising can often have a better return on investment than real estate. Consider a salon suite franchise in which beauty professionals are renting suites from you to run their businesses. In this scenario, you are responsible for the initial investment, leasehold improvements and filling the salon with beauty professionals. But after that point, there is not much for you to do on a day-to-day basis


Similar to investment real estate, your time in many franchise models can be very leveraged, but unlike real estate, you are providing a unique service with higher barriers to entry, typically creating stronger returns on investment. After the business gets off the ground, you'll typically enjoy high-level oversight and fewer day-to-day operations.Related: 7 Essential Questions to Ask Yourself Before Starting a Franchise3. Franchise vs. Non-franchise business ownershipWhether you own a franchise or a non-franchise brand, business ownership is business ownership, right? Wrong.Depending on your specific goals for owning a business, each of these models has a variety of options to consider. Primary differences include the level of control, the finances and time leverage available, branding and marketing say-so, research and development opportunities, staffing and training practices and shared industry knowledge.Franchise ownership means you are starting a new business, but not from square one. There is a tried and true framework in which to operate. For the right candidate, this is an ideal jumping-off point. However, if you desire control over the concept and granular details, then a non-franchise business may be a better fit. Just remember starting a business from scratch takes a lot of time for things that don't generate revenue (logo, employee manual, back office set-up, etc). If you take the business-from-scratch approach, make sure you are prepared for a long ramp-up period.4. Franchise vs. Passive investment portfolioNo business is truly passive — if you want truly passive income, then consider buying stocks and bonds. While there are franchises that are passive, they take significantly more capital (consider a hotel chain). Of course, truly passive franchise models are not within most realistic budgets.


That said, there is a middle ground. Successful franchise owners often see the time spent operating and managing the business drop off over time. Most franchise models can eventually be run by a general manager rather than the franchise owner. While it may have to be full-time at the beginning, franchise owners who have built their operations platform can grow to become semi-passive over time.If you are in the process of evaluating your portfolio and find yourself seeking alternative options, then it's worth considering franchise ownership. By comparing franchises alongside other more traditional money-making avenues like a corporate job, real estate investments, non-franchise business ownership and passive investments, you will be able to make the best decisions that match your professional goals.At the end of the day, it's important to know your options to chart the best path forward. Who knows? You just might discover your next big career move.

3,What Happens When a Food Entrepreneur Meets a Michelin Star Chef? You Get The #1 Pasta on Amazon.,"Mar 22, 2024",StackCommerce,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/what-happens-when-a-food-entrepreneur-meets-a-michelin-star/471561,"
Imagine how well a great-tasting pasta with just 9 calories and zero net carbs would sell.You don't have to imagine: It's Skinny is already the top-selling pasta on Amazon. And with the global pasta market worth more than $131 billion, investors everywhere are taking notice.It's Skinny started when co-founder Bryan Guadagno had to change his diet after being diagnosed with esophagitis. He quickly realized that most ""healthy food"" brands were anything but. These brands loaded their products with carbs, unhealthy vegetable oils, and inorganic and artificial ingredients.



There had to be a better way. And with more than 50 million people in search of foods that fit their diets, finding a solution had the potential to be lucrative.Guadagno teamed up with Barb Axleson, whom he knew had experience with food companies like Unilever and Campbell's Soup, and Elad Barkan, a Michelin-star chef, to start It's Skinny. Their mission: To help the millions of people who feel cheated by the food industry by giving them a truly natural, low calorie, gluten-free, and tasty option. It's been a stunning success.


It's Skinny is already the top-selling pasta on Amazon. They're growing by more than 80% each year, the company says, reaching a $10 million revenue run rate today. That's earned them investments from Tim Draper, the Elevator Syndicate, and more. And to keep fueling their growth, they've opened up the opportunity for everyday investors to join them.That means you can invest in It's Skinny and share in their growth. And they have a very ambitious growth plan. But before we get to that, let's take a look at exactly how they've been able to achieve this success.It's Skinny's secret ingredient.Being from New Jersey and New York, Guadagno and Axleson grew up loving pasta. So they teamed up with Barkan, a world-class chef from a Michlin Star restaurant in Italy, to make pasta that checks all the boxes.""I'm Italian so I'm hardwired to love pasta,"" Guadagno says. ""But pasta is an inflammatory food, particularly pasta crafted from domestic and enriched wheat, and it's loaded with carbohydrates.""


Rather than using wheat or other genetically modified substitutes found in most pasta, the team turned to a special plant from southeast Asia called konjac.Konjac is high in fiber and has no excess carbs. The noodles take on the rich and flavorful taste of any sauce, cheese, or meat you'd usually cook with pasta. It's Skinny, which comes in spaghetti, fettuccine, and angel hair shapes, has a texture similar to al dente pasta.Guadagno explains, ""My team and I created It's Skinny to mirror the taste and texture of conventional pasta but with a non-grain base to avoid inflammation and unnecessary carbs.""Using konjac, It's Skinny created the simplest and most convenient way to eat better without sacrificing taste. An entire 9.5oz bag has only 9 calories, 2 grams of fiber and exactly 0 net carbs, the company says. It's Skinny doesn't need to be boiled so consumers can make most meals in less than five minutes.


But creating a better pasta on paper is only half the battle. What's really exciting for investors is that consumers are loving it.The top-selling pasta on Amazon is just the start.It's Skinny's great-tasting, 9-calorie pasta is a hit. It's already the top-selling pasta on Amazon, beating out traditional brands like Barilla and legume-based competitors like Banza, the company says. They've racked up more than 3,300 5-star reviews on Amazon with people calling out the delicious taste and lifestyle compatibility. As Guadagno says, ""We consistently receive stories about consumers who are also on a lifestyle improvement journey with It's Skinny being a huge help in their efforts.""Even better? People aren't just trying it, they're repeatedly buying it. More than 6,300 people subscribe on Amazon, meaning they buy it automatically each month. It's Skinny boasts a 19% higher repeat purchase rate than other pasta brands on Amazon, too.It's Skinny doubled household penetration in 2023 and expects to double it again in 2024, the company says. But this is just the beginning. Less than 1% of households have tried It's Skinny, meaning their expansion potential is wide open. And they have an ambitious plan to scale. They aim to expand to national retailers like Costco, Kroger, Target, and more. They have the potential to add more than 20,000 new retail doors, the company says.


Plus, they're developing new product lines to grow their reach. They've already announced It's Skinny Mac, a gluten-free mac and cheese that boasts just 5 net carbs and 2 grams of fiber per serving, the company says.Their short-term goal is $30 million in sales by 2026. In the long-term, they aim to be a household name and a staple in your grocery's shelves. It's no wonder investors are lining up to grow with them.The table is set: You can invest in It's Skinny.Normally you'd have to be an accredited investor or a Wall Street hedge fund to invest in a private company like It's Skinny. But they're opening the doors for anyone to join them as an investor.It's Skinny plans to use investor capital to accelerate their growth across three channels:


Retail distribution: Fuel their brick-and-mortar expansion and increase same-store velocity with at-shelf promotions.Direct marketing: Drive more traffic to their website through digital ads and email marketing, driving new sales and repeat buyers.Digital marketplaces: Leverage digital marketing strategies to drive awareness and findability of their products on platforms like Amazon, Instacart, and retailer websites.A who's who list of investors is already on board, including Tim Draper (who invested $1M), Kip McClanahan of Silverton Ventures, Elevator Syndicate, and more.And you can join them as an It's Skinny shareholder.

4,4 Promising Industries Investors Should Be Watching in 2024,"Mar 14, 2024",Sebastian Huelck,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/promising-industries-investors-should-be-watching-this-year/470676,"
Fast-moving markets are a lot like whitewater rapids — they are unpredictable and hard to navigate. For investors and business leaders, the challenge lies in knowing where to allocate resources to ensure sustainable growth. One wrong move, and your company can land on the rocks.Global economic volatility dominated 2023, marked by trade tensions, slowing growth and political instability. Despite this, the U.S. is projected to experience slower growth in 2024 due to rising debt and interest rates, but a rebound is expected in 2025 as inflation and rates normalize. U.S. consumer spending, strong in 2023, is anticipated to slow in 2024 with rising debt but is expected to recover with falling inflation and interest rates. Business investment slowed due to higher rates, while residential investment saw a temporary increase from high demand.However, significant improvement is unlikely until rates fall. Government spending, which boosted the economy through infrastructure projects in 2023, is expected to slow in the coming years due to political uncertainties. A tight labor market, driven by retiring baby boomers, is expected to remain resilient despite a slowing economy, preventing a recession and fostering growth next year. Inflation is projected to reach the Fed's 2% target by Q3 2024, triggering interest rate cuts beginning in June. Our baseline U.S. economic forecast for 2024 can be summed up by the number 2024 — 2% growth, zero recessions, 2% inflation and unemployment staying at roughly 4%. However, there are clearly risks that could divert us from that path.As the CEO of a growing photonics company, monitoring market trends and identifying promising sectors is a major function of my job. This year, I have singled out four core industries that we as tec5USA have significant insights into — the semiconductor market with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI), food, healthcare, pharmaceutical and biotechnology — that offer the intrepid investor myriad opportunities.

It is revolutionizing industries across the board because it makes everybody's lives so much easier. On a recent business trip to San Francisco, I saw more autonomous Waymo (driverless) vehicles on the road than I did on prior visits, with neither driver nor front-seat passengers on board.


There is a lot going on behind the scenes of AI technology, especially when it comes to specialized hardware. GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) require HBM (High Bandwidth Memory), which, in turn, is stimulating memory chip growth this year. Prominent players in this arena — among them, Nvidia, the clear market leader — include AMD, Alphabet (Google), Intel and IBM.Food for thoughtUN projections put the global world population at a staggering 9.8 billion by 2050, with much of the growth expected in developing nations in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. A growing population means heightened demand for food. Clearing land for animal ranching is not a viable option anymore considering the deleterious environmental impact. That is where cell-cultivated meat sources, plant-based options and alternative foods, such as algae, come into play. Companies including Switzerland-based Nestle (one of the biggest in the world), Tyson, Kellogg's, General Mills and Hormel have entered the fray.Pet food manufacturing, a related market segment, is also experiencing robust growth. As consumers increasingly make healthy food choices for themselves, they demand the same high quality for their beloved pets. Similar methods to manufacture food for people apply to pet food, and many of the same companies, such as Mars Petcare, Nestle Purina and Hills Petcare, are cashing in on this burgeoning market.Related: This Deep Tech Firm Is Positioned To Lead the Cultivated Meat Manufacturing Revolution


A welcome shot in the armThe era of enhanced diagnostics has dawned, and healthcare professionals have an array of state-of-the-art instruments at their fingertips that were not available a few years ago. A notable innovation is optical coherence tomography — a technology like ultrasound but based on light — which is being increasingly used to identify various eye diseases, such as macular degeneration.In the area of cancer diagnostics, several cutting-edge tools have paved the way for early detection. One such detection method uses a fiber optics probe connected to a Raman spectrometer, employing a machine learning algorithm to detect malignant tissue in real-time, offering a faster alternative to biopsy. Among the companies devoting resources to enhanced diagnostics and NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing) are Roche, Illumina and Intuitive, which pioneered its Da Vinci surgical robot more than 20 years ago.Future cancer diagnostics are likely to continue evolving towards more personalized and precise approaches, including the integration of advanced technologies such as liquid biopsies for circulating tumor DNA detection, single-cell analysis techniques and artificial intelligence-driven predictive modeling. These methods aim to improve early detection, monitoring of treatment response, identification of drug-resistant mutations and the development of tailored therapeutic strategies for individual patients, ultimately enhancing cancer management and outcomes.Next-generation sequencing for cancer diagnostics involves extracting DNA or RNA from a tumor sample, which is then fragmented, amplified and sequenced to identify genetic mutations and alterations associated with cancer development.

The benefits to patients are numerous: precise dosages, pinpointed drug release and unique shapes and sizes to promote ease of swallowing.In addition to genomics and genetic testing, molecular diagnostics, liquid biopsies and pharmacogenomics, also high-resolution imaging technologies, such as MRI, CT, PET and molecular imaging techniques, aid in much better disease diagnosis, treatment planning and response assessment in personalized medicine.All the major players in the pharma industry are jumping on the personalized medicine bandwagon, including Roche, Novartis, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, BMS and Merck, to name a few.Because there are uncertainties in any market, even those earmarked for growth, it is crucial that investors do their research. That strategy could mean the difference between a company hanging on for dear life on a metaphorical, white-knuckled rafting ride down a raging river or avoiding heavy rolls on a cruise ship en route to its next port of call: return on investment.

        As someone who's pitched investors — and been declined — and now a venture capitalist, I have a unique understanding of investors' minds. 
      


        Here are seven common reasons VCs say no to startups and how you can prevent it from happening to you.
      












    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

""No.""This one little word can be the most excruciating thing to hear for entrepreneurs desperately seeking funding for their dream venture. Unfortunately, most entrepreneurs will hear ""no"" often. According to a study published in Harvard Business Review, only 1% of meetings with potential investors turn into a partnership.While it was challenging to hear investors decline my pitches as an entrepreneur, I find it just as difficult to turn down budding startups now that I'm on the other end of the spectrum. Luckily, my years of experience in both capacities have helped me better understand the minds of investors. That's why I want to share seven reasons investors might reject your business pitch.



Related: Venture Capital 101: A Comprehensive Guide for Startups Seeking Investment1. Your numbers don't line upPart of meeting with potential investors is sharing the raw numbers of your business. For some, this isn't a problem, while others feel some trepidation and may even consider making things sound better than they are. It may have been an honest mistake. Either way, venture capitalists are savvy and will always spot incongruencies, especially when they do their due diligence — which they will.


If they find the numbers you presented aren't accurate, they'll call you on it. Integrity and competency are vital for solid business partnerships, and a failure in either area could put your reputation at stake.2. Poor consumer perceptionThis may seem obvious, but if your target audience isn't buying what you're selling, neither will investors. Even if your sales numbers are considerable, if your customers aren't happy with your product or service or there's a consistent theme of discontent, that's a clear signal to step away from the table.Venture capitalists need to know that you're doing everything possible to ensure customers are satisfied and cared for. Not only are happy consumers more likely to remain loyal to your company if they're happy, there's a higher likelihood they'll share your product or service with others.3. Your company lacks diversityCulture matters. It's what drives good organizations to become better ones. A crucial part of developing a solid culture is embracing and hiring people from different backgrounds with various perspectives. This is how innovation thrives.


A lack of diversity in your company now may tell investors that building a diverse culture will become a problem as the organization grows later. One caveat: Don't make it about meeting some ""quota."" It should come from a genuine desire to expand your horizons and create positive change for your company and industry.Related: Serial Entrepreneur Turned VC Reveals 4 Numbers You Need to Know to Scale Your Company4. You seem difficult to work withEven if they believe in your business, most venture capitalists won't just hand you a check and pat you on the back. No, it's more about forming a lasting partnership to ensure the company's long-term success.That means that while it's the company you built, you're still open to new ideas or suggestions for improving it. Investors know what works and what doesn't and want to pass that on — but only to someone willing to listen. If you come off as an entrepreneur who must have everything done your way, you'll be hard-pressed to find willing suitors.


5. Your business won't stand outYou can have a solid business model with a quality product or service, but your company will blend in with the rest if nothing differentiates you from what's out there already. In a market likely saturated with similar ideas, investors want to see something that will make your idea stand out. How is what you offer innovative from what currently exists? If it's not, they won't be interested.Successful entrepreneurs know their market and customer base inside and out. They have done extensive research on what others are doing so that they can deliver something special.6. You're underpreparedSimply getting a meeting with venture capitalists is a feat in itself. With hundreds of proposals and pitches coming at them, their time is a finite resource. There are no second chances.If a question from an investor catches you off guard or you don't have a satisfactory answer at the ready, you're not likely to gain their confidence and support. I know you're likely putting in 20-hour days just to keep your dream alive, but you can't afford to be off when you have a shot like this.


It's a lot of pressure to be under, but it's also an excellent chance to show investors you can handle it. Despite everything you're going through, coming prepared for every possible scenario or challenge speaks volumes to your ability to lead a successful business.Related: Embrace Change or Miss Out On Money — 5 Trends to Know in Venture Capital This Year7. It's just not a good fitRejection isn't always something wrong with your business. Sometimes, investors say no because your company doesn't fit well with their investment portfolio. Every venture capitalist has a specific investment strategy that they adhere to. It's how they became successful in the first place. They'll occasionally take a chance on a business idea outside their realm, but that's only if they feel confident it's a can't-miss opportunity.For some, it might be less about the industry or market and more about your company's growth stage. Regardless, do your homework on the investors and firms you're meeting with. What's their typical profile? What markets do they usually go for? Do they tend to invest more in Series A funding or other rounds? Like any other interview, you need to know who you're talking to and have your questions ready.


These are just a few examples of why you might not get the support you're hoping for from investors. It can come down to countless factors, some within your control and others not. The best advice I can give you is to use every rejection — every ""no"" — as fuel to improve your business, your product, and yourself until you find that one ""yes"" you're looking for.

6,How to Identify and Address Dysfunctional Venture Capital Relationships in the Startup Ecosystem,"Mar 6, 2024","Jena Booher, Ph.D.",https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-navigate-dysfunctional-founder-investor-relationships/469424,"
The venture capital (VC) world has long been characterized by its tight-knit and somewhat private community. Founders typically maintain a low profile regarding what transpires behind closed doors, largely due to their significant financial reliance on the investor community.Understanding the dynamics within this community can be challenging without direct exposure or day-to-day interactions with investors or founders. Over the past two years, my increased involvement in the VC community has brought to light both commendable individuals and concerning trends that have direct implications for founders.In the realm of venture capital, there are VCs who genuinely support founders, but there are also those who exhibit behaviors that can hinder entrepreneurial success. Despite a shared desire among all stakeholders for optimal business performance, founders and VCs occasionally grapple with misaligned incentives. While investors may have the intellectual intention to support their founders, there exists a challenge in fostering an environment where founders feel comfortable being open about what is or isn't working in the founder-investor relationship.



Drawing from my expertise as a business psychologist, I have observed the financial repercussions of founders becoming sidetracked by managing investor relationships at the expense of their businesses. My aim is to shed light on these observed issues and encourage VCs to reflect on their actions. Projecting emotional or mental health issues onto invested founders not only risks financial returns but also exacerbates challenges for entrepreneurs already facing significant obstacles.Related: 5 Tips for Navigating the Entrepreneur/Investor Relationship


Three prevalent dysfunctional VC archetypes emerge1. The Bully:The Bully archetype within the VC landscape often presents as an investor with an initially charismatic and supportive demeanor. However, this façade quickly transforms after the ink has dried on the contract. These VCs may lack substantial operating experience as CEOs, leading them to impose their subjective views on what it takes to be a successful CEO. Criticism often targets the founder's decisions and sometimes questions their character, suggesting they are ill-suited for the role or negligent in their fiduciary duties.The Bully employs vague strategic advice intentionally, creating ambiguity to make failure more likely. This lack of clarity allows the Bully to seize opportunities to point out the founder's supposed incompetence, negatively impacting the founder's self-esteem and decision-making. The unpredictable nature of interactions with such VCs further contributes to an unhealthy founder-investor dynamic.Bully archetype snapshot:Qualities: Lack of operational experience; emotional volatility; creates ""gotcha"" scenariosImpact: Harmful for founder self-esteem; insecure attachment; relationship between founder and investor leads to lack of trust2. The Daddy:The Daddy archetype is characterized by a patronizing attitude and a hero complex. These investors leverage their initial belief in the founder as a tool for manipulation, reminding the founder of their unwavering support. This dynamic can lead to breaches of professional boundaries, with the investor overstepping by providing unsolicited advice. The fragile ego of the Daddy investor is highlighted, revealing a need for constant validation from founders to maintain their perceived relevance and importance. This emotional reliance distracts founders from their primary responsibilities, creating an imbalanced power dynamic detrimental to business success.


Daddy archetype snapshot:Qualities: insecure; manipulative; breach of professional boundariesImpact: imbalanced power, as the founder may find it challenging to assert independence or make decisions without the constant approval of the Daddy investor.3. The Neurotic:


The Neurotic archetype enters the VC community, often through familial or friend connections, with a potential lack of resilience for the roller-coaster ride of startup life. While these VCs may possess impressive intelligence and academic credentials, they struggle to endure the inevitable ups and downs of the startup ecosystem. Their inability to weather challenges prompts excessive involvement in their portfolio companies, seeking regular updates on performance. This behavior is driven by a lack of thick skin for the job, leading them to emotionally lean on founders during tough times.While their intentions may be well-founded, the Neurotic archetype needs to cultivate greater resilience. Instead of emotionally dumping on their founders, seeking external support for managing anxiety over their portfolio's performance is crucial for maintaining a healthy investor-founder relationship.Neurotic archetype snapshot:Qualities: excessive involvement; need for constant reassurance; lacking resilienceImpact: poor emotional boundaries; looking for the founder to relieve their distress, which leads to founders becoming distracted from core business problemsRelated: The Relationship Between Founders and Investors Transcends Beyond CapitalCharting a course forwardThe venture capital industry operates under immense pressure, leading to stress, anxiety and a fear of failure. Nonetheless, founders can't bear the brunt of VC stress, and if you identify with one of these archetypes, it's essential to address the core issues.If you find yourself exhibiting Bully or Daddy behaviors and feel the need to assert power over others, it's likely that someone wielded power over you in your past. That is a wound that has gone unaddressed and unhealed. Without judgment, find a way to explore that core wound with a trusted therapist to diminish emotional projections.


If you're displaying behaviors exhibited by the Neurotic archetype, you should be aware of your challenges, surround yourself with supportive individuals who can model emotional regulation, and utilize tools for anxiety management like mindfulness, therapy and nervous system regulation.If you're a founder facing a contentious relationship with investors, especially if it verges on an abusive situation, my advice to you is to stop blaming yourself for not ""figuring this out"" sooner. In my experience, founders blame themselves first and then internalize the stress and shame. Also, look to establish boundaries, keep business discussions within scheduled meetings, and consider bringing others to meetings for support. People can show up better when there are more folks in the room.Investors and founders alike should schedule periodic sessions to openly discuss the dynamics of their relationship. Just like any interpersonal connection, it's crucial to approach these conversations with care, ensuring they are structured to focus on the health and effectiveness of the overall partnership.Navigating the founder-investor relationship is tough, but it's crucial to remember shared interests. Choose differently to avoid making the startup journey harder than necessary. In the startup world, where the odds are always against you, how you choose to turn those odds around matters.

7,Here's Where Venture Capitalists Are Putting Their Money in 2024 — and What Startups Must Do to Attract Funding,"Feb 26, 2024",Vitaly Gerko,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/top-5-industries-attracting-investment-dollars-in-2024/469714,"
In venture capital, certain niches are more relevant in certain periods and attract the biggest number of entrepreneurs. This is mostly influenced by world events and the demands of states, society or businesses. In 2020-2021, many developments revolved around the pandemic and online interaction: telemedicine platforms, the heyday of ecommerce, including payment and delivery systems, remote work and training services, the explosion of crypto projects and investment platforms.The modern environment dictates new rules. Current events are inextricably linked to the geopolitical situation and financial instability. The era of cheap money has passed — to curb inflation, financial regulators started increasing interest rates. Since March 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve has been increasing the key rate at each meeting (for the first time since 2018). This led to continuous interest rate growth — in July 2023, the range reached the current 5.25-5.5%.Last September, the European Central Bank increased the interest rate to a record 4.5%, which was the tenth time they increased it in 14 months, reaching the highest level since the introduction of the Euro in 1999. For startups looking to expand or just stay afloat, this leads to a decrease in available cash flow and an increase in business loan payments. At the same time, growing rates tempt investors to give preference to businesses with established profitability.Current events directly affect the investment landscape. According to CB Insights, by the end of 2023, global venture capital financing decreased by 42% compared to 2022 and amounted to $248.4B, while the number of deals decreased by 30%.Venture capitalists started leaning towards a more conservative position, exploring strategies that are likely to pay off in the next five years or are fundamental to the world and technology. The coming years are expected to be a time of thoughtful decisions and careful investments.



Related: Venture Capital 101: A Comprehensive Guide for Startups Seeking InvestmentTop 5 most relevant industries for investmentBut let's not be pessimistic — there are areas that continue to develop extensively to this day. Here is the list of the most in-demand niches for both startups and investors:


1.  Artificial Intelligence (AI)Generative AI blew up the market and brought new investment activity: In 2023, one round shook the venture capital world — Microsoft invested $10B in OpenAI. On top of that, more than 70 rounds in the total amount of about $100M were dedicated to startups that create models, provide infrastructure or apply technology for a specific application (e.g., companies like Anthropic, Adept AI, Inflection AI, Jasper, Descript and Stability AI).In 2024 and in the following years, the use of technology will expand dramatically. In January, OpenAI launched the GPT Store marketplace, which features trained AI assistants (chatbots) based on the GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 language models. These assistants have built-in prompts (tips or instructions), so you just need to select the right assistant for the task and briefly explain the task. At the moment, the marketplace features around 3 million versions of AI assistants for a variety of tasks: from program training to casual movie selection. Today, anyone can create an AI tool and place it on the marketplace to be accessed by all users.Another trend in the development of AI is B2B: increased integration of technology into solutions for business, healthcare, finance and other industries.


Already at the beginning of this year, there were two major funding rounds in this direction: startup Kore.ai raised $150M (offers AI-powered virtual assistants and applications for enhancing customer and employee experiences across various industries) and Zum — $140M (the company helps schools improve efficiency and reduce the cost of managing their bus fleets using an AI-based platform).2. Biotechnology (BioTech) and healthcare (HealthTech)According to Silicon Valley Bank, 2023 was the third biggest year for the U.S. venture capital investments in healthcare projects over the past decade (funding decreased by just 14% compared to 2022).Already at the beginning of 2024, there have been major funding rounds in the industry. For example, $105M was raised by biotech company Cour Pharmaceuticals (it focuses on the development of disease-modifying therapies to treat patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases). Also, the biopharmaceutical company Basking Biosciences, which develops therapies for the treatment of stroke, received investments of $55M.


Such demand is related to the social significance of the industry. In addition, Covid-19 highlighted problems in global medicine and accelerated developments that will help to respond to new threats quickly. In the coming years, we will see a stronger focus on biomedicine and data-driven healthcare. The integration of artificial intelligence and big data analytics into medical research and diagnostics increases both the effectiveness of disease treatment and the developments in this area.3. Marketing (MarTech) and advertising technology (AdTech)According to a Forrester study, the global market for marketing technologies is expected to grow by 13.3% a year in the coming years, compared with 10.9% in 2023. Its growth is largely influenced by major B2C brands: Last year, they spent 18% of their marketing budget on technology. This share is expected to grow further, with data management (AI and machine learning) as the main item for investment.Companies also have a request for products that include several integrated tools and technologies for solving different tasks (from the Forrester report: 47% of marketers expressed the desire to reduce the number of products they use).


In a scenario where cookies will no longer be used, there is an urgent need to develop standalone solutions that will help businesses capture their own accurate user data. Again, these could be products utilizing AI or other technologies.4. Financial technology (fintech)Over the past decade, fintech has been brought to the forefront of progress. To this day, this is facilitated by the growth of the banking sector, rapid digitalization, changes in user preferences and growing support from investors and regulators.According to the McKinsey report, in July 2023, the market capitalization of publicly trading fintech companies amounted to $550B, which is twice as much as in 2019. The USA was the region with the largest number of fintech startups, with over 11,500 companies registered in the country. Stripe (payment processing) and Chime (online banking) are recognized as the largest global players. In total, there are more than 272 fintech unicorns in the world, which is seven times more than six years ago. This data indicates that the industry is in high demand and it periodically gives rise to successful fintech players.5. ESG startups


An extensive industry that includes areas corresponding to the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals: ClimateTech, UrbanTech, renewable energy, eco transport, social projects and more. More and more investors are expressing interest in the field. According to Statista, 50% of professional investors worldwide plan to increase funding for socially relevant projects in 2024.In 2023, there were two major rounds of financing for ESG startups (comparable to financing for AI): $1.1 billion invested in Generate Capital (renewable energy sources) and $1 billion invested in Redwood Materials (production of materials for electric car batteries).In addition, more and more consumers are becoming concerned about the environmental and social impact of the products they use, and they are willing to spend more on conscious brands. As a result, corporations are developing their own solutions in this area and purchasing startup developments (from recyclable packaging to logistical solutions that reduce carbon emissions, etc).Here is a thought-provoking study by Stanford University. It showed that approximately two-thirds of Generation Z and millennial investors are concerned about environmental and social issues. While the majority of investors aged 58 and older expressed little or no concern about those issues. Moreover, young people are willing to tolerate lower returns in order to achieve ESG goals. We can conclude that young investors and startups create the driving force in this industry.In addition to the above-mentioned industries, there is a demand for projects that increase resistance to threats (for example, cybersecurity). Areas such as SpaceTech, autonomous transport, and agricultural and food technologies are also developing.


Related: 4 Crucial Indicators To Know Before Seeking Venture Capital FundingWhat should a startup's founder have in order to attract funding?Effective idea and business model: Investors assess the unique potential of the startup, its competitiveness and scalability. The assessment is based on a pitch, which includes, among other things: a roadmap — a plan of strategic development (goals, objectives, deadlines, key milestones), and a go-to-market strategy — a strategy for attracting customers.It is also important to evaluate the economics of the project. It should include a forecast of income, expenses, profit, cash flow and other indicators for a certain period. Based on these indicators, the founder estimates approximately how much investment the project will need for a period of six or 12 months.Proof of concept (traction) and MVP: These days, venture capitalists want to see evidence that the product has already partially entered the market and can provide metrics by which investors can determine its progress. Therefore, it is easier for a startup to receive bigger funding at the seed round than at the idea stage (pre-seed). In other words, the founder should start searching for investors after developing an MVP — a prototype of the product.


Of course, you can still approach investors with an idea, but in this case, it would be more appropriate to enter an accelerator or incubator. This option is also viable if you have already launched a successful project from scratch, showing that you have a proof of concept and can be trusted.Choosing and tracking the right metrics: There are no universal metrics — the selection depends on the industry and the stage of business development. You should start with bigger metrics such as average purchase amount or session duration and follow to a conversion funnel.You need to understand that your actions directly affect the tracked metrics, including the most important marker. In product businesses, this is the North Star Metric (NSM) — an important indicator that is used to assess the overall success of a company and the achievement of its strategic goals. NSM is often related to how users interact with a product and how well it fulfills their needs. This can include the number of active users, customer satisfaction, total sales or another major indicator.Professional team: The team behind a project is essential. Investors expect to see a strong team with capable leaders who can execute a business plan and drive growth. It is important to highlight the strengths of the entire team, as it will help increase the level of trust.


Understanding the exit strategy for investors: From the very start, investors are normally interested in the process of exiting the project in the future: either through an IPO, a merger, an acquisition or other strategies.I should note that each business angel or VC fund may attach different levels of importance to the listed features depending on their approach to investments.Related: 4 Strategies for Creating a Compelling Business Plan That Actually Attracts Investors — and Secures FundingOther important notes for startups and investorsIf you are an investor, I recommend looking at projects in the field that you have expertise in. If you want to discover new areas, you can access professional platforms that will help you learn about unfamiliar niches and invest more effectively.


If you are a startup founder, it is especially important to be able to assess risks before launching a product and to have an immediate business strategy. Also, use your time efficiently while waiting for an angel: Develop your product and attract early adopters or customers for testing.In order to make venture agreements profitable for all parties, be as open as possible — show real forecasts, make transparent goals, and do not be afraid to point out areas that need to be improved. If you manage to reach a partnership, provide honest reports in the process of work. This will ensure long-term relationships with investors and partners and will push your business towards short and long-term development.

8,Don't Fall Victim to Rental Fraud. Adopt These Smart Practices to Prevent This From Happening to You.,"Feb 19, 2024",Ryan Barone,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/dont-fall-victim-to-rental-fraud-adopt-these-smart/468241,"
A Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report found that fraud, identity theft and other deceptions spiked 67% in the U.S. between 2019 and 2021. A sizable portion of those descriptions occurred in the rental housing industry, according to Snappt, which estimates that 11 million fraudulent rental applications were submitted in the U.S. in 2021. Furthermore, its 2022 State of Apartment Tenant Screening Survey found that 85% of apartment property managers feel consumers are becoming more comfortable committing application fraud.As a real estate investor, there are many types of rental fraud and scams that can have serious financial and legal implications on your business, which can negatively impact your personal life as well. Prospective tenants may provide fraudulent information to gain access to your property. This includes using false identification or someone else's identity to pass background and credit checks. Some may falsify employment information or income by using fake pay stubs or employer references to appear financially stable and meet the rental criteria.There are also subletting scams, where tenants sublet the property without the landlord's permission, causing damage or legal issues; overpayment scams, where a tenant or potential tenant overpays with a check and then obtains a refund of the excess amount before the original check bounces; and repair scams, where tenants intentionally cause damage to the property and offer to repair it, only to demand rent reductions or refunds.



In this digital age, when it's easier than ever for bad actors to steal identities and perpetrate deceptive practices in the rental industry, real estate investors must adopt these smart and savvy practices to protect themselves from rental fraud.Related: What Is Rent Payment Fraud and How Can Landlords Prevent It? Here Are 3 Expert Tips.


Use a formal rental application processIt is imperative to have a standardized and formal application process to gather the information necessary to properly evaluate applicants and set a professional tone from the beginning of the relationship. It is an opportunity to communicate the landlord's expectations and rental policies, but it also demonstrates professionalism, setting a tone that is more likely to attract high-quality renters.A formal application should be designed to collect all the necessary information required to make the most informed decision, including employment history, credit information, past rental history and references. Red flags to look for during this information-gathering process include inconsistencies in an applicant's history or gaps in information, which might warrant further investigation or serve as a reason to weed out that candidate.There are many other benefits to having a formal application process that serves to mitigate risk. For instance, it can help identify applicants who might default on rent, cause property damage, or engage in illegal activities on the premises. It can also help ensure compliance with local and federal housing laws and promote organization and good record keeping.If setting up a formal application process that is thorough, compliant, and mitigates risk seems overwhelming, you may want to consider seeking help from a professional property manager who has the experience and resources to do it properly. If that option is too costly, property management software (particularly one with customizable options) can automate the process for you, saving time and money while ensuring the security of your investment.


Conduct thorough background checks Probably the most critical part of preventing rental fraud is conducting comprehensive background checks on potential tenants. This includes running credit checks, verifying employment, checking criminal and eviction reports and reviewing references from previous landlords. Background checks help to detect fraudulent actors as well as assess the reliability and trustworthiness of candidates and gauge how likely they are to pay rent on time and treat the property respectfully.Credit checks are the most common part of background screenings. They provide insights into the applicant's financial background, including their history of timely payments and outstanding debts. Finding renters who demonstrate financial stability suggests they present a lower risk of rent defaults. However, background checks shouldn't end there.A thorough background check should screen applicants for a criminal history. Knowing whether a candidate has a criminal background is crucial for the safety and security of the property and other tenants or neighbors. However, you must comply with fair housing laws and regulations regarding the use of criminal history in rental decisions.Collecting references from previous landlords can also help identify applicants who have a history of causing property damage or other lease violations. Selecting reliable tenants not only lowers the risk of rental fraud but also reduces evictions, lease breaks, and tenant turnover, which means fewer vacancies and more rental income stability.


Verify identity, income and assetsOne crucial and often overlooked part of the application and background screening processes is identity, income and asset verification. Identity verification confirms that the applicant is indeed the person they claim to be. This is crucial in avoiding identity theft scenarios where a fraudster might use stolen personal information, such as forged or stolen IDs and financial statements, to pass a background check.Verifying government-issued IDs, such as a driver's license or passport, is a common method of identity verification, but given that identity theft cases have nearly tripled in the last decade, it's important to match these documents with the applicant's face. It's best to meet tenants in person, whenever possible, to verify their identity and gauge their sincerity and reliability. If that's not possible, set up a Zoom or video call and require that they turn their camera on for the meeting. This reduces identity fraud by forcing applicants to produce government-issued IDs that match their faces.Income and asset verification is another important component of this process. It's helpful to establish a good financial picture of a prospective tenant. Looking at an applicant's paystubs, bank statements or investment accounts ensures that they have the financial resources to pay rent consistently. However, these documents can also be faked, and applicants may not want to share such personal information (which is understandable as that can lead to fraud against them as well). This is another instance where advanced technology can help. Look for software platforms that can seamlessly verify the income and assets of prospective renters without requiring the exchange of sensitive documents.Secure personal and financial informationProperty investors must also take steps to secure their, as well as their tenants, personal and financial information. First and foremost, limit information sharing to only what is necessary and use secure, encrypted communication methods for exchanging sensitive information. If it's necessary to store personal information, keep physical documents in a secure location, such as a locked filing cabinet or safe and use encrypted digital storage solutions for digital documents.


Other precautions include regularly updating software to ensure you're using the most current versions that include patches for security vulnerabilities; using strong, complex and unique passwords for all online accounts; implementing two-factor authentication for accessing online accounts to add an extra layer of security; using secure networks such as virtual private network (VPN) when accessing your information on public networks; and regularly monitoring bank accounts, credit reports, and other financial accounts for any unauthorized or suspicious activity.Educate yourself and stay informedFinally, one of the best ways to protect yourself against fraud is to remain vigilant by continuously educating yourself and staying informed and up to date with the latest rental fraud tactics. For instance, understanding local rental laws can help you spot inconsistencies or illegal requests in applications or conversations. Reading up on various types of fraud, as well as new trends and how old trends are evolving, are the first steps towards prevention.If you're not experienced in property management or feel overwhelmed by the effort required to protect yourself from fraud, consider enlisting a professional service. There are technologies available that can automate and streamline most of the practices and processes outlined above. However you choose to do it, taking proactive steps to secure your investments will limit, if not eliminate, your exposure to rental fraud.

9,"Why Chick-fil-A is the Best Fast-Food Concept But an Average Franchise Opportunity, According to One Industry Expert","Feb 15, 2024",Ryan Zink,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/discover-the-paradox-of-chick-fil-as-franchise-model/469124,"
Chick-fil-A, a renowned fast-food establishment with an 80-year legacy, is celebrated for its fan-favorite cuisine, top-notch service, and memorable 'my pleasure' experiences. However, its franchise opportunity comes with a unique twist. In this article, we'll dive into what makes Chick-fil-A an exceptional fast food concept while only being an average franchise opportunity.Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now to find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.Unwavering focusChick-fil-A's secret sauce lies in its unwavering focus. Just like aiming a rifle precisely at a target, Chick-fil-A hones in on a few key aspects it knows it can excel at, and it does so brilliantly. This approach is similar to being a ""rifle"" rather than a ""shotgun"" in business. It's all about hitting one bullseye rather than several random targets.Before we get into what makes Chick-fil-A an exceptional concept, let's rewind a bit and explore the history of this iconic brand.



The birth of Chick-fil-AIn 1946, the founder, Truett Cathy, began his journey with a restaurant he named the Dwarf House — it wasn't even named Chick-fil-A yet. Cathy was on a quest to perfect the chicken sandwich, a pursuit that spanned a whopping 18 years. Finally, in 1964, he achieved chicken sandwich perfection with a simple combination of bread, chicken, butter, and pickles.He trademarked the name Chick-fil-A, with the ""A"" signifying grade A quality. Chick-fil-A was born, and the same mouth-watering chicken sandwich we enjoy today is a testament to Cathy's unwavering commitment to excellence.Related: 5 Things You Need to Know Before Investing in a Chick-fil-A Franchise


The Chick-fil-A experienceWhen you think of Chick-fil-A, what comes to mind? Great food served quickly, impeccable service, and, of course, that ever-present smile. ""My pleasure"" seems to be the anthem of Chick-fil-A employees, making every visit a delightful experience. Chick-fil-A has set the standard for what a fast-food restaurant should be.Just as Southwest Airlines is known for online flights and Ritz-Carlton for five-star service, Chick-fil-A stands out as a brand that instantly conveys its mission. It's a brand that speaks for itself, one where you understand precisely what they do.Non-stop growthChick-fil-A isn't just a successful fast-food chain; it's an industry titan. It currently reigns supreme as the highest-grossing fast food chain globally. But here's the intriguing part: others have followed its model and are thriving too. Names like Raising Cane's and In-N-Out Burger have embraced Chick-fil-A's philosophy of doing less but doing it exceptionally well.Chick-fil-A's remarkable achievement includes an unprecedented 60 years of non-stop business growth since the first store opened in 1967. The impact of this extraordinary journey is evident in the fact that Chick-fil-A averages over $5 million per location. That's more than what McDonald's and Burger King combined can claim.Related: 24 Interesting Facts You Should Know About Chick-fil-AChik-fil-A's cultureThese five reasons combine to drive Chik-fil-A's success:


Food Quality: Chick-fil-A's menu is intentionally limited, focusing on what they do best. This streamlined approach ensures top-notch quality and a loyal customer base.Customer Experience: Chick-fil-A's employees are trained to create exceptional experiences for customers. The core four principles - make eye contact, smile, speak enthusiastically, and stay connected - are the foundation of their service excellence.Belief in Something: Closing on Sundays, even when it could mean more revenue, shows Chick-fil-A's commitment to its values. This choice has created a fiercely loyal following.Building a Strong Brand: Chick-fil-A has built an iconic brand over eight decades, standing as a shining example for other restaurants.Profit Margins: With an average profit margin of around 30%, Chick-fil-A franchisees can expect substantial returns on their investment.The catch(es)Now, you might wonder, with such stellar success, why isn't Chick-fil-A considered the ultimate franchise opportunity? Two crucial factors set it apart from the traditional franchise model.


1. Lack of Exit Value: Chick-fil-A franchisees do not have the opportunity to sell their business or its assets. Once they're done, they're out. There's no exit strategy, which is a significant drawback for those seeking long-term investment.2. Limited Growth: Chick-fil-A franchisees can only own one location. While this laser focus aligns with the brand's philosophy, it hinders those aspiring to scale and grow their franchise empire.Related: Why Chick-fil-A Employees Never Say 'You're Welcome'Still a dream for manyDespite these limitations, Chick-fil-A offers an enticing proposition for a specific group of individuals. Here's why:Low Entry Cost: The initial investment is a mere $10,000, with virtually no risk involved.Profit Share: Chick-fil-A franchisees typically earn around 5-7% of the business's profits. Considering an average location's revenue, this translates to a substantial income. However, there's a significant caveat: The competition to become a Chick-fil-A franchisee is fierce. With more than 50,000 applicants annually and only a handful of new locations opening, the odds of being selected are less than 1%.


Chick-fil-A undeniably boasts one of the best fast-food concepts in the world. It has mastered the art of focus, quality and customer service. Yet, when it comes to franchise opportunities, it falls short due to the absence of exit value and limited growth potential. While Chick-fil-A may be a dream come true for some fortunate individuals, it may not align with the aspirations of those seeking scalable and long-term franchise investments.

10,The Difference Between Startup Success and Failure Comes Down to This One Thing,"Feb 12, 2024",Hilt Tatum IV,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/the-difference-between-startup-success-and-failure-comes/468936,"
In every company, employees are an invaluable resource. Not only are they the ones who help startups hit the ground running, working fast and furious to meet outrageous goals, but they also bring an incredible background of education, experience, abilities, creativity and more.These are the intangible factors that make human capital such a critical piece of the startup puzzle.As a former entrepreneur and now an investor who helps startups realize their dreams, I know how a talented and motivated workforce can mean the difference between a successful business venture and one that fails.



Let's discuss how human capital can be the secret weapon for a thriving startup.Related: Beyond the Basics: 5 Surprising Qualities Investors Seek in a Winning Team


Invest in people and their skillsWhile entrepreneurs have great ideas, they need a team with the right abilities to take their vision from a concept to a viable product or service. That means finding the right people with particular skills and experiences to drive innovation and solve problems others can't.Personality, attitude and work ethic are crucial. That's one element of human capital that can't be ignored. You can hire someone who is the best in their field, but if they create division and strife in your team, it won't work.Conversely, your startup's success depends on people who know what they're doing and do it well. It's hard to build a strong company with good people who aren't contributing to the day-in-day-out technical needs of the organization.It's a balancing act you must evaluate correctly the first time, as hiring the wrong person can set your company back. And in the fast-paced startup environment, that doesn't bode well for future investments.


Attracting and keeping top talentAnyone familiar with startup culture knows that it can get pretty vicious when you're trying to hire the best talent. It's highly competitive, with many fledgling companies vying for precious capital.That's why creating a culture that attracts the right candidates is essential. With so much transition over the past decade, there are not many ways startups can differentiate themselves in a tangible sense, such as working virtually, ping pong tables, free food, etc. With most companies already offering those things, it becomes more about selling your vision and what the future could hold with the right people on board. Appealing to a candidate's sense of self-worth and intrinsic value can go a long way to bring them on.However, once you have them in the fold, the game's not over yet. According to Founders Circle, the average employee tenure in high-growth startups is two years. If getting them in the door wasn't hard enough, keeping them there is even more challenging.This attrition rate makes sense. Startup life is a grind, and it can quickly take a toll on everyone within the organization. That's why employee engagement initiatives are so important. As an entrepreneur, you have to remember that you have real people working for you, and even the most devoted among them have needs.


Talk with your team members individually and have honest conversations about how they're doing, how the company is doing and how your team can help each other through challenging periods. Ask them what they need or if there's any further education or learning that might help them in their roles. You have no idea how the simple act of taking time to attend to your employees, treating them as people and not resources, can motivate them to keep their eyes on the prize.Related: Here's What's Brewing in the Minds of Startup InvestorsA culture of continuous learningWhile the scheduling and budget constraints of running a startup can be brutal sometimes, it's still important to carve out opportunities for your people to focus on enhanced learning and skill development. Giving employees the chance to pursue their passions and improve their craft is an integral part of the human capital process.If you think about the technology and software industries, change and evolution are constant. It only makes sense that you want your team to stay updated on the latest trends and developments, bringing these new insights into your organization. You want your team to evolve with the technology they're working with, so allow them time to focus on the latest updates and integrate those ideas into their daily work.


Not only is this an essential investment in your company, but you're also sending your people the message that you value them and their careers. You want them to be the best versions of themselves and give them opportunities to build on their knowledge and experiences.That can be scary, as it's always a possibility they may take all this new knowledge to another organization. But that's a risk you should be willing to take if it means improving your product and service while bolstering your company culture.Building a winning teamAs mentioned, I've been on both sides of startup life as an entrepreneur and an investor. In my experience, I have found and firmly believe that no single individual can get all the work done, nor do they have the talent to do so.As a leader within an organization, it's your responsibility to recognize that you can't do it all, and you shouldn't have to. Finding the right people makes an incredible difference in the work you do. That includes building a diverse and inclusive team. A robust and diverse team is a good signal to investors of a healthy organization, and it also pushes your team to think in new, innovative ways crucial to development.


Every person in your organization should be seen as a strategic ally and resource for your company's continued growth, development and success.

11,Netflix streaming toward uncharted heights,"Jan 24, 2024",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/netflix-streaming-toward-uncharted-heights/468764,"
Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) has surged today in the stock market. The company recently released earnings, showcasing a remarkable corporate resilience and strategic insight display. Netflix headlines have captivated investors as the company continues reshaping the streaming industry landscape. The final quarter of 2023 marked a turning point for Netflix, as it shattered subscriber growth expectations and showcased its financial prowess. 



Subscriber surge and financial vigorNetflix’s recent earnings report reveals that in the final quarter of 2023, Netflix experienced a significant increase in its subscriber base. The company added an impressive 13.1 million subscribers, which elevated the company's global subscriber count to 260 million. This substantial growth shattered previous company records and significantly surpassed the projections set by Netflix analysts. The achievement signals a recovery and a robust expansion in Netflix's market reach and consumer appeal


Netflix's financials show that the company's performance mirrored this upward trend in subscriber growth. Netflix reported a revenue of $8.8 billion, an accomplishment that eclipsed prior market forecasts. This revenue growth directly results from the increased subscriber base and suggests effective monetization strategies for Netflix. Despite this revenue triumph, the company experienced a minor shortfall in its per-share earnings estimates. However, this discrepancy did not detract from the company's overall financial success, as evidenced by the subsequent positive response in the stock market and the entertainment stock sector.Following the earnings announcement, Netflix's shares experienced a rise in after-hours trading. This surge is a reflection of the market's response to Netflix's Q4 performance and is indicative of growing investor confidence. It also caps off a year where Netflix's stock value has increased by around 65%, a substantial gain that highlights the resilience and strength of Netflix's business model, especially in a market characterized by fluctuations and uncertainties.Content diversity and pioneering partnershipsNetflix's recent climb in the streaming market is fundamentally due to its dynamic and multifaceted content strategy. The company's portfolio, featuring a mix of in-house productions and strategic collaborations, has played a pivotal role in attracting and retaining a diverse global audience.


Flagship programs and original productions are leading the charge in Netflix's content arsenal. ""Squid Game: The Challenge,"" a reality show spin-off from the top-rated series ""Squid Game,"" is an example of the company's ability to leverage its existing intellectual properties creatively. Similarly, critically acclaimed adaptations like ""All the Light We Cannot See"" have garnered viewer attention and critical acclaim, further cementing Netflix's reputation as a purveyor of quality content.The company's content strategy extends beyond English-language programming, embracing the global nature of its audience. Shows like ""Lupin,"" a French series, have significantly contributed to Netflix's international appeal, resonating with non-English speaking audiences and broadening the company's subscriber base. This strategy underscores Netflix's acknowledgment of its global audience's varied tastes and preferences and its dedication to satisfying this diversity through extensive content.A strategic milestone in Netflix's content strategy was the announcement of its partnership with World Wrestling Entertainment (NYSE: WWE) to broadcast ""Raw"" starting in 2025. This $5 billion deal is a groundbreaking venture for Netflix, marking its first significant foray into the live sports entertainment genre. 


Including WWE programming in its content lineup is a bold step into a new domain, diversifying its offerings and potentially tapping into a new subscriber demographic. This move indicates Netflix's willingness to explore new content territories and innovate beyond the traditional confines of streaming service offerings.Subscription innovations: A revenue revolutionNetflix's innovative approach to subscription models has played a crucial role in its financial success. Introducing an ad-supported tier led to a 70% increase in memberships within this segment, now accounting for 40% of all new sign-ups in available markets. Netflix implemented strategic price hikes, which, contrary to expectations, did not hinder subscriber growth. The crackdown on password sharing also contributed to revenue growth, underscoring the company's agility in adapting to market challenges and consumer behavior.Bullish projections and praiseThe financial market's response to Netflix's recent performance has been overwhelmingly positive, with a spectrum of analysts expressing a bullish outlook on the company's prospects. Renowned financial research firms and analysts have been vocal in praising Netflix, often classifying it as a top-tier growth stock. 


This classification underscores Netflix's perceived potential to surpass general market growth trends, indicating a strong belief in its capacity for sustained success and profitability. Such high rankings are typically reserved for companies with robust growth prospects, innovation, and a solid market position.In-depth analyses by various market research platforms and financial experts have consistently echoed this optimistic stance. Most of these analysts have conferred a ""buy"" rating on Netflix's stock, signifying their confidence in its value appreciation potential. This consensus is not merely a reflection of current achievements but also a decisive vote of confidence in Netflix's strategic direction and ability to adapt and thrive in a competitive market environment.Several leading financial institutions have maintained positive ratings on Netflix's stock and revised their price targets upwards. This adjustment in price targets directly reflects the analysts' increased confidence in Netflix's growth trajectory and its ability to generate value for shareholders. Such revisions are often based on comprehensive research of the company's market performance, future potential, and overall industry trends.Competing in the streaming ColosseumDespite intense competition from other streaming services like Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Netflix has maintained its market dominance. 


Its unique content strategy and innovative revenue models have ensured its competitive edge. The company's ability to continually adapt and evolve in a rapidly changing digital entertainment landscape has been vital to sustaining its leadership position.Streaming into the futureNetflix's remarkable performance in the fourth quarter of 2023 is a testament to its robust business model, innovative strategies, and unwavering commitment to quality content. The company's ability to exceed expectations in subscriber growth, financial stability and strategic partnerships positions it for continued success.

12,Surprise Reason Behind Stock Breakout?,"Jan 24, 2024",Steve Reitmeister,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/surprise-reason-behind-stock-breakout/468728,"
Why is the S&P 500 (SPY) making new highs? And what is the outlook for stocks coming into the quite important 1/31 Fed meeting? Investment pro Steve Reitmeister shares his views along with a preview of his top 13 trades to excel in weeks and months ahead. Read on below for more.I am a tad bit surprised by the recent surge to new highs. Not that it wouldn’t take place this year. That was a given.Rather why it took place now with such mixed economic and inflation data calling into greater question WHEN the Fed will start lowering rates.



Yet as we all know timing the market can often be a “fool’s errand”. Gladly our bullish outlook for the year ahead had us fully invested and enjoying in the upside as it rolled in.Let’s use our time today to discuss the results from earnings season so far. And preparing for the next Fed meeting on January 31st.Market CommentaryTuesday marks the 3rd straight close above 4,800 for the S&P 500 (SPY) helping to solidify that indeed we have a solid breakout to new all time highs. Certainly, that is something to celebrate helping to erase most of the painful memories of the 2022 bear market.Helping the cause are the better than expected early results for Q4 earnings season. Here are insights from my friend Nick Raich at EarningsScout.com
67 companies in the S&P 500 (13%) have released Q4 results.
Good news first! 56 companies, or 84%, have topped their EPS expectations, on average by +6.92%.
Furthermore, 4Q 2023 EPS growth is up +6.37% from 4Q 2022 for the companies that have reported so far, which is an accelerated rate from last earnings season when their collective 3Q 2023 vs 3Q 2022 EPS growth rate was +4.42%.
Now, the bad news. And to be honest, it is not all that bad. Only 67% of companies are topping their sales expectations, which is below the 72% three-year average sales beat rate.
While 4Q 2023 sales are up +4.98% from 4Q 2022 for the 67 companies that have reported, this is a slowdown in the rate of growth from last quarter when their 3Q 2023 sales were up +6.01%.
Underlying S&P 500 EPS expectation trend is improving, on a rate of change basis, for the first 67 co’s in the index on the 4Q 2023 clock and this is bullish for stocks.
The above may be a bit too much in the weeds for some investors. So let me simplify.


Earnings so far are better than expected. And estimate revisions for future earnings are also positive. Net-net this is good news and no doubt one of the catalysts behind the recent stock breakout to new highs.These positive earnings announcements should not come as much of a shock given the resilience of the US economy. The GDPNow model is now pointing to +2.4% growth for Q4 which is far better than earlier predictions closer to a paltry 1%.The welcome strength of the US economy, coupled with still moderating inflation figures, creates an interesting riddle for the Fed to solve as to when they can comfortably start lowering rates. That is highly unlikely at their 1/31 meeting where the CME’s FedWatch model points to less than 3% chance of a rate cut on the way.The March 20th Fed meeting was considered the most likely launching point for these rate cuts with odds at nearly 90% just a month ago. That is now down to only 43% probability at this time.


This change of heart stems from the slightly higher than expected CPI report on January 11th where core is currently at 3.4% year over year. Along with that the monthly jobs report showed job gains hotter than expected bringing with it stubborn wage inflation that is not abating as fast as some had hoped.Long story short, we are still a good way off the Fed’s 2% inflation target thus delaying when the economic catalyst of rate cuts will finally be on the way. Now folks believe that May 1st Fed meeting is the more likely start to this rate cutting process (currently 86% likelihood).Yes, with what I just shared I am a tad surprised that stocks had the energy to break to new highs at this time. I thought that would be on hold til there was greater certainty of when rate cuts would be delivered as that timeline keeps getting pushed further back.However, it is not hard to see the economy is doing just fine without the rate cuts. So its not like we need them on the books to keep the stock market humming along. It would just provide a bit more oomph to earnings growth which further lifts share price valuation.


The point is that when the primary trend is bullish, then there is no benefit in trying to time the minor pullbacks and bounces. Like I said up top, that is a “fool’s errand”.It is better just to stay 100% invested in the best stocks and ETFs to enjoy those rallies whenever they arrive.As for what are the best stocks and ETFs to own now, we will tackle that in the section that follows...What To Do Next?Discover my current portfolio of 11 stocks packed to the brim with the outperforming benefits found in our exclusive POWR Ratings model.Yes, that same POWR Ratings model generating nearly 4X better than the S&P 500 going back to 1999.Plus I have selected 2 special ETFs that are all in sectors well positioned to outpace the market in the weeks and months ahead.These 13 top trades are based on my 43 years of investing experience seeing bull markets...bear markets...and everything between.If you are curious to learn more, and want to see these lucky 13 hand selected trades, then please click the link below to get started now.Steve Reitmeister’s Trading Plan & Top Picks >Wishing you a world of investment success!

13,Energy Gains This Week: 3 Stocks Making Waves,"Jan 24, 2024",Sristi Suman Jayaswal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/energy-gains-this-week-3-stocks-making-waves/468742,"
The energy industry’s outlook appears robust, buoyed by increased global energy requirements driven by population growth, industrialization, and economic development. Given this backdrop, fundamentally strong energy stocks Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (CQP), Ultrapar Participações S.A. (UGP), and Transportadora de Gas del Sur S.A. (TGS) could be solid buys now. Read on….Amid the mounting global energy needs and constrained supply levels, crude oil prices are projected to adhere closely to 2023's averages. The potential for price spikes is real due to aggravated geopolitical instability, exemplified by increasing turbulence in the Middle East and maritime assaults occurring in the Red Sea region.Given this backdrop, quality energy stocks Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (CQP), Ultrapar Participações S.A. (UGP), and Transportadora de Gas del Sur S.A. (TGS) could be solid portfolio additions now.



While the transition toward renewable energy sources continues to accelerate, there is a simultaneous rise in oil and gas requirements. According to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) monthly report, 2024 can expect to witness oil demand growth by 1.24 million barrels per day (bpd). This optimistic forecast can be attributed to population growth, escalating energy consumption in developing economies, improving global economic health, declining crude oil prices in the last quarter, and sustained growth in China's petrochemical sector.Significant investments in oil and gas drilling technologies, including hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, have generated a notable spike in oil and gas production in the U.S. It's worth noting that these innovations have enabled heightened yields from reservoirs once deemed non-productive.


In 2023, Master Limited Partnerships and the broader midstream sector demonstrated robust performance within the energy industry, generating total returns of 23.8% and 14%, respectively. The prediction for 2024 suggests that the industry will continue to yield free cash flow and distribute capital to shareholders through enhanced dividends and strategic buybacks.The persisting geopolitical turmoil in the Red Sea region, particularly the ongoing militant attacks by Yemen-based Houthis, has imposed additional challenges on oil trade activities. Also, the OPEC+ production cuts, combined with production disruptions in Libya, have amplified bullish market conditions for oil prices.Moreover, in the U.S., severe winter weather across Texas and North Dakota has notably hindered oil production. For instance, North Dakota's oil output experienced a substantial drop last week. This tightening of supply, coupled with increased oil and gas demand, has contributed to recent surges in oil prices.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in its Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), anticipates Brent crude oil prices to average at $82 per barrel (b) for 2024, dropping to $79/b in 2025.


With these trends in mind, let's delve into the fundamentals of the three energy stock picks.Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (CQP)CQP provides liquefied natural gas (LNG) to integrated energy companies, utilities, and energy trading companies worldwide. It owns and operates a natural gas liquefaction and export facility at the Sabine Pass LNG production terminal.On November 29, CQP announced that Sabine Pass Liquefaction Stage V, LLC (SPL Stage 5) entered into a long-term Integrated Production Marketing (IPM) gas supply agreement with ARC Resources U.S. Corp., Canada’s leading natural gas producer.

14,Procter &amp; Gamble: A titan in turbulent times,"Jan 23, 2024",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/procter-amp-gamble-a-titan-in-turbulent-times/468717,"
Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) is a testament to enduring corporate resilience and innovation in an era of economic volatility and shifting consumer trends. With a history dating back to 1837, P&G has become synonymous with consumer staples that include household and personal care products used by customers globally. The pillars of Procter & GambleAt its core, P&G is a conglomerate of familiar brands that have become household names, contributing to a large portion of the consumer staples sector. From the ubiquitous Gillette razors to the indispensable Tide laundry detergents, P&G’s portfolio covers a broad spectrum of consumer needs. Operating in various segments, including beauty, grooming, health care, fabric and home care, and baby, feminine, and family care, P&G has woven itself into the fabric of everyday life, ensuring a widespread presence in the market.



Navigating the currents of changeRecently, Procter & Gamble headlines have detailed the organization's strategic maneuvers in the face of global economic challenges. Procter and Gamble’s latest quarterly earnings report shone a light on its resilience and the hurdles it faces in a volatile market sector. Despite a challenging environment, P&G reported a 3% increase in net sales, showcasing its ability to navigate market turbulence. However, a significant development was the $1.28 billion non-cash impairment charge related to the Gillette brand, highlighting the impact of macroeconomic factors like currency fluctuations and the ongoing restructuring program. The non-cash impairment charge reported by Procter & Gamble concerned its Gillette brand and is a significant accounting adjustment reflecting a reduction in the asset's value on the company's balance sheet. 


This charge does not involve any immediate cash expenditure but indicates that P&G assessed the Gillette brand's future earning potential to be lower than previously valued. Such a charge can be influenced by various factors, including changes in market conditions, brand performance, economic factors like currency fluctuations, and the need to align with accounting standards that require accurate asset valuation. This adjustment reflects P&G's response to evolving market dynamics and economic conditions impacting the Gillette brand's valuation.Strategic reorientation in dynamic marketsProcter & Gamble has strategically restructured its market portfolio in a decisive move towards operational realignment. This initiative, particularly focused on economically volatile regions such as Argentina and Nigeria, represents a proactive response to the multifaceted challenges posed by the global economic landscape. The restructuring involves reevaluating and possibly recalibrating P&G's operations in these regions to better align with the prevailing market conditions and future growth prospects.This strategic shift, while necessary, is expected to result in substantial financial charges. These charges, predominantly non-cash, result from adjustments in asset valuations and operational restructuring costs. Despite the immediate financial implications, this move is regarded as essential in fortifying P&G’s long-term market position.The decision to restructure these specific markets stems from a thorough analysis of these regions' economic conditions, consumer behavior trends, and competitive dynamics. Argentina and Nigeria, for instance, have been experiencing macroeconomic instability, which has significantly influenced consumer spending patterns and market dynamics. By recalibrating its operations, P&G aims to optimize its resource allocation, enhance efficiency, and strengthen its competitive edge in these markets.


Furthermore, this strategic reorientation underscores P&G's agility and adaptability in the face of economic instability. It reflects the company's commitment to safeguarding its current market stronghold and ensuring its robust growth trajectory. P&G’s approach in this restructuring endeavor is a testament to its strategic foresight, where short-term financial recalibrations are judiciously undertaken for long-term sustainability and growth in a rapidly evolving global economy.Eco-innovation and market assuranceProcter & Gamble is strategically steering its course toward a future that blends innovation, sustainability, and robust financial performance. This multifaceted approach reflects the company's commitment to continuous product development and ecological responsibility while aligning with the positive outlook of market analysts and investors' confidence.Innovation and sustainability form the twin pillars of P&G’s future strategy. The company is dedicated to innovating across its product range, consistently introducing new products and enhancing existing ones to cater to global consumers' dynamic needs and preferences. P&G's sustainability endeavors complement this commitment to innovation. The company is actively working to reduce its environmental footprint, an initiative that resonates with the global shift toward ecological consciousness and responsibility.Procter and Gamble market analysts recognize P&G’s strategic initiatives and status as a benchmark in the consumer goods industry, maintaining a favorable outlook for the company. Despite the complex challenges presented by the global economic environment, analysts foresee continued growth in sales and earnings for P&G. This projection is underpinned by the company's strong brand portfolio and its proven track record of adapting effectively to market changes.


Investor sentiment towards P&G further reinforces this positive outlook. The company's stable stock performance, coupled with Procter & Gamble’s consistent dividend payouts, indicate the investor community's confidence in P&G’s long-term prospects. This sentiment is bolstered by Procter & Gamble’s financial performance and strategic initiatives, both of which are geared toward future growth.

This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Spirit Airlines has turned into the latest meme stock in what has been a wild week of trades for the low-cost airline.The drama first unfolded last week, when a court blocked JetBlue's proposed $3.8 billion takeover of Spirit Airlines due to concerns about competition within the airline industry.



Following the court's decision, Spirit Airlines stock plunged as much as 74% over a period of three days as the company's deal was in doubt.The stock price of Spirit Airlines fell to as low as $4.04 on Thursday, but it has since mounted a furious rally, in part driven by a retail trading frenzy akin to the meme-stock rallies seen throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, during which traders bought shares of companies that had questionable fundamentals.


Shares of Spirit Airlines have since rallied as much as 131% from the low on Thursday, hitting a high of $9.34 per share on Tuesday. Helping boost the stock was JetBlue's decision to file an appeal to the court ruling, offering hope to investors that a deal might ultimately go through.Cumulative trading volume has exploded over the past week, eclipsing more than 512 million shares traded, with multiple trading days seeing more than 75 million shares being traded. For context, Spirit Airlines has 109 million shares outstanding, and its typical daily volume before the court ruling was just 3 million shares.Online chatter about the stock has picked up amid the trading frenzy, with message volume on the social media platform StockTwits registering an ""extremely high"" reading on Tuesday, registering a score of 87 out of 100.Spirit Airlines stock has also received attention from Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, who purchased shares and posted videos to X over the past week commenting about the recent volatility in the stock price.


""$SAVE is ripping. WE FLY IN THIS COUNTRY!"" he posted to X.Despite the recent four-day rally, shares of Spirit Airlines are still 42% below last week's price before the court decision.Markets Insider

16,"Johnson and Johnson: Q4, courtrooms and cutting-edge science","Jan 23, 2024",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/johnson-and-johnson-q4-courtrooms-and-cutting-edge-science/468709,"
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), a cornerstone in the global healthcare sector, recently released earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024. Johnson & Johnson’s earnings tell a story of resilience, innovation, and the company's navigation of a complex market strategy. At the heart of this narrative are three pivotal themes: their financial performance in the latter part of 2023, high-stakes legal challenges, and breakthroughs in medical science. Johnson & Johnson's fiscal fortitudeIn 2023, Johnson & Johnson demonstrated a solid financial performance underpinned by strategic maneuvers and market adaptations. Johnson & Johnson’s financial summary is characterized by strengths and areas of challenge, reflecting the company's position in a fluctuating global market.



Annual sales growthThe company's annual sales for 2023 showed a significant increase of 6.5%, resulting in a total revenue of $85.2 billion. This growth indicates the company's effective market strategies and ability to maintain a strong sales trajectory in a competitive healthcare industry.Operational growthJohnson & Johnson's operational growth for the year stood at 7.4%. This figure excludes the impact of translational currency, providing a clearer picture of the company's core operational efficiency and effectiveness.


Adjusted operational growthThe adjusted operational growth, a figure that further excludes the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was reported at 5.9%. This metric offers insights into the company's organic growth, stripping away the effects of external business activities and focusing solely on operational performance.Net earnings and EPS dynamicsDespite the robust growth in sales, Johnson & Johnson faced a downturn in net earnings and Earnings Per Share (EPS). This decline can be attributed to various factors, including but not limited to market volatility, increased operational costs, and investments in research and development. The EPS, a key indicator of profitability per share, is often closely monitored by investors as it reflects the company's profitability distributed among its common shares.Overall financial healthWhile the decrease in net earnings and EPS presents a challenge, the overall operational growth figures signify the company's resilience and adaptability in the face of market pressures. Johnson & Johnson's ability to generate substantial sales growth amidst a complex and evolving healthcare landscape speaks to its strong market presence and operational efficiency.The dividend declarationJohnson & Johnson's dividend declaration of $1.19 per share for Q4 2023 highlights its financial strength and commitment to shareholders. This strategic financial move demonstrates the company's ability to generate significant profits and manage cash flow efficiently in the competitive healthcare sector.


The dividend, payable to shareholders of record by November 21, 2023, is a testament to Johnson & Johnson's operational success and capability to balance growth investments with investor rewards. This action is integral to the company's approach to maintaining investor confidence and stabilizing stock prices through regular, reliable returns.Talc investigations and opioid settlementsJohnson & Johnson encountered significant legal hurdles recently, culminating in considerable financial settlements that have substantially impacted its legal and financial landscape. 
Resolution of talc investigations: The company agreed to a $700 million settlement to resolve investigations into Johnson & Johnson talc products. This substantial amount reflects the company's approach to addressing and resolving long-standing legal disputes related to allegations about the safety of its talc-based products. The settlement indicates Johnson & Johnson's commitment to putting these legal challenges behind it and moving forward. This decision has financial implications and affects the company’s reputation and approach to product safety and consumer trust.
Opioid settlement in Washington State: Johnson & Johnson also made a significant statement regarding its settlement in opioid litigation within Washington State. This settlement is part of a broader legal landscape where pharmaceutical companies are facing scrutiny and legal action for their role in the opioid crisis. The company's decision to settle reflects a strategic approach to managing complex legal disputes with wide-reaching implications, not just in terms of financial cost but also in how Johnson & Johnson is perceived in public health responsibility.
Innovations at the forefrontJohnson & Johnson has reinforced its position as a leader in healthcare innovation, mainly through its recent breakthroughs in cancer treatment and genome sequencing. The company's research and development efforts have led to significant progress in treating previously incurable cancers, showcasing its dedication to transforming patient care and setting new benchmarks in oncology.Simultaneously, Johnson & Johnson's involvement in major genome sequencing initiatives highlights its commitment to pioneering personalized medicine. This work is crucial for understanding disease at a genetic level, paving the way for tailored treatments. These advancements demonstrate Johnson & Johnson's role in driving medical progress and reflect its influence on improving global health outcomes.


Market analysis and investor perspectivesThe recent performance of Johnson & Johnson exhibits a strong market position and positive investor outlook. The company has demonstrated substantial operational growth and financial stability, bolstering investor confidence. Moreover, its active engagement in pioneering healthcare projects and notable regulatory advancements underscore its leadership within crucial areas such as oncology and immunology.The stock performance mirrors investor reactions to these developments, indicating a resilient market standing. Overall, Johnson & Johnson navigates market complexities effectively, focusing on innovation and stakeholder value, which paints an optimistic future market outlook.As Johnson & Johnson looks to the future, it's evident that the company is navigating a path marked by innovation and strategic resilience. At the same time, despite various market challenges, Johnson & Johnson's robust financial performance underscores its operational strength and positions it for continued positive impact in the healthcare sector. This combination of innovation, responsible management, and financial resilience paints a picture of a company well-equipped to thrive in the volatile healthcare landscape.

17,Want to Raise Money? Ignore These 3 Sources of Conventional Wisdom,"Jan 23, 2024",Liam Gill,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/ignore-these-3-sources-of-conventional-wisdom-if-you-want/468314,"
Raising venture capital is an infamously tricky task. Thousands of startups pitch VCs each year, hoping to receive the funding to help turn their dreams into reality. At the top firms, only 0.7% of companies receive the funding they seek.With so much at stake and such long odds of success, founders constantly search for ways to improve their pitches. Unfortunately, this often leads them to learn and follow conventional wisdom, much of which is outdated and ineffective.This article will explore three sources of conventional wisdom that entrepreneurs should approach critically.Related: 3 Ways to Raise Capital and Take Your Business to the Next Level



1. Pitch templatesIndustry giants like YC, Sequoia Capital, and numerous other companies and individuals alike have shared similar pitch templates since the early 2000s. These pitch templates often follow the same pattern companies like Dropbox and AirBnb used to present their early ideas before becoming billion-dollar businesses.The problem with using pitch templates is multifold.


The best analogy for a pitch template is riding a bike with training wheels. While you are less likely to fall off the bike, you also won't be winning the Tour de France — the problem with using training wheels when fundraising is that it limits your potential. With only 6.7% of the inbound decks to major funds being seriously considered for investment, the standard for your deck can't avoid complete failure; it needs to outperform your peers.The power of a pitch template is that it ensures all the aspects of a business a VC needs to familiarize themselves with before agreeing to a meeting are covered. You'll never have a severe deficiency in the content of your deck. The tradeoff is that you remove the creative freedom required to craft a compelling deck. Instead of building a narrative for your business, placing the most impressive slides early in the deck and ensuring continuity between slides, you are forced into presenting dry information in the order recommended by the template.The prevalence of pitch templates also compounds this issue. It limits your ability to tell the story behind your company and forces you to present your information in the same manner as thousands of other founders. If your goal is to stand out from the crowd and show that you deserve to be in the 0.7% of companies that receive funding, using a pitch template moves you away from that goal. A pitch template blends you into the crowd. The moment investor sees your deck, the familiar look, feel and story will strongly signal to them that you belong in the 99.3% they ultimately reject.Related: 10 Reasons Your Capital Raising Strategy Is Failing


2. Pitch anythingWhen Oren Klaff published Pitch Anything in 2011, it was revolutionary. The methods in that book have underpinned the last decade of pitching theory, practice and study. Unfortunately, since then, the market has adapted. Venture capitalists have seen the ""Pitch Anything"" format used for the past 13 years and have adapted, but entrepreneurs have yet to respond.A typical example I've observed is founders turning away VCs, ignoring emails, claiming they don't see a fit, criticizing VCs online and using similar techniques to try and establish status and prevent a perception of neediness. When these strategies were first employed over a decade ago, they worked for founders.A decade ago, the ideas in the book were known. It was standard practice for entrepreneurs to value the time of VCs above their own, to beg VCs for money. This is why the founders who had the confidence to stick to their terms, run deals on their schedule and demand the respect of VCs stood out. Following the advice in the book was a significant differentiator that helped founders raise.Today, these tactics are well known. Most founders understand the need to create a feeling of exclusivity and a fear of missing out on their business when they fundraise. The issue is that the ways that companies can establish that type of exclusive status today are not the same as they were a decade ago. In a world where everyone is using the same playbook, all trying to pretend they don't need venture capital, rejecting a VC no longer makes them want you more; it simply costs you the deal.If you want to succeed at creating exclusivity around your company, you need to use new strategies adapted for today's fundraising environment. The best application of these tactics I've seen recently are companies that can build momentum and use it to raise quickly. Elon Musk is an expert at implementing this strategy. From Tesla to X to SpaceX, his capital raises are often accompanied by a significant launch, positive announcement or other catalyst event. Raising capital at a time when there is genuine excitement around the business allows him to establish status and differentiate himself from other investment opportunities.


Related: How to Raise Funds As a Startup3. Venture capitalistsVenture capitalists love to give founders advice on how they can improve their pitch. This advice is problematic because it isn't generally beneficial to entrepreneurs. Instead, the advice attempts to convince the entrepreneur to present the information in a manner that is most beneficial to the venture capitalist.The hard fact is that the interests of the VC and the entrepreneur are opposed. In an ideal world, VCs would want you to present raw data, pure facts upon which they could make the most rational investment decision. As an entrepreneur, you need to sell your story. Deciding to start a business from nothing and attempting to grow it into a billion-dollar enterprise, an endeavor with a high likelihood of failure, is inherently irrational. Your objective is to sell yourself, your story and the opportunity, not a rational investment.A simple example: the most common advice I hear from VCs is to continuously add more information to your pitch deck as you talk to VCs. Many of them will have questions, and when one asks a question, you should ensure the answer is in the deck before you speak to the next VC. Why might this be their advice? They want as much information as quickly as possible. They also don't want to forget to ask a crucial question whose answer made others pass on the investment.


Following this advice, however, could drastically decrease your chances of raising capital. A far better solution is to build a database of questions that VCs ask you, prepare answers in advance, and then prepare the perfect answer when you get asked the question. Now, you suddenly keep a simple deck with a strong narrative and can easily navigate the questions you'll receive after your pitch. It is a far better outcome than the clunky, data-filled pitch VCs recommended, followed by unforeseen (likely poorly answered) questions.

18,What Lies Ahead for NVDA and TSM in the Chip Landscape in 2024,"Jan 23, 2024",Mangeet Kaur Bouns,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/what-lies-ahead-for-nvda-and-tsm-in-the-chip-landscape-in/468688,"
Following last year’s slowdown, the semiconductor industry is positioned to witness a solid rebound in 2024, fueled by resurgent market demand, the rising popularity of technologies like generative AI and HPC, and growing government incentives. So, let’s analyze what lies ahead for NVIDIA (NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) in the chip landscape this year. Read on to know more….The semiconductor industry’s 2024 outlook appears promising, driven by the recovery in demand, especially in two prominent end markets, PCs and smartphones and numerous technological innovations. Moreover, the heightened attention to the strategic importance of chip manufacturing to national and economic security is a crucial catalyst of the industry’s growth.Amid this backdrop, fundamentally sound chip stock Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) seems well-poised to capitalize on the industry’s tailwinds. However, given its mixed prospects, investors could wait for a better entry point in NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA).



Semiconductors are a crucial component in multiple applications across end-use sectors, including consumer electronics, automotive, computing, networking and communications, industrial equipment, healthcare, military, and clean energy. In addition, the growing popularity of technologies like AI, machine learning, and IoT will offer growth opportunities to chip companies.In 2023, the semiconductor industry had a challenging year, the seventh downturn since 1990, with sales projected to decline 9.4% (to $520 billion) for the year. However, the industry is well-positioned to rebound in 2024, with global chip sales reaching an impressive $588 billion, indicating a 13% year-over-year growth. The memory sector is a vital driver of this growth.


In terms of end markets, both PC and smartphone sales are anticipated to increase by 4% this year, following declines of 14% and 3.5% in 2023, respectively. Returning to growth for these two end-use sectors is very important for the semiconductor industry.As we enter 2024, semiconductor companies will increasingly emphasize on product innovations, targeting developments in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) and boosting demand for high-performance GPUs in data centers and high-performance computing (HPC).According to Deloitte, the market for AI chips appears to be strong in 2024 and is predicted to reach more than $50 billion in sales for the year or 8.5% of the value of all chips to be sold. In the long term, some forecasts suggest that AI chips (mainly gene AI chips) could total $400 billion in sales by 2027.Favorable government initiatives further drive the chip industry’s prospects. In August 2022, President Biden signed the CHIPS Act of 2022 into a law that allocated about $52.70 billion over the next five years to boost domestic manufacturing and research and development (R&D) of semiconductors.


“Resurgent market demand and increased government incentives worldwide are powering an upsurge in fab investments in key chipmaking regions and the projected 6.4% rise in global capacity for 2024,” said Ajit Manocha, SEMI President and CEO.As per SEMI’s latest quarterly World Fab Forecast report, the global semiconductor capacity is projected to rise by 6.4% this year to reach record high 30 million wafers per month (wpm) mark for the first time after increasing 5.5% to 29.6 wpm in 2023.Given the industry trends in mind, let’s look at the fundamentals of the two Semiconductor & Wireless Chip stocks.Stock to Hold:Stock #2: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)NVDA designs and manufactures computer graphics processors, chipsets, and related multimedia software.

19,"Buy, Sell, or Hold These 3 Homebuilder Stocks?","Jan 23, 2024",Sristi Suman Jayaswal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/buy-sell-or-hold-these-3-homebuilder-stocks/468687,"
The homebuilding industry is poised for substantial expansion, propelled by robust demand for housing properties. Given this backdrop, let’s assess the prospects of homebuilder stocks D.R. Horton (DHI), Hovnanian Enterprises (HOV) and Lennar Corporation (LEN) to determine the best investment opportunity in this space. Read on….As mortgage rates continue to descend, homebuilders are taking strides to accelerate production, enhancing affordability for prospective homeowners. Furthermore, the predicted interest rate reductions projected for this year are set to stimulate housing demand, reinforcing the potential advantages of investing in the quality homebuilder stocks Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. (HOV) and Lennar Corporation (LEN). However, D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI) should be kept on one's watchlist for better entry opportunities in the stock.Let’s first discuss why the homebuilder industry is poised for growth before delving deeper into the fundamentals of the stocks.



In 2023, an infusion of vitality swept over homebuilders' stocks, responding to an escalating crisis where the mere attainability of housing reached historic lows in the U.S. Scores of American citizens found themselves on the sidelines or burdened with substantial monthly housing payments. Redfin data unveiled that only 15.5% of available homes were deemed financially accessible to the average household last year – a stark fall from the 20.7% prior year.This notwithstanding, new single-family home sales, as per the U.S. Census Bureau's data, demonstrated a subtle but noteworthy 1.4% year-over-year growth, reaching 590,000 in November 2023. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo's Housing Market Index (HMI) unveiled a seven-point surge month-over-month in builder confidence, achieving 44 in January. The injection of confidence within builders has been attributed to sustained mortgage rates below 7% over the previous month.


A slight relaxation in market conditions is predicted for 2024. Forecasts predict that the forthcoming increase in stock availability, combined with a reduction in the ""lock-in"" effect – where current homeowners resist moving due to previously secured lower mortgage rates – will induce greater buying activity. However, persistent obstacles can be expected.The presence of high mortgage rates remains an undeniable reality. Yet disproportionate supply and demand dynamics have inhibited home prices from the usual decline when borrowing costs heighten. For 2024, William Blair anticipates a more prosperous landscape with improved supply, declining mortgage rates, and a return of existing homeowners to the market, driven primarily by necessity.Furthermore, a resurgence in the construction of new homes is apparent. Privately-owned housing starts in December exhibited a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,460,000, a 7.6% increase from the previous year. Builders are anticipated to construct more houses to meet escalating demand as long-term interest rates decline.The global residential construction market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.8% to reach $8.31 billion by 2032.


The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF’s (XHB) 49.8% rise over the past year, compared to the aggregate S&P 500's 21.8% rise, substantiates investors’ interest in the housing sector.Considering these trends, let's take a look at the fundamentals of the three Homebuilders stocks.Stocks To Buy:Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. (HOV)HOV designs, constructs, markets, and sells residential homes in the U.S. Its segment includes Homebuilding and Financial Services.On January 15, HOV introduced Salerno Reserve, a new community of single-family homes in Stuart. Salerno Reserve offers LOOKS: a designer-curated collection of beautiful interiors.

20,Vita Coco: Stirring the market with strategic shifts,"Jan 22, 2024",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/vita-coco-stirring-the-market-with-strategic-shifts/468666,"
Vita Coco (NASDAQ: COCO) has emerged as a prominent contender within the highly competitive health and wellness beverage industry, a sub-sector of the consumer staples sector. Vita Coco is primarily recognized for its coconut water, coconut milk and coconut oil products. The journey of Vita Coco, established in 2004, exemplifies strategic dexterity and market adaptability. Recognizing a significant gap in the United States market, founders Michael Kirban and Ira Liran capitalized on the popularity of packaged coconut water in Brazil, positioning Vita Coco as a dominant brand within the industry.The Vita Coco chronicleThe company's notable strategic moves characterize Vita Coco's climb in the market. These include its expansion beyond coconut water into products such as coconut oil and canned cocktails. This latter move was in collaboration with Diageo (NYSE: DEO), a renowned entity involved in the production, marketing, and sale of alcoholic beverages. Diageo is known for its vast portfolio, featuring prominent brands such as Johnnie Walker, Guinness, and Smirnoff.



Vita Coco's strategic insight was further demonstrated by successfully executing its initial public offering (IPO) in 2021. This positioned the company as a top-performing consumer IPO despite experiencing a subsequent decrease in earnings in 2022. Nonetheless, Vita Coco has managed to maintain a substantial market share, commanding over half of the coconut water market.Market challenges and adaptationsThe brand's journey has not been without challenges. Vita Coco faced early logistical issues and competition from beverage giants like Coca-Cola (NASDAQ: COKE) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP). Market trends, such as the surge in hard seltzer popularity and evolving retail sector strategies, tested the company's adaptability. Despite these challenges, Vita Coco's resilience and strategic agility have enabled it to maintain its growth trajectory.


Insider transactions and rating downgradesRecently, significant developments have been affecting Vita Coco’s stock market dynamics. William Blair downgraded the company from an ""outperform"" rating to a ""market perform"" rating. This downgrade often indicates a change in the firm's outlook on a stock’s future performance relative to the market and can reflect concerns about the company's near-term financial prospects or market challenges. However, Vita Coco’s analyst ratings show that the number of analysts who rate the stock a “buy” has increased over the past quarter. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.26 for the quarter ending October 31, surpassing analysts' expectations by $0.02. Their revenue for the quarter was $138 million, slightly below analyst estimates of $139.05 million. Despite this, the company's revenue showed an 11.3% increase compared to the same quarter in the previous year, and Vita Coco had a return on equity of 23.93% and a net margin of 7.73%.High-profile insider stock sales at Vita Coco have increased interest in the company’s market activities. Jane Prior, the Chief Marketing Officer, sold 1,205 shares at an average price of $28.84, while Jonathan Burth, the Chief Operating Officer, sold 23,671 shares at an average price of $30.04. Even more recently, chairmen and directors have sold off a collective 73,998 shares valued at a combined $1.95M. These sales are often a part of the normal course of business for corporate executives, but they draw attention as they might reflect the insiders’ perspective on the company's future prospects. The involvement of institutional investors in Vita Coco has also been noteworthy. Recent changes in their positions indicate varying levels of confidence and investment strategies related to the company. Some investors have increased their stakes, while others have initiated new positions, showcasing a dynamic and changing investor landscape for Vita Coco.


Vita Coco's revenue and growth trajectoryVita Coco's financials have shown a consistent increase in revenue. In 2022, the company reported an annual revenue of $427.79 million, a 12.72% increase from the previous year. This upward trajectory continued into 2023, with the company achieving $479.46 million in revenue for the twelve months ending September 30, 2023, a further 13.51% growth year-over-year. These figures indicate Vita Coco's solid market presence and successful business expansion efforts.Investor perspectives: Sentiment and valuationThe developments surrounding the company, including its financial performance, the stock rating downgrade, and other negative headlines about Vita Coco, have significantly influenced investor sentiment. The downgrade suggests a neutral outlook on the stock, indicating that it is expected to perform in line with the market average. This stance reflects a more cautious view of the company's near-term growth prospects.Nevertheless, Vita Coco's revenue growth serves as a favorable indicator for investors. However, market analysts' forecast of a flat EBIT margin for 2024 implies limited potential for substantial short-term growth in profitability. The current market valuation of Vita Coco is generally considered to be an accurate reflection of its anticipated financial performance.Strategic aspirations: Vita Coco's future outlookVita Coco's strategy for future growth includes considering mergers and acquisitions, mainly targeting smaller brands with solid margins and positive consumer acceptance. This approach aims to accelerate growth and expand Vita Coco's product range. The company's partnership with Diageo, leading to the launch of Vita Coco spiked with Captain Morgan, is an example of its intent to broaden market reach and diversify consumer engagement points. Moreover, Vita Coco's marketing strategies have evolved to cater to a diverse consumer base by leveraging digital channels like TikTok and YouTube.


Investment implications: Assessing Vita CocoFor those considering investing in Vita Coco, it's a blend of opportunity and caution. The company's strong track record and foothold in the ever-growing non-alcoholic drink market add to its appeal. However, the craze for coconut-based products could potentially cool down, which might affect Vita Coco's business. The stock's current price seems to reflect its achievements and future goals, offering a fair deal for potential investors. It is worth noting that Vita Coco’s short interest is considered to be high for its sector. High short interest may indicate that many investors are betting against the stock, which means any good news could lead to a quick rise in stock price. Vita Coco has carved out a strong position in the health and wellness beverage sector, demonstrating adaptability and strategic foresight. Its collaboration with Diageo reflects a diversification strategy while evolving marketing tactics aim to reach a broader consumer base. Despite a downgrade by William Blair and notable insider stock sales, the company's consistent revenue growth and strategic plans, including potential mergers and acquisitions, signal a proactive approach to market challenges and opportunities.

21,Buying a Business? Make Sure It Checks The Boxes On This Checklist Before You Pull The Trigger.,"Jan 22, 2024",Andrew Cagnetta,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/buying-a-business-make-sure-it-checks-the-boxes-on-this/466314,"
Embarking on the journey of buying a business is an exciting and commendable resolution. However, often, I see buyers trying to find the perfect business. Spoiler alert! No such business exists, so flexibility is the key to achieving your entrepreneurial goal.Every business opportunity comes with its share of drawbacks and risks. Your task is to identify these issues, understand them, and determine if you can work with or solve them. In this article, we'll delve deeper into the essential attributes to consider when deciding on a business purchase and hopefully solve some of the thought barriers for prospective entrepreneurs.Related: Purchasing a Business Doesn't Have to Be Difficult. Here's Your Comprehensive Guide.



1. IncomeYour goal should be to make money, so avoid buying a hobby or a business with a history of losses or one that barely gets by. Look for a business that offers a solid, provable, sustainable and potentially growing income stream. Analyze past income records closely to ensure their accuracy and reliability. And look for opportunities to grow the income in the future.2. LongevityConsider businesses that have stood the test of time, preferably operating for more than five to ten years. Established businesses with a history of success indicate strong customer loyalty. People, in general, hate change; therefore, business longevity can often ensure long-term repeat business.


3. Good books and recordsA business that maintains accurate financial records can reduce the risk of buying something that may not perform in the future. Hopefully, your target has a computerized accounting system. That way, with due diligence and the assistance of a trusted CPA, it is easy to verify historical financial performance through accurate tax returns and clean financial reports. Note that if a business does not have good books, it could be an opportunity for a savvy buyer.4. Recurring revenueWhile recurring revenue is desirable, don't dismiss a business solely based on this criteria. Sometimes, companies that have one-time diverse customers can have the ability to change the business model and really grow quickly. If not, evaluate other critical factors mentioned here to make an informed decision, but don't let this be a deal breaker.5. Long-term employeesBusinesses with loyal and trained long-term employees are great assets for new buyers. Especially in a tight labor market. Navigating transition issues can be challenging, and having a dedicated team as part of the deal adds substantial value and often solves those issues. If you do purchase a business, be careful not to let go of employees too quickly. They may have more knowledge and expertise than you think.6. Location, location, locationConsider the significance of the business's location and its impact on overall value. A good lease for a strategically located business is obviously essential. So make sure you have the terms and options to ensure your ability to stay in your leasehold and get a return on your investment. To reiterate, most customers like the routine of going to their ""favorite spot."" And for your own sanity, avoid long commutes. You'll be working a lot of hours, and an extended drive to work just adds to an often stressful day.


7. Established industryBuying into an established industry with proven success is often preferable to launching new products or ideas. Aim to acquire businesses with a track record of profitability within an established market. Gaining market share is easier than shaping a new market or trying to sell new ideas to consumers.8. Strong gross marginsSeek businesses with strong gross margins, as slim margins can vanish quickly. Finding a business that can create value beyond price is crucial for sustainable profitability. And having strong gross margins can often make up for mistakes made along the way.9. Upside PotentialPrioritize businesses with growth potential through marketing, networking and outside sales. Avoid businesses that rely solely on location-specific traffic, as they may have limited room for expansion. Hard work and persistence can help you expand a business that may have been neglected.10. Solid business modelDistinguish between a real business and a passing fad. Franchises, with their proven success and established business models, can be a safer option for those unsure about an individual business's stability. Wild new trendy products, responses to crises, and other rocketing new business ideas often turn into duds.


11. Skill set necessary to run the businessChoose businesses that align with your existing skill set or are easy to learn. The business should thrive on your talents, allowing you to leverage your expertise for success. And if you are lacking in a certain skill, make sure you can readily hire and afford the staff to fill in the gaps.12. CompetitionWhile not a deal-breaker, assess the competitive landscape to understand potential challenges. Be aware of any emerging category-dominating apps or major players entering the market. There will always be room for small businesses in any industry, but you don't want to be there while an industry goes through a seismic change.13. Diverse customer baseMitigate risk by selecting a business with a diverse customer base. Relying on a single large customer poses a significant risk, so opt for a business that caters to a broad range of customers. And if there is a customer concentration issue, work to eventually broaden your sales channels.14. Retiring ownershipPrefer businesses where the owner is genuinely retiring, eliminating the risk of competition from the former owner. Retiring owners are more likely to facilitate a smooth transition for new ownership.


Related: 8 Legal Requirements When You Start A Business15. Legal and regulatory complianceEnsure the business adheres to all relevant legal and regulatory requirements. Fines and legal issues can be quite expensive and lead to un-repairable reputational damage. Thoroughly review the business's compliance history and seek legal advice if necessary.16. Technology integrationEvaluate the business's use of technology and its integration into daily operations. A modern and efficient technological infrastructure can enhance productivity and competitiveness. Note again this could be an opportunity if the business is now lacking technological infrastructure.17. Social media presenceIn today's digital age, a strong social media presence is crucial for business success. Assess the business's social media accounts, online reviews, and overall digital reputation. Note if there are any issues currently, and make sure you get access and ownership immediately upon sale.


18. Marketing strategiesExamine the effectiveness of the current marketing strategies employed by the business. A well-developed and targeted marketing plan can significantly impact customer acquisition and retention. This is often a place where new owners can excel.19. Employee training programsInvestigate whether the business has solid employee training programs in place. Well-trained employees contribute to better customer service, operational efficiency, and overall business success.20. Financial flexibility and strengthEvaluate the business's financial flexibility, including available credit lines, cash reserves and financial partnerships. A business with a strong balance sheet and available credit is better equipped to navigate economic downturns and seize growth opportunities.While it's unlikely for a business to possess all these traits, even one can set you on the path to successful ownership. This guide aims to assist you in selecting a business that aligns with your goals and proves to be a rewarding venture. Best of luck on your journey to entrepreneurship!


This extended guide incorporates additional crucial considerations for aspiring entrepreneurs looking to purchase a business, ensuring a more comprehensive and informed decision-making process.

22,5 Smart Marketing Strategies to Boost Investor Confidence and Thrive Under Their Scrutiny,"Jan 19, 2024",Tim Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-smart-marketing-strategies-to-thrive-under-investor/467005,"
As the most important audience for many companies, it's important that investors are enthusiastic about the company's marketing activities. Given that different investors have varying levels of marketing acumen and beliefs about effective marketing, your marketing team must customize how it collaborates with investors on an individualized basis.That said, there are several tactics that are frequently effective in ensuring investor confidence in your marketing program.Related: 5 Tips for Customizing Your Pitch for Every Investor



Research your markets and build marketing around the resultsAn intelligent marketing program begins with market intelligence. To demonstrate to investors the strategies and execution your marketing team has put together will provide optimal results, quantitative and qualitative research creates a strong foundation.In addition to formal market research, the marketing team should also talk informally with target customers, technology and distribution partners, media, industry analysts and market influencers to build and continuously update its understanding of dynamics such as new activities, trends and potential new competitors.


Involve your investors in marketingInvestors often have significant followings of their own on social media and are often regarded as thought leaders and industry experts in the venture capital and tech communities. These links can often provide significant benefits to your company as you look to enter new markets, attract talent, ink partnerships and pursue similar goals. An easy way to involve investors and tap into their networks is to include them in the company's social media program to explore cross-promotion, especially on LinkedIn.One approach that can be effective is to ask investors to post on their social channels when the company announces or closes a funding round, senior executive appointment, product or related announcement. We often draft the posts for investors in advance to minimize their time commitment and to ensure the posting takes place.Many investors, especially VC and PE firms, have created marketing programs to highlight the companies in which they have invested. Your marketing team should aggressively pursue these opportunities as they both serve as free publicity and deepen your ties to the investor.Related: Ask These 3 Questions to Determine Where to Spend Your Marketing Dollars


Study competitors and identify best practicesTo demonstrate to investors that your marketing team is exploring all avenues to support the company's growth, it should periodically undertake a thorough analysis of competitors' marketing activities as well as general best practices. This review should include digging in to learn as many details as possible about competitors' products, future product strategy, market expansion plans, et al — all by ethical means, of course.The team should also study marketing approaches at companies in other industries and consider applying relevant activities to your company. Companies in certain industries, such as food and beverage products, tend to be very sophisticated marketers since they have fierce competition and are trying to influence consumers who are often fickle. Marketers in a wide range of industries can learn valuable lessons from their peers at consumer product companies and then report back findings to their investors.Measure ROI of all marketing activitiesSetting key performance indicators (KPIs) and managing metrics on an ongoing basis provides a quantitative way to show investors both the effectiveness and the ROI of the marketing program. Of course, some marketing elements, such as advertising and digital marketing, are much easier to quantify than activities like media relations.But even for activities that are less measurable in terms of driving lead generation and sales, marketers should get creative and develop some type of metrics. For example, while it's nearly impossible to prove that media coverage has driven sales, it is possible to tie media coverage to increases in website and social media activity and demonstrate a correlation.


Related: 10 Things You Must Do Before Connecting With InvestorsTie marketing to lead generation and not just brand awarenessMany investors think of marketing as more of a function to build brand awareness than to generate leads and sales — but it does both. The level of contribution to business development depends on the product or service being sold. If a consumer is planning to buy a printer for their home, seeing an online ad with a discount coupon or reading a positive review in reputable media can very possibly generate that sale. If a CIO is researching intrusion detection software for their cybersecurity stack to protect her company's critical data assets, marketing may attract her interest and encourage her to contact the company, but it's definitely not going to end in a sale.As with so many activities within a business, demonstrating the effectiveness of your marketing program to investors will be much easier if your marketing team plans ahead, gets the foundational research in place, measures their results and anticipates questions investors are likely to ask. Anticipating and addressing investor queries will facilitate working with them when difficult marketing situations arise.

23,Macy's Is Cutting Jobs and Closing Locations Amid a Leadership Shakeup — Is Your Local Store on the Chopping Block?,"Jan 19, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/macys-cuts-jobs-closes-stores-ceo-tony-spring-takes/468568,"
Macy's Inc. is making some major changes to its leadership and operations in 2024.The department-store chain is laying off around 2,350 corporate staff members — 13% of its corporate workforce — and closing five locations in an attempt to streamline costs and refocus resources on enhancing the consumer shopping journey, The Wall Street Journal reported.Related: Target to Cut Thousands of Jobs as It Seeks to Trim Costs by $2 Billion



Macy's overall workforce will see a 3.5% reduction, excluding seasonal hires, as the company looks to introduce more automation to its supply-chain operations and outsource some roles to third-party providers. Additionally, tiers of management will be reduced to improve efficiency.The department-store behemoth, also the parent company to Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, plans substantial investments in customer-facing areas. Soon, Macy's stores will feature more visual display managers to boost store aesthetics and digital improvements for a smoother online shopping experience, per the report.


This reorganization comes ahead of Tony Spring's ascension to CEO, succeeding Jeff Gennette next month. Macy's faces not just transitional leadership but also considerable pressure from activist investors who have publicized a $5.8 billion takeover offer.""The buyout group is undoubtedly interested in Macy's large real estate portfolio, which has attracted activists and potential buyers in the past,"" Morningstar analyst David Swartz said in a note reported by Reuters.According to JPMorgan analysts, Macy's total real estate value is estimated at approximately $8.5 billion, or $31 per share, including its Herald Square property worth about $3 billion, per the outlet.Related: The Full List of Major U.S. Companies Slashing Staff Next Year, from Nike to IntelWhile Macy's has not publicly addressed the buyout bid, more details on its new strategy are expected in the coming weeks, per WSJ.The changes will take effect on January 26 and include the sales of two furniture locations and store closures in Ballston Quarter, Arlington, Virginia; Bayfair Center, San Leandro, California; Kukui Grove Center, Lihue, Hawaii; Simi Valley Town Center, Simi Valley, California; and Governor's Square, Tallahassee, Florida.The wave of layoffs at Macy's is part of a broader trend witnessed in early 2024, with peers such as Google, Amazon, and Citigroup also streamlining their workforce. However, this occurs against a backdrop of a potential ""soft landing"" for the U.S. economy, as inflation shows signs of easing, and sectors like retail continue to demonstrate growth — albeit at a moderate pace compared to pre-Covid patterns, according to the outlet.

24,3 Medical Stocks Smart Investors Want,"Jan 19, 2024",Sristi Suman Jayaswal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/3-medical-stocks-smart-investors-want/468564,"
The medical industry, pivotal in elevating the quality of human life, is poised to remain buoyed due to medical breakthroughs, advanced medical discoveries, and rising health consciousness among individuals. Given this backdrop, quality medical stocks McKesson Corporation (MCK), Qiagen N.V. (QGEN), and DaVita Inc. (DVA) could be solid portfolio additions now. Read on….The healthcare sector has performed notably well, fueled by the burgeoning integration of remarkable technological advances, the progression of sophisticated medical research to satisfy mounting individual demands, and the surge in clinical diagnosis stemming from an increased prevalence of infectious and chronic ailments.To that end, it would be wise to add quality medical stocks McKesson Corporation (MCK), Qiagen N.V. (QGEN), and DaVita Inc. (DVA) to one’s portfolio now to garner significant returns.



The medical sector is expected to see substantial growth powered by factors such as a rapidly aging demographic, the surge in infectious diseases, and the escalation of chronic ailments. This trend emphasizes the critical need for personalized medical solutions and technology innovations within the industry.The healthcare industry is happily welcoming technological developments like artificial intelligence (AI) and gene editing that could enhance disease detection and treatment methods, subsequently improving patient outcomes.


In addition, novel medical technologies are increasingly being adopted to augment the patients' experience with medical services. The global medical devices market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.9%, reaching $799.67 billion by 2030, driven by increasing healthcare expenditures.Within the healthcare sector, clinical diagnostics, responsible for significant growth in the field, plays an essential role. Key contributors to this progress include an aging population, technological advancements, a rise in chronic disease prevalence, and an increasing focus on personalized treatments and early disease detection.In the coming year, innovative transformations, especially in AI, are projected to foster diagnostic development further. Machine learning's potential to significantly increase aid and efficiency in diagnostic processes enhances its appeal to the industry. Consequently, the global clinical diagnostic market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.1% by 2028.Investors’ interest in the medical industry is evident from the SPDR Select Sector Fund – Health Care ETF’s (XLV) 7.3% returns over the past three months.


In light of these encouraging trends, let's look at the fundamentals of the three medical stocks.McKesson Corporation (MCK)MCK provides healthcare services in the United States and internationally. It operates through four segments: U.S. Pharmaceutical; Prescription Technology Solutions (RxTS); Medical-Surgical Solutions; and International.On January 2, MCK paid stockholders a regular dividend of 62 cents per share of common stock. The company has a record of paying dividends for 24 consecutive years, reflecting its shareholder payback abilities.


Its annualized dividend of $2.48 per share translates to a dividend yield of 0.51% on the current share price. Its four-year average yield is 0.76%.

26,Google pivots: Unpacking the recent round of layoffs,"Jan 18, 2024",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/google-pivots-unpacking-the-recent-round-of-layoffs/468534,"
Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) continues its journey through a significant restructuring effort initiated in the latter half of 2023. This restructuring marks a directional change in the company's future and business strategy. This strategic shift was primarily influenced by the tech giant's ambition to integrate advanced artificial intelligence (AI) into its core operations. The decision reflected the broader industry trend towards AI and necessitated a considerable realignment of Google's workforce and resources to align with these new priorities.Streamlining for the futureGoogle made headlines when CEO Sundar Pichai recently announced a new series of layoffs, intensifying the company's ongoing restructuring process. This announcement is in addition to the substantial number of job cuts across various sectors such as hardware, engineering, advertising, and services. The new round of job cuts represents a deeper transformation in Google's operational strategy.



The extent and character of these personnel reductions provide evidence of a strategic realignment within the technology corporation. Notably, the divisions central to Google's progress in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector have been impacted, including the Google Assistant software team. The decision to decrease positions in these pivotal areas underscores Google's reassessment of its operational requirements in accordance with its future objectives. This represents reduced personnel numbers and a recalibration of skill sets and resources to effectively address the changing demands of the AI-driven market.These layoffs go beyond the conventional corporate downsizing. They are emblematic of Google's recognition of the need to adapt its workforce composition in response to changing technological landscapes and market expectations. For example, the cuts in the AI and Google Assistant divisions suggest a refocusing on how AI technology will drive future products and services. This strategic realignment ensures that Google remains at the forefront of innovation and market relevance in an increasingly competitive tech sector.


Analyzing the consequences of Google's decisionsGoogle's latest strategic moves have garnered attention within the tech industry. The company's focus on streamlining operations, consolidating hardware engineering efforts, and increasing investment in generative AI aims to drive efficiency and growth. This shift has elicited diverse reactions both internally and externally. These changes aim to maintain Google's position at the forefront of innovation.Internal and Industry Reactions
The Alphabet Workers Union has publicly expressed concerns about these layoffs. Their statements underscore the tension between the necessity of corporate restructuring for business agility and the ensuing implications for employee job security and stability.
These concerns are echoed by Google’s industry analysts who are closely monitoring the company’s restructuring. These analyst reviewing Google’s strategy point out that while such changes are integral for staying relevant in a rapidly evolving tech landscape, they also pose risks related to employee morale and corporate reputation.
Long-Term Cultural and Operational Effects
The restructuring is poised to affect Google's internal culture profoundly. There is a potential for shifts in employee engagement and loyalty as the workforce navigates the uncertainty and realignments within the company.
These changes could also impact Google's ability to attract and retain top talent. The tech industry is highly competitive, and the perception of a company’s stability and growth prospects are key factors for prospective employees. Google's restructuring, therefore, could influence how it is viewed as an employer in the tech community.
Additionally, there is a potential for these changes to redefine Google's innovation strategy. With a renewed focus on AI and hardware engineering, the company might see a shift in how teams are structured, how projects are prioritized, and how creativity and innovation are fostered within the organization.
While Google's restructuring is strategically aimed at driving growth and maintaining its competitive edge, it is crucial to consider the multifaceted implications of these decisions. They affect the current workforce and play a significant role in shaping the company's future in terms of culture, talent management, and innovation trajectory.A comparative industry perspectiveIn the broader tech industry sector, Google's restructuring strategy aligns with trends observed in other leading technology firms. Companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) have undertaken similar restructurings, indicative of an industry-wide focus on adapting to the evolving digital environment. These shifts are not isolated incidents but reflect a collective move towards greater efficiency and modernization across the technology sector.Google's restructuring, particularly its emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud services, mirrors initiatives seen in other tech giants. This parallel indicates a significant industry pivot towards leveraging these advanced technologies to drive innovation and maintain a competitive edge. AI and cloud services are increasingly becoming central to the strategies of major tech companies, reshaping how they approach product development, data management, and customer engagement.


This trend towards AI and cloud services transforms the tech industry's operational models. As companies integrate these technologies into their core operations, they are redefining the skills needed in their workforce, the structure of their teams, and their overall business strategies. This shift also influences how companies allocate resources, prioritize projects, and approach market opportunities.What lies ahead?Looking forward, Google seems to be doubling down on its commitment to AI integration and operational efficiency. The tech giant is expected to continue aligning its resources with its primary product priorities, particularly in AI and cloud services. This forward-looking approach indicates Google's readiness to adapt and evolve in an industry where technological advancement and market demands are in constant flux.Steering the Future of AI and Cloud InnovationIn the face of its extensive restructuring, Google sets the stage for a future defined by advanced technologies like AI and cloud services. This strategic realignment is an adaptation to current trends and a proactive move to shape the technology landscape. Looking forward, Google's focus on innovation and operational efficiency is poised to keep it at the forefront of the rapidly evolving digital era, reinforcing its role as a leader in the tech industry. This period of transformation, though challenging, marks a significant step in Google's journey toward defining the future of technology and innovation.

Stewart's role will be critical in integrating these strategic elements to drive Goodyear’s growth and reinforce its position as a leader in the tire industry.Market pulse: Responding to the leadership changeThe stock price of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company showed modest fluctuations over the past few months, with no significant reaction to the news of Mark Stewart's appointment as CEO. Throughout this period, the stock price moved within a range of around $11 - $15, reflecting general market trends rather than specific responses to the expected leadership change. This stability suggests that the market had either anticipated the change or viewed it as part of Goodyear's ongoing strategic plans rather than as a disruptive or particularly influential event. The stock's performance indicates investors may take a wait-and-see approach, assessing how Stewart's leadership will impact the company's future growth and strategies. Analysts focusing on Goodyear have commented positively on Goodyear's overall transformation plan, which includes Stewart's appointment. The plan to beef up Goodyear’s financials aims to reduce debt, cut costs, and divest non-core business assets and has been viewed as a step towards a more profitable and focused Goodyear. This strategic direction, combined with Stewart's leadership, aims to capitalize on his extensive experience and operational expertise. As a result, Goodyear is poised for a transformative era in its illustrious history.


However, the true measure of success for Stewart's appointment will be observed in the long term, shaped by his strategic decisions and their practical implementation. The anticipation is that his leadership will rejuvenate Goodyear's market position, particularly by capitalizing on emerging trends in the automotive sector, such as the shift towards electric vehicles and sustainable transportation solutions.Stewart's track record at Stellantis, where he led significant operational transformations and oversaw the introduction of electrified vehicles, bodes well for Goodyear's strategic alignment with evolving market dynamics. His expertise and leadership style are expected to steer Goodyear through the challenges of a dynamic global market, enabling the company to navigate the currents of change and innovation in the tire industry.Charting the road aheadAs Stewart takes the reins, he faces a multifaceted landscape of challenges and opportunities. Much like the broader automotive sector, the tire industry is grappling with issues like supply chain disruptions, competitive pressures, and the imperatives of sustainable innovation. Stewart's ability to navigate these challenges while identifying and capitalizing on growth opportunities will be crucial for Goodyear's continued success.Mark Stewart's appointment as CEO of Goodyear marks a pivotal moment for the company. His deep industry experience and a track record of innovative leadership align well with Goodyear's strategic goals in an evolving market. As the tire industry faces the winds of change, Stewart's vision and expertise could drive Goodyear's continued success and adaptation in a competitive and dynamic global market.

30,Tesla's winter woes: A storm of challenges and disruption,"Jan 18, 2024",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/teslas-winter-woes-a-storm-of-challenges-and-disruption/468482,"
Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has navigated complex operational and environmental challenges in the past few months. These challenges have led to a 13% drop in Tesla’s stock price over the last thirty days. This combination of factors, ranging from supply chain disruptions to strategic pricing changes and technological obstacles in extreme weather conditions, has raised concerns about the company's growth trajectory and has drawn the attention of investors and analysts. Tesla’s upcoming Q4 earnings report and FY2024 guidance are eagerly awaited, as they are crucial in assessing Tesla's future in the fast-changing electric vehicle industry.Stock slides amid operational obstacles navigating the cold snapThe recent challenges placing Tesla in the headlines, including operational disruptions, strategic market adjustments, and technological limitations in cold weather, have impacted its stock price, contributing to a 13% decline in the past thirty days. Tesla's analysts are concerned about business growth, which has shown signs of deterioration in recent quarters. This, combined with the company's high valuation, makes some analysts cautious about Tesla's stock in the medium term.



Despite these concerns, Tesla's diverse business operations beyond just manufacturing cars offer some optimism. Its advancements in other areas, like energy solutions and technology innovations, provide potential growth avenues. However, the company's core focus on car manufacturing is subject to market cyclicality, which currently does not favor bullish sentiments.Investors eagerly anticipate the release of the Q4 earnings report and guidance for the fiscal year 2024, as it will impact the company's stock valuation. Manufacturing efficiency and the number of vehicles manufactured are pivotal in influencing investors' interest. While some investors maintain a positive outlook based on potential long-term growth, Tesla’s overall sentiment is a mix of optimism and caution. Some investors and Tesla stock analysts have adopted a bearish stance due to the company's prevailing challenges and market dynamics.


Supply chain disruptions lead to factory freezeTesla's Berlin gigafactory is pivotal to its European market growth. The Berlin gigafactory has recently halted operations due to supply chain issues linked to the Red Sea blockade. This crucial maritime channel is integral to global trade, and its disruption has had a domino effect, underlining the vulnerability of global manufacturing networks to geopolitical strife. The Berlin factory, known for its state-of-the-art production capabilities, now faces uncertainties that concern investors, particularly regarding potential delays in vehicle production and distribution. This halt impacts Tesla's operational efficiency and places added pressure on its stock value as the market reacts to these unforeseen challenges and the possible implications for Tesla's European market performance and overall global supply chain efficiency.Tesla's market maneuvers in China and EuropeIn response to intensifying competition in China and Europe, Tesla has strategically reduced prices for select models in these key markets. This price adjustment is calculated to strengthen Tesla’s standing, especially in China, where the demand for affordable electric vehicles is rapidly expanding. While this strategy could potentially increase Tesla's market share in the short term, it raises crucial questions about its long-term effects on its profitability and financial health. These concerns are particularly pertinent for investors as they weigh the implications of Tesla's pricing strategy on its future revenue streams and overall market sustainability. A scheduled pause at Shanghai's production powerhouseTesla's Shanghai factory is taking a scheduled break for the Lunar New Year, aligning with regional traditions. This closure, while routine, gains significance as it aligns with a time when Tesla's operational choices are under close observation. The temporary halt, typical in the context of local customs, introduces a new dimension to Tesla's efforts to satisfy global demand and rebuild investor confidence. The pause at this key manufacturing site, essential for Tesla's market presence in Asia, is a reminder of the balance the company must maintain between respecting local practices and ensuring steady production flow.Increasing voting power amidst stock slumpCEO Elon Musk's intention to augment his voting control of the company to around 25% has sparked a debate on Tesla’s corporate governance and strategic direction. This move could centralize decision-making and influence Tesla's future trajectory, an aspect closely monitored by investors and market analysts. Increased control by Musk may bring about decisive leadership but also raises questions about the balance of power within the company. This development, coupled with the current challenges, plays a significant role in shaping investor perceptions and the company's stock performance.


Tesla's cold weather conundrumTesla's recent encounter with extreme cold weather in the United States has exposed a significant challenge, as several Tesla vehicle models could not charge or experienced very slow charging under these harsh conditions. Extreme cold temperatures can significantly impact the performance of electric vehicle (EV) batteries. In harsh conditions, EVs may struggle to charge efficiently or, in more severe cases, might be unable to charge. This is partly because batteries need to be at a certain temperature to function optimally, and extreme cold can hinder their ability to store and use energy effectively. Additionally, the cold weather can affect the infrastructure, like the electric vehicle charging stations, leading to further complications in charging EVs efficiently.This issue, which is not exclusive to Tesla but prevalent among electric vehicles (EVs), has brought to light the technological limitations that EVs face in extreme climates. This problem has sparked concerns among consumers and has caught the attention of regulators, leading to scrutiny of Tesla's claims regarding vehicle performance in cold weather. Such developments have contributed to a lack of confidence among investors, adding further strain on Tesla's stock in an already challenging period. This situation illustrates the ongoing need for technological advancements in EVs to ensure reliability and performance in all weather conditions.Navigating a winter of discontentAs Tesla faces multiple operational, market, and environmental hurdles, its path forward is marked by challenges and opportunities. The 13% dip in stock price over the last month reflects the complex landscape the company navigates, from supply chain disruptions and pricing strategy, shifts to having to cope with the impact of extreme weather on electric vehicle technology. The anticipation around Tesla's Q4 earnings report and FY2024 guidance is high, holding potential insights into the company's strategy to address these complex issues. Investors and analysts actively watch how Tesla adapts and innovates in response to these challenges, balancing short-term pressures with long-term growth prospects.

Furthermore, the sector is embracing Industry 4.0 and fostering sustained expansion through advanced technologies.Given the sector's growth trajectory, it appears wise to acquire shares of robust industrial stocks, The Eastern Company (EML), Greenland Technologies Holding Corporation (GTEC), and Team, Inc. (TISI), which exhibit significant untapped potential for substantial returns. Before delving into the featured stocks, let’s look into the sector's dynamics.



In 2023, the U.S. manufacturing sector harnessed the impetus from three pivotal laws enacted in 2021 and 2022: the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), driving progress and development.The IIJA, CHIPS, and IRA have catalyzed unprecedented private sector investment in U.S. manufacturing by injecting funds and tax incentives into key sectors.


The manufacturing sector has experienced substantial growth in construction spending following the enactment of these acts. Post-IRA implementation, nearly 200 new clean technology manufacturing facilities, with a cumulative investment of $88 billion, have been announced.Additionally, in November, new orders for manufactured goods increased by $14.9 billion or 2.6% to $592.9 billion, as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. Shipments, following two consecutive monthly decreases, rose by $2.7 billion or 0.5% to $580.7 billion during the period.Significant investments in onshoring, infrastructure, and sustainability hold the potential for sustained growth in diverse industrial sectors. Recent opportunities include commercial aerospace, utility infrastructure, residential construction, and shipping companies, positioning these segments for long-term expansion.Furthermore, the sector is undergoing a transformative shift from traditional machine-based assembly lines to ""smart factories,"" embracing robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), data analytics, Augmented Reality (AR), and other advanced technologies.


Known as Industry 4.0, this evolution signifies the next phase in manufacturing digitization, propelled by advancements in automation and connectivity. Considering this encouraging outlook, let’s look at the fundamentals of the three industrial stocks.The Eastern Company (EML)EML designs, manufactures, and markets engineered solutions for industrial sectors, providing turnkey returnable packaging, packaged consumer goods, and pharmaceuticals.

32,Recession &amp; Bear Market Warning from Tuesday?,"Jan 17, 2024",Steve Reitmeister,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/recession-amp-bear-market-warning-from-tuesday/468432,"
Tuesday stocks fell after a truly horrific economic report pushing them back from near the all time highs for the S&P 500 (SPY). Was this report the cause for the market decline? And what does it mean for the market going forward? 43 year investment veteran Steve Reitmeister shares his views and top 13 trades in the commentary that follows below.The Empire State Manufacturing Index plummeted before the market open on Tuesday. Subsequently, the stock market plummeted too.Is that coincidence or causation?That important exploration, and what it means for the stock market going forward, will be the focus of today’s Reitmeister Total Return commentary.Market Commentary



The Empire State Manufacturing Index is one of the most widely followed regional economic reports. That’s because it covers the large manufacturing base in New York, which is often a bellwether for industrial activity across the country.Well, that vital index plummeted to a reading of -43.7 on Tuesday morning. That is shockingly bad when the consensus estimate called for a reading of only -5.The worst of the component ratings was the -49.4 showing for New Orders. That forward looking element does not bode well for what lies ahead.This news on Tuesday morning is certainly part of the mix leading to a pullback in stocks. But before you hit the panic button let’s consider a few things starting with this chart:


Note how bad this report has been for the past year...even though the entire time the national economy has been in positive territory and a bull market has emerged. A lot of that has to do with manufacturing being a touch weak while the much larger services sector was doing quite well.Another oddity is that also on Tuesday the 10 year Treasury rates spiked once again back above 4%. That is in great contradiction to what the weakness of the Empire State Index would imply.Meaning that manufacturing report, if considered a harbinger of what is to show up in other economic reports, would have many more people worried about the likelihood of future recession. And as you know, recessions are deflationary which would absolutely have rates heading lower on Tuesday...not higher as what happened.


The point being, investors are not reacting to the weakness in the Empire State Manufacturing Index. Especially true when broader, and more complete, readings of the economy are still quite healthy. For example, the +2.2% growth estimate for Q4 as measured by the famed GDPNow model.Are you saying that investors are once again worried about rising rates and what the Fed will do at upcoming meetings? Not really worried about that either, thanks to an impressive showing for the Producer Price Index (PPI) on Friday. Year over year that is down to only 1% inflation. Even better was finding the month to month PPI reading actually in minus territory.Meaning that high inflation continues to head lower increasing the odds at the Fed will start lowering rates at some point this year. The greater mystery is whether that begins at the March, May or June Fed meetings.


I believe that the reason for Tuesday’s stock sell off is much more benign when you appreciate that 4,800 poses serious resistance for the S&P 500 (SPY). That’s because it equates to making new all time highs for the stock market.It will be hard to break to those new highs without supreme confidence that the Fed will start lowering rates to spark greater economic activity which begets higher earnings growth which, as we all know, begets higher share prices.This very concept was at the heart of my recent commentary: When Will the Bull Market Run Again?At the earliest, that rate cut and stock catalyst may be in hand as early as March 20th where investors currently place 67% odds on a rate cut taking place. To be honest, I think it’s closer to 50/50 chance making the May 1st and June 12th meetings as real possibilities.


Long story short, I do not expect a meaningful stock advance until after the Fed makes the first rate cuts. That most likely points to a trading range forming with 4,800 being the upside and the previous support area of 4,600 being the downside.That may not be exciting...but it is not scary either. Especially true after the tremendous bull run we enjoyed to close out the year. So, to give back 3-5% shouldn’t shock anyone.Instead, this is a good time to review all your stock holdings. Which are getting rich in valuation prompting you to take profits. And which new picks, with more appealing upside, should be added back.Our POWR Ratings is certainly helpful in that regard. We just updated the long term performance through the end of 2023:The good news of those results is the nearly 4X advantage of our A rated stocks over the S&P 500 since the start of 1999.The bad news is that there are currently nearly 300 A rated stocks.

33,3 Pharma Stocks for January 2024 Profits,"Jan 16, 2024",Mangeet Kaur Bouns,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/3-pharma-stocks-for-january-2024-profits/468386,"
The pharmaceutical industry is thriving, fueled by steady demand for drugs, cost-efficient alternative discoveries, and rapid technological innovations. Hence, fundamentally strong pharma stocks Novo Nordisk (NVO), Eton Pharmaceuticals (ETON), and Pacira BioSciences (PCRX) might be profitable buys now. Read on….The pharmaceutical industry is considered recession-proof, given the consistent demand for medicines and new treatment options. Moreover, the industry is experiencing a drastic transformation with the growing adoption of advanced and innovative digital technologies.Given the industry’s promising prospects, it could be wise to invest in quality pharma stocks Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO), Eton Pharmaceuticals (ETON), and Pacira BioSciences, Inc. (PCRX) for substantial gains.



Medical needs are surging around the globe due to the rapidly aging population and growing prevalence of chronic diseases, such as arthritis, asthma, cancer, diabetes, ulcerative colitis, cystic fibrosis, and more. The pharmaceutical industry is expected to witness robust long-term growth, driven by an increase in drug demand amid expanding healthcare needs.Revenue in the pharmaceuticals market is expected to reach a staggering $636.90 billion in 2024. The market’s largest segment, Oncology Drugs, is projected to total  $114.60 billion this year. In global comparison, the United States is expected to generate the most revenue of nearly $636.90 billion.


During the forecast period (2024-2028), the pharmaceuticals market is anticipated to exhibit a CAGR of 6%, resulting in a market volume of $802.80 billion by 2028.Increasing healthcare costs and the need for enhanced accessibility to medication drive high demand for generic drugs. The global generic pharmaceutical market is estimated to be worth around $740.50 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 8.1% during the forecast period from 2024 to 2032.The growing pressure in the pharma industry to reduce production costs and improve efficiency is propelling corporations to take substantial strides toward automation. That has resulted in increased adoption of digital technologies across the pharma value chain, from drug discovery to packaging.Advanced technologies, including AI, IoT, blockchain, robotics, and big data analytics, are being adopted by pharma companies to automate repetitive and hazardous tasks, improve quality and yields and meet compliance standards.


For instance, AI techniques can analyze large-scale biomedical data to identify existing drugs that can potentially have therapeutic advantages for different diseases. By repurposing approved drugs for new indications, AI is accelerating the drug discovery process and reducing costs.According to Coherent Market Insights, the global pharma 4.0 market is projected to hit $54.43 billion by 2031, expanding at a CAGR of 18.3% from 2024 to 2032.Investors’ interest in pharmaceutical stocks is evident from the iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF’s (IHE) 10.4% returns over the past six months.Given these favorable trends, let’s look at the fundamentals of the three Medical - Pharmaceuticals stocks, beginning with the third choice.Stock #3: Pacira BioSciences, Inc.

34,"Should You Buy, Hold, or Sell Commerce Bancshares (CBSH) and Wintrust Financial (WTFC) Ahead of Earnings?","Jan 16, 2024",Sristi Suman Jayaswal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/should-you-buy-hold-or-sell-commerce-bancshares-cbsh/468385,"
The banking industry has showcased resilience and stability despite encountering several challenges last year. Yet, bank profits could remain under pressure in 2024. As regional banks Commerce Bancshares (CBSH) and Wintrust Financial Corporation (WTFC) prepare to unveil their fourth-quarter earnings soon, let’s find out whether or not the stocks could be wise portfolio additions ahead of earnings….Investors have demonstrated an increasingly bullish outlook toward banking stocks. This trend is primarily fueled by indications from the Federal Reserve that no further rate hikes will be instituted this cycle. However, despite the keen attention given to bank stocks, bank profits are predicted to face continued pressure.Regional banks Wintrust Financial Corporation (WTFC) and Commerce Bancshares, Inc. (CBSH) are set to announce the results for the quarter that ended on December 31, 2023, soon.



Analysts expect WTFC’s revenue and EPS for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 (ended December 2023) to be $579.32 million and $2.52, up 5.2% and 13.1% year-over-year, respectively. On the contrary, CBSH’s revenue and EPS for the same quarter are expected to decline 4.1% and 14.3% year-over-year to $385.93 million and $0.85, respectively.Given this backdrop, let’s further analyze as to why WTFC should be kept on one's watchlist for better entry opportunities, while CBSH should be best avoided. But first, let’s look at what’s shaping the banking industry before delving deeper into the fundamentals of the two stocks.


2023 presented a challenging landscape for banking institutions, with significant operational and macroeconomic hurdles arising. Despite these challenges, the sector demonstrated notable resilience, navigating the complexities effectively. Owing to escalating interest rates, banks saw an uplift in their revenue streams.While higher interest rates can indeed be beneficial for banks, they have the potential to curtail loan growth by pushing up borrowing and deposit costs. However, the prospect of future reductions could stimulate the demand for goods and services, triggering an increase in bank lending accordingly.Nevertheless, there has been a growing cloud of pessimism looming over the banking sector. The most formidable contributor to this negativity has been the profound decline in profitability. Approximately 75% of bank stocks in 2022 saw price-to-book ratios dipping below 1. Concurrently, price-to-earnings multiples plummeted to nearly half of what they were in 2008.Similarly, shareholder returns on bank stocks have consistently fallen behind those of major market indexes since the global financial crisis, with this gap progressively broadening over time.


Looking ahead, Boston Consulting Group predicts that even if banks make substantial investments in productivity and undergo drastic simplifications in their operations, profitability will likely remain under strain. This pressure owes to mounting capital requirements and intensifying competition from emerging players in the sector, predominantly fintech firms.With these trends in mind, let's delve into the fundamentals of the two Midwest Regional Banks stock picks, starting with the weakest from the investment point of view.Stock #2: Commerce Bancshares, Inc. (CBSH)CBSH operates as the bank holding company for Commerce Bank. It provides retail, mortgage banking, corporate, investment, trust, and asset management products and services to individuals and businesses in the U.S. It operates through Consumer; Commercial; and Wealth segments.

37,Quality Stocks In…Garbage Stocks Out!,"Jan 13, 2024",Steve Reitmeister,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/quality-stocks-ingarbage-stocks-out/468307,"
Stocks keep flirting with the all time highs for the S&P 500 (SPY) and keep falling short. Meaning this is proving to be a stubborn level of resistance at 4,800. Why is that happening? And when will stocks finally break above? 43 year investment veteran Steve Reitmeister shares his view including a preview of his favorite stock picks now. Read on below for the answers.As suspected, the market is not ready to make new highs above 4,796 for the S&P 500 (SPY).That was quite evident Thursday as stocks jumped out of bed in the morning to touch those previous highs only to find stubborn resistance with the broad market heading lower from there.



Why are stocks struggling at this level? And what is an investor to do about it?The answers to those vital questions will be at the heart of today’s commentary.Market CommentarySome investment writers will have a fairly short hand, and highly inaccurate, way to describe what happened on Thursday.They will tell you that the CPI inflation reading was hotter than expected on Thursday morning. And that caused the stock market sell off that followed.That is simply not true. Here is what really happened. The CPI report came out an hour before the market open. And yet still the market leapt higher out of the gate. But once it touched the hem of the previous highs (4,796) a more than 1% intraday sell off that ensued.That pain is not so evident in the late session bounce and modest loss for S&P 500. Yet is a lot more apparent in the -0.7% showing for the small caps in the Russell 2000 on the session.Thus, the problem for lack of further stock advance is not about CPI report. Just a statement that investors are not prepared to breakthrough resistance to make new highs.


So, what is holding stocks back?I discussed that in greater detail in my last commentary: When Will the Bull Market Run Again? The essence of the story is that investors have less clarity on the next moves for the Fed than they had after the November and December meetings that sparked a tremendous end of year rally. Unfortunately, there has been a mixed bag of inflation and economic data that calls into question when rate cuts will begin.At the earliest those cuts could come at the March 20th meeting. But I sense that the more readings we get like Thursday’s CPI report, or last Fridays stronger than expected employment report...the more likely those first cuts get pushed off to either the May 1st or June 12th Fed meetings.


Digging into the CPI reading we find that inflation was expected to come in at 3.1% yet spiked to 3.4% on this reading. Core CPI was even worse at 3.9% year over year. Just still too far away from the Fed’s target of 2%.For the “wonks” out there you should dig into the Sticky Price resources created by the Atlanta Fed. To put it plainly, sticky inflation remains too sticky. The main elements are housing and wages that are not coming down as quickly as expected.When you appreciate the conservative nature of the Fed...and that they state over and over again that they are “data dependent”, then its hard to look at the recent data and assume they are ready to lower rates any time soon.Long story short, I don’t think that investors are ready for the next bull run to make new highs until they are more certain WHEN the Fed will finally start cutting rates. That delays the next upside move to March 20th at the earliest with May or June becoming all the more likely.


Hard to complain about settling into a trading range for a while given the tremendous pace of gains to end 2023. So this seems like a reasonable time for stocks to rest before making the next big move.The upside of the current range connects with the aforementioned all time high of 4,796...but really easier to think of the lid as 4,800.On the downside, that is a bit harder to infer. Typically trading ranges are 3-5% from top to bottom. So, for quick math let’s say around 4,600 on the bottom. This also represents the previous resistance point that took a long time to finally break above in early December.The good news is that I expect quality stocks to prevail even in a range bound market. Meaning that last year pretty much any piece of beaten down junk was bid higher. That party is OVER!


Instead, when you have a pretty fully valued market as we have now, then there will be a greater eye towards quality of fundamentals and value proposition. I spelled that out pretty completely in last week’s article: Is 2024 Prime Time for Value Stocks?The answer to the question posed in the headline is...YES. Meaning that 2024 is lining up nicely for value stocks.Case in point being the early results this year with our Top 10 Value strategy up +3.70% through Wednesday’s close vs. breakeven for S&P 500 and -2.80% for the small caps in the Russell 2000.I strongly believe that edge for value will continue as the year rolls on.

38,"Citigroup Slashes 20,000 Jobs: Restructuring or Retreat?","Jan 12, 2024",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/citigroup-slashes-20000-jobs-restructuring-or-retreat/468301,"
In a strategic pivot, Citigroup (NYSE: C), the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, has embarked on a significant restructuring initiative. This bold move involves dramatically reducing its workforce by 20,000 employees over the next two years. This move is signaling a 10% contraction of its global workforce and this decision marks a critical juncture in Citigroup's history. This strategic pivot reflects a deep commitment to revitalizing the company’s operational efficiency and boosting its financial performance.Driving forces behind Citigroup's restructuringThe catalyst behind Citigroup's decision to cut its workforce is complicated. The strategy shift is rooted in a series of financial and operational challenges. The bank's recent performance paints a grim picture, with a $1.8 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 2023. This loss is coupled with a 3% year-on-year revenue decline. These profitability figures are in stark contrast with the company’s peers in the banking sector, underlining inefficiencies and strategic missteps within Citibank. This restructuring, therefore, aims to streamline operations, eliminate redundancies, and refocus on core business areas, with anticipated cost savings of up to $2.5 billion.



Dissecting Citigroup's workforce reductionThis workforce reduction, which is slated to unfold over the next two years, is a calculated strategy. Citigroup is targeting a range of roles across various levels, indicating an overhaul that touches every corner of the organization. The bank has already initiated a trimming of senior management roles, suggesting a top-down reshaping approach. Importantly, Citigroup is also focusing on the human aspect, pledging comprehensive severance and outplacement support to the affected employees.Fraser navigates Citigroup's restructuringCEO Jane Fraser is the architect of this ambitious overhaul. Fraser remains steadfast in her vision for Citigroup's future. Despite acknowledging the disappointing recent performance in Citigroups financials, Fraser's strategy pivots towards a leaner, more focused operational model. The targeted approach aims to bolster efficiency, capitalize on growth opportunities, and shed non-core businesses. Fraser's leadership is pivotal in steering Citigroup through this transformative period, with 2024 earmarked as a critical year for witnessing the fruits of these efforts.


A broader view of job cuts Citigroup's workforce reduction reflects a larger industry-wide phenomenon. Other major banks like Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) have embarked on similar paths, signaling a sector-wide shift towards operational efficiency and digital transformation. This trend points to a changing banking and fintech landscape, where automation and streamlined operations are becoming increasingly prevalent.Restructuring's promise and perilThe restructuring at Citigroup stands at a crossroads of opportunity and challenge. The promise of cost savings and improved market positioning is substantial, yet the execution of such a sweeping change is fraught with complexities. The bank's leadership is tasked with the delicate balance of achieving operational excellence while managing the human dimensions of the restructuring process. The success of this endeavor will not only shape Citigroup's future but also potentially set a precedent for the banking industry at large.Navigating workforce reduction with careCitigroup's workforce reduction is more than a strategic maneuver; it has a profound human dimension. The impact on 10% of its workforce is significant, necessitating a responsible and empathetic approach to layoffs. The bank’s commitment to providing supportive measures for affected employees is crucial, underscoring the recognition of Citigroup’s social and corporate responsibility.Realigning for the futureThis restructuring is part of a broader strategic realignment for Citigroup. By focusing on its core competencies and exiting non-core businesses, the bank aims to become more agile and competitive. This realignment is essential for Citigroup to adapt to the rapidly evolving financial landscape and meet the changing needs of its clients and shareholders.


Cost savings and efficiency gainsA key driver behind the workforce reduction is the pursuit of cost savings and efficiency gains. Citigroup's targeted $2.5 billion savings reflects a crucial step in improving its financial health and operational agility. These savings are expected to enhance the bank's profitability and investor appeal, a vital aspect of its overall strategy.Technology and automationCitigroup's restructuring also underscores the growing importance of technology and automation in the banking sector. The bank aims to stay ahead in a rapidly digitizing world by streamlining operations and integrating technological solutions. This focus on technology is not only a cost-saving measure but also a strategic move to position Citigroup at the forefront of the digital banking revolution.Citigroup's decision to reduce its workforce by 20,000 is a significant milestone in its history. This move, while challenging, is driven by a clear vision for a more efficient, focused, and competitive future. The success of this transformative journey depends on effective execution, empathetic management of the human impact, and a clear focus on strategic realignment. As Citigroup embarks on this path, it sets a precedent for the banking industry, highlighting the delicate balance between financial imperatives and corporate responsibility. The road ahead is complex, but the potential rewards of a revitalized Citigroup are significant, not just for the bank itself but for its stakeholders and the broader financial world.

39,A 5-Step Survival Guide to Fundraising for a Niche Industry,"Jan 12, 2024",Kirill Gurskiy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/a-5-step-survival-guide-to-fundraising-for-a-niche-industry/466005,"
The global venture capital (VC) market is going through an undeniably rough phase caused by a seemingly unending stream of economic and geopolitical issues, simultaneously occurring across all corners of the globe. According to KPMG's ""Venture Pulse Q3 2023"" report, worldwide VC investment dropped to a sixteen-quarter low in Q3 2023. Many market players feel concerned by the historically high number of down rounds, the overall slowdown in the speed of VC deals and the protracted lack of exit opportunities.Based on CB Insights' ""State of Venture Q3 2023"" report, 9M of 2023 showed the lowest results in the amount of funding received by startups since the same period in 2019. The number of deals is also slightly lower: 21,216 deals during 9M of 2023 versus 22,992 deals within the same time frame in 2019.The same report states that during 9M of 2021, investors injected an astonishing $465.6B into startups, while during 9M of 2023, startups received only $193.6B. So, 2021 was a peak year for startup funding, while the current market has shrunk to less than half its size.



With no end to market challenges in sight, today's investors are much more cautious. The good old venture market that we knew prior to 2022 no longer exists. With that in mind, here are 5 pieces of advice that we'd like to share with all companies seeking VC funding in 2024.Related: VCs Want to See Product-Market Fit: Here's How to Prove It


1. The idea is not enough! Show VCs the first metrics and tractionIn the current financial climate, it's much more difficult to sell just a lofty idea or a talented team to investors, no matter how good your previous achievements and your concept are. Nowadays, everyone is looking for something more solid, like initial engagement figures. Most VCs will want to see the first metrics or a prototype of your product right away to confirm its potential. Focus your effort on that to make your pitch convincingly stand out.Also, you should deeply understand your market and its trends. Comprehend your competitors, envision their development trajectory, and clearly convey your thoughts on where you overlap, where you are better and where you have the potential to outpace them.2. Work out your marketing strategy and the path to customers from the very beginningCultivating your customer base should begin as early as possible. Talking to potential customers is a great way to validate your concepts. Their approval and insights gained from these conversations can prove to investors that your startup is on the right track. Beyond that, a startup that is already earning money gives more freedom to its team and looks better in the eyes of potential VC investors. The venture capital landscape has led to increased demands from funds to startups. What matters now is the fundamental strength of the business, not just its potential. Investors are now looking for not just growth but profitable growth. They want to invest in growing companies that are close to self-sufficiency.Today's market is oversaturated in many ways. The competition for the attention of consumers, talent, and investors is at an all-time high, and the flow of information is broad and intense. You need to figure out in advance how you will be breaking through all that noise to connect with your customers.


If your company serves a niche market, try reaching out to communities within that space. Perhaps your best strategy would be collaborating with micro-influencers or using highly targeted ads on social media platforms. Try exploring specific social networks and ways of communication that are typical for your niche (like games and Discord). For some niches, building reach offline rather than online may be better.Related: Venture Capital 101: A Comprehensive Guide for Startups Seeking Investment3. Start working with your community as soon as possibleOne of the most crucial aspects, and a sign that all investors consider a positive indicator of business health, is proof that your product is in demand by customers. The more traction you show in this area, the higher your chances of being funded and the better valuation you may receive. Start building your future fan base as early as possible to prove that you've figured out the path to your target audience. On this front, your community stands above all!Use all tools possible: launch YouTube or Discord channels, Twitter, Threads, Facebook groups and a Reddit thread for your startup with up-to-the-minute updates. Consider branching out into new platforms and become an early adopter. Every opportunity to keep your audience informed and engaged matters.


4. Think in advance and build your dry powderFundraising looks set to be an uphill battle in 2024. Few things are certain, least the time frame needed to secure an investment. Consequently, your best strategy would be securing a reserve fund for 12-18 months of runway. It can help to weather the ongoing storm still ravaging the markets.Start the process of fundraising at least six months before your funds are projected to run out. It widens your opportunities in terms of sources of capital to raise and decreases the chance of being knocked out by unforeseen circumstances. Also, in the current situation, it's better to reduce operational costs as much as possible to continue working on a project.Related: We Can't Rely on Venture Capital Funding to Build a Just and Thriving Entrepreneurial Economy. Here's What to Do Instead5. Try to discover as many investment options as you canPlan out the fundamentals of your fundraising strategy as early as possible. The wider the net cast towards potential investors, the higher your chances of securing the deal on terms favorable to you. Relying on a single funding source can be risky while diversifying your funding sources can help ensure stability and resilience.


Explore grants and individual donations within and beyond the angel investor community. Corporate partnerships and other options that align with your mission are worth investigating, too. Today, many countries are trying to develop their tech market by attracting companies and talent from abroad. They often offer special terms to startups, like lower taxes or even freedom from paying taxes for a couple of years. Think outside the box! For example, UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are very enthusiastic about accommodating startups, including games and tech companies. Bringing in innovation is a core part of their economic strategy.Ultimately, even though the VC market is going through a rocky period, it's still possible to secure funding, so long as you can prove your product viable. The trick is to show a strong understanding of how your product fits into the market. Provide community metrics, work out your unique selling points and marketing strategy from the inception, prepare your investor pitch thoughtfully and be ready to put more effort into the fundraising process than was required in the past.

40,Delta does a double-take: Clear skys or turbulence in 2024?,"Jan 12, 2024",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/delta-does-a-double-take-clear-skys-or-turbulence-in-2024/468293,"
Delta Air Lines' (NYSE: DAL) financial performance in 2023 could have been more consistent. The fourth quarter was record-breaking, demonstrating the company's operational efficiency and strategic foresight. However, this success is tempered by a conservative outlook for 2024, underscoring the complex dynamics in the aviation and transportation sector and leading to a downward adjustment in Delta’s stock price. Some analysts are questioning whether Delta’s stock is still a buy, so let’s take a closer look at Delta’s 2024 strategy.A closer look at the profitsDelta's strong showing in international travel was a major source of profit. The company capitalized on pent-up demand for international travel, a smart move that paid dividends. Passenger traffic on these routes took off, indicating a renewed interest in global travel following the pandemic. Delta's expansion of its network, particularly in premium cabins, was a well-calculated move that yielded significant benefits for the company’s bottom line. These cabins, known for their superior comfort and amenities, saw a substantial increase in sales, demonstrating consumers' willingness to pay for a better travel experience.



The challenges aheadDespite its successes, Delta faces several challenges that have prompted it to adopt a cautious stance for 2024. The airline industry is notoriously unstable, and fluctuating operational costs are a significant concern. Fuel prices are always a wild card in the aviation sector, and rising labor costs have begun to eat into Delta's profit margins. Additionally, aircraft repair supply chain disruptions have caused logistical difficulties and increased maintenance expenses. These factors and the unpredictable nature of global economic conditions have necessitated a more conservative approach to the company's 2024 financial projections.Soaring ambitions amidst headwindsDelta Air Lines' performance in the fourth quarter of 2023 blended soaring achievements and emerging challenges. The company's strategic decisions, particularly in international market expansion and premium cabin offerings, paid off with a significant revenue increase. 


The upswing in international travelDelta's focus on international routes was a strategic masterstroke. The company capitalized on the global rebound in travel demand, particularly in premium segments. This focus provided a revenue boost and helped diversify its revenue streams, reducing reliance on more volatile domestic markets.Navigating the challengesReviewing Delta Air Line's financials shows that operational costs, a long-standing issue in the aviation industry, have become a major obstacle. The constant growth of fuel and labor expenses and supply chain problems in aircraft maintenance strained the company's profit margins. The domestic market, characterized by fierce competition and fare reductions, added another layer of complexity. Delta's response, which is marked by a cautious 2024 outlook, demonstrates its dedication to long-term stability over short-term gains.Strategic Fleet ExpansionThe purchase of 20 Airbus (OTCMKTS: EADSY) A350-1000 aircraft has been a hot topic in Delta's news, and it is seen as a strategic move that aligns with the company's focus on operational efficiency and market expansion. These aircraft, known for their fuel efficiency, will help reduce operating costs while opening avenues for increased cargo revenue. This decision underscores Delta's adaptability and foresight in a rapidly evolving aviation landscape.Delta's strategies for 2024's turbulenceAs Delta Air Lines prepares for 2024, the company faces the potential of significant challenges. Rising operational costs and supply chain challenges are at the forefront of its strategic planning.


Emphasizing cost containmentCost management is a crucial aspect of Delta's strategy for 2024. This involves optimizing fleet utilization, including strategically deploying fuel-efficient aircraft and potentially retiring older, less economical models. Streamlining internal processes and renegotiating supplier contracts are other avenues the company is exploring to keep costs in check.A future-ready fleetIncorporating Airbus A350-1000 jets into Delta's fleet is a forward-thinking move. These fuel-efficient jets have larger cargo capacities, opening new revenue channels. The extended range of these aircraft also allows Delta to explore new long-haul routes, further solidifying its competitive edge in the international market.Sustainability and technology as pillarsBeyond immediate cost considerations, Delta is positioning itself as a sustainability and technological innovation leader. Delta’s ESG scores need improvement, and the company is looking toward investments in alternative fuels and carbon offset programs to reflect its commitment to environmental responsibility. Exploring advanced data analytics and automation technologies will further optimize operations and enhance passenger experiences.Navigating external factorsHowever, external factors like global economic conditions and industry trends significantly influence Delta's future success. Fluctuating fuel prices and potential economic downturns can disrupt Delta's strategic plans. Therefore, maintaining flexibility and market awareness will be crucial for the airline to navigate the uncertain times ahead.


Analyzing soaring highs and potential dipsDelta Air Lines stands at a crucial juncture, with opportunities and challenges shaping its future trajectory. Strengths and opportunitiesDelta's strengths are numerous: a strong international network, a modern, fuel-efficient fleet, and a solid reputation for customer service. The company's strategic focus on operational efficiency and network optimization continues to be a competitive advantage. The opportunities, such as the potential for increased cargo revenue and leveraging sustainability initiatives, present avenues for growth and differentiation in a crowded market.Weaknesses and threatsHowever, weaknesses such as cost pressures and reliance on volatile international markets must be addressed. The domestic market's oversupply and intense competition pose additional challenges. External threats, including economic downturns and fluctuating fuel prices, add to the complexity of Delta's operating environment.Delta Air Lines enters 2024 with strategic successes and looming challenges. Its legacy of resilience, strategic market positioning, and proactive investments in technology and sustainability position it well for future success. However, the airline must deftly navigate rising operational costs, supply chain disruptions, and global market uncertainties. Delta's adaptability, strategic planning, and ability to balance immediate challenges with long-term vision will be key in maintaining its leadership position in the volatile aviation industry.

41,Is Your Opinion of Day Trading Accurate? Take This Quiz,"Jan 12, 2024",Ross Cameron,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/is-your-opinion-of-day-trading-accurate-take-this-quiz/467672,"
Opinions on day trading vary depending on who you talk to. Some of the criticism you hear is warranted, while others are just emotion-led opinions. Let's distinguish between misconceptions and the actual facts surrounding this practice.""Day trading is simply gambling; nothing more and nothing less.""False. It certainly is true that plenty of gamblers try day trading, just as plenty of gamblers may make other types of investments based on a ""hot tip."" But it's a mistake to label all-day traders as mere gamblers. That opinion usually comes from outsiders who form their views based on movies or social media.Professional day trading is a highly disciplined process. It involves learning a great deal about the movements of stocks, assessment of risk — and perhaps most importantly — human nature. I mean not only how other traders react to market movements but also how you react when things are going well and especially when they are not.



Day trading is humbling to those who work hard at it before it ever becomes consistently profitable, but that outcome is possible.Related: How to Find Great Stocks for Day Trading


""Scientists talk about separating a signal from noise. With long-term investing, it's possible to detect signals like stock fundamentals. With day trading — where positions are held for hours, minutes, or even seconds — it's all noise.""False. I can't speak for high-frequency trading, where trades are sometimes measured in milliseconds, but no matter what duration you hold stocks, it's possible to detect signals among a great deal of noise.Day traders are keenly focused on patterns that repeat. I'm reminded of fractal patterns that can be found in giant trees and also under the microscope.It's certainly true that sometimes I might notice a pattern forming in the last series of trades on a stock, and I may even take a position only to discover that the expected pattern did not materialize. That's when I will likely close out the position, cut my losses, and turn it into a learning moment. I am a huge proponent of journaling after a trading session. I write what I thought would happen, then what did happen, and what I can learn from the episode. Rigorous analysis of trades is my shortcut to getting better over time.""Day trading is inherently riskier than any other form of investing, except for crypto and futures.""False. If I take a position in a $7 stock, not only will I be watching it intently, but even before I take that position, I will have calculated the point at which I bail out if the stock goes south — no hand-wringing; just executing a plan. Therefore, I'm not at risk of losing the entire value of that position. Contrast that with people who trade penny stocks that can go to zero quickly, or options investing where one moment the option is worth something, and the next moment it has evaporated. That kind of investment is too rich for my blood.


Related: How I Turned $583 into $10 Million by Day Trading""Day traders who take positions in order to ""stick it to the man"" are misguided at best and idiots at worst.""True. I'm all for investing in entities that provide a useful service and are not involved in illicit or unethical activities. But I don't regard investing as the soapbox for broadcasting my views. When I am day trading, I'm looking for stocks that at this very moment are behaving in a certain way: they have made a significant move on high volume; that move is because of certain things like news of a successful drug trial or announcement of a new product; and the stock trades in my preferred range of $2 to $10, among other factors. My goal is to invest prudently and professionally. Then I can use any profits to make political statements.""Gamers make the best day traders.""False. It certainly is true that many great day traders also are veteran gamers; but simply being fast with the keyboard does not make you a natural day trader.Gamers bring to the table certain advantages like being proficient with commands and also being able to make quick decisions. Both are useful when day trading, but they are not enough. You must also have a great deal of self-awareness and self-discipline: At this moment are your emotions being hijacked by FOMO after you just saw some traders make a killing on a stock? Are you tempted to ride a stock down ""just a little longer"" when your preset threshold indicates you should sell?


Fast fingers are a plus. What's even more important is what goes on between your ears.Related: 10 Important Things You Need to Know Before You Try Day Trading Stocks""Highly trained, professional day traders can actually eliminate market risk.""False. I've logged well over 20,000 trades in my career. I am an intensive student of the profession and have every tool at my disposal. Even so, I cannot eliminate all market risks. The most that I can hope for is to learn from my mistakes and be highly disciplined in how and when I place my trades. That goes a long way toward reducing my risk. Even when I'm completely on my game, occasionally the market will smack me back into humbleness.Perhaps there are certain professions, like sports, art or poker, where extreme cockiness can pay off. Day trading is not one of them.


""Anyone including day traders can get lucky in the short term, but eventually that luck will run out; it's called 'regression to the mean.'""False. I do think that ""beginner's luck"" is a thing. Some people get excited about day trading because they got a hot tip, opened an account, and made a few thousand.Let's say that is you. Congrats. What's important is what you do next. If you think you can find another hot tip and replicate that success, you're in for a rude surprise.Instead, if that first easy win made you curious about day trading and you decide to get serious about how it really works, then good for you. You're on the ground floor of a whole lot of steps you must take to become a disciplined and effective trader.

42,2024 Auto Stock Buy or Sell: Nikola (NKLA) vs. Toyota Motor (TM),"Jan 12, 2024",Mangeet Kaur Bouns,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/2024-auto-stock-buy-or-sell-nikola-nkla-vs-toyota-motor/468273,"
With sustained demand for new vehicles, rapid shift to electric vehicles (EVs) globally, and ongoing technology trends, the automotive industry is expected to maintain solid momentum in 2024 and beyond. Amid this, let’s find out if you should buy or sell auto stocks Nikola (NKLA) and Toyota Motor (TM). Read more….In this article, I evaluated two auto stocks, Nikola Corporation (NKLA) and Toyota Motor Corporation (TM), to determine which has the potential for substantial returns. After comparing the fundamentals of these stocks, we believe TM is a solid buy, while NKLA is best avoided for reasons explained throughout this piece.New auto sales in the U.S. witnessed a significant rebound in 2023 after experiencing a decade-low in 2022. Several factors, including pent-up demand, improved inventories, and generous incentives, drove the surge in sales. According to data by Wards Intelligence, U.S. new vehicle sales last year finished at nearly 15.5 million units, of which EVs, including hybrids, made up around 17%.



New vehicle sales reached the highest since 2019 and exceeded approximately 13.9 million in 2022, as per figures from consultant Cox Automotive.“This is the third consecutive year in which U.S. consumers spent more than half a trillion dollars buying new vehicles, J.D. Power stated in a report last month.


According to a report by Market Research Future, the global automotive industry is projected to reach $6.07 trillion by 2030, expanding at a CAGR of 6.9% during the forecast period. Surging demand for EVs worldwide and rapid digital transformation would fuel the market’s profitability and growth.Environmental concerns, rising gasoline prices, and government incentives, among other factors, are encouraging people worldwide to switch to EVs. As per estimates from Kelley Blue Book, a Cox Automotive company, a record 1.2 million EVs were sold in the U.S.Further, the Cox Automotive Economic and Industry Insights team expects 2024 to be “the Year of More” for EVs, with more new products, more incentives, more inventory, more leasing, and more infrastructure. The team forecasts the EV share of the U.S. market this year to reach 10%.The automotive industry has seen a tremendous transformation, with the recent technology trends disrupting how value is delivered to customers. Advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and data analytics, are being adopted by auto manufacturers to optimize operations and enhance customer experience.


With an enhanced focus on sustainability and eco-friendliness, manufacturers are increasingly using green technologies, like biofuels and hydrogen fuel cells, to lower their carbon footprint.Therefore, auto stocks NKLA and TM will likely benefit from the industry’s promising growth prospects. Given sound fundamentals and a bright outlook, it could be wise to invest in TM, but struggling NKLA is best avoided now.NKLA has declined 46.7% over the past three months, while TM has surged 9.5%. NKLA has slumped 47.8% over the past six months, compared to TM’s 23.1% gain. In addition, NKLA has plunged 69.2% over the past year, while TM has climbed 40.4%.Here are several reasons why we think TM could perform better in the near term:Latest DevelopmentsOn December 20, 2023, NKLA, via the HYLA brand and FirstElement Fuel (FEF), a global leader in hydrogen refueling station solutions, formalized a definitive 10-year agreement to refuel Nikola’s hydrogen fuel cell electric truck at FEF’s hydrogen refueling station in Oakland, California.This partnership unifies both the companies’ commitment to driving the adoption of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles and marks a significant step toward a greener and more sustainable future.On November 27, TM unveiled its newly designed NASCAR Cup Series (NCS) Toyota Camry XSE race car which is expected to make its debut in the 2024 NCS season. The Camry XSE Next Gen follows the Toyota Camry TRD Next Gen, which produced around 18 victories and 25 poles in the last two seasons of competition.


“The 2024 Camry XSE race car will properly highlight Toyota’s attention to detail as has been showcased in the new street version Toyota Camry. We are excited to bring this car to the race track and continue to achieve success with it for years to come,” said Paul Doleshal, group manager of motorsports, TMNA (Toyota Motor North America).Recent Financial ResultsFor the third quarter that ended September 30, 2023, NKLA reported total revenues of negative $1.73 million, compared to $24.24 million in the same quarter of 2022. Its gross loss widened by 316% year-over-year to $125.50 million. Also, the company’s loss from operations for the quarter came in at $226.17 million.Furthermore, Nikola’s net loss worsened by 80.2% from the previous year’s period to $425.76 million, and its net loss per share was $0.50.


TM’s sales revenues increased 24% year-over-year to ¥11.43 trillion ($78.52 billion) during the fiscal 2024 second quarter ended September 30, 2023. Its operating income grew 155.6% from the year-ago value to ¥1.44 trillion (9.89 billion). The company’s income before income taxes came in at ¥1.80 trillion ($12.37 billion), up 121.7% from the prior year’s quarter.In addition, net income attributable to TM rose 194.3% year-over-year to ¥1.28 trillion ($8.79 billion), and earnings per share attributable to TM was ¥94.51, an increase of 197.9% year-over-year.Past And Expected Financial PerformanceOver the past three years, NKLA’s revenue has increased at a CAGR of 499.9%. The company’s total assets have grown at a CAGR of 0.4% over the same time frame. However, its tangible book has declined at a 20.4% CAGR over the same period.


Analysts expect NKLA’s revenue for the fiscal year (ended December 2023) to decline 22.3% year-over-year to $39.49 million, and the company is expected to report a loss per share of $1.19 for the same period.

43,"Financial Stock Trio - Buy, Hold, or Sell?","Jan 12, 2024",Sristi Suman Jayaswal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/financial-stock-trio-buy-hold-or-sell/468265,"
Amid the escalating interest rate climate, finance companies appear favorably poised to augment their profit margins. Given this backdrop, let’s assess the prospects of financial services stocks Moody's (MCO), Discover Financial Services (DFS), and Qifu Technology (QFIN) to determine the best investment opportunity in this space. Read on….The financial services industry is strategically positioned to experience significant growth and expansion due to robust demand bolstered by solid consumer spending and increased business investment activity. The current high-interest rate environment benefits financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies, brokerage firms, and money management entities.Given the industry’s promising outlook, in this piece, we evaluate three financial services stocks to shed light on how they can help an investor capitalize on the prevailing industry tailwinds.



Solid buy candidates for 2024 appear to be Moody's Corporation (MCO) and Qifu Technology, Inc. (QFIN), given their robust fundamentals. Conversely, Discover Financial Services (DFS) should be kept on one's watchlist for better entry opportunities.The Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate to its highest point in 22 years since March 2022, with rates currently set between 5.25%-5.5%. Despite projections of rate cuts, it seems unlikely they will happen anytime soon, thus keeping rates elevated for some more months.


The financial services industry revenues positively correlate with the rising interest rates. Consequently, the prevailing high-interest condition compels borrowers to pay more interest, which could heighten revenue for these service providers.The financial services market is expected to grow to $33.31 trillion in 2026. The market is then expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% from 2026 and reach $45.15 trillion in 2031.The global consumer finance market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.1%, reaching $1.96 trillion by 2029. Key market propellants encompass swift loan approvals from government and private banks or financial organizations and the easy availability of various loans, such as home, auto, and student loans.The digitization momentum in the industry has significantly transformed the financial services sector, fulfilling the requirements of individuals, corporations, governments, and investment institutions. The impact of financial technology, or 'Fintech,' has eradicated barriers to financial services while simultaneously enhancing consumer value, propelling small business growth, and bolstering the economy.

44,TSMC flatlines Q4 revenue but AI boom signals bright future,"Jan 10, 2024",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/tsmc-flatlines-q4-revenue-but-ai-boom-signals-bright-future/468173,"
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM), the world's largest contract chipmaker, defied Wall Street expectations with a flat fourth-quarter revenue report. At first glance, this may seem underwhelming. However, a closer look reveals a more complicated strategy at play. This new strategy masks a strategic pivot towards a booming future fueled by Artificial Intelligence (AI).From humble foundry to industry titanTSMC is a foundry, a silicon subcontractor, that creates the miniature brains that power our digital world. Unlike traditional chipmakers that design and manufacture their chips, TSMC only fabricates chips, carefully constructing these complex circuits based on designs provided by technology leaders like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM).



This distinctive “foundry model” has propelled TSMC to the top of the industry. It is the world’s largest chipmaker, holding the title of Asia’s most valuable company. Its chips power our smartphones, tablets, and laptops, enabling the seamless flow of information that defines our modern lives. The company’s reach extends far beyond consumer electronics. TSMC’s silicon powers the servers that crunch data in the cloud, the high-performance computing clusters driving scientific breakthroughs, and even the silicon designed to power the emerging artificial intelligence sector.Flat revenue, soaring prospectsAt first glance, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's recent Q4 revenue report may seem contradictory. The company's flat results contrast with strong global tech demand. However, a closer look reveals a more complex story of strategic reinvention driven by the growing wave of artificial intelligence (AI).


While overall revenue remained level compared to the same period last year, a closer inspection provides a little more context. TSMC experienced a slight dip in smartphone chip sales, reflecting market saturation and pandemic-induced demand normalization. Additionally, certain legacy product lines encountered issues due to ongoing supply chain constraints. These factors, combined with ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, contributed to the muted headline revenue figures.In contrast to the flatlining revenue figures, the AI-centric chip sales numbers demonstrated considerable promise. As AI’s insatiable appetite for computational power grows, TSMC has shifted its focus toward crafting the specialized silicon chips that underpin these next-generation systems. This deliberate shift toward higher-margin, cutting-edge AI chips, while strategically dampening overall revenue in the short term, is sowing the seeds for explosive future growth.Maneuvering the silicon circuitTSMC's AI-driven pivot has promising potential, but the tech industry faces challenges specific to the tech sector. The challenges, geopolitical uncertainty, and intense technological competition necessitate carefully navigating the company's internal strategy.Tensions on the horizonTSMC's geographic location in Taiwan casts a long shadow in today's volatile geopolitical climate. The ongoing tensions between the United States and China, both key markets for the company, add an element of risk. Any escalation could disrupt supply chains, impact trade relations, and jeopardize TSMC's global position.


The race for next-gen nanosBeyond geopolitical concerns, the tech race continues to intensify. Rivals like China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (OTCMKTS: SMICY) are closing the gap, making significant strides in miniaturization and threatening TSMC's technological leadership. The relentless pursuit of next-generation chips, like the 3nm node, demands substantial R&D investments and continuous innovation to stay ahead of the curve.Charting the courseTSMC is not sitting idly by in the face of these challenges. The company is actively pursuing a multi-pronged strategy to mitigate risks and secure its future. Expansion plans include building new facilities, diversifying manufacturing capabilities, and reducing reliance on any geographic location. Additionally, TSMC is pouring resources into R&D, focusing on cutting-edge technologies like 3nm chips and advanced packaging solutions to maintain its technological edge.Supply chain symphonyRecognizing the vulnerability of a single-source supply chain, TSMC is also proactively diversifying its material sourcing and collaborating with key partners to strengthen its ecosystem. This collaborative approach aims to build resilience and minimize disruptions caused by unforeseen events.TSMC's global footprint and future impactWhile TSMC's Q4 results may have initially raised questions, a deeper analysis reveals a company at the precipice of a transformative era. Beyond the flatline and AI pivot lies a broader narrative, one interwoven with leadership transitions, global implications, and the very future of technological innovation.


The recent appointment of C.C. Wei as CEO marks a new chapter in TSMC's leadership. His extensive experience within the company and focus on technological advancement position him well to navigate the challenges and opportunities of the AI landscape. This leadership shift and TSMC's unwavering commitment to R&D suggest a future fueled by sustained innovation and continued industry dominance.But TSMC's impact extends far beyond internal transitions. Their success and challenges are linked to the health of the global tech ecosystem. Their chips power the devices that drive our economies, shape our communications and push the boundaries of scientific discovery. A resilient TSMC signifies a thriving tech landscape, fostering progress and economic growth.

45,When Will the Bull Market Run Again?,"Jan 10, 2024",Steve Reitmeister,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/when-will-the-bull-market-run-again/468128,"
The late 2023 rally is now over with stocks taking a step back in the new year. Some believe there are signs that stocks may be ready to break to new highs for the S&P 500. However, investment veteran Steve Reitmeister believes that may not happen til the spring with a trading range forming now. Below he spells out why including a preview of his top 13 trades. Read on below for more.Given the intensity of the November/December bull run...it only made sense for investors to take a step back to start 2024.Now just a week later, investors seem ready to buy that modest dip with the all time highs for the S&P 500 (SPY) of 4,796 once again in sight.Are investors ready to break higher...or will 4,796 prove to be stubborn resistance a good while longer? That and more will be at the heart of this week’s Reitmeister Total Return commentary.Market CommentaryTo start the year there was a lot of profit taking and price reversals across the investment spectrum.This was obviously true with the stock market. Especially the big name tech stocks giving up a small chunk of their tremendous gains from 2023.This can easily be understood as a strategy to delay the tax consequences of those capital gains for another year. But that wasn’t the only group reversing course.



Let’s remember that the main catalyst for the late 2023 stock rally was the tremendous decline in bond rates as the Fed finally looked prepared to lower rates in the new year. This had the 10 year rate tumbling from 5% to under 3.8% in the final couple months.So, when bond investors took some profits off the table with 10 year rates bouncing back over 4%...that too was yet another reason for the early 2024 stock market declines.That was then...this is now with stocks bouncing back the last few sessions pushing back towards the all time highs 4,796.There is little doubt that stocks will break above at some point this year. That’s because the prospect of lower rates starting in 2024 looms large as a catalyst for corporate earnings growth and therefore stock prices.


But WHEN that happens is a bit of a mystery that got more complicated last Friday after the release of the Government Employment Situation report.Not only did job adds come in higher than expected at 216K jobs added versus 150K expected, but also wage inflation stayed too hot at +4.1% year over year (above consensus). Even worse was the month over month reading at +0.4% which speaks to the pace of increases closer to 5% annualized.The Fed is not going to like these figures in their fight against high inflation. Not that they would necessarily raise rates again...but perhaps dig in their heels at the current restrictive level longer than investors anticipate.This came through loud and clear with the changes to odds for when rates will likely be cut as measured by the CME.The March 20th Fed meeting was the one that investors expected the first rate cuts to flow in. That has been cut from 89% likelihood a week ago to 61% today.Interestingly, not everything is rainbows and lollipops with the economic data. The manufacturing sector continues in contraction territory as can be seen by the recent 47.4 reading for ISM Manufacturing. In fact, the sector has not grown according to this report since mid 2022.More interestingly, ISM Services was lighter than expected with the employment reading showing the most pain dropping from 50.7 to 43.3. Remember that below 50 points to contraction. And this is the worst showing for this reading in a long, long time.With services previously being the healthiest part of the economy, this is very interesting clue that things might be slowing more than expected.What we don’t want is heading into a recession which is not always so speedily solved by Fed rate cuts. Meaning creating a recession is akin to opening up Pandoras box...very hard to get the monsters to quietly go back in the box.  What we do want is modest signs of a slowing economy to keep reducing inflation back to the 2% target. And that would compel the Fed to cut rates, thus boosting the economy and leading the charge back for earnings growth and stock prices.Price Action and Trading Plan 


My prediction is that stocks will not break above the all time highs at 4,796 in a meaningful way until investors are convinced the Fed is truly going to lower rates. With that unlikely to happen at the January 31st announcement then it has investors putting their sites on the March 20th event.Again, investors are currently putting the odds of that first cut in March at a little over 60%. But with Fed officials still putting out hawkish rhetoric...and some parts of inflation, like the aforementioned sticky wage inflation issue, then indeed the first rate cut may not be til May or June.That would cap the upside for the overall market. Which is not so terrible given the above average gains we enjoyed last year.The good news is that quality stock pickers can always find companies ready to sprint ahead regardless of overall market conditions. And we are already finding that to be the case with the POWR Ratings narrowing in on the top stocks primed to outperform.


To be clear, the Buy & Strong Buy rated stocks in our model, top 25%, still amounts to over 1,300 stocks. Yes, a smaller selection than the over 10,000 US stocks you could invest in. But still too many stocks for the average person to investigate properly to narrow down to the ones that are best for your portfolio.That is why I have put in the time for my Reitmeister Total Return service to narrow down the field to the 11 best stocks to own now.

46,What's the Best 2024 Buy out of These 3 Coal Stocks?,"Jan 10, 2024",Sristi Suman Jayaswal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/whats-the-best-2024-buy-out-of-these-3-coal-stocks/468145,"
Despite the intensified focus on eco-friendly energy alternatives, the rising demand for coal – facilitated by its affordability and easy transportation and storage capabilities – fortifies its anticipated growth trajectory. Given this scenario, let’s assess the prospects of coal stocks Peabody Energy Corporation (BTU), Hallador Energy (HNRG), and China Shenhua Energy Company (CSUAY) to determine the best investment opportunity in this space. Read on….Amid escalating environmental concerns, the coal sector is set for robust growth, propelled by an amplifying coal demand.In this piece, we evaluate three coal stocks to shed light on how they can help investors capitalize on the prevailing industry tailwinds.



Stocks Hallador Energy Company (HNRG) and China Shenhua Energy Company Limited (CSUAY) appear to be solid buy candidates for 2024, given their robust fundamentals. Conversely, I think Peabody Energy Corporation (BTU) should be kept on one's watchlist for better entry opportunities.Let’s first look at what’s shaping the coal industry before delving deeper into the fundamentals of the three stocks.


Many nations have instigated broad climate action plans for coal eradication in the coming years. However, ongoing gas shortages and sluggish renewables growth reinforce that coal continues its role as an essential power generation resource and industrial use across various regions.Despite coal’s unwavering position as a reliable energy source, it remains the leading contributor to carbon dioxide emissions. Consequently, worldwide efforts to replace coal with renewable energy may trigger a gradual decrease in coal consumption over time. Yet this transition remains slow-paced.Asia experienced a record surge in seaborne thermal coal imports in December. Driven by peak winter demand, China, the top importer, led the increase, with imports reaching 83.69 million metric tons. This figure marked a significant increase from November's 78.87 million, representing the highest since records began in January 2017.Chinese and Indian population sizes, the largest globally, suggest an imminent need to fulfill rapidly increasing energy demands, likely to stimulate industry growth in the future.


Furthermore, the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts total coal consumption to be 391.3 million st in 2024, marking a 1.6% increase from December's forecast. Consequently, the global coal market is expected to grow to $2.1 trillion in 2031 at a CAGR of 4.4%.In light of these encouraging trends, let's look at the fundamentals of the three Coal stocks, beginning with number 3.Stock #3: Peabody Energy Corporation (BTU)BTU is a producer of metallurgical and thermal coal. It markets and brokers coal from other coal producers trades coal and freight-related contracts, and partners in a joint venture to develop various sites. The company operates through Seaborne Thermal Mining; Seaborne Metallurgical Mining; Powder River Basin Mining; and Other U.S. Thermal Mining segments.


The company repurchased approximately 12.6 million shares of its common stock for $266.6 million and paid dividends of $20.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. From October 1, 2023, through October 27, 2023, the company repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares for $27.3 million. Moreover, the Board approved a new share repurchase program authorizing repurchases of up to $1 billion of the company’s common stock.On November 9, the company paid a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $0.075 per share.

47,Nike navigates a new course without Tiger,"Jan 9, 2024",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/nike-navigates-a-new-course-without-tiger/468108,"
Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Tiger Woods have officially parted ways following a 27-year journey together. This news has sent ripples through the athletic apparel, footwear, and broader retail industries. This monumental partnership, one of the most iconic in sporting history, saw Nike leverage Woods' unparalleled star power to solidify its dominance in golf wear. At the same time, Woods secured lucrative endorsements and global recognition. However, with the curtain drawn on this era, both parties stand at a crossroads, leaving investors to ponder the potential implications for Nike's trajectory.Cautious uptick followed by a wait-and-see approachFollowing Nike’s news of the decoupling from Tiger Woods, Nike's stock experienced a modest uptick, increasing by a few percentage points yesterday. This initial movement reflected potential investor optimism, perhaps interpreting the move as a strategic shift or a cost-saving measure.



Today, Nike’s stock price has retreated slightly, demonstrating a wait-and-see approach from investors. This reflects an acknowledgment of the potential risks and uncertainties surrounding the long-term impact of losing Woods' endorsement, particularly in the context of a potentially declining golf market.Nike analysts remain divided on the future trajectory of Nike's stock. Some believe the initial increase might signal a positive outlook, citing Nike's diversified portfolio and ability to adapt to market changes. Others caution against unfounded optimism, emphasizing the need to monitor how Nike replaces Woods' influence and navigates the evolving landscape of golf sponsorships.


Nike's post-Tiger strategy The parting of ways with Tiger Woods marks a pivotal moment for Nike, demanding a reassessment of its golf strategy and brand positioning. While the iconic red Sunday shirt may fade from the fairway, Nike's dominance in the broader athletic apparel and footwear landscape offers a sturdy foundation for navigating this shift.One notable factor shaping Nike's future path is its recent exit from the golf equipment market. This strategic move, aimed at streamlining operations and focusing on core competencies, indicates a potential shift towards apparel-centric advertising and marketing campaigns. Without Tiger's equipment endorsement, Nike can concentrate on showcasing its innovative apparel and footwear technologies designed to enhance golfers' performance and style.However, the void left by Tiger's departure also presents an opportunity for Nike to leverage its existing strengths. As an athletic apparel and footwear leader, the brand boasts a diverse athlete portfolio. From superstars like Michael Jordan and LeBron James to rising stars in various sports, Nike can amplify their endorsements and partnerships, diversifying its brand exposure and ensuring its message resonates beyond the golf course.Furthermore, Nike's established partnerships with other golf athletes like Rory McIlroy and Brooks Koepka offer valuable continuity and expertise. These players, strategic collaborations with golf leagues and tournament sponsorships can help maintain Nike's visibility and influence within the sport.


CEO John Donahoe's recent statement that ""athletes remain at the heart of everything we do"" further underscores Nike's commitment to diversifying its athlete portfolio and leveraging their influence. He emphasized the importance of ""inspiring the next generation of athletes"" and ""driving innovation across all sports,"" suggesting a future where Nike's golf strategy integrates seamlessly with its broader brand vision.Risks and rewards for Nike investorsOn the risk front, several factors demand investor vigilance. Increased competition from brands like Adidas (OTCMKTS: ADDYY) and Under Armour (NYSE: UAA) could erode market share and profitability, particularly in the golf segment. Economic downturns can dampen spending and impact consumer discretionary purchases like athletic apparel. Additionally, evolving consumer preferences towards athleisure or other sports could further challenge Nike's core market.Despite these threats, Nike's robust brand portfolio, encompassing diverse athletes and sports beyond golf, offers a solid buffer against potential market fluctuations within any single segment. The company's unwavering focus on innovation and technology, evident in its cutting-edge materials and performance-enhancing designs, continues to drive product differentiation and consumer appeal. Furthermore, Nike's proven track record of adapting to changing market trends, exemplified by its expansion into athleisure and digital fitness platforms, suggests a flexible and responsive approach to evolving consumer demands.While Tiger Woods' exit undoubtedly leaves a significant mark, Nike's future appears far from uncertain. By capitalizing on its apparel and footwear dominance, diversifying its athlete endorsements, and adapting its marketing strategies, Nike can chart a new course on the green, carving a successful path that transcends the absence of the iconic red Sunday shirt. The coming years will unveil how effectively Nike executes this strategic pivot, demonstrating whether it can maintain its golfing legacy while solidifying its position as a global leader in athletic apparel and footwear.

49,Unlocking January Gains With 3 Key Tobacco Stocks,"Jan 9, 2024",Mangeet Kaur Bouns,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/unlocking-january-gains-with-3-key-tobacco-stocks/468071,"
The tobacco industry’s outlook appears bright due to the consistent tobacco use given its addictive nature and the launch of new, emerging products like e-cigarettes. Thus, investing in quality tobacco stocks Japan Tobacco (JAPAY), Turning Point (TPB), and Imperial (IMBBY) could be wise for potential gains this month. Read more….Despite stringent government regulations and the harmful health effects of tobacco use, the tobacco industry appears to be thriving with the introduction of tobacco-free and other innovative products such as e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches. Also, growing chain smokers and tobacco consumers contribute to the sustained adoption of tobacco products.Given the industry tailwinds, it could be wise to invest in fundamentally sound tobacco stocks Japan Tobacco Inc. (JAPAY), Turning Point Brands, Inc. (TPB), and Imperial Brands PLC (IMBBY) this month for solid returns this month.



The tobacco industry has grown considerably despite the health risks associated with tobacco consumption from cancer and heart disease to lung disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The industry has even evidenced continued challenges such as surging taxes, strict rules and regulations, etc.Tobacco companies highly benefit from the addictive nature of tobacco, compelling the consumer in the direction of consistent consumption. That leads to positive performance even through economic cycles. An estimated 28.3 million US adults are cigarette smokers, and nearly 2.80 million US middle and high school students use at least one tobacco product.


The global tobacco market is expected to exceed a valuation of $627 million in 2024, growing at a CAGR of 3.4% during the forecast period. The market is projected to reach $878 million by 2034.In recent years, the slightly safer and less harmful tobacco products have taken over the industry significantly. Large corporations are shifting toward safer alternatives such as snus, e-cigarettes, heated tobacco products (HTPs), and nicotine pouches, boosting the industry’s growth and observing an expanding customer base.Moreover, a surge in advertising and promotion of smokeless tobacco attracts consumers and increases the sales of cigars and electronic pipes. The global e-cigarette and vape market is expected to reach $182.84 billion by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 30.6%.With these encouraging trends in mind, let’s delve into the fundamentals of the three Tobacco stock picks, beginning with the third choice.Stock #3: Japan Tobacco Inc.

The company operates through three segments: Tobacco Business; Pharmaceutical; and Processed Food.On October 31, 2023, JAPAY announced the launch of Ploom X ADVANCED, its newest heated tobacco device in Japan, to be sold at convenience and tobacco stores nationally. This new device will deliver enhanced taste satisfaction as compared to the old Ploom X model. This new launch might extend the company’s market reach and drive its growth.JAPAY’s trailing-12-month gross profit and EBITDA margins of 58.53% and 30.89% are significantly higher than the respective industry averages of 33.72% and 11.26%.

50,Johnson &amp; Johnson: Biotech a shot in the arm for future growth?,"Jan 9, 2024",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/johnson-amp-johnson-biotech-a-shot-in-the-arm-for-future/468057,"
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), a healthcare sector powerhouse with over 130 years of experience, has long dominated diverse sub-sectors within the industry. From groundbreaking pharmaceuticals like Remicade to innovative medical devices, JNJ has established itself as a leader in multiple healthcare domains. However, the landscape is evolving, and JNJ is making a strategic shift to stay ahead of the curve.J&J navigates a multi-pronged landscapeRecent headlines have been dominated by two key developments: the $2 billion acquisition of Ambrx Biopharma (NYSE: AMAM) and the series of patent settlements surrounding Stelara, JNJ's top-selling treatment for psoriasis and arthritis. While seemingly disparate, these moves represent a calculated pivot in JNJ's strategic focus. They signal a deliberate push towards the burgeoning field of biotechnology, specifically a subfield known as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs).



Expanding into antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)In a $2 billion deal, JNJ’s headlines report that the company has acquired Ambrx Biopharma. Ambrex is a company specializing in developing next-generation antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). ADCs are essentially targeted drug delivery vehicles in the fight against cancer. They combine potent anti-cancer agents with monoclonal antibodies, proteins that selectively bind to tumor cells. This targeted approach minimizes harm to healthy tissue, offering a potentially safer and more effective option than traditional chemotherapy. The ADC market is poised for explosive growth, projected to reach an estimated $35 billion by 2028. JNJ's acquisition of Ambrx positions the company as a major player in this promising field, gaining access to Ambrx's proprietary platform and promising ADC candidates in the pipeline.


Breathing room for JNJ's revenueStelara, JNJ's blockbuster drug for psoriasis and arthritis, was facing the imminent threat of biosimilar competition, cheaper versions of the original drug manufactured by other companies. However, JNJ has secured a series of patent settlements that delay the entry of these biosimilars until at least 2025. This provides JNJ with valuable breathing room, allowing them to maximize Stelara's revenue stream for the next few years and prepare for the inevitable decline in sales when biosimilars finally enter the market.Can Stelara biosimilars threaten JNJ's future?Despite the patent settlements, a lawsuit filed by CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield casts a shadow of uncertainty over Stelara's future revenue. The lawsuit alleges that JNJ engaged in anti-competitive practices to delay the entry of biosimilars, artificially inflating drug prices. If successful, the lawsuit could significantly impact JNJ's finances and accelerate the decline in Stelara sales.Gauging the expert perspectiveGiven J&J's recent moves and the changing market environment, investors naturally look to Johnson & Johnson industry analysts for their insights.  The analyst community paints a relatively optimistic picture for J&J. Based on a survey of recent ratings, the consensus estimate places the average 12-month target price for JNJ shares at $168.94, representing a potential upside of 5% from current levels. Some analysts predict prices as high as $215.00, representing close to a 25% upside for the stock. This positive outlook reflects analysts' confidence in JNJ's long-term prospects, fueled by factors like the Ambrx acquisition and the successful Stelara patent settlements.J&J's strategic playbook for future growthJohnson & Johnson's recent moves indicate a clear roadmap for future growth, focusing on two key pillars: diversifying its portfolio beyond Stelara and capitalizing on high-growth markets. These strategies paint a picture of JNJ actively expanding its reach and positioning itself for sustainable success in the evolving healthcare landscape.


Beyond Stelara: Pipeline for the futureWhile Stelara remains a critical revenue driver, JNJ recognizes the need to move beyond its dependence on a single blockbuster drug. To achieve this, the company is actively investing in a diverse pipeline of innovative medicines and treatments across various therapeutic areas. Some noteworthy examples include:
Spravato: This nasal spray medication, approved for treatment-resistant depression, represents a potentially significant growth opportunity in a large and underserved market.
Darzalex: This antibody-drug conjugate, already successful in multiple blood cancers, is being investigated for additional indications, expanding its market reach.
Epclusa: This combination therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) boasts a high cure rate and shorter treatment duration, positioning it well in the competitive HCV market.
By actively developing and introducing novel treatments in both established and emerging markets, JNJ aims to reduce its reliance on Stelara and build a more diversified and sustainable revenue stream for the future.Global expansion and high-growth segmentsJNJ also recognizes the importance of geographical expansion for future growth. Emerging markets like China, India, and Brazil present significant untapped potential, with rapidly growing healthcare spending and aging populations. JNJ is strategically increasing its presence in these regions through targeted investments, acquisitions, and collaborations with local partners.Furthermore, JNJ is aligning its focus with high-growth segments within the healthcare market. Areas like oncology, immunology, and specialty pharmaceuticals are projected to experience significant growth in the coming years, and JNJ is actively developing drugs and expanding its portfolio in these segments. 


Examples include the Ambrx acquisition for its innovative ADC platform and ongoing research in areas like CAR-T cell therapy for cancer. By actively venturing into high-growth markets and therapeutic areas, JNJ aims to tap into new revenue streams and stay ahead of the evolving healthcare landscape.

 Boeing (NYSE: BA), a giant in the aerospace industry, is currently facing a pivotal challenge.  The turbulence surrounding Boeing's 737 Max program took a sharp turn for the worse on Friday, as a mid-air incident involving a door plug failure forced the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to issue an emergency grounding order for all 737 Max 9 aircraft operated by U.S. carriers. This latest episode casts a long shadow on Boeing's recent struggles, including fluctuating profitability and persistent supply chain disruptions, and raises critical questions about the future of the jetliner.



Emergency descent: Unveiling the market impactFriday's incident aboard an Alaska Airlines (NYSE: ALK) 737 Max 9 wasn't just a terrifying experience for passengers and crew; it sent tremors through the aviation industry and beyond. The dramatic mid-air loss of a door plug, forcing an emergency landing, instantly reignited safety concerns surrounding the jetliner and prompted the FAA to take swift action.The technical details paint a concerning picture. A 60-pound panel covering an optional exit door ripped off at roughly 16,000 feet, causing depressurization and forcing the pilots to execute an emergency descent maneuver and turn back. Thankfully, no injuries were reported, but the potential safety hazard sent shockwaves through the market.


Wall Street responded with a swift sell-off, dragging Boeing's stock price down by 9% in pre-market trading. Analyst commentary about Boeing quickly followed, with downgrades and cautious outlooks becoming the new norm. The sentiment shift was palpable, reflecting a deep-seated concern about the reliability of the 737 Max and the potential for further reputational damage for Boeing.However, comparing this reaction to past Boeing crises, particularly the fatal crashes of 2018 and 2019, reveals similarities and key differences. While the immediate market plunge echoes the initial shock of those tragedies, the lack of casualties this time offers a glimmer of hope for a less protracted downturn. Additionally, the grounding order, while disruptive, signifies a proactive approach by the FAA, potentially mitigating the long-term damage compared to the drawn-out investigation process that followed the crashes.Analyst perspectives on Boeing's turbulenceAs Boeing grapples with the fallout of the 737 Max grounding, investors are hanging on every word from industry analysts to decipher the potential long-term implications. Wall Street's analysts have offered a mixed bag of perspectives, reflecting the situation's inherent uncertainty.On the bearish side, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) delivered a blow by downgrading Boeing's rating, citing concerns about the incident's impact on customer confidence and potential production delays. Their analysts cautioned that the grounding could erode airline trust in the 737 Max, leading to order cancellations and further financial hardships for Boeing.


However, not all analysts are singing the same somber tune. While acknowledging the near-term challenges, Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS) expressed a more optimistic outlook for the long term. They pointed to Boeing's history of overcoming past crises and its strong balance sheet as factors that could aid in weathering this storm. They emphasized the importance of Boeing's swift and transparent response to the incident as a key determinant of its ultimate recovery.Other analysts, like Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), adopted a measured approach, highlighting the need for further investigation before issuing definitive pronouncements. They emphasized the importance of understanding the root cause of the door plug failure and Boeing's proposed corrective measures before accurately assessing the potential financial and reputational damage.Charting a course through crisisWith the 737 Max grounded again, Boeing is at a critical juncture. The company's immediate and long-term response to this crisis will significantly determine its path. Let’s take a minute to review potential strategies Boeing could employ to weather the storm and regain the trust of investors, airlines, and passengers:Prioritizing quality controlThe door plug failure demands a rigorous reevaluation of Boeing's quality control measures. Implementing comprehensive inspections across the 737 Max production line, tightened supplier oversight, and a thorough review of production processes are crucial to ensuring future aircraft meet the highest safety standards.


Collaboration with the FAAOpen and transparent communication with the FAA is paramount. Proactively sharing investigation findings, proposing effective fixes, and actively collaborating on the inspection process demonstrate Boeing's commitment to safety and regulatory compliance. This collaborative approach can expedite the grounding's resolution and rebuild trust with the governing body.Embracing transparencyClear and consistent communication with all stakeholders is critical during this period of uncertainty. Timely updates on the investigation's progress, detailed explanations of corrective actions, and proactive communication of Boeing's unwavering commitment to safety can help mitigate negative publicity and reassure airlines, passengers, and investors.Repairing reputational damageThe recent incident and past challenges have taken a toll on Boeing's reputation. Launching targeted PR campaigns to rebuild trust with airlines and passengers becomes crucial. Highlighting past safety improvements, showcasing the company's investments in quality control, and demonstrating a genuine commitment to transparency can contribute to restoring public confidence.In crisis management, the speed and decisiveness of the response are often as crucial as the actions themselves. Industry stakeholders and the public will closely watch Boeing's immediate steps after the grounding. A swift, comprehensive, and transparent approach to addressing the issues and effective communication strategies can significantly mitigate the long-term impact on the company's reputation and financial health.

53,3 Private Equity Stocks to Watch,"Jan 8, 2024",Sristi Suman Jayaswal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/3-private-equity-stocks-to-watch/468009,"
The private equity industry is well-positioned for substantial growth in the future, largely attributable to a growing High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWI) base, an uptick in global deals, and the sector's enhanced ability to navigate market turbulence. Given this backdrop, private equity stocks Golub Capital BDC (GBDC), WhiteHorse Finance (WHF), and Goldman Sachs BDC (GSBD) could be watched now. Read on….As we usher in a new year, the private equity industry scenario might continue to be molded by trends reminiscent of those that characterized 2023 – modest fundraising, rising interest rates, and a complex macroeconomic backdrop tainted by geopolitical turmoil. However, a glimmer of optimism illuminates the industry's horizon, courtesy of an expanding pool of high-net-worth individuals (HNWI), a surge in transactional actions, and escalating fundraising initiatives emanating from secondary funds.Considering this scenario, it would be astute for investors to watch private equity stocks Golub Capital BDC, Inc. (GBDC), WhiteHorse Finance, Inc. (WHF), and Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. (GSBD) for better entry opportunities.



In 2023, the private equity (PE) landscape navigated through unique circumstances driven by a spike in interest rates, a banking catastrophe, and widespread geopolitical uncertainty. Not surprisingly, these tumultuous conditions led to a slump in PE activity throughout the year. Concurrently, an abundance of uncertainty, an antagonist to successful dealmaking, pervaded the global markets. However, through astute risk mitigation, managers ensured that PE-backed deals proceeded unhindered.The U.S. currently spearheads the global PE industry with assets trumping $6 trillion. The consistency of the industry was underlined as PE firms pronounced deals worth $101 billion in the third quarter of 2023. Moreover, the rising number of deals reinforced this stability, where sponsors signed 93 deals of $100 million in the third quarter, marking a 63% surge from the first quarter of 2023.


Due to their record dry powder valued at $2.59 trillion and diversified portfolios incorporating fresh asset classes, PE firms are more than well-equipped to withstand market volatility. This diversification has fortified the resilience and agility of PE firms in managing unfavorable alterations in marketplace dynamics.Furthermore, 2024 appears poised for a substantial uptick in secondary transactions. Secondaries funds exhibited an accelerated fundraising rhythm last year, with a total of $68.1 billion raised as of September 2023. The level of secondaries dry powder reached $202.7 billion.In recent times, the strategy of PE firms targeting High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI) to amplify fundraising has garnered considerable attention. It will be compelling to observe if this approach makes significant strides in 2024. Considering traditional exit routes have become impassable, PE firms have found an alternative in net asset value financing to generate capital, thereby enabling distributions to Limited Partners.Consequently, the global PE market is projected to reach $1.10 trillion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 9.7%.With these trends in mind, let's delve into the fundamentals of the three Private Equity stock picks, beginning with the third choice.Stock #3: Golub Capital BDC, Inc.

55,Walgreens Swaps Dividends for Growth,"Jan 5, 2024",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/walgreens-swaps-dividends-for-growth/467928,"
Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA), more commonly known as WBA, stands as a global titan in the healthcare sector. Spanning neighborhoods and continents, its vast network dispenses essential prescription drugs, offers health and beauty havens, and even stocks your everyday consumer staples. However, WBA recently made waves within the sector. They did not do this with a new pill or a potion but with a bold financial maneuver. The company announced a substantial cut to its dividend, igniting a firestorm of concern and curiosity amongst investors and stakeholders. This unexpected move has left many wondering – was it a bitter pill to swallow or a strategic tonic for the future? 



A Retail Juggernaut Beyond the CounterFounded in 1848, WBA stretches from Deerfield, Illinois, to bustling pharmacies worldwide. Under CEO Tim Wentworth, WBA is transforming. The company is adding in-store clinics and healthcare partnerships to its shelves of pills and potions. With recent bold moves like the dividend cut, WBA is rewriting its story to become a healthcare destination, not just a drugstore.Why WBA Swallowed a Bitter Pill Walgreens Boots Alliance was splashed across headlines recently, not for a groundbreaking drug or health service but for a bold financial maneuver. They announced a near 50% reduction in WBA’s quarterly dividend. This move, a sharp break from the company's long-standing forty-seven-year tradition of dividend increases, sent shockwaves through the investment world.


Why the sudden financial sleight of hand? For years, WBA enjoyed the coveted title of ""Dividend Aristocrat,"" a badge of honor awarded to companies with unwavering commitment to dividend growth. However, recent financial headwinds, including lower consumer spending and intense competition, began to cast a shadow.The pandemic's initial boost to vaccine sales faded, and inflation squeezed both customers and the company's bottom line.Enter the bitter pill: the dividend cut The new quarterly payout of twenty-five cents per share, slashed from the previous forty-eight cents, sparked mixed reactions. Income-focused investors choked on the disappointment, missing out on the reliable income stream WBA once offered. Yet, others saw a strategic remedy in the decision. Some of Walgreen’s analysts applauded the move as a wise way to free up valuable cash flow, estimated at roughly $800 million annually. This financial fuel could be channeled into crucial areas like cost-cutting, expansion of healthcare services, and potential acquisitions.The jury's still out on whether the dividend cut will be a masterstroke or a miscalculation. While some investors remain wary, others are cautiously optimistic, intrigued by the potential for long-term growth and innovation fueled by the newly freed-up cash.


Only time will tell if WBA's gamble pays off, but one thing's for sure: the company's decision has shaken up the investment landscape, leaving everyone watching to see how the story unfolds.Financial Tonic or Industry Tremor?Walgreens Boots Alliance may have swallowed a significant financial pill with its nearly 50% dividend cut, but the ripples of this decision extend well beyond disappointed income investors. Financially, the cut serves as a solution to WBA’s cash crunch. By freeing up an estimated $800 million annually, WBA injects its balance sheet with fresh cash flow.This cash transfusion fuels critical areas such as cost-cutting, healthcare service expansion, and potential acquisitions. While the stock price initially wavered, the long-term outlook hinges on WBA’s execution. Investors, like hesitant patients, await to see if the treatment delivers, potentially driving the stock upward if growth materializes.However, the decision comes at a cost. WBA surrenders its coveted ""Dividend Aristocrat"" status, a symbolic blow to its reputation for reliability. Walgreens also notably altered its position within the renowned dogs of the dow strategy, moving from the top spot to somewhere near the bottom.


These changes left some analysts wondering if it was time to take Walgreens out for a walk. Nevertheless, it also paints a picture of a company prioritizing long-term health over short-term appeasement, potentially attracting growth-oriented investors.The ripples reach beyond WBA's walls, sparking conversations across the pharmacy and healthcare industry. Could this be a precursor of a broader trend, with other companies prioritizing cash flow and strategic investments over dividend increases? The answer remains clouded, but WBA's move raises an eyebrow or two from investors and analysts alike.For the retail pharmacy sector itself, the cut casts a mixed light. While some see it as a symptom of industry-wide struggles, others interpret it as a strategic pivot towards lucrative healthcare services. WBA's gamble on expanding its clinics and partnerships highlights the growing importance of diversification in a changing market.The most immediate concern is WBA’s customers and individual investors. Income-focused individuals might feel the financial pinch of a reduced dividend yield. However, those seeking convenient access to healthcare services could benefit from WBA's renewed focus on this area.


Ultimately, the impact on customers hinges on how effectively WBA translates its financial maneuver into tangible improvements in its offerings and accessibility.So, was WBA's dividend cut a bitter pill with no sweeter future? Only time will tell. But one thing's for sure: the ripples it sets in motion will impact the company and the broader landscape of the healthcare and retail sector, leaving many watching to see where these strategic changes take Walgreens Boots Alliance.

56,General Motors' surge in sales and strategic vision,"Jan 4, 2024",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/general-motors-surge-in-sales-and-strategic-vision/467917,"
General Motors (NYSE: GM) has been a leading force in automotive innovation for over a century. Its iconic brands like Chevrolet, Cadillac, and Buick have filled the roads, and its products have been at the forefront of new technologies. GM is not content to sit back and watch as the world moves toward a future powered by electricity and guided by self-driving technology. The American giant is aggressively accelerating to take the lead, embracing the electric revolution and pushing the boundaries of autonomous driving. GM cruises to sales success General Motors roared into 2024 with its best U.S. sales performance in five years, defying challenges and exceeding expectations. The Detroit automaker notched a 14.1% increase in annual vehicle sales compared to 2022, exceeding industry-wide forecasts and marking a return to pre-pandemic levels. This surge was fueled by the combined strength of its diverse brands, each contributing to the overall triumph.



Buick led the charge, which saw a remarkable 61% surge in annual sales. This impressive growth signifies a successful brand revitalization strategy, with Buick attracting new customers with its stylish and technologically advanced offerings. Following closely behind was Chevrolet, the company's mainstream powerhouse, achieving a 13.1% sales increase. This sustained momentum underscores Chevy's ability to cater to a broad range of consumers with reliable and value-driven vehicles.GM's strong 2023 performance in the automotive sector extends beyond individual brands. It aligns perfectly with industry-wide expectations for a robust year, further solidifying the company's position as a significant player in the automotive landscape. This impressive accomplishment speaks volumes about GM's adaptability and resilience in the face of market uncertainties, including chip shortages and economic anxieties.


Analyst upgrade despite market skidsGeneral Motors faces a complex market scenario. While broader indices are experiencing a downturn, the company received a significant boost from an analyst upgrade. Wolfe Research issued an ""Outperform"" rating highlighting the favorable risk-reward potential in General Motor’s stock. This positive signal served as a counterweight to the broader market pressure.Despite the analyst's endorsement, GM's stock price has been volatile, reflecting the prevailing market unease. While facing near-term market headwinds, the company secured valuable analyst support, indicating longer-term upside potential. Whether this translates into sustained growth remains to be seen, but the developments suggest a dynamic and evolving situation for General Motors in the marketplace.Analyzing the ripple effectsIn the short term, the news served as a shot of adrenaline for investor sentiment. This was evident in the pre-market rebound, indicating renewed interest and potential for increased financial backing. However, it's crucial to remember the broader market context. The prevailing economic headwinds may temper this immediate upside, creating a scenario where GM navigates an environment of both promise and uncertainty.Beyond the immediate market fluctuations, the analyst upgrade and positive news carries more profound long-term implications. The positive sentiment regarding GM's focus on electric vehicles and autonomous driving technologies could bolster the company's position as a frontrunner in this burgeoning market. Such developments would solidify GM's market share and enhance its competitive edge in the race to define the future of mobility.


A cautious optimismWhile the analyst upgrade undoubtedly paints a brighter picture of GM's future, it's essential to approach the road ahead with cautious optimism. Challenges remain, from the intensifying competition in the EV space to the need for robust charging infrastructure and the continuous refinement of autonomous driving technology. Overcoming these hurdles will require strategic agility, a commitment to sustainability, and attracting and retaining the best minds in the field.Regulatory crossroadsNavigating the maze of government regulations is a challenging feat. Stringent emission standards and complex self-driving technology certification processes could significantly delay GM's progress. However, this also presents an opportunity. By investing in lobbying efforts and collaborating with policymakers, GM can play a key role in shaping future regulations that favor innovation and accelerate the adoption of clean transportation technologies.Supply chain snarlsChip shortages and logistical snarls still haunt the automotive industry. Securing access to critical materials and building a resilient supply chain will be vital for GM to avoid production bottlenecks and delays. Strategic partnerships with battery manufacturers, mining companies, and logistics providers can prove invaluable. Collaborating with other leading carmakers on joint sourcing initiatives could unlock economies of scale and mitigate supply chain risks.Winning hearts and mindsThe success of GM's electric revolution hinges on consumer adoption. Addressing range anxiety, ensuring affordability, and building trust in autonomous driving technology are critical hurdles. Here, GM can leverage its vast customer base and brand recognition to implement innovative marketing campaigns, expand charging infrastructure partnerships, and offer flexible financing options. Investing in robust education and safety initiatives surrounding autonomous driving will also foster public trust and encourage widespread adoption.


While these challenges are significant, they also present potential opportunities. Carbon credits for reducing emissions, collaborating with energy companies to build charging networks, and even exploring new revenue streams like providing autonomous driving technology to other industries are just a few possibilities. By embracing a comprehensive approach that addresses both immediate hurdles and future opportunities, GM can transform these roadblocks into stepping stones on its path to becoming a leader in the new era of mobility.

57,"Why the Private Sector, Not Public, Must Continue to Lead Impact Investing","Jan 4, 2024",Sandra M. Moore,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-the-private-sector-should-take-the-lead-in-impact/466905,"
Earlier this year, John Deere and Al Roker Entertainment released a powerful documentary, Gaining Ground: The Fight for Black Land, that examined why Black ownership of farmland across the United States has dwindled to alarmingly low numbers over the past century. In just a few decades after the end of enslavement, Black Americans were able to amass millions of acres of farmland. But today, approximately 90% of that land is no longer in Black hands.While various factors have proven to work against Black land ownership, Gaining Ground spotlighted a little-known issue, the exploitation of Heirs' Property, as having had the most devastating effect on African-American farmland ownership. This land ownership plight afflicting Black farmers exposed the need for impact investments to target wealth gaps that are still embedded along racial lines across American society.According to Federal Reserve measurements, in the third quarter of 2022, the nation's white households had $124.5 trillion in assets. In comparison, all Black households had just under $8 trillion in total assets, while Hispanic households had $5.5 trillion, and all other racial groups combined had roughly $15.7 trillion. Wealth disparity in the United States couldn't be more apparent, and public funding will never reverse this.Related: Compounding Inequality to Compounding Success: Bridging the Racial Wealth Gap



Financial institutions driving impactAfter many years in nonprofits, I came to my current role in the impact investing space, working primarily with housing developers to rebuild crumbling urban core communities. We used mixed-finance, multi-family housing as a revitalization platform. Having invested so much of my time toward the empowerment of people and the communities where they live, I have long realized the pivotal gap for catalyzing undercapitalized regions has always been about attracting private investment dollars.Philanthropy and government subsidies, while important forms of investment, are not the way to tackle wealth disparity in America. You can't grant enough money to drive vitality in an economically distressed area. Plus, such programs have unrealistic structures. For most grant and government subsidy programs, the cycles for achieving success are far too brief. Grants usually expect to reap progress within a year. Government programs are not much better, typically allowing just a couple of years to drive impact. That's just not enough time to undo generations of neglect.Related: Primed For Growth: The Impact Investment MindsetIn reality, private financial institutions and organizations have both money to invest and the motivation to generate a return on double-bottom-line investments, making them the ones who drive the real results in impact investing. Look at Truist Bank, which has many impact investments across its portfolio, including sizable support for affordable housing, job growth and career development in cities such as Charlotte and Atlanta.


They invest in funds focusing on job creators and should be recognized for deploying their own money into minority-led businesses and projects that uplift communities. It's a very concerted effort and targets systemic issues correctly, making them a critical impact investing partner for my firm and many others.Another financial institution that stands out is U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance. The institution has been addressing wealth disparities among Black Americans for quite some time, advancing diverse leaders, increasing business with diverse suppliers, growing ownership and assets for people and small businesses, and investing in Black communities. U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance does a lot of small business and New Markets Tax Credit investing, which allows firms to invest in undercapitalized businesses.Also incredibly impactful in funding minority-owned businesses are Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs). These banks, credit unions and SBICs, which are minority-owned and led, have recently become well-funded due to current administration initiatives and are now the best source for many small businesses seeking capital.Following the Dodd-Frank decision, MDIs were cash-strapped, but now they are flush with money and investing prolifically. Their approach should be celebrated for helping to get public monies into the hands of the communities that can then use them to drive their own vision of success. Carver FSB, Industrial Bank and Southern Bancorp are among the many minority-led banking institutions with Black and brown eyes on the community while furnishing SBA-guaranteed small business loans. Efforts like these support not just short-term results, but the critical generational wealth.Related: Why Addressing the Racial Wealth Gap is Good for Business Others champions of impact investingAlso having an outsized effect in the impact investing world are foundations and funds that are committed to eliminating wealth disparities over the long term.The Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation has long been committed to championing ideas and supporting solutions designed to improve education, boost entrepreneurship and help communities and individuals thrive. Much of the Kauffman Foundation's success in building inclusive prosperity through a prepared workforce and entrepreneur-focused economic development is attributed to patient investments. Their work to address the ""friends and family"" gap in funding for Black entrepreneurs, in collaboration with Living Cities, is dedicated to helping entrepreneurs of color access more capital and grow their businesses.The same should be said for the Case Foundation, founded in 1997 by Jean and Steve Case, which aims to drive entrepreneurship and innovation while addressing chronic social challenges. Their investments into companies, organizations and funds to generate social and environmental impact, alongside a financial return, have served as a long-standing model for impact investors. The Rise of the Rest Seed Fund from Revolution, a Case-founded investment firm that backs entrepreneurs at every stage of development, invests in passionate entrepreneurs who are based outside of traditional business hubs, with the effect of reaching more underrepresented entrepreneurs.As we have seen, tackling wealth gap disparities, such as the loss of land owned by Black farmers, requires the private sector to lead the way in affecting lasting positive change. This work is far from complete. Given the financial strain and uphill climb so many people are facing, the private sector must commit to further investments that foster greater economic inclusion by growing minority-led businesses and funding those who, far too often, are shut out of receiving investment capital.

58,2024 Buy or Hold Chemical Stocks?,"Jan 4, 2024",Sristi Suman Jayaswal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/2024-buy-or-hold-chemical-stocks/467885,"
The chemical industry stands on the cusp of substantial growth, driven by robust demand across vital sectors. Therefore, let’s assess the prospects of chemical stocks Dow Inc. (DOW), Linde plc (LIN), and NewMarket Corporation (NEU) to determine the best investment opportunity in this space. Read on….The chemical sector displays substantial resilience, propelled by robust demand for chemicals utilized in a variety of industries for transforming raw and precursor materials into valuable products that respond to society's needs. Given the industry’s promising prospects, in this piece, we assessed three chemical stocks to determine how they can help investors tap into the industry's tailwinds.Linde plc (LIN) and NewMarket Corporation (NEU) appear to be solid buy candidates for 2024, given their strong fundamentals. On the other hand, I think Dow Inc. (DOW) should be kept on one's watchlist for better entry opportunities.



Before delving deeper into the fundamentals of the three stocks, let’s take a quick look at the industry landscape.Chemicals are as fundamental to the economy as the more overt technologies. Used in everything from processed foods as artificial sweeteners and preservatives to the manufacture of everyday items, which utilize advanced polymers or affordable synthetics to accommodate cost considerations, the chemical industry extends its influence to countless elements within our homes or workplaces.


The chemical industry, deeply embedded in the U.S. economy, accounts for over 85% of basic and specialty chemicals consumed by the industrial sector. Its influence permeates both micro and macroeconomic levels, underscoring its significant impact. The industry has demonstrated impressive financial performance, hitting those that have remained unmatched for over two decades. It contributes over a quarter to the nation's GDP, propelled by heightened demand.Moreover, new government policies and incentives promoting investment in energy transition have spurred additional manufacturing activity dependent on chemicals and materials. Over 75% of technologies reducing emissions are rooted in the chemical industry.Advancements in digital technology are also reshaping the landscape for chemical manufacturers. Producers are expected to use various digital tools to create innovative materials and streamline efficient formulations – evaluating, optimizing, and incorporating ingredient recipes and proprietary knowledge.Consequently, the global chemical market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 8.8% until 2032.

59,3 Foreign Bank Stocks Primed for Untapped Growth in 2024,"Jan 4, 2024",Sristi Suman Jayaswal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/3-foreign-bank-stocks-primed-for-untapped-growth-in-2024/467882,"
The banking industry displayed admirable resilience and stability in 2023. Amid the banks' efforts to streamline their structures, honing in on core operations – there are projections of higher costs in the short term, inflicting some degree of impact on immediate bottom-line growth. Given this backdrop, quality foreign bank stocks Akbank T.A.S. (AKBTY), KB Financial Group (KB), and Erste Group Bank AG (EBKDY), primed for untapped growth in 2024, could be solid buys now. Read on….2023 presented a challenging landscape for banking institutions as they grappled with operational and macroeconomic hurdles. However, banks skillfully navigated these obstacles. Aided by rising interest rates, banks managed to boost their top-line growth.Furthermore, the anticipated continuation of this high-interest environment poses a profitable future, with the prospect of increasing net interest income and margins. Given this backdrop, foreign banks Akbank T.A.S. (AKBTY), KB Financial Group Inc. (KB), and Erste Group Bank AG (EBKDY) could be solid buys for 2024.



Foreign banks offer various services and products to American customers, catering to both individual and corporate clients who run operations in the U.S. Central banks worldwide have implemented measures to buffer their economies from the 2020 pandemic-induced financial downturn, including reducing benchmark interest rates to historic lows. Although beneficial for immediate economic recovery, these measures have significantly eaten into bank profitability.The journey to economic recovery presents its challenges, with progress inconsistent in developed nations housing major foreign banks and emerging nations. This inconsistency has caused global disruption in banking operations.


As many foreign banks may possess federal and state-chartered offices within the U.S., the Federal Reserve holds significant influence over their domestic operations. The decision by the Fed to increase the benchmark interest rate signifies an encouraging shift for the banking sector; higher interest rates prompt a rise in banks' net interest income.Although these higher rates typically favor banks, they can also limit loan growth by inflating borrowing and deposit costs. That said, anticipated reductions could stimulate demand for goods and services, thereby catalyzing an increase in bank lending.Moreover, several foreign banks are pursuing extensive business restructuring efforts, divesting or closing non-critical operations to concentrate more on their core businesses and regions. Although these restructuring measures are expected to spur long-term growth, they have led to a short-term rise in expenses. Technology-related costs are predicted to continue posing some degree of hindrance to banks’ bottom-line growth in the near term.In light of these trends, let's look at the fundamentals of the three fundamentally strong Foreign Banks stocks, beginning with number 3.Stock #3: Akbank T.A.S.

60,Moderna soars on analyst upgrade,"Jan 3, 2024",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/moderna-soars-on-analyst-upgrade/467859,"
Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) saw its stock surge 13% after Oppenheimer & Co. (NYSE: OPY) analyst Hartaj Singh upgraded the stock to ""outperform"" and predicted five product approvals by 2026. This comes despite a dismal 2023 for the company, marked by declining COVID-19 vaccine sales and investor concerns about pipeline progress.Moderna Inc. is a pioneering biotechnology company founded in 2010 with its headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They specialize in developing mRNA-based therapeutics and vaccines, including their flagship Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine, the first mRNA COVID vaccine. CEO Stéphane Bancel leads the company, which boasts a market capitalization of $42.51 billion and employs over 3500 people worldwide.



Decoding Moderna's post-pandemic playbookModerna's core business revolves around its mRNA platform technology. This biotechnology breakthrough instructs cells to produce specific proteins for therapeutic or preventative purposes. This technology has been applied to develop personalized cancer vaccines and vaccines for infectious diseases like COVID-19 and RSV. Despite COVID-19 vaccine sales being their current revenue driver, the company's future hinges on its diverse pipeline of new products.More than just a shot in the armModerna's recent stock surge isn't just a blip on the financial radar. It's a resounding vote of confidence in the company's future, fueled by a burgeoning pipeline with promising candidates. Oppenheimer & Co.'s bullish outlook is rooted in three game-changing possibilities:


The RSV saviorRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common respiratory infection that can be deadly for infants and older adults. While most children encounter it before age 2, some experience severe complications, leaving a significant unmet medical need. With a potential approval date as early as April 2024, this vaccine could be a lifesaver, protecting those most vulnerable from a potentially devastating illness.The flu fighterSeasonal flu strikes fear into the hearts of millions every year, disrupting lives and clogging healthcare systems. Current vaccines offer decent protection, but their effectiveness wanes over time, requiring annual booster shots. Moderna's flu vaccine candidate takes a different approach, aiming for broader and more durable protection. The hope is that a single shot could shield you from multiple flu strains for extended periods, significantly reducing the burden of this annual battle. That's the potential Moderna's flu vaccine holds.The cancer warriorsCancer, in its many forms, remains a formidable foe. But personalized cancer vaccines, tailored to each patient's unique tumor profile, could be a game-changer. Moderna is pushing the boundaries here, developing vaccines targeting melanoma and other cancers. Think of it as training your immune system to recognize and attack your specific cancer cells, turning your body into a powerful defense system. This is truly personalized medicine at its finest, and the potential to save lives is immense.Why 2024 could be Moderna's yearThe Oppenheimer upgrade came following a challenging year for Moderna in 2023. COVID-19 vaccine sales peaked, and concerns about the company’s pipeline progress weighed on the stock. However, analysts expect a turnaround in 2024 and beyond as new products launch and COVID-19 booster education efforts increase vaccine distribution.


Moderna's stock surge reflects renewed analyst and investor confidence in the company's long-term potential. The potential approval of RSV and flu vaccines in the near future could inject significant revenue streams, while progress on cancer vaccines offers long-term growth prospects. Additionally, declining operating expenses and a potential rebound in COVID-19 booster sales in 2025 could further bolster the company's financial health.A rising tide lifts all boatsThe far-reaching impact of Moderna's recent surge goes beyond the numbers on a ticker. This positive news isn't just a boon for the company itself, it is a splash of hope for the broader biotechnology industry and countless patients worldwide. Here's how:ModernaThe analyst upgrade and stock surge act as a powerful validation of the company's pipeline strategy. Investors are voting with their wallets, expressing confidence in the game-changing potential of the RSV, flu and cancer vaccines in development. This newfound trust can unlock doors to further investment, fueling even more research and accelerating the path to bringing these innovations to market.Biotech industryModerna's success with mRNA technology isn't just a win for one company, it is a beacon of light for the entire medical sector. Their pioneering work paves the way for broader adoption and exploration of this revolutionary technology by other research teams and companies. This could lead to a new wave of innovation, tackling previously untouchable diseases and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in healthcare.


CustomersUltimately, the true beneficiaries of Moderna's pipeline lie in the potential health benefits for millions worldwide. Imagine infants and older adults protected from the dangers of RSV, thanks to a readily available vaccine. Picture a future where seasonal flu becomes a memory, thanks to a more durable and effective vaccine. And envision the hope offered by personalized cancer vaccines, empowering patients' immune systems to fight their unique tumor profiles. These are just glimpses of the potential impact on individual lives and public health.While challenges remain, including potential delays in product approvals and competition within the vaccine market, Moderna's recent upgrade and pipeline progress signal a possible shift in its fortunes. If the company successfully executes its strategy, it could regain its place as the leader in the biotech industry and deliver life-changing therapies to patients worldwide.

61,Rivian in rough terrain: Can it drive demand in 2024,"Jan 3, 2024",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/rivian-in-rough-terrain-can-it-drive-demand-in-2024/467857,"
Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) is an electric vehicle (EV) maker backed by Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and it has started 2024 on a rough note. Despite exceeding its production targets in 2023, the company's delivery numbers fell below expectations, raising concerns about demand and competition in the growing electric vehicle sector.Production beats targets, deliveries disappointDespite exceeding its production target by over 6% in 2023, Rivian Automotive encountered challenges in the final quarter. The company fell short of delivery expectations. While 57,232 units rolled off the assembly line, 13,972 vehicles reached customers in Q4. This represents a 10% decline from Q3, and these figures missed analyst estimates by nearly 3%. This disparity raises questions about Rivian's ability to translate production into demand, particularly in a market facing multiple hurdles. 



Macroeconomic headwindsRising interest rates make car loans more expensive, potentially dampening consumer enthusiasm for high-value purchases like EVs. This macroeconomic trend presents a challenge to all automakers but resonates particularly with Rivian's premium price point.Intensifying competitionThe EV industry is rapidly changing, with established companies like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and General Motors (NYSE: GM) ramping up their electric vehicle offerings and new entrants like Lucid (NASDAQ: LCID) and Fisker (NYSE: FSR) entering the market. BYD Motor (OTCMKTS: BYDDF) recently surpassed Tesla to become the world's leading electric vehicle manufacturer, adding to the pressure on an already volatile market. This shift in the industry landscape makes it even more critical for automakers to distinguish themselves and provide compelling value propositions to attract buyers.


Internal roadblocksRivian's recall of nearly 7,800 vehicles in January 2024 due to a software issue with the accelerator pedal likely impacted deliveries, potentially delaying final customer handovers and casting an even bigger shadow on brand confidence.Investors react with cautious optimismRivian's stock price dropped 10% on the first trading day of 2024 following the release of the delivery numbers. However, some analysts remain optimistic about the company's long-term prospects. Baird analysts recently designated Rivian stock a ""best idea"" for 2024, citing the company's strong production performance and potential to reach profitability later in the year. He expects Rivian to turn gross margin positive in the fourth quarter of 2024. Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) analysts also raised their price target on Rivian stock but maintained a neutral rating, reflecting the challenges posed by the competitive landscape.Rivian challenging obstacle course in 2024While Rivian has established itself as a prominent electric vehicle (EV) player, 2024 presents a critical year for the company. Several key challenges stand in its path to growth and sustained success, demanding strategic navigation and focused execution from the company’s management team.Sparking consumer interest in a crowded marketDue to rising interest rates and an increasingly saturated EV market, boosting demand will be critical for Rivian. It will be crucial for Rivian to execute strategies to boost demand, including:



Competitive pricing: Exploring price adjustments or innovative financing options to make their premium EVs more accessible to a broader audience.
Product portfolio expansion: Diversifying beyond their current truck and SUV offerings to cater to a broader range of consumer preferences and price points.
Brand recognition amplification: Strengthening their brand through targeted marketing campaigns and customer engagement initiatives to build a loyal following.
To conquer the demand battle in 2024, Rivian must combine sharper pricing, broader offerings, and amplified brand resonance.Charting a course to black inkLike many young EV companies, Rivian is still unprofitable. It is vital to create a clear path to profitability as soon as possible to maintain investor confidence and secure the financial resources required for sustained growth. Some ways Rivian might achieve this include:
Cost optimization: Streamlining production processes, optimizing supply chain management, and exploring cost-reduction opportunities across the organization.
Revenue diversification: Exploring complementary revenue streams beyond vehicle sales, such as subscription services, software upgrades, or data monetization.
Production efficiency enhancement: Maximizing output from existing manufacturing facilities and optimizing capacity utilization to improve the cost-effectiveness of each unit produced.
Standing out in a sea of electric optionsWith established automakers and new entrants entering the EV market, differentiation will be essential for Rivian to maintain its competitive advantage. Rivian could differentiate itself in several ways, including:
Leveraging unique features: Highlighting their distinctive strengths, such as off-road capabilities, innovative technology integrations, or premium materials, to capture specific market segments.
Cultivating superior customer service: Building a reputation for exceptional customer service, personalized support, and seamless ownership experiences to create brand loyalty.
Exploring niche markets: Identifying underserved segments within the EV market and tailoring offerings to cater to their needs and preferences.
These strategies can help Rivian carve out a distinct niche in the EV landscape and attract customers who value their unique proposition. Navigating these challenges and emerging victorious in 2024 will require strategic agility, focused execution, and a relentless pursuit of innovation. By overcoming these hurdles, Rivian can solidify its position as a leading force in the EV revolution and secure a bright future for its brand.


Despite the challenges, Rivian remains a well-positioned player in the growing EV market. The company has a strong production base, a supportive partner in Amazon, and a promising product lineup. If Rivian can address its delivery and demand challenges, it could still achieve significant success in the future.

62,"Tesla delivers, but can they outrun China's EV surge?","Jan 3, 2024",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/tesla-delivers-but-can-they-outrun-chinas-ev-surge/467854,"
Electric vehicle (EVs) adoption is surging across the globe. At the forefront of this surge is Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), the company Elon Musk built on ambition and electric dreams. Last quarter, Tesla defied expectations, delivering a record-breaking 484,507 vehicles. Although Tesla achieved another milestone and exceeded analyst estimates, its victory lap feels strangely muted.As Wall Street celebrated Tesla's delivery numbers, a quiet rumble came from the East. Chinese EV giant BYD (OTCMKTS: BYDDY) surged past Tesla to claim the global crown with an even bigger number of 526,409 deliveries. This news has left analysts and investors alike questioning: “Can Tesla, the once-uncontested champion, outrun the charging pack, particularly the formidable force surging from China?”



The crown slips: Tesla beats forecasts, but BYD steals the showAnalysts were already anticipating a strong quarter, but that got more than they expected as the EV titan crushed estimates with 484,507 deliveries in Q4. Wall Street cheered Tesla's impressive results but decided not to celebrate the win fully. Why? Because in China, another company was quietly taking the lead in the electric car race.BYD, a major Chinese company, has impacted the electric vehicle (EV) market and crashed Tesla’s party. BYD delivered an impressive 526,409 EVs, surpassing Tesla's global EV sales and positioning itself as the leader in this sector. This achievement is not only a significant milestone for BYD but also marks a shift in the competitive landscape of the EV industry.


On the other hand, Tesla delivered 484,507 EVs in the same period, representing a 37% increase compared to the previous year. This performance underlines Tesla's continued strength in the market, securing its status as the second-largest EV seller globally. Furthermore, Tesla exceeded its annual goal of 1.8 million deliveries, showcasing its strong market presence and operational capabilities.Added to the mix is the fact that Tesla's fourth-quarter growth rate was slower than its previous quarters. In contrast, BYD's rapid growth, supported by its large domestic market and a diverse range of EV products, has been more pronounced. The fourth quarter of 2023 has marked a significant shift in the electric vehicle sector, with BYD overtaking Tesla in quarterly deliveries.The Tesla tightropeTesla's Q4 performance was a paradox wrapped in an enigma. On the one hand, they shattered analysts' forecasts and surpassed their annual delivery goal. The company exceeded the 1.8 million units projected for the year. This cemented their position as the second-largest EV seller globally, showcasing a healthy 37% year-over-year growth. The numbers, while impressive, reveal underlying complexities. While it is true that Tesla beat Wall Street's estimates, it did not meet its internal goals. Tesla's inner circle had set a goal of 2 million deliveries, and falling short casts a shadow of unmet expectations. Profit margins also remain scrutinized, especially as the raw materials sector remains volitile. The ever-present possibility of a recession further clouds the economic horizon, adding a layer of uncertainty to Tesla's future balance sheet.


China shadows lengthenWhile Tesla enjoyed domestic success, BYD, a rapidly expanding giant from the East, captured the global spotlight. Their Q4 delivery figures of 526,409 far exceeded Tesla's, making them the undisputed EV market leader. This shift in power dynamics sent shockwaves throughout the industry. It indicates that the market is rapidly changing and that established dominance can be quickly seized.Investors eye the tightropeAnalysts and investors are cautiously optimistic about Tesla's prospects. While acknowledging the company's solid fundamentals and ambitious plans, they raise concerns about the intensifying competition, particularly from BYD. Some analysts believe that a price war could result from this intensifying competition, which could squeeze profit margins for both players. Additionally, global economic headwinds add another layer of complexity to the investment equation.Tesla is not one to shy away from ambitious goals. Elon Musk has set a target of delivering two million vehicles in 2024, a significant increase from the company's 2023 milestone. To achieve this, Tesla is rapidly ramping up production at its existing gigafactories and busies itself building new ones. The factories in Texas and Berlin are currently producing Model Y vehicles, while the Shanghai factory is producing Model 3 vehicles. In addition, Tesla is planning to build a Gigafactory in Mexico, which will help the company expand its operations in Latin America.The company is not content with simply churning out more of the same. Tesla still has some tricks up its sleeve. The highly anticipated (albeit delayed) Cybertruck is finally launched, promising to redefine the pickup truck landscape with its angular appeal. Meanwhile, rumors of a $27,000 automobile for India suggest Tesla's goal to democratize EVs and tap into developing markets. And let us not forget that the ever-evolving Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technologies are constantly inching closer to the holy grail of full autonomous driving.


Tesla is reaching a critical juncture in the electric vehicle (EV) market. Despite surpassing its delivery targets and demonstrating robust growth, the company now contends with the rapid ascent of China’s BYD. This signals a shift in the global EV landscape as competition extends beyond sheer delivery numbers to encompass technological innovation and market expansion. Tesla’s response to these challenges, including its ambitious production goals and strategic developments, will be pivotal in determining its position in an increasingly competitive and volatile industry.

63,17 Organizing Musts to Successfully Finance Your Next Business Step,"Jan 3, 2024",Jim Conroy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/17-organizing-musts-to-successfully-finance-your-next/466051,"
Successful businesses grow. Is yours ready?When these good things happen, it often requires money to convert opportunity into reality. A busy dentist hires new technicians and buys new equipment, or perhaps rents or buys new office space. A bicycle retailer might buy more bicycles to have in the shop or carry a wider range of helmets. A successful restaurant owner may decide to enter a complementary business, such as catering.Related: 3 Strategies for Getting Into Lending Shape



Where does the money come from?When you've decided to take your next step, you need to find the right place to secure your funding. Obvious choices include banks or credit unions. However, they can be difficult to qualify for without strong personal credit and a solid track record. Some banks offer loans backed by the Small Business Administration (SBA). If you're large enough, you may find yourself seeking a venture capital firm. Less-traditional options include online peer-to-peer lending platforms, microfinance institutions, accelerators and incubators; and angel investors may want a share of the business in exchange for their capital.17 things to organize before asking for fundingGood looks and shiny shoes aren't going to be enough to convince somebody to hand you money. No matter where you look, the money will come with strings. To provide a clear financial overview of your business, assemble and organize these 17 things:


Provide a loan proposal. This will describe how much money you need, what you'll do with it and how you intend to repay it. Also, provide a backup plan in case this doesn't work; lenders want their money back. List your business and personal assets. Where to get it: You build this yourself. Lenders and internet research can probably help you with structure.Balance sheet. Your bookkeeping will provide the data you need to provide this list of assets, liabilities and owner's equity in the business. If you've never put one together, here's a template you can use.Profit and loss statement. Any lender is going to qualify you based on how much money you're making.

Driven by a solid green economy, with investments in photovoltaics, 5G networks, and rapid adoption of electric vehicles, silver industrial demand is expected to remain robust, boosting the silver industry’s growth. So, let’s analyze if you should buy or hold silver stocks Pan American Silver (PAAS), Fortuna Silver (FSM), and Gatos Silver (GATO) for growth this year. Read on to know more….Silver is expected to experience significant demand, with its end uses ranging from jewelry and silverware to industrial and technological applications. In the long term, silver industrial demand will likely benefit from widespread vehicle electrification, the growing adoption of 5G technologies, and the advancement in the solar energy sector.Amid this backdrop, it could be wise to invest in fundamentally sound silver mining stock Fortuna Silver Mines Inc. (FSM) for solid growth in 2024. However, investors could hold Pan American Silver Corp. (PAAS) and Gatos Silver, Inc. (GATO) and wait for a better entry point in these stocks.



Silver is known as one of the most versatile precious metals, and it witnesses robust demand in multiple end-use applications, including industrial fabrication, jewelry and silverware manufacturing, physical investment, photovoltaic cells (PV), and more. Silver is a popular metal for jewelry because of its luster, affordability, and durability.The demand for silver in the form of bullion coins and silver bars has sharply increased in recent times, as it is historically considered a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Investors generally turn to silver to preserve their wealth.In 2023, silver industrial demand has achieved a new annual high, as reported by the Silver Institute. Industrial demand for silver is anticipated to grow 8% to a record 632 million ounces last year. Primary growth drivers include increased investment in photovoltaics, power grid and 5G networks, growth in consumer electronics, and high vehicle production.A report by Oxford Economics for the Silver Institute expected silver industrial demand to increase 46% through 2033, while jewelry and silverware demand is projected to grow 34% and 30%, respectively.According to a report by the Business Research Company, the silver ore market is expected to reach $11.40 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 8.8%. Silver’s use in electric vehicles (EVs) and solar panels will gain immense momentum in the upcoming years. Solar panels have been gaining traction amid the global green energy transition.The global solar PV panels market is projected to total $287.13 billion by 2030, expanding at a CAGR of 7.7% from 2024 to 2030. A significant surge in solar power installation will drive silver demand.


Growing silver demand, especially from the industrial sector, tight supplies, and expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2024 could push silver prices high this year. JPMorgan forecasts silver will cross the $30 per ounce mark anytime soon in 2024.Given these favorable trends, let’s look at the fundamentals of the three Miners - Silver stocks, beginning with number 3.Stocks to Hold:Stock #3: Pan American Silver Corp.

65,Happy New Year for Stock Investors???,"Jan 3, 2024",Steve Reitmeister,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/happy-new-year-for-stock-investors/467825,"
The new year started with a thud for stock market...that is in stark contrast to the raging bull market we all enjoyed to close out the year. Yet as the S&P 500 (SPY) closes in on the all time highs it does make one take pause and consider the best way forward as the strategies that worked best in 2023 will likely not hold the keys to success in 2024. Get Steve Reitmeister’s game plan for 2024 along with a preview of his top 13 trades below.2024 is NOT 2023!A new game plan for stocks is afoot which was very much on display in December and kicked off the new year in the same fashion.What is that new game plan? And how to outpace the market from here? The answers to those questions and more are in this first Reitmeister Total Return commentary of 2024.Market CommentaryStocks kept sprinting into the finish line ending the year 4,769 for the S&P 500 (SPY). That is spitting distance from the all-time closing high of 4,796. Meaning we will get there soon enough in the new year.Interestingly, investors spent the first day of the new year hitting the brakes. That makes perfect sense when you appreciate the non-stop pace of gains the past several weeks. Plus nearing the all time highs is a natural point of resistance leading to a palpable pause.



However, not all stocks were in the red. Instead, a rotation took place. In simplest terms it was OUT with the winners of 2023...and IN with the weakest groups from the past year. The next 2 charts tell this story in stark contrast:Indeed, last year’s big winners in Technology and Communication Services went from the top of performance chart to the bottom to kick off the year. Conversely the 2023 weaklings like Healthcare, Utilities and Consumer Defensive took a healthy step forward in the new year.


The explanation for this rotation can be easily explained when you appreciate the tax games investors play. For example, investors want to delay the tax ramifications for big profits on their winners by selling at the onset of 2024 instead of the end of 2023. That is why technology took it so hard Tuesday.Another popular tax season trend is to sell the biggest losers at the end of the year to take the tax loss to offset gains to lower their tax bill. And then those same stocks enjoy the biggest rebound early in the New Year as value seekers buy that dip.At this stage most everyone is feeling comfortable about the economy, especially with the Fed likely to start lowering rates in the coming year. At this moment the GDPNow model from the Atlanta Fed stands at +2.0% for Q4.Not too hot to keep inflation aloft. Not too cold to worry anyone about recession. 


Now the guessing game begins about WHEN the Fed will make their first rate cut. Very few people expect that at their January 31st announcement. However, odds go up to nearly 80% likelihood for March 24th.I don’t think it matters so much when they first drop rates...but how aggressively. A minor 25 point cut in March barely moves the needle. Given how aggressively they raised rates I would want to see a faster pace of withdrawal...like 50 points to get the party started. Right now, the odds of that in March are only 10% (perhaps that should be a notch higher).But as the Fed likes to say...they are data dependent. Thus, we all need to keep a watchful eye on these upcoming economic events:1/3 ISM Manufacturing1/5 Government Employment (not just jobs added, but also wage inflation)1/5 ISM Services1/11 CPI1/12 PPI1/25 Q4 GDP + the Feds favorite reading on inflation, PCEAll leading to the 1/31 Fed meeting.Trading PlanThis is a natural spot for the bull run to take a rest and form a trading range. The top end is around 4,800 given how it correlates with the all time highs. The low end is not that low...maybe 4,650’ish.


The more important element is the ongoing rotation that should take place. Last year’s big winners are played out. Meaning just riding the same ol’ Magnificent 7 bandwagon is not the path to outperformance in 2024.Instead, it will be the ongoing rotation to smaller stocks (mid caps too). They have a lot of room to play catch up given a nearly 4 year advantage for large caps.I also like industrials and materials that should benefit from lower rates as they often borrow a lot to run their businesses. So, this lower cost of borrowing should help boost earnings growth and share prices.I believe the S&P 500 will have modest returns this year. Like high single digits. Maybe 10% tops. Thus, would expect to end the year around 5,200.


Index investors will not be so pleased as it becomes more of a year for stock pickers. And in that environment, I love our odds by leaning into the most attractive groups in the year ahead.

66,2 Crypto Stocks to Watch Ahead of Spot ETF Approval,"Dec 29, 2023",Mangeet Kaur Bouns,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/2023-crypto-rebound-paves-the-way-for-a-promising-2024-2/467710,"
Cryptocurrency prices have been on the rise after the so-called “crypto winter” deepened by the collapse of the FTX exchange in 2022. Bitcoin is up more than 150% year-to-date, mainly strengthened by optimism for a spot bitcoin ETF. As this year’s crypto recovery paves the way for a promising 2024, crypto-centric stocks NVIDIA (NVDA) and Block (SQ) could be ideal watchlist additions. Read on….The crypto market has witnessed a roller coaster ride this year but has generated profitable returns. In early December, the digital currency topped around $44,000 for the first time since April last year and gained above 150% year-to-date, primarily fueled by optimism for a spot bitcoin ETF.Amid this backdrop, it could be wise to add quality crypto-centric stocks NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Block, Inc. (SQ)  to your watchlist.



Cryptocurrency prices are rebounding after a so-called “crypto winter” that was aggravated by the collapse of the FTX exchange in 2022. Last year was highlighted by hedge fund collapses, crypto lender failures, and worsening losses at miners, which was punctuated in November 2022 when the FTX spiraled into bankruptcy.While the Bitcoin price surged more than 150% from the same time last year, shares of Coinbase (COIN), MicroStrategy (MSTR), and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), all closely tied to the digital currency, rose more than 300% in value. Ethereum, another major coin, is up approximately 85% from this time in 2022.


Yesterday, the Bitcoin price jumped to nearly $43,446.82, a significant win for investors who got in at the start of the year when the price was around $16,500.One of the primary drivers for the Bitcoin surge this year was an easing of the Fed’s interest rate increases, which created an attractive case for riskier assets. Crypto prices were further strengthened by the upcoming bitcoin halving, which occurs every four years and is scheduled for May 2024. During the halving process, the reward for mining is slashed in half, capping the supply of bitcoin.Additional buying was fueled by the potential for a flurry of bitcoin ETFs emerging in the new year.This year, various leading financial firms, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Fidelity, and others, asked the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve a spot bitcoin ETF. This approval of the first U.S. spot bitcoin ETF awaited in January 2024,  would be a milestone for cryptocurrency investors.


“For ETF investors, this would be the best product on the market,” said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar. “All the other options right now have flaws to varying degrees.”At present, U.S. investors can buy bitcoin futures ETFs, which own bitcoin futures contracts or agreements to buy or sell the asset later for an agreed-upon price. This long-awaited bitcoin spot ETF can invest in the digital asset directly.Given an enhanced optimism surrounding the crypto space, crypto-centric stocks NVDA and SQ could be solid watchlist additions now.Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of these stocks:NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)NVDA offers graphics, and compute and networking solutions globally. It provides GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics, Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing, cryptocurrency mining processors, and more. The company serves the gaming, data center, and automotive markets.Cryptocurrency mining requires specialized computer hardware, including GPUs. NVDA saw an immense opportunity in this market and boosted the production of specialized GPUs for cryptocurrency mining. For instance, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 became highly popular among miners due to its high hash rate and power efficiency.On November 13, NVDA announced that it had supercharged the world’s leading AI computing platform with the introduction of the NVIDIA HGX™ H200. Based on NVIDIA Hopper™ architecture, the platform features the NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPU with advanced memory to handle enormous amounts of data for generative AI and high-performance computing workloads.


The NVIDIA H200 is the first GPU to offer HBM3e — faster, larger memory to boost the acceleration of generative AI and large language models while advancing scientific computing for HPC workloads. This new processor optimized for AI applications is expected to extend the company’s market reach and drive its growth.NVDA’s trailing-12-month gross profit margin and EBITDA margin of 69.85% and 49.39% are favorably higher than the industry averages of 49.14% and 9.25%, respectively.

But as of October 29, 2023, NVDA’s current liabilities increased to $9.10 billion, compared to $6.56 billion as of January 29, 2023.Analysts expect NVDA’s revenue and EPS for the fourth quarter (ending January 2024) to increase 231.1% and 411.1% year-over-year to $20.03 billion and $4.50, respectively. Also, the company has topped the consensus revenue and EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, which is impressive.NVDA’s stock has gained 10.4% over the past six months and 252.8% over the past year to close the last trading session at $495.22.NVDA’s mixed fundamentals are reflected in its POWR Ratings.

67,Should Investors Keep an Eye on JPMorgan and Citigroup (C) in 2024?,"Dec 29, 2023",Sristi Suman Jayaswal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/should-investors-keep-an-eye-on-jpmorgan-and-citigroup-c/467709,"
The banking sector has showcased commendable resilience and stability, defying the hurdles encountered at the beginning of 2023. Following a substantial resurgence in bank stocks, let’s examine whether investors should keep an eye on banking stocks Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) for 2024. Read on….The U.S. banking sector, having weathered regional bank collapses and credit downgrades, projects stability despite looming macroeconomic uncertainties that put certain financial institutions at risk. Given this backdrop, waiting for better entry points in stocks Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) could be prudent.The Federal Reserve's decision to hike the benchmark interest rate marked an uptick for the banking sector, as high interest rates correspondingly raised net interest income for banks.



The industry grappled with risks like sluggish loan growth, steepening bond losses, default risks tethered to commercial real estate loans, increasing capital requirements, and broader macroeconomic degradation.Moreover, the third quarter saw an unprecedented surge in credit card debt, registering close to a 5% increase compared to the second quarter. This rise has resulted in an increasing number of borrowers teetering on the edge of late payments.


However, amid easing inflation in November, there are strong market predictions that the Fed will begin to implement rate cuts next year. Such a move will likely alleviate concerns pertaining to deposit costs, loan growth, and credit quality within banking circles.Banking stocks have recently rallied following the Fed's indication of potential interest rate cuts by 2024. Although higher interest rates generally favor banks, they can impede loan growth by making borrowing expensive and raising deposit costs. Anticipated lower rates are expected to foster demand for goods and services, opening the way for more loans by banks.However, lending may become less profitable under lower rates due to decreased charging, while staff pay could rise slightly. Despite this, there are still opportunities for bank stocks to gain value.With short-term rates likely to decline, the margin outlook seems optimistic as banks borrow short-term funds to make loans. Therefore, loan demand could also experience a boost.


Considering these trends, let's look at the fundamentals of the two Money Center Banks stocks.Stock #2: Citigroup Inc. (C)C provides various financial products and services to consumers, corporations, governments, and institutions in North America, Latin America, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

Its EPS for the same quarter is expected to decline 14.6% year-over-year to $0.99. It surpassed the consensus revenue estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, which is impressive.The stock has gained 15.5% over the past year to close the last trading session at $51.52. Over the past three months, it gained 25.1%.C’s fundamentals are reflected in its POWR Ratings.

However, its forward Price/Book of 1.66x is 35.4% higher than the 1.22x industry average.JPM’s total net revenue for the fiscal third quarter that ended September 30, 2023, increased 21.9% year-over-year to $39.87 billion.

68,"Affirm's rise and the future of buy now, pay later","Dec 28, 2023",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/affirms-rise-and-the-future-of-buy-now-pay-later/467686,"
Fiscal year 2022 was challenging for Affirm Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: AFRM). After crumbling under recession fears and a 90% stock dive, the buy now pay later (BNPL) pioneer teetered on the brink, but 2023 witnessed a stunning reversal. Affirm's stock skyrocketed over 430%, dwarfing its tech peers. What fueled this dramatic turnaround? Holiday BNPL adoption, strategic partnerships and easing economic anxieties all played a part. But Affirm's future isn't risk-free. The competition and looming regulation could dampen enthusiasm for BNPL. Regardless, Affirm's comeback is a testament to its resilience. Understanding its past triumphs and future challenges will be crucial for discerning its investment potential in the volatile BNPL sector.



Examining the buy now, pay later pioneerA pioneer in the buy now, pay later (BNPL) sector, Affirm is changing how consumers shop by providing flexible payment options. For example, you can split your purchase into interest-free installments over a set period, typically from several weeks to months. Affirm makes this possible by acting as a financial intermediary between you and the retailer.So, how does it work? When you encounter an Affirm partner at checkout, you can opt for its BNPL service. Affirm performs a quick credit check to assess your eligibility and, if approved, disburses the purchase amount directly to the merchant. You, in turn, repay the loan in fixed installments to Affirm, typically without incurring any interest, as long as you adhere to the agreed-upon repayment schedule.Affirm diversifies its offerings through various loan types tailored to different purchase values and timelines. For smaller items, biweekly payments might be ideal, while larger purchases might necessitate monthly installments spread over a longer period. This flexibility empowers consumers to manage their finances responsibly and avoid the burden of hefty upfront costs.Affirm has forged strategic partnerships with major retailers across various industries to bolster its reach and cater to diverse consumer needs. From household names like Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) to niche players in the education and healthcare sectors, Affirm's extensive network ensures broader accessibility for BNPL solutions.


But Affirm isn't alone in the BNPL arena. Competitors like Klarna and Afterpay (a product owned by Square's parent company Block Inc. (NYSE: SQ)) vie for market share, offering similar installment plans. While the core concept remains the same, subtle differences exist. Klarna, for instance, often charges interest for longer repayment periods, while Afterpay focuses on smaller purchases with shorter installment durations. From Wall Street woes to market darlingThe 2023 fiscal year was a time of significant change for Affirm. The company experienced a sharp reversal of fortune. After a tumultuous 2022 that saw its stock plummet due to recessionary anxieties, the BNPL player roared back with a vengeance, its price surging over 430%. What ignited this remarkable comeback? A potent mix of strategic moves and favorable market conditions propelled Affirm's ascent.


First, the holiday season proved a boon for BNPL adoption. Wary of inflation and seeking financial flexibility, consumers embraced installment plans to manage holiday spending. This surge in demand directly benefited Affirm, solidifying its position as a preferred BNPL option for retailers and shoppers.Affirm's strategic partnerships with retail giants like Amazon and Walmart further fueled its growth. These collaborations expanded Affirm's reach and brand visibility, exposing its BNPL offering to a broader audience and driving increased transaction volume. The resulting revenue boost and improved market share strengthened investor confidence, promoting positive sentiment toward the company's stock.Beyond the holiday bump and strategic alliances, macroeconomic factors also played a pivotal role. Easing concerns about a looming recession and potential Fed rate cuts injected optimism into the broader market, benefiting growth-oriented companies like Affirm. Affirm's strong financial performance, characterized by improved revenue and narrowing losses, ignited investor enthusiasm in this improved market climate.Challenges facing Affirm's continued ascentWhile Affirm's 2023 rally was undeniably exciting, it's crucial to acknowledge the potential challenges that could disrupt its future trajectory. Several key challenges pose significant threats to its continued growth and profitability.


First, Affirm faces intensified competition from established financial players. Traditional lenders and credit card companies increasingly recognize the BNPL market's potential and are developing their own installment-based offerings. This increased competition could erode Affirm's market share and squeeze its profit margins.Secondly, regulatory scrutiny surrounding BNPL practices is intensifying. Concerns about potential overspending and predatory lending practices have prompted regulatory bodies to consider stricter oversight and possible limitations on BNPL usage. Such regulations could restrict Affirm's ability to acquire new customers and hinder its revenue generation.Finally, the macroeconomic environment presents another significant risk. A potential economic slowdown could reduce consumer spending, negatively impacting BNPL adoption. Rising interest rates could also make Affirm's financing options less attractive than traditional credit products, further dampening demand.Affirm's vision for financial dominationAffirm's astonishing 2023 performance begs the question: Where to go next? The company's ambitious plans extend beyond the BNPL space, aiming to build a comprehensive financial services ecosystem that caters to evolving consumer needs.


International expansion is a primary focus. Entering new markets like Canada and Europe presents significant growth opportunities, potentially multiplying Affirm's customer base and expanding its reach. Strategic partnerships with regional players could further accelerate this international push.But Affirm's ambitions go beyond geographic expansion. The company is developing new financial products, including debit cards and spending accounts, to integrate seamlessly with its BNPL offerings. This move could foster user loyalty and create a stickier ecosystem, encouraging greater engagement and repeat transactions.Ultimately, Affirm's success in 2024 will hinge on its ability to navigate these challenges, execute its expansion plans effectively and solidify its position as a trusted and comprehensive financial partner. Investors who believe in Affirm's vision and execution prowess may find it a compelling opportunity, while those seeking greater risk mitigation may prefer to adopt a wait-and-see approach. Careful analysis, diversification and continuous monitoring will be key for anyone navigating the complexities of this potentially rewarding investment prospect.

70,7 Things That Set Angel Investors Apart From Other Early-Stage Investors,"Dec 28, 2023",Allison Murn,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/7-things-that-set-angel-investors-apart-from-other/466033,"
I have had the honor of working with New York Angels for the past year, and I honestly didn't know much about angel investing prior. I had helped sell Cameron's Coffee to private equity, so I was familiar with that process and I read a lot about VCs, but angel investing was foreign to me. I added New York Angels to my consulting portfolio as another client, but I had no idea what it would be like. Admittedly, I historically grouped all investors into the same bucket, and I didn't understand the differences between each stage of funding.But like any other role I've had, I spent the first 90 days learning as much as I could. I read Angel Investing: The Gust Guide to Making Money and Having Fun Investing in Startups and What Every Angel Investor Wants You to Know. I sat in on as many meetings as possible with members and founders. Over the last year, I connected with more than 100 angel investors and founders, and I learned how significantly different angel investing is from other early-stage investments.Related: 7 Important Differences Between Angels and VCs You Need to Understand



1. Angels invest for the exitMost angels are looking for startups with exit potential, not just a stake in a high-profit, high-revenue business. Consequently, angels will tell you if you will be more successful as a lifestyle business vs. one working towards an exit. Also, founders often start their businesses because they don't want to answer to someone else. Angels will be the first to say that if you don't want to answer to someone else, don't fundraise (since you will be answering to them as shareholders).That being said, angels usually will not interfere unless you want them to, but angels do expect an exit. If an exit is not likely possible, angels will guide you to consider continuing to fund your company yourself. Sometimes bootstrapping is the best idea; just ask Sir James Dyson and his £6.5 billion later.


2. Valuations can make or break a deal for angelsAngels are very sensitive to valuation because as many companies fail, angels need successful investments to produce 20x. Valuations can be extremely difficult to determine for early-stage companies because oftentimes there are no real benchmarks. Inevitably, the founder believes the company has a higher valuation, while investors will negotiate for a lower one.The reality is whatever the valuation is, it must align with the company's traction for founders and investors to agree and close the deal. Bigger also isn't always better — a smaller valuation with a higher likelihood for a 10x multiple at exit is much better for all parties than a larger valuation with a minimal multiple or a lower likelihood of exit.3. Angels hope for unicorns, but they don't start out looking for themFrom the outside, we often hear about the unicorns, but realistically, that's not what angels look for when they invest. No one actually knows which company will become a unicorn. Most angels manage a diverse portfolio and invest in startups that have proven some sort of traction to greatly reduce their failure rate. Unicorns are called unicorns because they rarely happen. When they do, it has a lot to do with luck.Related: 6 Ways Angels and VCs Think Differently


4. Angels are incentivized to help their founders be successfulAngels not only want you to succeed, but they relish being in the trenches with you (if you want them to) to help you succeed. Angels will often make themselves available to talk through issues 24/7, while others will serve on the board, sharing their advice, experiences and contacts. They can also be most helpful to founders through tough times because angels have seen permutations of the same issues across other companies in their portfolio or they have experienced these issues themselves in their personal ventures.5. Angels invest for the payout result, but they often most enjoy the mentoring along the wayAlmost every company goes through a major pivot at some point. When angels invest, they don't know exactly what the company will become, but they do know the founder they are investing in (leading to the adage of investing in the jockey as opposed to the horse). Angels want to like the founder, and they want to work with them.Mentoring is almost like a continuation of their own careers, as many angels have made their money by being successful founders themselves, like Marc Andreessen, the top angel investor, who founded Netscape, which was bought by AOL in 1998. In the final analysis though, if an angel can't envision the reasonable possibility of a significant return, they won't invest.6. Angels are not playing with someone else's moneyWhen angels write a check, it's their own money. They weren't hired as part of an investment firm to use the firm's money — every penny is their own. Angels also hope that when they do invest, founders treat it like their own money, too.


Related: How to Fund Your Business With Angel Investors7. Angels look for diversity in founders but those who share similar valuesInvestors look for founders with a diversity of backgrounds because that leads to diversity in thinking and ideas. The angels who I have met are humble yet confident, hardworking, smart as hell and adaptable — all things that they similarly value in founders. Angels also are incredibly positive yet realistic, which is what founders need to be throughout the ups and downs of their business.After talking with many founders who have exited or raised their next series, they often say they are so thankful for their angel investors. Angels gave them the first shot, frequently when no one else would.Google recently celebrated its 25th birthday. In 1998, four angels (Andreas von Bechtolsheim, Kavitark Ram Shriram, David R. Cheriton and Jeffrey Bezos) invested in this early-stage startup that is now the eighth-largest company in the country. Google wouldn't be Google today without angel investment. All in all, the most important takeaway that I've had from watching angels, is that angels are not just investors — they can be real-life angels.

73,SoftBank's billion-dollar bet pays off,"Dec 27, 2023",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/softbanks-billion-dollar-bet-pays-off/467627,"
The Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank (OTCMKTS: SFTBY), known for its bold investments, received a $7.6 billion windfall this week. This strategic payout, tied to the 2020 acquisition of Sprint by T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: TMUS), strengthens SoftBank's financial position and demonstrates its expertise in completing complex transactions. This influx of capital opens up intriguing possibilities for the company's future, raising questions about how it will use it to advance its ambitious tech initiatives.SoftBank: Diversification and calculated gamblesSoftBank is more than just a company it is a multifaceted empire. Its investments reach deep into the corners of the tech world, with core business areas including:




Telecoms: As a major player in Japan and beyond, SoftBank boasts control over mobile carriers like SoftBank Mobile and stakes in giants like T-Mobile US.
Investments: SoftBank has become a recognizable name in the venture capital realm through its Vision Fund. The company has backed countless startups across multiple technology sectors, from AI and robotics to fintech and proptech (real estate property management technology).
Technology Assets: From chip design with Arm to e-commerce ventures, SoftBank's portfolio extends into diverse tech arenas, demonstrating its appetite for venturing beyond traditional boundaries.
But SoftBank's journey hasn't been without its volatility. While past successes like the Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) investment stand as glowing tributes to its insight, challenges like the acquisition of Sprint and the WeWork (NYSE: WE) debacle revealed the inherent risks in their high-stakes investment approach.SoftBank reaps $7.6 billion from T-Mobile mergerSoftBank's recent windfall was due to a meticulously planned strategy it adopted in 2020. That year, the CEO of Softbank, Masayoshi Son, orchestrated the merger of SoftBank-owned Sprint with T-Mobile US. Embedded within the agreement was a clause holding the potential for future prosperity. This clause was a contingency stake in T-Mobile for SoftBank. This stake was contingent upon performance reaching defined parameters.


Fast forward to the present, and those performance thresholds have been recently surpassed. T-Mobile's stock price has soared, causing the price to exceed the stipulated share price triggers outlined in the original agreement. This triggered the automatic issuance of 48.75 million T-Mobile shares to SoftBank, translating to a $7.6 billion stake.The financial implications of this windfall are significant. For starters, it injects substantial liquidity into SoftBank's balance sheet, bolstering its financial position and providing much-needed breathing room.  This provides SoftBank with a potential capital gain. They can choose to hold onto the shares or sell them for immediate cash.Navigating SoftBank's strategic optionsThe path ahead presents a spectrum of possibilities. First and foremost, the windfall offers an opportunity to fortify SoftBank's financial foundation. The company’s existing debt is a strain from past acquisitions, and this debt could be meaningfully reduced. Reducing the debt would bolster the company's balance sheet and enhance its creditworthiness. This could lower borrowing costs and unlock access to more favorable financial terms, paving the way for future growth.The newfound resources could also fuel a new wave of investments. SoftBank's “Moonshot” philosophy remains unchanged, and the company’s appetite for daring investments remains a cornerstone of that philosophy.  The windfall could provide the ammunition to venture deeper into promising sectors like artificial intelligence, robotics, or renewable energy, solidifying its position as a tech pioneer.


Another intriguing option could be share buybacks. Repurchasing its shares would directly reward shareholders, boosting their stake in the company's future success and increasing the stock price. By reducing the number of outstanding shares, a buyback plan would also increase the earnings per share (EPS), potentially making the stock more attractive to investors and propelling the price upwards. However, this approach can be controversial, raising concerns about short-term financial gains versus long-term growth initiatives.Navigating the SoftBank surgeSoftBank's $7.6 billion windfall has naturally piqued investors' interest. But before investing in Softbank, you should familiarize yourself with the risks. While the windfall might paint a rosy picture, SoftBank remains a high-risk, high-reward proposition. While potentially lucrative, its history of audacious bets can also lead to significant losses, as witnessed in the WeWork saga. Investors with a stomach for risk and a long-term perspective can consider SoftBank as a strategic addition to their portfolio. The windfall strengthens the company's financial position, offering a buffer against potential downturns. Moreover, SoftBank's focus on cutting-edge technologies like AI and robotics positions them to benefit from future industry growth. Alternative strategies and comparable companiesSoftBank's windfall has created a stir, but it is essential to remember that it is just one chapter in the company's ongoing story. Investors should prioritize due diligence, understand the inherent risks, and consider alternative options before making a SoftBank investment.


Investing in broader technology sector ETFs or established tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) or Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) may offer lower risk profiles with more predictable returns for those looking for alternatives. Companies like Alibaba, with a longer track record and similar exposure to Asian markets, could also be worth considering. Ultimately, the decision depends on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market outlook.

74,3 Energy Stock Outliers With Massive Gain Potential,"Dec 27, 2023",Sristi Suman Jayaswal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/3-energy-stock-outliers-with-massive-gain-potential/467617,"
Given the accelerating global demand for oil and gas coupled with a dwindling supply, it's plausible that we may witness a significant surge in energy prices, which could stimulate considerable growth within the energy sector. To that end, fundamentally strong energy stocks ChampionX Corporation (CHX), Ultrapar Participações S.A. (UGP), and Star Group, L.P. (SGU) could be solid buys now. Read on….Despite an increasing global emphasis on sustainable energy practices, robust oil and gas demand indicates a potential rise in the consumption of non-renewable resources. Given this backdrop, quality energy stocks ChampionX Corporation (CHX), Ultrapar Participações S.A. (UGP), and Star Group, L.P. (SGU) could be wise portfolio additions now.While the transition toward renewable energy solutions intensifies, projections indicate a continuous robust demand for oil and gas globally. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), by 2024, global oil demand is expected to surge by 930,000 bpd, primarily driven by robust economic growth in India and China's ongoing economic recovery.



The OPEC’s 2023 World Oil Outlook forecasts global oil demand to reach 116 million bpd by 2045. To meet the oil demand forecast for the long term, OPEC suggests an investment of approximately $14 trillion in the oil sector, averaging $610 billion annually.OPEC+ has initiated voluntary output cuts of about 2.2 million barrels per day throughout the first quarter of 2024. This could lead to an increase in prices due to tightened supplies amid the amplifying demand.


Recent upward trends in oil prices have been stimulated by global shipping companies' decision to avoid the Red Sea in light of heightened security concerns, causing a temporary halt of services through the crucial Bab el Mandeb strait. This maritime checkpoint accounts for nearly 12% of global trade, encompassing a substantial portion of international oil commerce. Any escalation in this situation could further propel oil prices.Barclays and S&P Global anticipate oil to average at $93 and $85 per barrel, respectively, in 2024. Meanwhile, as per Fidelity's 2024 energy outlook, crude oil prices could stay high, boosted by increased geopolitical risk, tight supply, and strong global energy demand. This optimistically sets the stage for potential profitability and an upward shift in sector stock prices.Furthermore, the surge of international investments and offshore production is expected to invigorate the market, increasing demand for energy equipment and services companies.With these favorable trends in mind, let's delve into the fundamentals of the three energy sector stocks.ChampionX Corporation (CHX)CHX provides chemistry solutions, and engineered equipment and technologies to oil and gas companies worldwide. The company operates through four segments: Production Chemical Technologies; Production & Automation Technologies; Drilling Technologies; and Reservoir Chemical Technologies. On November 10, CHX’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share on the company’s common stock, par value of $0.01 per share, payable to the shareholders on January 26, 2024.Its annualized dividend rate of $0.34 per share translates to a dividend yield of 1.11% on the current share price. Its four-year average yield is 0.37%.

75,3 Buy or Hold Energy Stock Options for Momentum,"Dec 27, 2023",Mangeet Kaur Bouns,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/3-buy-or-hold-energy-stock-options-for-momentum/467610,"
With sustained demand for oil and natural gas globally and numerous technological advancements in exploration and production activities, the energy sector’s outlook appears robust. Amid this, let’s analyze if you should buy or hold energy stocks Halliburton (HAL), Pembina Pipeline (PBA), and NGL Energy (NGL) for momentum. Read more to know….Despite lingering challenges, OPEC maintains a positive outlook for the oil market’s future, given solid energy demand worldwide. Also, oil prices continued their year-end surge this Tuesday amid rising fears that tensions in the Mideast could disrupt oil supply coupled with hopes of rate cuts that could drive economic growth and fuel demand.Given the backdrop, it could be wise to invest in fundamentally sound energy stock NGL Energy Partners LP (NGL) for steady momentum. However, investors could hold Halliburton Company (HAL) and Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PBA) and wait for a better entry point in these stocks.



Despite several economic headwinds, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) maintains an optimistic stance for the oil market’s future. It attributes recent declines in oil prices to speculative actions and overblown concerns. In 2024, OPEC expects world oil demand to rise by 2.25 million bpd, highlighting that robust global GDP growth will support crude demand.American oil output now climbed to all-time levels as it continues to meet rising demand at home and around the world. According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, the U.S. has become history’s biggest oil producer. Production of crude and condensate hit a new global record of 13.3 million barrels per day this quarter. That is part of a record 21.4 million bpd for total U.S. liquids production.“Not only is the United States producing more oil than any country in history, but the amount of oil (crude oil, refined products and natural gas liquids) that it is exporting is near the total production of Saudi Arabia or Russia,” said Jim Burkhard, vice president and head of research for oil market, energy, and mobility.Surging energy demand globally will contribute to the growth of the oilfield services market. Moreover, advancements in drilling technology represent a primary change in the oilfield services sector. The global oilfield services market is expected to reach $346.45 billion by 2027, expanding at a CAGR of 6.6% during the forecast period (2023-2027).Rapid technological advancements have positively impacted exploration and production activities in the energy industry. Oil and gas companies are increasingly integrating advanced technologies like AI, machine learning, automation, IoT, and big data analytics, leading to improved efficiency, lower costs, and achieving decarbonization.Given the industry’s bright prospects, investing in fundamentally strong energy stock NGL could be wise for solid momentum. However, it seems prudent to hold HAL and PBA and wait for a better entry point in these stocks.

This acquisition complements Pembina’s strategy of offering access to world-class, long-life resources from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin to premium end markets and enhances exposure to lighter hydrocarbons.This strategic acquisition is anticipated to be leverage-neutral, ensuring PBA’s continued financial flexibility to fund future products and improving its free cash flow position.

76,Venture Capital 101: A Comprehensive Guide for Startups Seeking Investment,"Dec 26, 2023",Zamir Shukho,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/venture-capital-101-a-comprehensive-guide-for-startups/466550,"
Every day, dozens of startups go through the Vibranium.VC funnel; some don't pass the first scoring, while others move to the next stage towards potential investment. Drawing from my entrepreneurial background, I can confidently say that advice I received in the past from professionals in specific fields helped me be well-prepared and aware of the nuances that come along with the entrepreneurial journey.Advice for startup founders is crucial at the beginning of their journey as it provides invaluable insights and guidance from experienced individuals who have navigated similar paths. This advice can help founders avoid common pitfalls, refine their strategies, and make informed decisions, ultimately increasing their chances of success. The early-stage startup founders are often filled with uncertainties, and seeking advice from business role models can offer clarity and direction to set a solid foundation for the entrepreneurial journey.Related: Why Investors With an Entrepreneurial Past Are Crucial to Startup Success



Secure your runwayBegin your search for investments at least six months before your funds run out, ensuring your runway remains at 6-8 months. If you are raising seed, anticipate that this funding will sustain your runway for two years. Approximately a year or 1,5 years, you can move towards the Series A fundraising process. This timeline implies that you should attain Series A metrics within one and a half years, providing a six-month buffer while concluding the round with the next-level investors.Series A financing refers to an investment in a startup after it has shown progress in building its business model and demonstrates the potential to grow and generate revenue. It often refers to the first round of venture money a firm raises after seed round and angel investors.


A healthy runway, representing the number of months a startup can operate before running out of cash, demonstrates financial stability and responsible financial management. Investors are more likely to be interested in companies that clearly understand their financial standing and can sustain operations over the mid to long term.A longer runway enhances your negotiating position: It reduces the urgency for immediate funding, giving the startup more negotiating power when discussing valuation, terms, and other aspects of the investment deal. This can result in more favorable terms for the startup.Additionally, a sufficient runway provides the startup with ample time during fundraising. This time is essential for due diligence procedures, negotiations, and other steps involved in securing investment. It allows both the startup and investors to thoroughly evaluate the opportunity without the pressure of an imminent cash shortage.Be prepared for a lengthy fundraising processAs you initiate active fundraising, the second point is to prepare for an extended fundraising process from 3 to 6 months at best (sometimes even more). This is particularly crucial in the early stages, considering all due diligence procedures, negotiation processes, and other factors. The size of the funding round can influence the timeline: larger funding rounds often involve more extensive due diligence, negotiations, and legal processes, potentially extending the duration. For example, one of our longer deals took almost five months, while the shortest one was sealed after one month.


Negotiating the terms of the investment, including valuation and other deal terms, can take time. The back-and-forth negotiations between the startup and investors contribute to the overall duration. And don't forget about legal processes: finalizing legal agreements and paperwork can add time to the timeline.Related: 3 Alternatives to Venture Capital Funding for StartupsCreate a database of investorsBuild a database of 100 or more warm contacts with investors. Initiate conversations with them and strive to convert these interactions into closed deals. Have as many contacts as necessary to achieve the crucial milestones for the next round.Having a database of investors is a strategic asset for startups. It streamlines communication, facilitates relationship-building, and allows startups to make informed decisions throughout the fundraising process and beyond.


The database is also crucial when it comes to your pitch. By understanding different investors' preferences and investment histories, startups can tailor their pitches more effectively. This personalized approach increases the likelihood of capturing investor interest and aligning with their investment thesis.Related: Why Strategic Venture Capital is Thriving in a Founder's MarketTransparency is everythingBe transparent, avoid fabrications, and don't lie. We all know ""Fake it till you make it "" cases, which have made investors more cautious about startups. Transparency is a way for startups to demonstrate accountability and lower the risk of investment for VCs. By providing clear and accurate information, startups show they take responsibility for their actions and decisions, reinforcing a sense of trust. Be truthful because, trust me, distorted information will surface during the Due Diligence process and can become a deal breaker. This could lead to losing investors, and more importantly, it will discourage them from engaging with you.Always remember that transparency is not just about sharing information; it's about fostering a culture of openness, trust, and accountability.

77,The No. 1 Reason Why This New Battery Tech Will Make Traditional Batteries Obsolete…,"Dec 22, 2023",StackCommerce,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/the-no-1-reason-why-this-new-battery-tech-will-make/467483,"
Lithium batteries, the current industry standard, can be ticking time bombs. They're expensive, environmentally unfriendly, and, frankly, potentially dangerous. Remember those headlines about phones and electric cars catching fire? They've gotten worse.In New York, one out of every five fire deaths this year were from lithium batteries. That's the legacy lithium's left behind. And if New York is any indication of what's to come, the longer we rely on lithium batteries, the more lithium deaths we'll be hearing about on the news.Even still, our future relies on batteries. Forecasts project the market for global energy storage systems to rocket up to a staggering $435.32 billion by 2030. Right now, there's not even enough batteries for less than 1% of all global power needs.



Therefore it stands to reason, with so many headwinds against lithium batteries, investing in a non-lithium technology could represent a significant opportunity. Thankfully, today there is a seismic shift away from lithium happening, and there's one investment you can make today to cash in on this growing trend. A new company has introduced a revolutionary next-gen battery–a lithium-free innovation that's safe, cost-effective, and incredibly powerful.Say goodbye to sleepless nights worrying about battery fires. That's because the next-gen battery platform is based on a battery chemistry that is dramatically safer than lithium.


Unlike lithium, this pioneering battery technology uses materials that are inherently safe. These next-gen battery cells can't explode or catch fire, even under extreme conditions. In all of the stress testing, gas leak, and nail puncture tests, these cells beat every other cell tested.A new investment that can redefine your future.The company behind this revolutionary next-gen battery is an early-stage battery upstart called Next Thing Technologies. And they recently opened a new funding round to allow anyone like yourself to invest in their technology platform.That means you can invest in the next-gen battery right now. This technology can be so disruptive, it's poised to transform how we power our lives. While the company's flagship home storage battery is just the start, these next-gen battery modules are set to transform not just homes, but everything from data centers… to commercial buildings… to the utilities themselves!


Click here to invest in Next Thing Technologies and their mission for safer and more affordable energy storage for all.Reasons to consider investing in early-stage companies: Potential for returns: First of all, private companies may provide the opportunity for greater a return on investment than public companies. Their valuations often increase as they grow and scale, resulting in potentially higher gains for early investors before they reach the public market.Early access to innovations: Secondly, investing in early-stage companies allows you to support groundbreaking ideas and technologies. Oftentimes, these technologies have the potential to fundamentally change the market landscape of the competition. And with disruptive potential, comes disruptive value creation.Diversification: Lastly, if you are already invested in the stock market, early-stage companies offer new exposure to new companies in industries like technology or green energy that you can't access as easily in the public markets.Next Thing Technologies says it fits those three criteria perfectly. And the company has already raised more than $6 million and counting. To date, they've made progress in five generations of testing commercial-grade battery cells. Now, they're taking everything they've learned from all the previous tests and creating their latest generation module as well as a residential prototype.As a result, they intend to produce units in as little as 18 months. So there's never been a better time to invest in their innovative technology platform.With an investment of $1,500, you can join thousands who have already backed this solution to our looming lithium-dependence crisis, and play a pivotal role in the shifting landscape of a massive industry.

78,A Guide to Penny Stocks — From a Day Trader's Perspective,"Dec 22, 2023",Ross Cameron,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/penny-stocks-from-a-day-traders-perspective/466664,"
It seems like a match made in heaven, right? Penny stocks can have amazing runs, and day traders are gamblers, right?Both are only sometimes true. Penny stocks do have several attractions:They've made some people wealthy in a hurry.Because investors can buy lots of shares cheaply, these stocks provide a special ego boost. (""Sorry I was late; I just bought 50,000 shares…."")The extremely low share price means you might be in on the ground floor of something that could theoretically grow to be the next household name. At one time, Ford Motor and Sirius XM were penny stocks.First, let's define what we're talking about. Though the SEC considers a penny stock to be anything trading under $5 per share, I go with the conventional definition: anything trading for less than $1.



Related: Why Do Penny Stocks Often Crash After Rallies?As for day traders, certainly, some of them are gamblers. If you only focus on the upside, you're a gambler. You are also one if you get your investment ideas from social media and not from how a stock is actually behaving at the moment.


I am a professional day trader and don't consider myself a gambler at all. I'm a hunter of volatility and a manager of risk. Although penny stocks might exhibit plenty of volatility, they are not my style for four reasons.1. Many penny stocks are thinly tradedIn other words, few shares switch hands on any given day. That is a major problem. I want to see lots of activity on a stock I'm trading. If I have a hard time finding a buyer for even 1,000 shares at a price I like, this is a problem. I look to trade stocks where many millions of shares change hands in a day.Related: How I Turned $583 into $10 Million by Day Trading 2. Few analysts follow penny stocksI don't follow analysts, but I like the thought of analysts scrutinizing the stocks I trade. Their opinions tend to get published widely, bringing attention to the stock. That attention brings not only liquidity but also scrutiny.


When Wall Street ignores a penny stock, I feel like it's easier for problems in a company to go unnoticed longer until they become existential. I don't want to be in a stock when the existential hits the fan.3. They have a higher magnitude of riskPenny stocks have a risk of going to zero. That's too rich for my blood. Because my average hold time is five minutes, when I get into a stock priced between $2 and $20, I do not consider all my money to be at risk. I'll be out of my position long before it reaches zero. In fact, before I ever place a trade, I calculate my exit point in case things go south. But in the Wild West that penny stocks inhabit, a position can indeed go to zero, fast.Related: Good Losers are Made — Not Born. 4 Principles for Cutting Your Losses Before It's Too Late4. Trading halts are way too commonAll stocks experience trading halts occasionally for several reasons: significant news might be pending, technical glitches, or after the stock price moves by 10% or more within five minutes, among other reasons.


Another type of halt that can happen on any stock — but is more common with penny stocks — is a ""T12"" halt. It happens when the exchange requests additional information from the company. This type of halt can last for weeks or even months and is often related to a pending government investigation. Because penny stocks are sometimes used for market manipulation and fraud, a penny stock that goes up 500% on no news could be at risk of being halted either pending news or on a T12. No thanks.I've made considerably more than 20,000 day trades. My style of day trading is not about the fundamentals of a given stock or my assessment of its short- and long-term prospects. It's about the fundamentals of human nature; more specifically, the nature of other traders who are looking at the same information that I am.I make money when I anticipate what they will do in the extreme short term (measured in minutes or even seconds), and I usually lose money when I am wrong.I have no interest in stocks that have the potential to move or ones that analysts gush over. I focus on stocks that are moving right now, in this very hour or minute. When traders put down their fresh cup of coffee in the morning and turn on their monitors, I'm focused on the stocks that are already at the top of the list of the biggest gainers. I'm focused on THE stock today.


Just as with everything else in life, such stocks follow the Pareto Principle. They get a disproportionate share of attention. Traders want in on a stock that other traders just rode up for a profit this morning. If they don't get in at first, then FOMO kicks in big time.Controlling emotions is the hardest part of successful day trading, even for seasoned pros.

79,Micron share price to benefit from multi-year memory upcycle,"Dec 22, 2023",Thomas Hughes,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/micron-share-price-to-benefit-from-multi-year-memory-upcycle/467484,"
Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) share prices have been higher yearly by analysts. The analysts predicted end-market normalization and a return to growth, confirmed by the FQ1 results. Now, the analysts are upping their targets again, and the trend will likely continue over the next year. Paraphrasing comments from analysts, Micron is in the earliest stages of a multi-year upcycle now amplified by AI. Because demand for AI is so tremendous and AI requires such a vast amount of memory, investors should expect the upcycle to be more vigorous and last longer than previous memory chip cycles.



Industry normalization drives results for Micron Micron had a good quarter, with demand for DRAM and NAND memory chips growing compared to last year. The company reported $4.73 billion in consolidated revenue for a gain of 15.6% compared to last year. The strength was driven by a 21% year-over-year (YOY) increase in DRAM, up 24% sequentially and an 11.5% increase in NAND. Strength was seen in computers and mobile with embedded up sequentially and YOY and storage down. Margin news is also good. The company continues to report GAAP and adjusted losses due to capex and deleveraging experienced in the prior year, but losses will end soon, and cash flow is improving. The company's operating cash flow improved by nearly 6x sequentially and 50% YOY, with capex also up. The salient point is that the 95 cents in adjusted losses are diminishing, and profits should return by the end of the year. 


Guidance is raised, AI is in the houseMicron raised its guidance for the year due to strength in computing and mobile, aided by demand for AI. The company sees increased demand for data center memory products to aid AI development and application, driving Q2 revenue to $5.3 billion or 44% compared to last year, and the forecast may be cautious. Micron also forecasts sequential fundamental improvement in financial metrics as revenue leverage returns. The takeaway is that revenue outpaces the consensus at the low end of the expected range, and the projected loss is less than half of the consensus figure.Because AI continues to show momentum and momentum should build in 2024, Micron will likely outperform in FQ2 and guide Q3 higher. Until then, executives forecasted a record TAM in F2025, suggesting a record year. The company is also expected to post more than $6 in profits in 2025, putting the forward P/E near 12x and deep value territory. Analysts raise targets, lead market to new highsThe analysts have provided a tailwind for Micron stock all year, which continues to blow. Marketbeat.com is tracking 14 fresh updates immediately following the FQ1 release, and 13 include price target increases. The single outlier is a reiterated Outperform from Wedbush’s Dan Ives, with a consensus-beating $95 price target. 


The consensus is $90 and implies a 7% upside after the post-release pop in pricing. The high target is $112, which will likely move higher soon. Regardless, the consensus figure is trending robustly higher and up 16% in December. Moving to the high end of the range would put the market well into all-time high territory, breaking above the dot.com bubble peak and setting the market up to continue higher. Technical outlook: Micron melting upThe price action in Micron gapped up on the news to advance more than 7% at the open, setting a multi-year high. The move may result in a pullback before higher prices, but higher prices are expected. The weekly and monthly charts are solid and show a market with bulls advancing from critical support levels with ample room to run. Assuming the company builds on its momentum, new highs will occur early in the 2024 calendar year.

82,Secure Your Funding — How Small Business Owners Can Level Up Their Negotiation Tactics With Venture Capitalists,"Dec 21, 2023",Avi Weisfogel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-small-business-owners-can-level-up-their-negotiation/465466,"
When small business owners are looking to secure investment from venture capitalists (VCs), they have to understand the accurate valuation of their business before they enter into negotiations. Otherwise, they end up asking for too much, and investors won't buy in, or they give away too much as a concession for getting financial backing. You don't need to let either of those unfortunate scenarios happen to you.Instead of guessing and hoping, you must be prepared to negotiate based on honest and accurate information. Even if your business is very small or you're new to the business world, you don't need to be intimidated when working with venture capitalists. Understanding your company's strengths and knowing how to address its weaknesses can take you a long way toward success.Choosing the right venture capital opportunitiesOne important negotiating tip is to make sure you're choosing negotiations with the right people. In other words, be selective about your opportunities. You don't want to send a mass email to many VCs, hoping someone will take interest. If you do that and get replies, it could be that they're trying to take advantage and think that you're desperate. Instead, target only a handful of venture capitalists who are a good fit for your needs and have helped companies like yours before.



Study your options for venture capital and the people who typically support businesses like yours. Look for VCs who work within your industry or who are focused on helping small businesses that are similar in size to what you have. When you find the right people, negotiating with them becomes much easier because you understand one another and have more common interests and goals. Then, you can both see the value of working with one another.Related: 8 Key Factors VCs Consider When Evaluating Startup Opportunities


Options for venture capital you should considerIt's essential to consider more than one option or offer if you can. It's not just the VCs you work with that matters, but also what they give you. Getting additional money to grow your business is essential, but there are other aspects of business development. There are many different ways that a venture capitalist could bring further and ongoing value to your company.If there are other areas where your business needs support, don't be afraid to ask. Some VCs may have connections, offer mentorship or provide additional value beyond cash. Consider these options and if they can help your business succeed. If they're better than an influx of money only, they might be suitable for your needs. Ideally, you can get cash and other perks, but that depends on the person you're working with and what they're willing to offer.Focus on post-investment processesBefore making any deal for venture capital, make sure you're clear on the decision-making processes that will occur post-investment and what level of control you'll retain. In other words, you only want to agree to work with a VC that will buy your business out and take it over if that's what you're specifically looking for. Getting your questions answered in this area is extremely important.You should negotiate this area carefully because too many small business owners get caught up in the idea of earning money to help their business, and they agree to conditions that only benefit them in the short run. Some need to read the contract carefully, or they aren't willing to ask for more because they fear losing what's offered. That is your business, so make sure you know what trade-offs you're agreeing to.


Remember that value-add is part of the equationWhile the financial backing venture capitalists can bring is highly important, there is a value-added beyond that capital. Working with the right venture capitalists brings you additional opportunities that could be even more significant than the money they'll invest. When negotiating with a VC, ensure you know what matters to you and why your business is worth investing in. That can help you get a ""yes"" from the right investor.

Entrepreneur Elevator Pitch is the show where contestants get into an elevator and have just 60 seconds to pitch their business to our board of investors. In this ongoing article series, we're celebrating the entrepreneurs who walked out with a win and sharing their tips for pitching success. (Answers have been edited for length.)If you've ever dreamed of creating your own video game but don't have a clue about coding, Mariam Nusrat's company Breshna.io is built for you. Mariam recently appeared on ""Elevator Pitch"" to discuss her simple creation platform and walked out with a $100K investment from Jonathan Hung. ""Our platform creates games with no code, at zero cost and at lightning speed!"" she told Entrepreneur. ""So think about a math teacher — she can make a run-and-catch game where students are catching even numbers and dodging odd numbers and having a blast. It's like the Canva for purposeful games.""Watch her winning pitch below, then read on to learn how she prepped to score big on the show.How did you prepare for your shot on ""Elevator Pitch""?



I was super pumped about the chance to share my big idea with the ultra-cool celebrity judges and was determined to make every moment count. So, I did what any eager entrepreneur would do—I practically etched that 60-second pitch into my brain. I wrote it out, practiced it, and recited it like a mantra, whether I was getting ready in the morning, sneaking in some practice during lunch breaks, or going over it while brushing my teeth before bed. I also went all Sherlock Holmes on the judges, checking out their investment preferences, and things that excite them. Marc Randolph loves talking about repeatable scalable business models, Kim is all about execution, and Jonathan and I both are London School of Economics alum!Related: Can You Recover From Blowing an Investor Pitch? Yes, Here's How.What did you think was going to happen? What was different from your expectations?Going into the show, I was particularly enthusiastic about the elevator pitch. I love public speaking; I've done two TEDX talks and even shared the stage with President Clinton. It was a pleasant surprise to see just how much I could squeeze into a 60-second pitch – it's actually a lot!


The real surprise, though, was the boardroom negotiations. It was a rollercoaster of emotions. I was both excited and nervous, and honestly, I didn't expect it to be so much fun. It was like a wild ride, and I found myself loving every minute of it.Why do you think they opened the doors?I believe the judges decided to open the boardroom doors for me because our traction and progress in the last two years spoke volumes about our commitment, capital efficiency and the massive opportunity that Breshna.io presents. The user growth and fundraising success we had achieved was hard to ignore, and I think that piqued their interest. And last, I have a hunch that my energy and enthusiasm during the 60-second pitch played a role. Sometimes, it's not just about the numbers. It's about the jockey, not just the horse, and I think they liked what they saw.Would you do anything differently during the negotiating process?


The negotiations were a big highlight for me. When the elevator doors opened into the boardroom, I had to pinch myself to make sure it wasn't all an amazing dream! Jonathan asked my favorite question about the meaning of the name Breshna. it means ""lightning"" in the Pashto language, my mother tongue and aligns with our mission of empowering users to make video games at lightning speed!Related: New Entrepreneur Podcast Offers Inside Secrets on How to Pitch InvestorsThe majority of our boardroom negotiations revolved around the deal terms, mainly because our valuation stood out as higher than that of most companies featured on the show. I rationalized this valuation by pointing to our impressive fundraising track record and the momentum we'd gained, and our potential to become a ""decacorn"" in the UGC gaming industry. I gratefully accepted Jonathan's offer of a $100,000 investment at a $40 million valuation.What do you plan to do with your investment?


With 27 months of runway, we are not pressed for funding, but the investment will allow us to double down on our scalable and cost-efficient GTM channels, and solidify our position at the intersection of no-code content creation, metaverse and AI. Over the next two quarters, we plan to blitzscale user growth and launch an AI-powered text-to-game engine, BreshnaBlitz, and a carnival-themed metaverse, Breshnaverse. This funding will also allow us to unlock opportunities for our community to join our journey, not just as empowered content creators of the platform but also as investors. Click here to learn more about our equity crowdfunding.What did it mean to you personally to get in the doors and walk out with a win?Getting through those doors and emerging with a win meant the world to me on a personal level. As a female founder, I was well aware of the odds stacked against us in the venture capital world, where only 2% of women receive funding. Walking through those doors and securing a deal on the show is an immense source of motivation and validation.It was not just a win for me, but a victory for my co-founder and brother, Rizwan Nusrat, and our entire team. It is a testament to their hard work and dedication. It also highlighted the unwavering support of our investors and underscored the massive opportunity that Breshna.io presents. This win wasn't just about a deal; it was about breaking barriers and making strides in an industry that needs more diversity and inclusivity. This show, with its visibility and Jonathan's backing, brought us one step closer to our goal of empowering the next 100 million people to tell their stories through video games.


Related: How to Create a Winning Elevator Pitch for Your AppWhat is your advice for anyone thinking of applying to be on a future episode?Recognize that this is an incredible opportunity and treat it with the utmost seriousness. Be intentional in crafting your pitch, commit it to memory, carefully consider your demo table setup, choose attire that boosts your confidence, and practice extensively. The key is thorough preparation, so invest the time and effort necessary to make the most of this chance.Also fun tip: When rehearsing your pitch, ensure the timer counts down from 60 to 0 instead of the other way around, starting from 0 and going to 60. I made the mistake of practicing with a stopwatch that began at 0, and it threw me off when the timer went in the opposite direction.

84,How Much Momentum Is Left in These Promising Software Stocks?,"Dec 21, 2023",Dipanjan Banchur,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/how-much-momentum-is-left-in-these-promising-software/467362,"
Digital transformation initiatives, the shift to cloud-based solutions, and the adoption of emerging technologies like generative AI are expected to bolster the software industry’s growth. Therefore, it could be wise to take advantage of the momentum in fundamentally strong software stocks SAP SE (SAP), DocuSign (DOCU), and Sapiens International (SPNS). Let’s discuss….Continued digital transformation initiatives and a growing shift to cloud platforms are amplifying the demand for software solutions. Moreover, the integration of advanced technologies like generative AI into software applications should bolster the software industry’s prospects.Amid this backdrop, it could be wise to buy fundamentally strong software stocks SAP SE (SAP), DocuSign, Inc. (DOCU), and Sapiens International Corporation N.V. (SPNS). These stocks have been showing strong momentum lately and will likely maintain the same in the near term.



Before diving deeper into the fundamentals of these stocks, let’s discuss what’s shaping the software industry’s prospects.Technology stocks faced the brunt of rising interest rates last year. However, the industry made a rousing comeback, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rising 41.2% year-to-date. The rally has been fueled by the hype around generative AI and the Federal Reserve’s signal of rate cuts next year.


The Fed maintained its benchmark interest rate between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest in 22 years. However, the central bank signaled that it would likely cut interest rates by 75 basis points next year, up from its previous forecast of 50 basis points. Falling interest rates will likely boost the performance of growth stocks, including the ones from the software space.The software industry plays a crucial role in the functioning of various sectors. The industry helps drive innovation, improve efficiency, and power digital transformation. Software spending is projected to grow 12.9% over the prior year to $916.24 billion this year and 13.8% year-over-year to $1.04 trillion in 2024.Traditional software applications have been replaced by cloud-based software applications, which provide advances like data ownership, flexibility, scalability, accessibility, security and privacy. Rising digitization initiatives are leading to a surge in demand for cloud-based software applications. The global Software as a Service (SaaS) market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 18.7% to reach $908.21 billion by 2030.In the 2024 Gartner CIO and Technology Executive Survey, 80% of CIOs reported that they plan to increase cyber/information security spending in 2024. CIOs are also focusing on investing in Business Intelligence/data analytics and cloud platforms, with 78% and 73% of CIOs expressing interest in increasing spending on these technologies, respectively.


Additionally, the integration of generative AI into software applications will further enhance the software industry’s long-term growth prospects. Goldman Sachs estimates that the total addressable market (TAM) of the generative AI software is approximately $150 billion.Investors’ interest in software stocks is evident from the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF’s (IGV) 56.8% returns year-to-date.Let's take a closer look at their fundamentals.SAP SE (SAP)

85,3 A-Rated Oil &amp; Gas Stocks to Buy for December,"Dec 21, 2023",Sristi Suman Jayaswal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/3-a-rated-oil-amp-gas-stocks-to-buy-for-december/467359,"
The energy sector is capitalizing on a robust demand, augmented by an escalation in domestic gas utilization. Therefore, quality oil and gas stocks Martin Midstream Partners L.P. (MMLP), CrossAmerica Partners LP (CAPL), and Star Group, L.P. (SGU) could be solid buys for December. Also, these stocks are A-rated (Strong Buy) in our proprietary rating system. Read more….Rising global oil and gas demand, coupled with diminishing supply, may trigger a price surge, thereby providing considerable stimulus to the energy sector. Amid this backdrop, it could be wise to buy fundamentally strong oil and gas stocks Martin Midstream Partners L.P. (MMLP), CrossAmerica Partners LP (CAPL), and Star Group, L.P. (SGU). These stocks are rated – A (Strong Buy) in our proprietary POWR Ratings system.Although the shift toward renewable energy is gaining momentum, world oil consumption continues to rise. The world oil demand will ascend by 2.3 million barrels per day (mb/d), reaching 101.7 mb/d by 2023. For 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) raised global oil demand to 930,000 bpd.



The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects global liquid fuel consumption to increase by 1.8 million b/d in 2023 and by 1.3 million b/d in 2024. Most of the anticipated growth in liquid fuel demand is projected in non-OECD Asia, predominantly driven by China and India.Forecasts indicate milder temperatures until December 23. Nevertheless, traditional cooling trends could stimulate augmented U.S. gas demand across the Lower 48 states, including export demands.


OPEC has been curbing supplies since late 2022 to stabilize the oil market. Despite declining oil prices, the group remains ""cautiously optimistic"" concerning oil market trends for 2024. OPEC+ has revealed voluntary output cuts of about 2.2 million barrels per day throughout the first quarter of 2024. The escalating demand juxtaposed with tightened supplies could lead to a price rise.Oil prices have exhibited an upward trend recently following global shipping companies' decision to circumvent the Red Sea due to heightened security concerns, leading to a temporary cessation of services in the Bab el Mandeb strait. This key maritime checkpoint is a gateway to the Suez Canal and facilitates approximately 12% of global trade, including a significant proportion of international oil commerce. An escalation in this situation could propel oil prices further.The U.S. EIA anticipates the Brent crude oil spot price to ascend from an average of $78 per barrel in December to around $84 per barrel in the first half of 2024, partly stimulated by recently declared OPEC+ production reductions. The Brent spot price is expected to average $83/b in 2024.With these favorable trends in mind, let's delve into the fundamentals of the top three MLPs - Oil & Gas stock picks, beginning with the third choice.Stock #3: Martin Midstream Partners L.P.

FedEx (NYSE: FDX), a global leader in the transportation and logistics sector, has been surrounded by unexpected turbulence in recent months. The once reliable delivery giant stumbled in its second quarter, missing analyst expectations and sending its stock price into a tailspin. This unexpected detour has raised concerns about the company's future trajectory and prompted investors to re-evaluate their positions.Facing headwinds: Why FedEx is stallingFedEx's recent stumbles cannot be attributed to one factor. Instead, forces have conspired to create a perfect storm, delaying the delivery giant's progress. Economic uncertainty poses a significant challenge. Weaker global economic growth has dampened demand for shipping services, for consumer goods and business-to-business transactions. This slowdown directly impacts FedEx's top line, making it difficult to achieve revenue targets.



Competition within the delivery landscape has intensified. Established players like United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE: UPS) and Deutsche Post AG (OTCMKTS: DHLGY) remain formidable rivals. At the same time, the emergence of agile e-commerce fulfillment specialists has chipped away at FedEx's market share. This competitive pressure squeezes margins and forces the company to innovate and adapt to stay relevant.Unveiling the numbers: FedEx's financial healthUnderstanding FedEx's recent struggles requires a close examination of its financial health. Year-over-year growth has dipped into negative territory, marking a worrying trend. While this decline stems partly from broader economic headwinds, it also reflects FedEx’s growing competitive landscape within the delivery space.


Earnings per share (EPS) presents a mixed picture. While some quarters have produced modest growth, overall performance has met analyst expectations. This inconsistency in EPS numbers underscores the volatility the company is currently facing.Profit margins, a crucial indicator of operational efficiency, also need clearer direction. Some segments have maintained decent margins, while others have seen concerning erosion. This uneven performance suggests internal challenges and disparities in response to external pressures.Debt levels, however, remain within a manageable range. The debt-to-equity ratio, a measure of financial risk, hasn't breached any significant thresholds. This provides some buffer for the company as it navigates its current difficulties.Trends emerge that raise further questions. Capital expenditure, historically a driver of growth, has shown signs of restraint. This could be a strategic move to weather the storm or indicate a lack of confidence in future growth prospects.


Furthermore, comparing FedEx's performance to industry benchmarks reveals a worrying gap. Rivals like UPS and DHL have managed to navigate the same economic climate with greater financial stability. This highlights the need for FedEx to identify and address its specific vulnerabilities.Should you hold tight or hit the brakes? The question swirling around FedEx isn't merely ""What went wrong?"" but ""Where do we go from here?"" For investors, navigating the company's turbulent present requires carefully assessing analyst opinion, market conditions, and potential returns.Analyst ranks present a spectrum of perspectives. Some remain cautiously optimistic, highlighting the company's strong brand recognition and potential for strategic maneuvers. Others have issued downgrades, expressing concerns about slowing revenue growth and the intensifying competitive landscape. Target prices for the stock range widely, reflecting the volatility and uncertainty surrounding FedEx's future trajectory.Beyond analyst sentiments, the broader transportation and logistics market paints a complex picture. While e-commerce growth offers a silver lining, the global economic slowdown casts a shadow. Rising fuel costs and potential labor unrest further add to the challenges. These macroeconomic factors undoubtedly impact FedEx's cost structure and demand for its services, demanding careful consideration by investors.


Ripple effects and road to recoveryFedEx's current struggles are not merely an isolated case of corporate turbulence. As a significant player in the global transportation and logistics sector, the company's performance holds significance for the broader economic landscape. FedEx's stumbles act as a bellwether for overall economic health. Its dependence on international trade and business activity makes it sensitive to shifts in global economic sentiment. Weak performance can indicate a broader economic slowdown, potentially impacting investor confidence and consumer spending across various sectors. For example, a decline in demand for shipping services could negatively affect manufacturers, retailers and logistics providers linked to the global supply chain.The implications for other businesses extend beyond direct financial impact. A struggling FedEx might implement cost-cutting measures, potentially affecting employment within the transportation and logistics sector. Additionally, its current challenges could further intensify competition in the delivery space as rivals vie for a larger share of a potentially shrinking market.Several scenarios hold promise for future improvement. A recovery in the global economy, driven by factors like policy interventions or easing inflation, could reignite demand for shipping services and boost FedEx's revenue. Additionally, the company's continued investment in innovative technologies like automation and AI could lead to cost reductions and enhanced service offerings, fostering a competitive edge.


Although FedEx's recent troubles have raised questions about its future, their ramifications go beyond the company itself. Its performance reflects the broader health of the economy, and its future path could have an impact on a variety of industries. A more comprehensive picture considers the possibility of a comeback, driven by both external factors and internal strategic changes. For investors and stakeholders alike, navigating this complicated situation requires a close eye on both the headwinds and tailwinds that could influence FedEx's journey ahead.

87,AAR (AIR) Earnings Watch: Is This Defense Stock a Golden Opportunity?,"Dec 20, 2023",Mangeet Kaur Bouns,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/aar-air-earnings-watch-is-this-defense-stock-a-golden/467282,"
AAR (AIR) seems well-poised for robust growth in the long run due to strong demand for its parts and services offerings among commercial aviation, government, and defense markets, but fierce competition, regulatory risks, and low profitability reflect uncertainty around its near-term prospects. As AIR is set to release its second-quarter results tomorrow, let’s find out if it is an opportune time to invest in this defense stock. Read on….AAR Corp. (AIR), a provider of aerospace and defense aftermarket solutions to commercial and government operators, MROs, and OEMs globally, is set to release financial results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2024, which ended November 30, 2023, after the NYSE trading session close on Thursday, December 21, 2023.Analysts expect the company’s revenue and EPS for the fiscal 2024 second quarter to increase 18.9% and 15.6% year-over-year to $558.65 million and $0.80, respectively. Moreover, AIR topped the consensus revenue and EPS estimates in the last reported quarter.



The aviation services company posted first-quarter sales of $549.70 million, beating analysts’ expectations of $507.26 million. This is compared to $446.30 million in the same period of 2022. AIR witnessed solid growth across all its commercial activities.In particular, AIR’s Parts Supply revenue rose 40% year-over-year due to investments made in previous quarters in expectation of strong demand. In addition, in Repair & Engineering, the company’s hangers were primarily full throughout the summer and flight hours continued to recover worldwide, which drove growth in Integrated Solutions.


Furthermore, the company’s EPS came in at $0.78, compared to the consensus estimate of $0.69 and up 27.9% year-over-year.“We are proud to have delivered another quarter of year over year sales growth and record first quarter adjusted earnings.  Our commercial businesses are capitalizing on the favorable aftermarket trends and we expect that to continue in the quarters to come,” said John M. Holmes, Chairman, President and CEO of AAR Corp.“We believe our pipeline of commercial and government opportunities, our strong balance sheet, and our ability to execute quickly will drive further growth across our parts and services offerings,” Homes concluded.However, the company could face regulatory and industry-wide challenges. A significant portion of AIR’s revenue comes from government contracts, making the company vulnerable to changes in government expenditure and budget allocations. Also, it operates in a very competitive market, facing rigid competition from large aviation and defense companies and smaller industry players.


Shares of AIR have gained 7.7% over the past month and 30.8% over the past six months to close the last trading session at $72.28. Also, the stock has gained 62.1% over the past year.Here are the factors that could affect AIR’s performance in the near term:Positive Recent DevelopmentsOn December 11, AIR added distribution support of select Woodward, Inc. parts under its Supplier Capability Contact with DLA Aviation. Under this multiple-year deal, AAR Corp. will supply DLA with spare parts from Woodward’s fuel control product family.


AAR will offer comprehensive and integrated supply chain management support and perform associated functions to maximize the parts availability to DLA. Last year, AIR was the first non-OEM to be awarded the 20-year base Supplier Capabilities Contract with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), forming a strategic relationship to offer global supply chain support to the DOD and U.S. allies.On December 7, AIR signed an agreement to extend the company’s existing airframe MRO services with Alaska Airlines through 2030 and expand its heavy maintenance partnership. The company has been committed to growing its dedicated airframe narrowbody capacity to provide Alaska Airlines with a minimum of six lines of maintenance support.To support this, AAR Corp. plans to add a new three-bay hangar adjacent to its existing seven-bay facility at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City, pending final approval by the Oklahoma City Airport Trust. The proposed new hanger will offer AAR an additional 85,000 square feet of MRO space to accommodate all 737 variants.Mixed Financials

However, the company’s earnings from continued operations have declined at a CAGR of 3.9% over the same period.Favorable Analyst EstimatesAnalysts expect AIR’s revenue for the fiscal year (ending May 2024) to come in at $2.29 billion, indicating an increase of 15.2% year-over-year. The consensus EPS estimate of $3.45 for the ongoing year reflects a 20.6% year-over-year improvement. Also, the company has surpassed the consensus revenue and EPS estimates in all four trailing quarters.For the fiscal year 2025, the company’s revenue and EPS are expected to grow 5.6% and 22.4% year-over-year to $2.42 billion and $4.22, respectively.Mixed ValuationIn terms of forward EV/Sales, AIR is currently trading at 1.22x, 33.3% lower than the industry average of 1.83x.

Also, its forward EV/EBIT multiple of 17.06 is 4.1% higher than the industry average of 16.40.Decelerating Profitability


AIR’s trailing-12-month gross profit margin of 18.60% is 39% lower than the 30.49% industry average. Moreover, the stock’s trailing-12-month EBITDA margin and net income margin of 7.91% and 3.19% compared unfavorably to the respective industry averages of 13.72% and 6.09%.Furthermore, the stock’s trailing-12-month ROCE, ROTC, and ROTA of 6.12%, 6.35%, and 3.42% are lower than the industry averages of 12.30%, 7.09%, and 4.99%, respectively.

88,"Roblox: Building a Gaming Empire, Brick by Brick","Dec 19, 2023",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/roblox-building-a-gaming-empire-brick-by-brick/467211,"
Roblox (NYSE: RBLX) is an online platform that has seen a meteoric rise in popularity, attracting significant attention from investors. Think back to when you were a child and played with Legos. Now imagine a virtual world made entirely of them, where you can not only play but also create experiences, share them with friends, and even make money. News about Roblox has been in the spotlight lately for its aggressive financial goals and as the defendant in a lawsuit. Let’s take a closer look at Roblox and see what is happening with the online block-building empire.Building your own playgroundRoblox isn't just a game it is a thriving online platform that empowers users to create, play, and connect in a dynamic virtual world. Roblox offers a malleable canvas where anyone, from casual enthusiasts to experienced developers, can unleash their creativity and build interactive experiences spanning genres like obstacle courses, role-playing adventures, social hangouts, and even educational simulations.



This user-generated content (UGC) ecosystem lies at the heart of Roblox's appeal. The intuitive Roblox Studio building tool democratizes development, making it accessible even to novices and fostering diverse experiences for players to explore. Roblox transcends simple entertainment, transforming into a vibrant social hub where friends can collaborate, chat, and express themselves through customizable avatars adorned with virtual accessories.But Roblox's allure extends beyond its creative and social aspects. It has a robust virtual economy fueled by the in-platform Robux currency. This in-platform currency unlocks monetization opportunities for both players and creators. Robux purchases empower players to enhance their avatars, access exclusive content, and support their favorite developers through virtual tipping. On the other hand, creators can leverage Robux as a revenue stream by charging entry fees for their experiences or selling virtual items within them.


A stock on the riseAfter a period of turbulence, Roblox has sparked renewed investor interest with a series of positive developments. Analysts are singing a different tune, issuing upgrades and increasing price targets due to improvements in its financial performance. The company is demonstrating more assertive fiscal discipline by curtailing expenditures, paving the way for potential near-term profitability. Several funds, including the Schwab Charitable Fund are growing their holdings in Roblox.Management has laid out ambitious growth plans, targeting robust user expansion and margin improvement over the next few years. This clear vision for the platform's future success is resonating with investors. With big investors shifting from net selling to net buying of RBLX shares in recent quarters, there's a palpable increase in institutional confidence in the platform's potential.Unlike many ""metaverse"" companies that faded quickly, Roblox isn’t dead. The company stands out in the entertainment sector because of its established platform, dedicated user base, and diverse monetization channels. This focus on tangible strengths attracts investor interest beyond mere trend-chasing.While challenges remain, including legal matters and a competitive landscape, Roblox's recent developments have undoubtedly piqued investor interest. The platform's evolving financial narrative, clear growth plans, and rising institutional backing suggest a potential turning point for RBLX, warranting close attention from investors looking for promising opportunities in the digital entertainment space.


Building Blocks for the FutureWhile Roblox has experienced significant growth in recent years, the company faces a number of challenges. One challenge is competition from established gaming giants such as Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA). These companies have a large user base and a deep library of games, which makes it difficult for Roblox to compete with them. New virtual world platforms such as Fortnite and Minecraft are also emerging as competitors, which could further erode Roblox's market share.Another challenge is the need to optimize the mobile experience. Roblox is primarily a PC-based platform, but mobile gaming is becoming increasingly popular. If Roblox wants to reach a wider audience, it needs to make sure that its mobile experience is top-notch.Roblox is facing a shareholder lawsuit alleging revenue manipulation. The lawsuit claims that Roblox overstated its revenue by inflating the value of Robux, which is the in-game currency that users can purchase. If the lawsuit is successful, it could damage Roblox's reputation and make it more difficult for the company to raise capital in the future.Despite these obstacles, Roblox’s solid foundation of strong fundamentals, engaged user base, and strategic focus will allow it to navigate these challenges and achieve future success. The platform’s ability to continuously innovate, maintain its competitive edge, and address user needs while diversifying its offerings will ultimately determine its continued trajectory.

91,"Now hiring: suddenly, jobs are going to these healthcare stocks","Dec 18, 2023",Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/now-hiring-suddenly-jobs-are-going-to-these-healthcare/467150,"
Markets have been swinging between bearish and bullish territory in the past few quarters, driven by similar bounces between the upper and lower bounds of the U.S. economy. You see, 2023 saw heightened fears surrounding rate hikes and their pending effects; now, just the opposite is happening.Now that the FED is turning more dovish than before, even pointing to six rate cuts coming in 2024, markets have rallied in the past week. However, some wonder why the FED would be looking to cut rates? Are they expecting a significant downturn ahead to make them choose this strategy?



Hence, the sideways market you are in; one thing is for sure, however, a bulk of economic activity - and investment dollars - is headed to the medical stocks space. Names like Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Merck & Co. (NYSE: MRK), and Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) are being rewarded by markets today for reasons that will become obvious in just a bit.Amazing recovery According to the latest employment situation reports, better known as the NFP (non-farm payrolls), the United States economy added 199 thousand jobs last month. MarketBeat has done the homework to bring you an in-depth look as to where the bulk of employment have been headed; here's the answer:


99 thousand jobs moved into the healthcare sector, which is 49.7% of the total jobs added! What this means for you is that if the industry is seeking higher employment prospects, you bet your bottom dollar that profits and business activity are making their way there, too.And it makes sense when you think about it. Suppose the market is still determining why or how the FED will start implementing another wave of 'quantitative easing.' In that case, employers and investors will bet on a safe space, and healthcare is one of those sectors that will always be here to carry the weight.But, as great investors always say, a story without numbers is just a fairytale, and investing based on numbers alone is basing your wealth's fate on a spreadsheet. So, now that the numbers are in and carry a reasonable story behind them, it is time for you to check whether markets agree.Starting with analyst estimates, especially those regarding earnings per share growth projections in the next twelve months, the industry is shooting for an average growth rate pushing into the 11.8% level.


Knowing what you know now, you can use this growth benchmark to pick and choose the gems of the industry that are set to blow these averages out of the water and bring you the price action needed to make serious returns.Checklist Picking and choosing can start with Pfizer, the smallest of the three in this list, small being $162.5 billion. Analysts have released their bold estimates for EPS growth at 46.1% in the next twelve months, which is 290.1% above the industry's average growth.With this in mind, it should be no surprise that these same analysts have landed on a consensus price target of $40.3 a share for this stock. Proving these targets right would require the stock to rally by as much as 48.4% from today's prices.But wait, there's more. Because this stock is trading at 49.0% of its 52-week high prices, making it the worst performer in the space, management comes to reiterate how undervalued the stock is by paying you 6.0% in an annualized dividend yield, which simply beats inflation and the 10-year treasury yield.


This is a tough act to follow, but rest assured the rest of the list carries its own set of explosive marks. Merck analysts are expecting EPS to grow by 522.6% over the next twelve months; the math is just too crazy to explain how high above the industry average this one is.With a $125.1 price target, there is still a double-digit upside from today's prices in this stock as well, to the tune of 16.9%. You can now see how following the money (jobs) can pay off in terms of wealth building.Last but not least, you have Eli Lilly to worry about. For this household name, analysts see EPS jumping by 92.1% over the next year, multiples higher than the industry average. So there you have it; if upside momentum is essential to you, you may want to stick with Eli Lilly, considering it trades at 95.0% of its 52-week high. But if, instead, dividend income and value are at the top of your checklist, you know that Pfizer is a better watchlist candidate.


Either way, jobs are going to the space, and so is the money, so choose wisely.

With the global demand for oil and natural gas soaring and tightened supplies instigating high oil and gas prices, the energy sector’s outlook appears robust.

However, customary cooling patterns might stimulate increased U.S. gas demand within the Lower 48 states, including export demands.The U.S. is on the brink of surpassing Australia and Qatar to become the leading global LNG supplier by 2023. Escalating oil prices, distribution interruptions, and sanctions related to the ongoing Ukraine conflict have magnified the international demand for U.S. exports.

The persistent surge in technological innovation is fueling a steady demand for high-speed and more advanced products, propelling the tech sector forward. Therefore, let’s explore whether to buy or hold tech stocks Infosys (INFY), EchoStar Corporation (SATS), and Stratasys (SSYS) for 2024. Read on….After an uncharacteristically sluggish performance in 2022, tech stocks have staged a robust rebound in 2023. This revival may be attributed to the escalating dependence of corporations on advanced technological solutions and expeditious digital metamorphosis anticipated to fuel industry expansion.Upon careful analysis, I believe tech stocks EchoStar Corporation (SATS) and Stratasys Ltd. (SSYS) could be solid buys now, given their robust growth trajectory and promising profitability. Conversely, waiting for a better entry point in Infosys Limited (INFY) might be prudent.



Amid swift digital transformation, technological innovations enhance convenience and accessibility within our living spaces. These advancements herald substantial opportunities for growth as previously expensive or seemingly unreachable services are now easily obtainable in sectors like healthcare, automotive, and real estate.Entering 2024, the tech industry's prospects appear promising due to cooling inflation, predicted interest rate cuts, and heightened consumer spending dynamics. The industry is thriving and continues to be a high-performing market player this year, evident from Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLK) impressive 54% year-to-date gain.


The industry owes its vehement expansion to the broad-based adoption of cutting-edge technologies, including AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR&VR), 5G, and machine learning by businesses and individuals worldwide.As per Gartner, Inc.’s (IT), global IT spending is set to touch the $5.10 trillion mark by 2024, indicating an 8% annual rise. The ubiquitous need for digital transformation across numerous industries propels this colossal surge in IT expenditure.As businesses consistently aim to maximize their investments in technology, the forthcoming years will likely witness substantial growth in the IT sector. The global IT services market is expected to reach $4910.4 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 8%.The global 3D printing industry is expected to reach $105.99 billion by 2028, growing at a 24.9% CAGR.

94,Stock Trading Plan AFTER the Fed Meeting,"Dec 16, 2023",Steve Reitmeister,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/stock-trading-plan-after-the-fed-meeting/467071,"
If you were to ask Chairman Powell if there is a “dovish tilt” by the Fed who would say emphatically no. That is because they are open to raising rates again if needed. However there is ample reason for investors to call his bluff given numerous facts in hand that say inflation coming down...rate hikes over...and time to plan for rate cuts in the year ahead. As such the S&P 500 (SPY) sprinted to new highs above 4,700. What happens next? And how can stock investors outperform? That is what investment pro Steve Reitmeister covers in his latest market commentary that includes a preview of his top 13 picks for today’s market. Read on below for more.Investors enjoyed one of the best possible outcomes from the 12/13 Fed meeting. That being a clear dovish tilt in their language pushing the S&P 500 (SPY) to new highs on the year.As per usual, Chairman Powell played up the flexibility the Fed needs and they “could” raise rates again. But that was fairly hollow when the updated dot plot from Fed officials showed no more rate hikes on the way and 3 rate cuts in the year ahead. With that stocks pressed on the gas pedal to further accentuate the bull run that started after the 11/1 Fed meeting.



Let’s review the key details from the Fed announcement and what that means for our investment plans in the weeks and months ahead.Market Commentary


Even before the Fed took center stage on Wednesday we already got good news from the PPI report that morning further pointing out the improvements in the fight against inflation. Core PPI is now down to the Fed target at 2% while the full PPI reading is even more tame at only +0.9%.Remember that PPI is the leading indicator of what shows up in the readings more vital to the Fed like CPI and PCE. So, this bodes well for lower readings in the future...and the Fed feeling confident to in following through on their dovish language tilt with the actual lowering of rates.The above did not factor into the Fed announcement that afternoon at 2pm ET...but did prove that the Fed does see many of these positive developments in place. Holding rates steady was a given. But what got stocks off to the races, and bond yields moving even lower, was Fed expectations for 3 rate cuts in 2024 and another 4 in 2025.Most know that the Fed typically understates these plans to give themselves some wiggle room to change course if needed. The simple fact that there is less talk of hikes...and more talks of cuts, tells you that the Fed has very likely managed a soft landing for the economy this cycle.


It is interesting to see how investors changed their outlook from the FedWatch tool from the CME. This is where they measure how investors are weighing the odds of rates in the future.The next Fed meeting is set for January 31, 2024. Only a month ago odds of a rate cut were nearly non-existent at 2% probability. That has spiked to 21% as of today with this fresh information in hand.Even more revealing is the 82% odds of a rate cut for the March 20, 2024 meeting. Some even thinking it could be a half point cut.When you appreciate the above information...and how that would be a catalyst for the economy and earnings growth...then you understand why stocks have rallied so hard on this dovish tilt from the Fed.


HOWEVER, I do think that expectations do need to be tempered for the future. That’s because much of that positive chain reaction for stocks is already showing up in current share prices. This fits under the well understood concept that investors make their selections today based upon what they expect 4-6 months down the road.This also matches with what I shared in my 2024 Stock Market Outlook presentation where I discuss the likely continuation of the bull market in the year ahead. Yet where the path to stock market gains will be very different than 2023.Meaning that blindly putting money in just mega cap tech stocks is overplayed and that group will underperform in the year ahead. Instead, the 4 year advantage for large caps over small caps should end with the latter finally taking the lead.This overdue and healthy rotation has already been present since this recent bull run began in early November. And was further accentuated on the Wednesday rally when the Russell 2000 rose +3.52% versus +1.37% for the S&P 500.


Thursday was more of the same with the small caps in the Russell 2000 adding on another +2.72% once again far outpacing the large cap centric S&P 500 at only +0.26% on the day.I expect this small stock advantage to continue to play out in 2024. Perhaps not as pronounced as what you see above...but they should outperform by a good stretch in the year ahead.That is why our portfolio is gladly tilted in that small cap direction...and enjoying very strong recent performance. More about that in the section below...What To Do Next?Discover my current portfolio of 11 stocks packed to the brim with the outperforming benefits found in our exclusive POWR Ratings model.This includes 4 small caps recently added with tremendous upside potential.Plus I have added 2 special ETFs that are all in sectors well positioned to outpace the market in the weeks and months ahead.This is all based on my 43 years of investing experience seeing bull markets...bear markets...and everything between.If you are curious to learn more, and want to see these 13 hand selected trades, then please click the link below to get started now.Steve Reitmeister’s Trading Plan & Top Picks >Wishing you a world of investment success!

95,Costco's earnings: Bulk buy blitz or bubble burst?,"Dec 15, 2023",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/costcos-earnings-bulk-buy-blitz-or-bubble-burst/467060,"
Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) is a retail sector titan synonymous with warehouses full of towering pallets and bargain-hunting bonanzas. Two significant announcements have investors and analysts a buzz: a massive $15 special dividend and an earnings beat that exceeded even the most optimistic expectations. The unexpected financial developments have caused a flurry of inquiries, leaving many wondering what lies beneath the surface of this retail giant's strategy.Costco was founded in 1976 and has evolved from a humble warehouse in Seattle to a global behemoth with over 870 locations and millions of loyal members. 



Its secret sauce: A unique value proposition built on membership. Costco members pay an annual fee to unlock a treasure trove of discounted goods, from everyday essentials to aspirational luxuries. Costco's success is due to more than bulk purchases. Its meticulously crafted business model is also a key factor. Leveraging its massive buying power can secure rock-bottom prices from suppliers, which offers lower margins but higher volume, a delicate balance it has mastered. In addition, Costco has embraced the changing retail landscape. Its online platform caters to convenience-seekers, while its international expansion taps into global demand for value.


Decoding Costco's special dividendThe recent declaration of a special $15 dividend by Costco Wholesale Corporation sent seismic waves through the financial world. This unforeseen windfall, exceeding even the most hopeful analyst projections, sparked a firestorm of inquiries and conjecture. Was this a one-time celebration of the company's robust financial health or a strategic indicator of future dividend policy adjustments?The shareholders were undoubtedly pleased with the generous dividend payout, which boosted immediate returns. However, there is some concern about its long-term sustainability. Could this be a sign that Costco will consider raising membership fees to maintain its newfound dividend generosity? While this would be unpopular with its loyal customer base, it could be seen as a necessary step to ensure the long-term stability of the dividend stream.The unexpected dividend move also reignited the debate about Costco's overall investment proposition. Is it a haven of value, providing investors with a steady stream of reliable returns through its membership model and efficient operations? Or is it a hype-fueled bubble, vulnerable to market fluctuations and the possibility of unforeseen economic headwinds?Investors must carefully weigh the potential rewards and risks of this intriguing conundrum. While the special dividend is undeniably attractive, it should not overshadow the need to thoroughly analyze the company's underlying financial health, future growth prospects and ability to navigate the volatile retail landscape.


Can Costco maintain its competitive edge?Costco Wholesale Corporation symbolizes stability in an uncertain retail market sector. Its membership model, which emphasizes value and bulk purchasing, has secured a loyal customer base and helped it maintain its position as the leading warehouse club. However, the future of this dominance depends on its ability to navigate the constantly changing retail landscape.Economic pressures pose a significant challenge. Declining consumer spending could erode the foundation of Costco's membership model. To counter this, the company must demonstrate agility in optimizing its product offerings, focusing on recession-proof categories and strategically-priced private labels to maintain margin stability and attract value-conscious shoppers.The digital tsunami is another formidable force. E-commerce giants like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) encroach on Costco's physical domain. This demands that Costco adapts to a robust omnichannel strategy. Costco must leverage its operational efficiency to optimize its supply chain and logistics. By achieving this goal, the company can offer competitive delivery options and a seamless online experience. Expanding its online platform with curated selections and exclusive member benefits can fortify its digital moat.Despite these headwinds, Costco possesses unique strengths that offer a competitive edge. One of their biggest strengths is the fiercely loyal member base forged through years of shared savings and bulk-buying. This loyal army of followers proves the company's value proposition. Their loyalty translates into predictable revenue streams and a level of customer engagement that remains unmatched by Costco's online competitors.


Furthermore, Costco's operational excellence remains a cornerstone of its success. Decades of expertise in bulk buying have honed the company's supply chains. This enables Costco to achieve efficient procurement and cost control even in volatile markets. The company's operational agility allows it to adjust pricing strategies and product offerings with unparalleled swiftness, adapting to changing consumer demands and economic realities.Predicting the future of Costco's competitive edge is challenging — economic headwinds, the digital tsunami and evolving consumer preferences all present significant challenges. However, Costco's commitment to value, its agile adaptation to market shifts, and its impregnable moat of loyal members offer compelling arguments for continued success.

96,I Have Over 20 Years of Experience in Real Estate — Here's the Investment Potential for Entrepreneurs.,"Dec 15, 2023",Ari Chazanas,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/unlock-the-diverse-investment-potential-of-the-real-estate/465441,"
In the vast and vibrant mosaic that is the U.S. real estate market, there lies a plethora of narratives rich with opportunity. This expansive canvas beckons entrepreneurs and business leaders to cast their sights far beyond the confines of their local vicinities. While investment dialogues have traditionally orbited around powerhouses like Los Angeles and New York, an array of untapped markets sprawls across the nation, waiting to be unearthed and capitalized upon.This article is an odyssey, charting the rationale behind diversifying investment interests across the American landscape, equipped with data-driven insights and strategic acumen tailored for the astute business mind.The economic tapestry of the U.S. is as diverse as its topographical splendor. From the innovation-fueled corridors of Silicon Valley to the historic trading floors of Wall Street, each contributes a distinctive thread to the nation's GDP tapestry. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reports that these regional economies add considerable value, underpinning the real estate sector's potential for growth. For entrepreneurs eyeing opportunities with robust prospects, aligning real estate initiatives with these thriving economic zones could leverage the inherent regional momentum.



Venturing beyond the allure of destinations like Beverly Hills or Manhattan, the U.S. presents a spectrum of luxury and commercial real estate markets, each replete with its character and investment potential. Consider Miami's art deco enclave, where property appreciation, as noted by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), has surged, outpacing national averages. Chicago's architectural splendor not only enhances the cityscape but also signifies a bustling commercial market with a notable uptick in occupancy rates. Boston's cobblestoned streets and historic façades offer not just charm but a steady appreciation in real estate value, marking these locales as worthy of investor consideration.Related: Why Real Estate Investment is the Ultimate Adventure for Entrepreneurs


The regulatory landscape of U.S. real estate can appear formidable, yet with institutions like the Small Business Administration (SBA) providing comprehensive guidelines, this terrain becomes navigable. This framework of varied yet coherent regulations form a supportive backdrop for nationwide real estate investment activities.Innovation is in America's DNA, mirrored in its technological and creative hubs. Industry leaders like CBRE highlight tech cities like Austin, which have seen explosive growth in the tech sector, thereby spurring demand for real estate. Similarly, research-centric towns like Raleigh-Durham are not just educational bastions but also investment hotbeds, where the nexus of academia and business catalyze property value increments.Sustainability has transitioned from buzzword to business imperative across the U.S. The U.S. Green Building Council reports that LEED-certified properties command notable premiums, a testament to the market's pivot towards eco-friendly living spaces. Investments in sustainable real estate are not merely ethical choices but strategically sound decisions that respond to a burgeoning market demand.Demographic trends and cultural dynamics offer a glimpse into future market directions. Data from the Census Bureau shows shifting population patterns, hinting at emergent real estate demands. Astute investors use this demographic data to spot growing markets and anchor their investment strategies in solid, data-backed projections.


Infrastructure development is a harbinger of real estate value. The U.S. Department of Transportation's data on upcoming projects, such as significant transit upgrades, signals future property hotspots. Shrewd investments in areas slated for infrastructural enhancement can lead to appreciable gains in property values and heightened demand.Related: The Entrepreneur's Guide to Building Wealth Through Real EstateThe resilience of the U.S. real estate market is exemplified by its historical performance. The Case-Shiller Index and other such metrics offer insights into the endurance of regional markets, guiding investors towards zones that balance stability and growth potential.In the realm of real estate, the power of a robust professional network cannot be overstated. The American Real Estate Society (ARES) and similar organizations act as conduits to expertise, offering connections to local specialists, legal advisors and financial consultants. For entrepreneurs, these networks are goldmines of wisdom, fostering informed decisions and fruitful investments.


Diversification in real estate should be seen as a strategic play, capturing unique regional values. Leveraging economic reports and market indices, investors can pinpoint areas ripe for investment. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, for instance, highlights sectors such as professional and business services experiencing job growth, which correlates with increased demand for commercial real estate.In my 20 years of experience as a property manager, I've observed firsthand the dynamic evolution of the U.S. real estate market as outlined above. The shift in investment focus from traditional hotspots to emerging markets, the interplay between regional economic strengths and property values and the increasing importance of sustainability and demographic trends in shaping investment strategies have all been pivotal in my approach to real estate management. Navigating these changes requires adaptability, keen market insight and a proactive stance in leveraging technological advancements and infrastructure developments to maximize property value and tenant satisfaction.In conclusion, the U.S. real estate landscape extends an open invitation to those business leaders willing to explore beyond their comfort zones. Its diverse territories promise a rich field for investment and innovation. A strategic approach, underpinned by an understanding of national trends and regional subtleties, can unlock extraordinary value and propel growth. As they survey the breadth of America's real estate horizon, investors are not just assessing properties; they're envisioning the evolution of business and the prosperity it beckons. With these insights at their disposal, they position themselves not just as participants in the market but as shapers of its future, charting a path to success in the world's most dynamic real estate marketplace.

Moreover, it anticipates that over 70% of enterprises will utilize industry cloud platforms to fast-track business initiatives, compared to less than 15% in 2023.Despite these advancements, the shift toward increased digitalization presents heightened cybersecurity risks, thereby increasing organizations' vulnerability to numerous cybersecurity threats. Over the past year, surging cyber-attack incidents, primarily driven by rapid digitalization, the growing adoption of cloud solutions, and the proliferation of smart devices, have thrown the spotlight on the cybersecurity industry.The global cybersecurity market is estimated to expand at a 12.3% CAGR to reach $500.70 billion by 2030.Considering these conducive trends, let's take a look at the fundamentals of the three software stocks.Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

98,Will this year's top performing stock ETFs stay hot in '24?,"Dec 15, 2023",MarketBeat Staff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/will-this-years-top-performing-stock-etfs-stay-hot-in-24/467033,"
Will this year's top-performing stock ETFs stay hot in '24?In movies, it was Everything Everywhere All at Once. In music, Bonnie Raitt’s “Just Like That.” In sports, Spain won the FIFA Women’s World Cup. This year’s pop culture winners have included plenty of surprises. The same can be said about U.S. equities.



Stocks brushed aside rampant inflation and rising interest rates to produce what many consider to be a surprisingly strong year. Barring an appearance from Scrooge, the S&P 500 will finish 2023 with a total return of at least 20%. It would mark the fourth time in the last five years that the index has posted high double-digit percent gains. Resilient to say the least given the recent mix of macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds.If the capital markets hosted an Oscars-style award show, there would be plenty of worthy nominees. Mega-cap technology, a group that typically underperforms in a rising rate environment, is crushing it. Growth stocks, which typically lag when inflation is high, are vastly outperforming. So are a bunch of emerging investment themes like artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity and digital currencies.Which brings up an important question for investors heading into 2024: will this year’s disconnect between economic conditions and asset class outperformance persist? Or will we see a more normalized investment setting where value and defensive sectors attract more buyers?  The good news is that if there is a clear market rotation, it won’t happen overnight. This means shareholders in these three top performing exchange traded funds (ETFs) will have an opportunity to secure gains — and move on to be the potential trophy winners of 2024.


#1 - ARKK This year has been sweet revenge for ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA: ARKK) manager Cathie Wood. The widely followed fund is up 55% year-to-date after suffering a 67% decline in 2022. Thanks to a drastic shift in market sentiment towards high-risk tech names, last year’s worst-performing stocks have turned into some of this year’s best. Top ARKK holding Coinbase Global is up 300% amid optimism around an upcoming Bitcoin ETF launch. Roku, the fund’s second-largest position, is up 140% on rising subscribers and an anticipated rebound in digital advertising demand (boosted by the election cycle). Meta Platforms, Palantir Technologies and Shopify have also more than doubled in 2023. The encouraging news for Aunt Cathie loyalists is that most ARKK stocks are still trading well below their all-time highs. At 10.6% of the ETF, Coinbase will be a big driver of future performance. The crypto trading platform (and former $400 stock) is one of the most polarizing names on Wall Street with seven analysts calling it a buy and seven a sell. Street sentiment around Roku is more bullish. What looms large, however, is that both Coinbase and Roku have significant downside based on their respective consensus price targets.  #2 - FBCGThe Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (BATS: FBCG) has been in the right place at the right time. Up 53% so far this year, the fund has benefitted from investors’ increased appetite for familiar tech leaders — and some unlikely heroes. While mega-caps like NVIDIA and Meta Platforms have been major return contributors, so have companies like Abercrombie & Fitch, DraftKings and Uber Technologies. The ETF has also gotten a big boost from owning Moonlake Immunotherapeutics, a mid-cap biotech that is up more than 400% year-to-date.


Whether FBCG can outperform in 2024 will depend heavily on Microsoft, Apple, NVIDIA and Amazon. Together, these stocks account for 40% of the portfolio compared to roughly 20% in the S&P 500. Although the fund is well diversified with about 150 holdings, it is quite top-heavy. Prospective investors should also be aware that the fund isn’t cheap — the expense ratio is 0.59%. There are less expensive and less concentrated ways to ride the growth train. #3 - VCAR The Simplify Volt RoboCar Disruption and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA: VCAR) is a thinly traded thematic ETF, but one that has performed extremely well. It invests in leading disruptive companies in the autonomous vehicle space, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Tesla and Lemonade. What’s also unique about the fund is that it “enhances” its highest conviction bets through an options overlay strategy. It is an approach that has served shareholders well, with the ETF up 54% this year.The expense ratio is high at 0.99%, but VCAR has a surprisingly high dividend yield (3.3%) which makes this easier to swallow. The self-driving car story has been accompanied by much hype — but also much doubt. This week, Barron’s called the space a popped bubble. Robotaxis may be the future, but after a huge run-up this year, its biggest proponents will have a lot to prove in 2024. Trading well below its $19.43 peak, VCAR is a high-risk play in a nascent, regulatory-challenged industry.

99,Is Walmart too big to prevail?,"Dec 13, 2023",Jea Yu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/is-walmart-too-big-to-prevail/466907,"
Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) is big, to say the least. It is the largest retailer in the world. It's the largest importer of goods in the United States. It is one of the largest consumer discretionary sector companies fiercely competing with Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). A strong dollar is a friend to Walmart as it imports goods cheaper and sells for a larger profit in the United States. Walmart is the largest employer in the United States, with 1.6 million workers, and the fourth largest in the world, with 2.3 million global workers. Some might say Walmart falls into the category of ""too big to fail .""However, after its recent earnings reaction, investors may be wondering if Walmart has grown too big to prevail.Window dressing accentuates the divergence. While competitors like Target Co. (NYSE: TGT) experienced an 11% price gap that grew to a 21% gain in the following days, Walmart shares gapped down 4.8% on its fiscal Q3 2024 earnings release and proceeded to sell off 10% in the following days despite the S&P 500 index hitting yearly highs. This stark negative correlation is rare as these two retailers tend to move together in lockstep. However, this time of the year can cause portfolio managers to frantically dump the losers and buy the winners in the final window dressing period of the year. It’s worth noting that WMT shares are still up 5% year-to-date (YTD) compared to TGT shares trading down 10.9% YTD. Check out the sector heatmap on MarketBeat.



Growth is slowing but still growing. On Nov. 16, 2023, Walmart released its fiscal third-quarter 2024 results for the quarter ending October 2023. The company reported an earnings-per-share (EPS) profit of $1.53 versus consensus analyst estimates for a profit of $1.52, a penny beat. Revenues climbed 5.2% YoY to $160.8 billion, beating analyst estimates of $159.65 billion. Consolidated gross margins rose 32 bps.Comparable sales and e-commerce growthU.S. comparable sales rose 4.9%, led by grocery and health wellness products. E-commerce spiked 24%, led by pickup and delivery. General merchandise grew low single-digit, reflecting softness in discretionary categories like apparel, home and toys. While unseasonal weather caused November sales to go up, Walmart expects sales growth to moderate in Q4 as grocery inflation normalizes to historic levels. Sam's Club U.S. comp sales without fuel rose 3.2%, and e-commerce rose 16% YoY.


Raised guidance still below analyst expectations Walmart expects fiscal full-year 2024 EPS of $6.40 to $6.48, up from previous guidance of $6.36 to $6.46 but still shy of the $6.50 consensus analyst estimates. Fiscal full-year 2024 revenues are expected to rise 5% to 5.5%, up from 4% to 4.5% in previous estimates or $641.6 billion to $644.6 billion versus $642.43 billion.Deflation will pressure the company.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon noted that inflation is starting to fall for some grocery items, including chicken, seafood and dairy, but not so much with dry grocery. General merchandise prices are also falling, causing retailers to roll back prices. Consumers will benefit from the effects of deflation, which will put more pressure on the company to sell more products. McMillon stated, ""In the U.S., we may be managing through a period of deflation in the months to come, and while that would put more unit pressure on us, we welcome it because it's better for our customers.” Investors didn't like this comment and reacted by selling.Insights on consumersCEO McMillon made many points in a CNBC interview following the earnings release. He emphasized that consumers are price-sensitive right now. Even richer consumers are shopping at Walmart for value. Foot traffic has increased with faster growth for curbside delivery. General merchandise is starting to experience price deflation. Next year could be a deflationary environment, but the company is not bracing for a recession and still expects growth in 2024.Walmart analyst ratings and price targets are at MarketBeat. Walmart peers and competitor stocks can be found with the MarketBeat stock screener. Daily ascending price channel breakdown The daily candlestick chart for WMT illustrates the ascending price channel heading into the earnings as shares hit 52-week highs on the heels of Target's strong earning reaction. However, the sentiment reversed quickly upon the release as shares gapped down nearly 5% and proceeded to continue selling off 10% through the daily 200-period moving average support at $153.63. The daily market structure low (MSL) trigger formed at $155.27 but could not trigger. The daily relative strength index (RSI) plunged from the 70-band towards the 30-band. Pullback support levels are at $150.24, $145.50, $141.84 and $138.00.

Therefore, tech stocks Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Teradata (TDC) are poised to benefit from the industry’s tailwinds. But which of these stocks is a better buy this month? Read on to know more….In this article, I evaluated two tech stocks, Riot Blockchain, Inc. (RIOT) and Teradata Corporation (TDC), to determine which has the potential for better returns. After comparing the fundamentals of these stocks, we believe TDC is the better investment this month for reasons explained throughout this piece.As businesses and industries increasingly rely on technology, IT service providers stand to benefit significantly. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic had a positive impact on the market. By investing in tech services, organizations across several end-use sectors are automating repetitive tasks and streamlining processes, leading to enhanced efficiency, productivity, and cost-effectiveness.



In recent years, cloud computing experienced considerable growth as businesses migrated their operations to the cloud, necessitating IT services to manage and secure these environments. Also, organizations utilize data analytics and business intelligence (BI) to gather insights from datasets, which aids in informed decision-making to improve performance across the business.Further, the tech services industry’s growth is driven by technological trends, including the growing use of AI, machine learning, and blockchain, enhanced focus on the Internet of Things (IoT) & connected devices, and increasing need to comply with data privacy regulations. The global IT services market is expected to reach $2.59 trillion by 2030, expanding at a CAGR of 9.7%.

102,8 Things Your Pitch Deck Needs If You Want Investment in Your Company,"Dec 12, 2023",Alexander Galitsky,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/8-things-your-pitch-deck-needs/466034,"
When entrepreneurs try to shore up funding and management for their ventures, they often summarize their business strategies in an abbreviated presentation document called a pitch deck. A pitch deck is typically utilized in meetings with clients, partners and co-founders and when presenting to investors.There are two things to remember when creating a pitch deck to attract and interest potential funders. Your pitch deck's visual appeal (including the text length of each slide) is the first element. The second element is the actual content of your pitch deck, which is critical and challenging to create.Related: Successful Fundraising Begins With a Stellar Pitch Deck



1. Vision statement and value propositionWhether they're on the same slide or are presented separately, each of these needs to be one short sentence or statement. These statements will show prospective investors what your firm does and the value it can bring to consumers. It's a general rule that these statements must be both clever and concise.Related: How to Think Like an Investor When Preparing Your Pitch Deck


2. Problem statementIf your company isn't addressing a compelling, pressing problem, something's wrong. Explain the issue your company is managing and who this issue affects (i.e., your target market). When describing the case, it's essential to tell a story that prospective investors can identify with. This will aid in conveying the nature and purpose of your company.3. Target audience and market opportunityYou can use this section to elaborate on your target market and the size of your estimated customer base. Explain to potential investors how big the market is and where you want to position your company.Collect as much data as possible on existing market purchases to give investors an accurate market size. If necessary, split your market into segments.While you might be tempted to define your target market as extremely broad, you should show investors you have a particular and addressable market. Doing so will add credibility to your presentation.


4. Product — Show the solutionAt last, you can describe the product or service you're bringing to the market. Explain to potential customers who use your product or service how it solves the issues you highlighted in the second section above.Describing your business here builds up the problem and allows you to define how acute or painful it is for your target market. Then, you can tell how your product or service can come to the rescue to solve (or help solve) the problem.Whenever possible, use pictures and stories to describe your solution. Showing is almost always better than telling.Related: Pitching Investors With Customer Motivations Won't Work


5. Business model or revenue modelAfter introducing your product or service, you should discuss its potential advantages and benefits. Some ventures rely on advertising revenue rather than consumer purchases to cover their business overhead and profit. Therefore, make sure you provide some explanation of the financial mechanics here.6. Sales and marketing approachHow will you advertise your company and attract new customers? Use this section to show investors how you intend to promote and sell your product or service. Ensure you include all the advertising and sales methods used to introduce and demonstrate your wares to consumers. You should also emphasize your unique selling points (USPs) here if you have any.Related: How to Sell Your Story Through Your Pitch Deck7. The moneyInvestors need to see sales, profits, and cash flow projections for at least three years. Use charts to display sales, estimated customer numbers, expenditure summaries, and profit projections rather than detailed, difficult-to-read spreadsheets.


Get ready to talk about the primary expense drivers and the assumptions you used to arrive at your sales projections. Keep in mind that your financial forecasts should be logical and reasonable.8. TeamPresent the team you intend to use for your venture, along with their background, qualifications and anything special they bring to the table that would make them especially suitable for their roles. A solid team will enhance your chances of success and give your company much-needed credibility.Additional considerationsEven though the elements above are crucial, a ""competition"" section is also recommended for a successful pitch deck in most cases. In this section, justify your place in the market and explain how your business can stand out from the rest of the options that will be there. Focus on the USPs that set your company apart from competitors.A ""Investment and the Use of Funds"" section can also be included. In this section, you should tell prospective backers how much money you need and why. Describe precisely how their investment will be used. Investors want to know where their money is going and how it will further your company's mission.

103,"Oracle's Q2 earnings report: Cloud highs, app lows","Dec 12, 2023",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/oracles-q2-earnings-report-cloud-highs-app-lows/466856,"
Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) is a giant in the technology sector and is known for its database and cloud computing solutions. The company saw its stock price drop in early morning trading today. This drop followed the release of the company's second-quarter earnings report, which fell short of analyst expectations regarding revenue growth.A mixed bag with clouds on the horizonOracle's Q2 earnings report unveiled a mixed performance, depicting a company straddling the line between growth and stagnation. While revenue of $12.9 billion marked a 5.4% year-over-year increase, it fell short of the $13.05 billion analysts had anticipated. Despite meeting the company's own guidance, this revenue miss sent shockwaves through the market, causing the stock to drop.



Earnings, however, provided a silver lining. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.34, exceeding the $1.33 analysts predicted and representing a healthy 19% increase over the same period last year. This suggests that Oracle still generates significant profits even as revenue growth slows.The cloud business, a crucial driver of Oracle's future, presented a tale of two halves. Cloud infrastructure (OCI) revenue soared by a robust 52%, showcasing strong demand for Oracle's cloud computing solutions. This growth is encouraging, as it indicates that Oracle is successfully capturing a share of the rapidly expanding cloud market.


However, the cloud applications segment revealed a less rosy picture. Revenue growth for cloud applications was a more modest 15%, falling short of expectations and raising concerns about the competitiveness of Oracle's application offerings. This slower growth could indicate that Oracle is struggling to attract new customers and retain existing ones in the face of stiff competition from cloud-native rivals like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.A perfect storm: A misstep, capacity concerns, and market jittersOracle's recent stock plunge was not a simple misstep. It was a perfect storm of circumstances that came together. The leading cause was a revenue shortfall. Investors were expecting stronger growth but were disappointed by the 5.4% year-over-year increase, particularly in the cloud applications segment, which saw a slowdown compared to previous quarters.This disappointment was compounded by concerns surrounding the pace of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) growth. While its 52% revenue surge is impressive, analysts expressed worries about potential limitations due to acknowledged capacity constraints. This uncertainty cast a shadow over Oracle's future cloud dominance.Adding fuel to the fire were issues revolving around the 2022 acquisition of Cerner, the electronic health records company. While expected to be a significant contributor in the long run, it currently seems to be dragging down earnings, further impacting investor sentiment.


The overall market volatility played its part. With investors increasingly cautious due to recession fears and rising interest rates, Oracle's performance wasn't spared from the widespread anxiety.Though each of these concerns is troubling, combined, they created a perfect storm that caused Oracle’s stock to plummet. Despite the company’s solid fundamentals and future potential, navigating this turbulent landscape will require addressing the underlying issues and reassuring investors that clear skies are still ahead.Analysts' perspectives: The view from the towerDespite the adverse stock reaction, some analysts remain optimistic about Oracle's long-term prospects. They highlight the company's strong balance sheet, healthy cash flow, and commitment to innovation, particularly in generative AI. Others, however, express concerns about the company's ability to maintain its high growth trajectory and compete effectively with cloud-native players like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure.Navigating turbulent skies: Oracle's key challengesWhile the current clouds may be casting a shadow over Oracle's stock performance, its future success ultimately hinges on its ability to overcome critical challenges:



Accelerating OCI growth: The robust 52% year-over-year revenue increase in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is a promising sign. However, maintaining this momentum requires rapid expansion of its capacity. Addressing current limitations and proactively scaling infrastructure will be crucial to meeting increasing demand and fending off competition in the fiercely contested cloud market.
Rejuvenating cloud applications growth: While OCI thrives, the cloud applications segment saw a more sluggish 15% growth, raising concerns about its competitiveness. Oracle must make its cloud applications more compelling and attractive to customers to regain investor confidence. This might involve strategic partnerships, innovative product offerings, or enhanced customer service to gain an edge over established rivals like AWS and Azure.
Unlocking Cerner's potential: The acquisition of Cerner holds significant promise for Oracle's future in the healthcare sector. However, a seamless and successful integration is paramount to unlocking its full potential. Streamlining processes, optimizing workflows, and ensuring data security will transform Cerner into a valuable asset contributing to overall growth.
Weathering market volatility: The current market climate, characterized by recession anxieties and rising interest rates, presents an additional challenge. To navigate this turbulence, Oracle needs to prioritize operational efficiency and cost control. By optimizing its internal processes and minimizing unnecessary expenditures, it can demonstrate resilience in the face of external headwinds and reassure investors of its ability to thrive even in challenging market conditions.
Investors considering Oracle stocks should carefully evaluate the company's long-term prospects and weigh the risks and rewards before deciding. The company's strong fundamentals and innovative technologies present potential upside, but the current challenges and competitive landscape require careful consideration.While the recent stock drop is concerning, it's important to remember that Oracle remains a major player in the software industry with a strong track record and significant growth potential. The company's ability to address its challenges and execute its growth strategy will ultimately determine its future success and stock price performance.

104,3 Miner Stocks Set for Year-End Success,"Dec 12, 2023",Sristi Suman Jayaswal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/3-miner-stocks-set-for-year-end-success/466829,"
The buoyant demand for metals and minerals foreshadows a prosperous future for the mining industry. Given this backdrop, fundamentally robust miner stocks Glencore plc (GLNCY), Fortescue Ltd (FSUGY), and Dundee Precious Metals (DPMLF), set for year-end success, could be solid portfolio additions now. Read on….With global demand for metals and minerals rising dramatically due to their essential function across multiple industries, the mining sector is well-positioned for substantial growth. Against this backdrop, quality miner stocks Glencore plc (GLNCY), Fortescue Ltd (FSUGY), and Dundee Precious Metals Inc. (DPMLF) could be solid buys now.The mining industry is an indispensable conduit, supplying vital metals and minerals, which fuel various sectors such as construction, jewelry, medicine, technology, and the burgeoning field of renewable energy. This industry has undeniably been an engine of progress, propelling modern economies' expansion and development while bolstering employment opportunities.



The global mining market is projected to grow to $2.15 trillion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 6.1%. Given that the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, the demand for the mining sector will undeniably surge.As nations make substantial investments to achieve their net-zero climate aspirations, the demand for critical minerals like copper, lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements required for clean energy is predicted to escalate significantly. Experts project that an accelerated transition toward global net zero by 2050 would necessitate six times more mineral inputs in 2040 than at present.


The escalating demand for metals like lithium, stimulated by the supply chain of the EV industry, has opened up a profitable avenue for the mining sector to exploit. The global demand for lithium batteries is expected to soar over five-fold by 2030. The U.S. market is estimated to proliferate over six-fold, equating to an annual budget of $55 billion by the end of this decade.Moreover, the increasing use of automation and digitalization has allowed mining companies to stay ahead of emerging trends and maintain a competitive edge.Considering these conducive trends, let's take a look at the fundamentals of the three miner stocks.Glencore plc (GLNCY)

105,Occidental Petroleum: A Giant Awakens in the Permian,"Dec 12, 2023",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/occidental-petroleum-a-giant-awakens-in-the-permian/466820,"
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) has been making waves in the energy sector with its recent acquisition of CrownRock, a major player in the Permian Basin. This $12 billion deal represents a strategic move that positions Oxy as a key player in the future of US shale production.The rise of a Permian powerhouseOccidental Petroleum's acquisition of CrownRock marks a pivotal moment in the company's history, catapulting it into the ranks of the dominant players in the oil and energy sectors. This strategic move significantly expands Oxy's footprint in the region, adding:




94,000 net acres: This substantial land acquisition provides Oxy with a vast platform for future drilling and development, significantly increasing its resource base.
1,700 undeveloped well locations: These locations represent a treasure trove of potential production, ready to be tapped for future growth.
170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d): This immediate production boost solidifies Oxy's position as one of the largest producers in the Permian, a clear indicator of its growing influence within the basin.
The CrownRock acquisition goes beyond simply adding numbers to the balance sheet. It signifies Oxy's bold ambition to become a true Permian powerhouse. By acquiring these prime assets, Oxy gains:
Enhanced scale: The increased acreage and production volume elevate Oxy's status in the industry, allowing it to leverage its size to achieve greater operational efficiency and cost competitiveness.
Improved access to infrastructure: CrownRock's existing infrastructure, including water pipelines, recycling plants, and saltwater disposal wells, provides Oxy with a valuable logistical advantage, facilitating efficient and cost-effective operations.
Diversification of assets: With CrownRock's Midland Basin assets complementing Oxy's existing Delaware Basin holdings, the company achieves a more balanced portfolio, mitigating risks associated with geological variations and production fluctuations.
This strategic move conveys a strong message to the market. That message is that Occidental Petroleum is a major player in the Permian Basin. With its expanded footprint, enhanced capabilities, and ambitious vision, Oxy is poised to become a major force in shaping the future of US shale production.


Oxy's Strategic Vision for Long-Term GrowthOccidental Petroleum's CEO, Vicki Hollub, aptly described the CrownRock acquisition as ""the opportunity to build scale in the Midland Basin and positioning us to drive value creation for our shareholders."" This statement indicates that this acquisition is not simply a land grab. It can be interpreted as a calculated move designed to solidify Oxy's dominance in the Permian Basin. By securing access to vast resources and low-cost, high-return production opportunities, Oxy is laying the groundwork for a sustainable and profitable future.Hollub's emphasis on ""building scale"" highlights the essential role of size in the energy sector. A larger footprint translates to economies of scale, increased bargaining power with suppliers and customers, and the ability to invest in cutting-edge technologies. The commitment to ""driving value creation for shareholders"" demonstrates that Oxy's strategic vision extends beyond mere corporate expansion. By strategically allocating resources and maximizing returns from its assets, Oxy seeks to reward its investors and ensure the company's long-term financial stability.


The acquisition of CrownRock aligns perfectly with Oxy's long-term strategy of focusing on low-cost, high-return production in the Permian. The region's vast reserves and relatively lower production costs offer Oxy an ideal platform to achieve its strategic goals. This synergy between the acquisition and Oxy's established strategy ensures a smooth integration and a rapid realization of the anticipated benefits.Financial considerationsThe acquisition is financed through a combination of cash, stock issuance, and debt, raising Oxy's debt levels from the current $20 billion to around $28 billion. While debt management will be crucial, the deal is expected to generate $1 billion in free cash flow in its first year, based on an oil price of $70 per barrel. This positions Oxy for continued growth and shareholder value creation.As with any major acquisition, challenges remain. Integrating CrownRock's operations and managing increased debt will require careful planning and execution. However, the potential rewards are significant. The acquisition opens access to new technologies, development techniques, and a vast resource base.Investor reactionInvestors have reacted positively to the CrownRock deal, with Oxy's stock price rising steadily in recent months. The acquisition showcases Oxy's commitment to growth and its position as a leading player in the Permian Basin. This bodes well for the company's future and potential to generate shareholder value.


Occidental Petroleum's acquisition of CrownRock marks a significant milestone in the company's history. It solidifies Oxy's position as a leader in the Permian Basin, opens up new growth opportunities, and creates value for shareholders. While challenges remain, Oxy's strategic vision and execution capabilities give it the right tools to navigate the future.

106,Stock Trading Plan for 12/13 Fed Meeting,"Dec 12, 2023",Steve Reitmeister,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/stock-trading-plan-for-1213-fed-meeting/466870,"
There is no denying the bull run for stocks since the last Fed meeting on 11/1. In fact, the S&P 500 (SPY) finally broke above the July highs to peak levels for the year above 4,600. The main thing for investors to contemplate is whether the 12/13 Fed announcement will add to those gains...or trigger a correction. That is what Steve Reitmeister covers in his latest market commentary that includes a preview of his top 13 picks for today’s market. Read on below for more.We are enjoying a very traditional Santa Claus rally. These are not marked by days with big gains. In fact, it has been nearly a month since we saw a daily rally of greater than 1% for the S&P 500 (SPY).Instead, we simply have a bullish bias like the last 4 sessions in being in positive territory. And 2/3rds of the days over the past month also being in the positive camp helping to grow our portfolios.



The looming question at this moment is if the Fed meeting on Wednesday 12/13 will further endorse these warm holiday spirits for investors...or are we about to get a lump of coal in our stockings? That will be the focus of this week’s Reitmeister Total Return commentary.Market CommentaryStocks have finally broken above the July highs to new ground above 4,600.This is not a surprise once the Fed flashed a green light for investors after their 11/1 meeting. This helped reverse the dramatic rise of bond prices that was the catalyst for the correction that unfolded in the previous 3 months.


To be honest, the Fed’s statements on 11/1 did not seem that different from the past. The general tenor being there is still more work to do to rein in high inflation. However, it was the acknowledgement of Chairman Powell in the press conference that rates were currently restrictive and they were seeing positive results on the inflation war front.Reading between those lines investors took this to mean that the Fed was more likely to leave rates at current levels than risk implementing higher rates which would increase the odds of recession.Since that time, we have more evidence of a stable economy all the while inflation comes in lower and lower. That includes Tuesday CPI report where we continue on a path back towards the Fed’s target of 2% inflation.Another key point for investors is evaluating the state of employment. The incredible resilience of the labor market 20 months after an aggressive rate hiking regime is going to have economists reconsidering their models in the years ahead. Meaning it is unprecedented that unemployment has not risen more dramatically at this stage.


Last Friday we saw the monthly Government Employment Report come in a notch above expectations with 199,000 jobs added. That is a solid showing that points to a still healthy economy...but not necessarily an overheating jobs market which has been one of the Feds concerns as it leads to persistent wage inflation.Given all the new data since the last Fed meeting, the CME shows the odds of another rate hike on 12/13 drop at a paltry 1.8%. What is more interesting is the expectations for the first rate hike to come at the March 20, 2024 meeting.A month ago that was considered only a 12% probability. Yet today it is all the way up to 41% likelihood (39.7% of quarter point cut and 1.6% for half point cut).


So, the key to the stock market reaction on 12/13 depends on how Fed statements change the above probabilities. If Powell sticks to his hawkish guns and says that inflation is still too persistent or sticky...then the March rate cut probability drops...and so too will stock prices recede from recent highs.However, if the Fed nods to the improvements made and gives an indication that the committee is finally starting to contemplate the timing of rate cuts...then stocks will be off to the races.Given all the evidence to date, I suspect that Powell will try and navigate something in the middle of these two examples. Bulls will continue to read positive things between the lines...and bears will do the opposite.The problem for bears is that bulls are clearly in charge...that’s because there is more evidence on their side. And thus I would expect that the recent Santa Claus rally to continue to melt up day by day into years end. This puts the year end target of 4,700 well in hand...and maybe a touch higher.


Even better than that is the continued broadening out of stock gains to previously underperforming small and mid caps. Those groups have been leading the charge ever since the rally began at the outset of November...and I expect that to be the case in the year ahead.Thus, wise to start overweighting those smaller stocks like we have been doing in the Reitmeister Total Return portfolio.

107,Unlocking Year-End Gains with Energy Stocks,"Dec 12, 2023",Sristi Suman Jayaswal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/unlocking-year-end-gains-with-energy-stocks/466811,"
Amid heightened demand for oil and gas, the energy sector is on the brink of substantial expansion. Moreover, Wall Street analysts expressed optimistic views triggered by constrained supply.

Read on….The global oil industry stands on the precipice of a significant transformation as OPEC+ nations limit their oil production. Additionally, amid the vigorous demand for oil and gas, Wall Street analysts project an upward trajectory in market performance, bolstering investor interest in this sector. Expectations of considerable profit gains especially favor companies already situated to capitalize on this industry-wide growth.Given this backdrop, it could be wise to add fundamentally robust energy stocks Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC), ChampionX Corporation (CHX), and Liberty Energy Inc. (LBRT) to your portfolio now.



Before exploring the fundamentals of these stocks, let’s scrutinize the industry’s evolving dynamics.In a drive for sustainable energy, over 140 nations worldwide have established net-zero emission objectives, thus hastening the transition toward renewable resources. Despite the increased adoption of clean energy solutions, the global oil and gas demand is anticipated to remain robust. In 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects global oil demand to increase by 2.4 million barrels per day (bpd) and 930,000 bpd by 2024.


This winter, meteorologists anticipate milder temperatures up until December 23, yet traditional cooling trends could augment U.S. gas demand in the Lower 48 states, including exports. LSEG predicts a rise from 121.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) this week to 124.8 bcfd the following week and 127.3 bcfd in two weeks.The United States stands on the edge of leapfrogging Australia and Qatar to emerge as the world's top supplier of Liquefied Natural Gas by 2023. Soaring oil prices, supply disruptions, and sanctions associated with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine have amplified international demand for U.S. exports.Amid geopolitical unrest and voluntary production cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia, oil prices could surge further. Analysts at UBS Group AG (UBS) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) foresee a probable increase in oil prices because of the implementation of these voluntary cutbacks. Forecasted Brent oil prices for 2024 are expected to hover between $80 and $100.In light of these encouraging trends, let's look at the fundamentals of the three energy stocks.Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC)MPC operates as an integrated downstream energy company primarily in the United States.

108,When Is It Time to Pull Out of a Startup Investment? An Investor Reveals What Signs You Shouldn't Ignore.,"Dec 11, 2023",Evgeny Kireev,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/when-is-it-time-to-pull-out-of-a-startup-investment-here/465261,"
In the world of investments, it's just as important to know when to exit as when to enter. My experience as an investor and entrepreneur has taught me that both types of decisions must be based on informed and strategic choices. If your chosen startup is not doing as well as expected, you are faced with a dilemma. So, how do you know if it is time to pull the plug?If you do pull out of an investment, you'll be selling your shares or redeeming your capital before its intended maturity date. Remember that investments are inherently volatile, meaning their value can fluctuate, sometimes significantly, over time. So, if you do decide to pull out of a startup, be aware from the beginning that you might not recoup the same amount of capital that you initially invested.Related: Here's What's Brewing in the Minds of Startup Investors



Align your investment strategy with your goals The investment journey is a voyage on the unpredictable tides of the financial markets, in constant flux, rising and falling on a daily basis. This variability is precisely why experts advocate adopting a long-term investment strategy as key to weathering the market's ups and downs. By opting for a long-term approach, investors have the opportunity to ride out market turbulence and capitalize on the overall growth trajectory.The duration of your investments should be aligned with your goals and your investment strategy, but it is crucial to keep a close eye on the ever-changing landscape of the current market performance. This vigilance will help to determine if and when you should consider withdrawing from the project.


Knowing when to exitThe decision to pull out of an investment is an important and permanent one, which needs to be made as rationally as possible and after doing the necessary research and analysis. Here are some key factors that you should carefully consider when assessing the situation and your options:Determine the company's vision and long-term prospectsIf the company's vision still aligns with your investment goals and demonstrates good growth potential, you may want to stay invested for longer. Take a close look at its current performance — whether it is achieving its strategic milestones and whether it's well-prepared to overcome any challenges that may lie ahead.Market conditions and trendsBeing well-informed about current market dynamics in the relevant sector will help you understand if it's safer to cut any losses now or if it's worth riding it out in the longer term. Consider the potential returns you aim to achieve from your investment and the timeframe for achieving them. You can use these criteria as a benchmark in this decision-making process.Review your own personal goals and objectivesYou should already have clearly identified these qualities as part of your overall financial strategy before deciding where to allocate your capital. If a startup is no longer meeting these goals, then it may be time for a change. However, before taking this important step, do some thorough research to determine if the under-performing startup still holds potential for future success.


Future prospects and risksMarket volatilityIf the market is in an unfavorable phase, yet the intrinsic value of the asset remains unchanged and is expected to recover when the market rebounds, then exiting now might not be the wisest decision. However, if the business itself has deteriorated or the asset's underlying value is much less than its market price, then you should seriously consider selling.Risk level vs. risk toleranceIf the startup has become too unstable for your liking or is making slow to no progress toward your objectives, it may be wise to consider pulling out. Extreme market shifts may indicate that the asset's future performance is unlikely to recover, or the company may lack the necessary agility and pivot capabilities to respond strategically to external factors beyond its control. Either way, it's unlikely to remain viable and profitable in the long run.


External life factorsLife happens to all of us, so it may be that your own situation has changed, and you need to adjust your strategy. Your initial investment was guided by a specific plan. Still, if your circumstances have changed significantly since then, the key is to adapt your strategy to align with your modified financial goals.Related: Exit Strategy Through the Eyes of an Angel InvestorAlways have a planUltimately, all investment decisions should always be rooted in a plan that evolves in response to the dynamic financial landscape. One effective approach is to closely monitor prevailing market trends. This analysis enables you to gain insights into your potential returns and whether they remain consistent with your investment objectives.


In essence, the decision to pull out of an investment should be a carefully considered one, founded on a deep understanding of the company's potential, market conditions and your own financial goals. It is essential to make an informed decision, not an emotional one, and you must have a well-thought-out exit strategy in place.By understanding when and why you should pull out, considering the company's prospects, and evaluating the associated risks, you can make informed and strategic choices that increase your chances of achieving the goals you set when you invested in the first place.

109,The truth behind BlackRock and Citigroup buying insurance firms,"Dec 11, 2023",Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/the-truth-behind-blackrock-and-citigroup-buying-insurance/466756,"
Well, here it goes again: banks and other prominent Wall Street participants are buying insurance stocks again. By again, you can refer back to somewhat common knowledge of when financial stocks, namely insurance providers, become attractive investments in the eyes of 'smart money' such as today.Typically, when investors feel there will be a downturn in the underlying economy, they will flood into what are termed 'defensive' names, or companies whose earnings depend on industries that are immune to downturns or ones that can even benefit from such. You know these suspects they're usually found in the healthcare sector.



Today, there is an added group to these safety stocks, and they are found in the insurance space. Names like Mercury General (NYSE: MCY), Progressive (NYSE: PGR), and even Ryan Specialty (NYSE: RYAN) have caught the attention of some of Wall Street's largest broker-dealers, but more on why later.Suddenly there's interest In case you missed it, the financial sector has been breaking out of its previous ceilings, even during December, which is known to disrespect market structure.


Maybe because most traders are out vacationing for the holidays, maybe because others avoid touching their portfolios before tax season, but the VIX has hit its lowest levels since 2019, signaling that good deals are more complex than ever to find right now.Take a look at the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA: XLF). You will notice an outperformance against the S&P 500 of up to 2.4% during the past quarter. Some could argue that this is only the beginning of a larger move from the sector, with good reason.According to the ISM Services PMI index, the one solely responsible for delivering a real GDP growth figure in the past two quarters, the financial services sector (including insurance) has taken a turn for the better.After pushing three consecutive months of growth, markets have placed their faith in a select few names they consider to be the winners in the group. Ryan, Progressive, and Mercury have all been reaping the rewards of higher valuations and earnings projections, but have these feelings turned into investment dollars?


When you ask giants BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) and Citigroup (NYSE: C), the answer is a definite yes. With a 5.5% increase in its Mercury stake, BlackRock (already the largest shareholder) seems to be finding some additional upside left by investing in the sector.Citigroup saw enough reason (and value) to deploy assets and increase its Ryan Specialty position by 34.5% in December. If you have been in the markets for a long time, you know that once the big guys leave evidence behind, it is typically too late, but is it really too late for you to ride the wave?Markets drive a hard bargainWhen you spread the world of insurance stocks by all its participants, you'll find an average forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11.0x. This is the market's way of slapping a value on what they think the next twelve months of earnings should be worth today.In the spirit of the insurance business, going for the cheapest policies will typically cost you dearly when you need them, so going with a slightly more expensive option can save you lots of headaches. These stocks work in kind of the same way in their valuations.


Going with the names that command a premium valuation means that 'they are expensive for a reason,' and if BlackRock knows the reason, do yourself a favor and don't argue with them. Mercury and Progressive go head-to-head at a 20.0x forward P/E, placing them both at a near 100.0% premium to the industry's valuation.Ryan Specialty takes the crown at 25.9x, commanding a 136.0% premium to the industry. You may begin to wonder why on Earth would markets be okay overpaying for these companies when they can just go right next door to a cheaper competitor?Results. The answer is results; you see, the industry is expected to grow its earnings by an average of 13.5% for next year, while these names are far beyond the norm and worth the price because of it.Mercury analysts are shooting for a 343.8% growth in EPS, which is not really a question but rather a heads up; after all, it is good enough for BlackRock to believe in. Progressive analysts see an industry-beating 49.1% rate as well, justifying its premium value, too.


When it comes to Ryan Specialty, analysts see the lowest growth at 23.2% while placing a 15.8% upside based on price targets. However, this one is commanding the largest valuation and position increase from Citigroup, so it is likely the one that is left to catch up with the winning pack.When there's fear, people buy insurance to protect their assets in case of an economic downturn. You now have tailwinds coming from Wall Street and the larger economy to place some exposure into the sector, so do yourself a favor and don't miss out!
