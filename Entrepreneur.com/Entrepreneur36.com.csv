0,How To Leverage Social Media to Optimize PR Success and Increase Your Brand Awareness,"Apr 19, 2024",Scott Bartnick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-leverage-social-media-to-optimize-pr-success-and/468837,"
One of the most exciting PR approaches today is thought leadership. By showcasing their expertise, thought leaders establish themselves as authoritative and trustworthy sources in their industry.Some of the most common methods used in a thought leadership campaign are podcast appearances, guest posts, and contributorship programs. The key to unlocking all of these opportunities is social media.Many entrepreneurs don't realize the power social media has to connect them not only with their consumers but also with fellow business leaders and further opportunities to share their expertise. In our increasingly online world, social media has become a fundamental part of an entrepreneur or business leader's personal brand. As entrepreneurs seek to become thought leaders, social media is a valuable tool.



Not only are social posts essential for showcasing your media resume by posting any podcasts, bylines, or mentions you get, but you can also use social media platforms to communicate your expertise directly. However, without the right social media strategy, you won't be able to take advantage of this powerful tool.Related: How to Create a Strong Personal Brand by Leveraging the Power of PR and Social Media


Optimize your social media content strategyThe first step a business leader should take in developing a social media strategy is to choose the right social channels. Every social media channel is different, and which platform (or platforms) are best for your company will depend on a few factors, including your industry and audience.TikTok and Instagram, for example, are great for short-form video content and connecting with younger consumers, while YouTube is better for long-form content and allows you to go into more depth, making it perfect for professionals. LinkedIn caters to a more professional audience, while X (formerly known as Twitter) is for a more general crowd. Generally, it's best for business leaders to have a presence on multiple social networks, but focus on a few that best align with your business goals.As your social media presence and brand become bigger, you can achieve more prominent placements on podcasts and contributorship opportunities. Many of these opportunities have minimum requirements for you to qualify to participate. Identifying the podcasts and publications you would like to appear on will allow you to set your social media goals.Many leaders fail to realize that you don't need hundreds of thousands of followers on your social platforms to leverage them successfully. What you must have, however, is a professional presence. Even if you only have a few hundred followers, you would be surprised how far good posts, a well-made bio, clean photos, and a fully filled-out profile — including profile and header pictures — can establish your legitimacy just as well as a nice website.


Of course, even in the era of social media, it's still important to have a professional website, too, since this is where your social media profiles will point your followers. You want a clean and concise landing page, including compelling, a call to action, and something to buy. Also, don't forget the small details like favicons and logos. Although these may seem insubstantial, they are important in showing your brand's consistency in its identity.Related: The Business of Harnessing the Power of Social MediaMistakes entrepreneurs make when creating a social media strategyOne of the biggest mistakes a business leader can make regarding social media is emphasizing quantity over quality. Although there are some minimums you must hit to create a splash on social media, most of these guidelines have more to do with consistency than the amount of content you produce. So long as you post with a regular cadence, you don't have to publish excessive amounts of social content. A few excellent posts a week will be more effective than multiple bad posts daily.Remember, social media should function as an extension of your brand narrative, so ensure any messaging you share on social media aligns with your brand's mission and goals, and plan your content based on your audience. While taking advantage of social media trends might work for some companies, it could present too informal of a social presence for others.


Once you build your social media presence, you can leverage this for podcast and contributorship opportunities to further boost your credibility as a thought leader, creating a cycle of success and authority. If an outlet or podcast sees that you have been featured on another reputable podcast or publication, they will likely trust you more and want you to share your expertise with them, too. This is why keeping a media resume is so crucial in thought leadership.Related: 6 Ways to Ace Social Media Branding for Your StartupSuccessful social media strategies pay off in the long runSocial media is a long-term game, and while some people have indeed become overnight viral successes, attempting to capture that lightning in a bottle is often futile. Instead, you should focus on consistently putting out high-quality content.


Over time, as you continue to provide value to the people who read your content, you will continue to gain followers. The podcasts you appear on and the outlets you contribute to will also share your content, which could also help you grow your following.Social media can be a powerful tool for entrepreneurs looking to become thought leaders, but to harness its full potential, they must understand the platforms they are using, the people they are serving, and what image they must present for success. Understanding these critical aspects of social strategy will help you stand out as an authority in your field and increase brand awareness.

1,94% of Customers Say a Bad Review Made Them Avoid Buying From a Brand. Try These 4 Techniques to Protect Your Brand Reputation.,"Apr 19, 2024",Scott Keever,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-ways-to-protect-your-brand-reputation-from-bad-reviews/471818,"
Protecting your online reputation means more now than ever before. Roughly 94% of customers claim that a negative review has convinced them not to purchase from a brand. This indicates that ""bad"" comments can be problematic for business owners, but there are ways to approach them and turn them around to be more positive.At some point, you'll have to deal with negative customer comments online and must learn to respond to criticism effectively. There are countless techniques out there, but here are the ones we've used with great success at Keever SEO, taking our cue from some of the most popular brands.Related: Why You Must Monitor Your Online Reputation Before it Hurts You



1. Creating a separate support handleAs our brand grew, we struggled to complete our daily tasks. Conducting competitor research, mastering content marketing and sending out customer support emails made managing our online reputation challenging. One way we combatted that issue was by creating separate support handles, which is similar to what Nike did.Nike created a separate Twitter (now X) account (@NikeSupport) dedicated solely to handling customer questions and complaints. We used our company name and it's working well. The goal is to keep customer questions and comments in a single place. This helps you respond to your loyal fans quickly and efficiently, but it also reduces the risk of negativity in other feeds.


For example, our clients' Facebook pages often get flooded with questions and sometimes even negativity, as their customers need help to reach out. Once we added a separate X handle for support, everyone knew they could go there for queries and concerns. We recommend that you create a separate support handle for your brand. It doesn't take much time to complete, and it will make it easier to find and address negative comments.2. Using humor to respond to criticismWhile creating a separate handle for support is beneficial, we still found that some customers were a bit standoffish. Since we were focused on being funny, warm and welcoming, we took inspiration from the Joe Dough Sandwich Shop in NYC and sometimes used humor to deal with criticism.Humor should only be used for criticisms when the complaint isn't severe, and it's only appropriate if it matches your brand's tone and style. It's quite easy to trigger a backlash of unhappy customers if you aren't taking things seriously.When done well, humor diffuses a challenging and awkward situation. Joe Dough Sandwich Shop used this style to respond to a bad review on Yelp. The intelligent comment created a funny moment and boosted the brand's profile online. After a Yelp user complained that the meatball sandwich was the worst he'd ever had, the shop wrote about it on the chalkboard menu out front. People were commenting about how funny it was, which created more engagement.


If you plan to use humor to deal with complaints, we recommend doing it only when it makes sense. A comment of one sentence, such as ""this sandwich sucked,"" might fare well with a funny response, but someone who is raging over many paragraphs will likely need a more respectful and thought-out response.Related: What is Google Saying? Why a Positive Brand Reputation Online is So Important3. Showing that you're competentSometimes, a customer is angry so a polite response won't calm them. This has happened to us before, and it's disheartening to read those types of comments. However, ignoring them won't help — it might actually make things worse.One time, a person claimed our client offered terrible customer service. They went into great detail about their package deal and how they didn't assist them in making the arrangements they promised on the website. Ultimately, they were mistaken because the client didn't actually guarantee those things that were listed on the site.


We recommended that the client thank the person for their comment, directly address the issue and explain how they would fix the problem in the future so that no one else would be upset.Why did that work? Overall, we realized that viewers would see the person's comment and response and realize they were unreasonable. Though we appeased the original commenter by answering them, we also indicated to others that we were competent enough to handle all types of queries.4. Avoiding canned responses (even though it's easier)Investing in online reputation management is essential for all types of businesses, whether you're running a startup, a small company or a large corporation. You may think shortcuts like artificial intelligence (AI) are often a great way to respond to people's questions and needs, though they have their limits.You've likely heard of chatbots, which answer a customer's question without needing the human touch. It works well for traditional FAQs and other things but is not ideal for complaints.


When we observed clients switch from a human responder to a chatbot for review responses, we discovered that everything sounded canned (because it was). Though this isn't necessarily bad in some situations, it doesn't work for complaints because people want to feel heard.We then recommended that humans write the comments using scripts, but that still didn't work. Canned responses sound dull and often upset the commenter more. Therefore, it's always wise to have a real person craft the words. It might not be perfect, but it will offer a personalized touch.Related: Why Investing in Reputation Management is Crucial for Your Business StrategyThe bottom lineThough many tools are available to help you manage your online reputation, it's all about how you react to people's comments. There are bound to be negative reviews periodically, and you must decide how to respond.


Humor and sarcasm can be great comeback options. However, those only work when the issue isn't severe. Likewise, creating a separate support handle can be helpful because it keeps all the negativity or queries in one spot.Overall, you want to respond quickly to negative comments, avoid canned responses and explain how you'll address the issues customers bring up. Doing these things (and implementing any changes) shows that you care about the consumer and their experiences.Whether you use online reputation management tools, hire a separate staff member to write responses or tackle the job alone, acting quickly and responding professionally is crucial.

2,They Designed One Simple Product With a 'Focus on Human Health' — and Made $40 Million Last Year,"Apr 18, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/simple-health-focused-product-led-to-40m-in-revenue-in-2023/472859,"
Branch Basics founders Marilee Nelson, Allison Evans and Kelly Love ""never set out to sell soap,"" let alone launch a cleaning brand that would generate tens of millions in annual sales.But the company's ""mission to create healthy homes"" while keeping cleaning routines simple continues to resonate with customers — 50% of whom are returning, according to the brand. Among other select accessories, Branch Basics offers a comprehensive ""starter kit,"" which features a fragrance-free, ""plant- and mineral-based"" cleaning concentrate along with various glass bottles that can be filled with different combinations of the solution and water to meet specific needs: from wiping down a bathroom counter to doing a load of laundry.Image Credit: Courtesy of Branch Basics. Marilee Nelson, left; Allison Evans, center; Kelly Love, right.



The story of how the company came to be begins with Nelson, who, after battling chronic illness, was told that she'd never have kids and needed to go on dialysis. Nelson wasn't sold on the prognosis and turned to another doctor who used ""food as medicine"" — a leap of faith that ""literally changed her life,"" eradicating those health issues and even inspiring her to become a medicinal cook. Later, after her 10-year-old son was exposed to pesticides and suffered brain and immune system damage, she took another hard look at environmental factors that might contribute to healing.""His immune system had been so damaged that he could not detoxify the things we're all exposed to every day,"" Nelson says, ""and he would have extreme reactions. I took one box and thought, Oh, I'll keep my favorite perfumes in here, favorite skincare products and things, in the closet, and when he gets better, I will bring them back out."" However, according to Nelson, the box's removal made such a significant difference that it showed her ""how important it is to [recognize] how powerful these chemicals are."" Nelson's son started to heal, and when word of mouth spread, she developed a course to help other people better understand the products in their homes.


Related: How This Pediatrician-Turned-Entrepreneur Transformed a Health Policy into a Consumer Product for Kids""Of course, the type of fuel we put in our bodies matters for how we feel.""Nelson's niece, Allison, had a similar experience. Diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, Evans was told by doctors that ""no lifestyle change"" could help her heal and to take birth control indefinitely; in college, she faced a range of symptoms — muscle aches, loss of motor skills and more — and says she was prescribed numerous medications to no avail. At the time, Evans and her aunt Marilee weren't particularly close, but she consulted with her and realized that some simple lifestyle changes just might help her feel better.According to Evans, removing certain products with synthetic ingredients and eating whole foods did help her condition improve, and as graduation neared, she decided to spend eight weeks with Nelson in the Texas Hill Country, where she'd learn more about healthy living from her aunt. Her friend Kelly joined her, and despite being in good health, also noticed a transformation — ""My dry itchy eyes, headaches, muscle aches are all gone,"" Love recalls, adding, ""the more I learned about all this, it just made sense to me: Of course, the type of fuel we put in our bodies matters for how we feel, how we think, how we act.""

The organization also notes that even naturally occurring fragrances, such as citrus, ""can react to produce dangerous pollutants indoors.""


""Nontoxic"" labels on products aren't the be-all and end-all either, Nelson notes. After all, ""it's the dose that makes the poison,"" as the Swiss physician and chemist Paracelsus said nearly 500 years ago. According to Nelson, looking at the ingredients themselves is key. The founders want people to feel empowered to examine any product — from Branch Basics or another company — and understand the ingredients being used. To that end, they offer a $99 ""Toss the Toxins"" course to ""walk you through a step-by-step process to remove products that pollute your home and body.""Related: Go Green Or Go Home: 3 Ways Industrial Facilities Can Clean Up Their Acts""Our 32-ounce liquid concentrate cleans your windows, cleans your baby's bottom, cleans your produce.""Branch Basics' ""minimalist"" product line is meant to make the whole process easier — and save time.

""Our 32-ounce liquid concentrate cleans your windows, cleans your baby's bottom, cleans your produce, takes off your eye makeup, cleans your countertops [or] your hardwood floors — whatever depending on the the ratio,"" Evans adds.The approach is resonating with customers, the company reports. Gross sales grew around 42% year over year from 2022 to 2023, with revenue hitting $40 million last year. The company currently has more than 50,000 product subscribers, 600,000 email subscribers and 10,000 five-star reviews on its concentrate and Oxygen Boost, which amplifies the power of the concentrate ""for tough cleaning jobs.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Branch Basics""We know that human health is our priority...

What's more, Branch Basics boasts a 6% referral rate compared to the industry's 2% average.""We approach everything [by asking] What do we want?"" Love says. ""What's missing in the market? What do we, as people who are moms, as people who are health-conscious, need and want? Because, most likely, other people would need and want those things, too.

      Key Takeaways    



        The Masters is this week. You know what that means: an opportunity for attendees to buy merch.
      


        Items with the Masters logo have become elite status symbols.
      


        If you went to the Masters and didn't buy a mountain of swag to show off, did you truly go?
      



















Christian Petersen via Business Insider
Patrons at the Masters lug around multiple bags of merch, which can include the hottest item of them all: the Masters garden gnome.


 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. When the Masters golf tournament started this Thursday, those watching on TV were treated to the usual assortment of visuals: lush green grass, immaculate flower beds, and the world's greatest players putting on a show.



But an even fiercer competition will be raging behind the scenes: the battle for authentic Masters merch.Sure, seeing superstars like Tiger Woods and Scottie Scheffler in person is cool. But so is loading up on gear emblazoned with the Masters' famous yellow logo, which has become a cultlike beacon of status.


I had the good fortune of attending a Monday practice round for the Masters and could see the merch fervor up close and personal.When I showed up at Augusta National Golf Club with my family (shout-out to my dad, who secured the tickets after a decade-plus of lottery attempts), I quickly noticed the number of people already heading for the exit. They each had six to eight bags stuffed with shirts, hats, and towels, and many had the most highly sought-after item of them all: the Masters garden gnome.A close-up of the highly sought-after garden gnome. Christian Petersen via BI


The tournament allows for one reentry a day, so it's possible those people were going to drop their merch off in their car. But it wasn't lost on me that they might be part of a legion of resellers who make thousands marking up and flipping authentic items. To get an idea of how lucrative that can be, check out this 2023 Masters gnome listed for $1,200 on eBay. (Original price: $50.)Once we made our way further up the entry path, we saw the start of the line. It stretched back 50 feet from the actual entrance, which was followed by a series of winding metal gates reminiscent of a TSA checkpoint. Directly in front of the entrance, there was a sea of people standing shoulder to shoulder, trudging along, trying to make their way to the actual course. It reminded me of going between stages at a music festival. I would've snapped a picture of the hubbub, but the Masters' no-phone rule made it difficult to document the journey.Being in the main line feels a lot like waiting for a ride at Disney. Once you enter the building, there's a huge room and corridor with gates snaking around. The line seems to extend at every turn. What's another 20 minutes when that sweet merch is within grasp?After roughly 45 minutes, we made it to the actual shop. The final step is to wait for about five minutes in an entryway before they let in a new flood of shoppers.


Once you're inside, the mania is overwhelming. There are separate alcoved sections for men, women, and kids. A giant houseware display sits in the center of the store. Countless shirts and hats are displayed on the wall and busy workers rush to fetch items from bins stacked high with various sizes.There are several checkout lines, each with at least five registers on either side. The cashiers crank through piles of merch, run credit cards, then move on to the next. It's an impressive assembly line of capitalism.I ended up purchasing a polo shirt, a T-shirt, a hat, and a cup. Compared to almost everyone else around me, it felt like a meager haul, and I wound up toting around just a single bag for the rest of the day.A sea of people near the entrance of the Masters golf shop on Tuesday. Ben Jared via BIThe whole experience left me feeling like the Masters has become a retail juggernaut that just so happens to put on a golf tournament. And the numbers bear that out: The 2022 tournament raked in $69 million in revenue from merch, per Forbes, which was far more than it made from tickets and concessions.Attendance figures aren't made public, but the consensus is that about 40,000 people attend the tournament each day, which works out to each visitor spending an average of $246 at the merch store.But that assumes endless supply. A guy I met at my hotel said that last year, the store had to stop selling merchandise by Friday because of depleted inventory. It's also possible people are less merch-obsessed from Thursday to Sunday when the actual golf tournament is going on, so the Monday-through-Wednesday practice-round crowd could be driving up that average.


It seems more likely that the typical patron is ponying up even more than $246 — the people carrying six bags were surely toting five figures worth of swag.So in the end, what's it all for? The answer is pretty straightforward: street cred and status. Golf is already an expensive sport largely played by the affluent. For one to stand out in that already elite crowd, extreme measures must be taken. Lines must be waited in, and hundreds (thousands?) must be shelled out.Now if you'll excuse me, I need to head to the store wearing my new Masters hat.

        Kerr saw the demand for enamel pins in the artist community and thought the sales could help fund his daughter's 529.
      


        Within a few days of launching his site, he had an order for 1,000 pins from someone he ""had no link to at all.""

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Alchemy Merch owner Greg Kerr, who was working as a musician when he started selling custom pins in 2015. Today, Alchemy Merch is a full-time business that creates custom products for companies including Apple, Nickelodeon, National Geographic, Nike and more, as well as independent artists looking for ways to monetize their artwork in new ways.Image Credit: Courtesy of Alchemy Merch. Greg Kerr.When did you start your side hustle, and what inspired it? I'd been running a literary-inspired apparel brand, Miles to go, and had begun making enamel pins as one of the products we offered back in 2015. Some friends began asking me for help to get them made because of how confusing overseas production can be. Around that time, my wife and I decided we'd try to have a baby, and on the day we found out we were pregnant (Father's Day in 2016), I bought a domain for Pin Game Strong. I saw there was a demand for help within the artist community, and I initially thought if we could put a few hundred dollars into our daughter's 529, it would be a win. The original intention was that we'd keep running the apparel brand and help people make enamel pins on the side. I quickly recognized that there was a huge gap in the market to offer retail-quality merchandise. Everything was focused on promotional products, and with my background in running a brand, I thought it was important to focus on products people would be proud to bring to market. There was a need to go beyond promotional and into fully custom.



Related: This Insurance Agent Started a Side Hustle Inspired By Nostalgia for His Home State — Now It Earns Nearly $40,000 a MonthWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I'd seen a post on an episode of the Adventures in Design podcast talking about how someone should help people make pins. At that point, I had made thousands of pins for myself but hadn't thought about offering it as a service. I offered to help anyone interested and got a quick response. Word of mouth spread, and I saw that people wanted a safe outlet for making pins. Knowing we had a child on the way was the catalyst to buy a domain and throw together some pricing. I was familiar with how promotional products companies price their products and decided I'd try to beat them. Once the site was up, things started happening quickly, and within a few days, I had an order for 1,000 enamel pins from someone I had no link to at all.Image Credit: Alchemy MerchWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?As things started moving quickly, I had a lot of struggles with my time and how to balance it with the brand that had been paying my family's bills for the past few years. We went from $0 to $1 million in sales in 18 months, and it was just me. I did all of it: managing the business, handling all orders, communicating with factories and all art. It was a lot to handle. We didn't spend a cent on advertising in the first two years. Word of mouth was spreading and keeping me as busy as I could handle. My first step was to get some help on handling art files so I could keep working on customer interactions. I wish I'd looked for help sooner, but when I finally did get the help, it freed me up to focus on sales more.

How much did the side hustle earn? Within six months, we'd surpassed the monthly revenue of the brand I'd been working on for eight years prior — and it kept growing. Once we saw how quickly it was moving, the secondary goal became to replace my wife's income by the time she'd have to decide whether to go back to work or not after our daughter was born. We hit that goal and kept on running upward.You've since turned the side hustle into a full-time business, Alchemy Merch. What's been key to that growth, and what does revenue look like now? We hit a point where I needed to let go of the previous business so I could focus all of my time on making products for others. We started as Pin Game Strong and kept on adding new products in: patches, acrylic keychains, washi tape, etc., and the name just felt too limiting. We'd built up solid name recognition but knew it was time to grow beyond pins. Growth has been challenging for the past few years. When Covid hit, we got knocked back twice. First, we had delays in factories returning to work that caused a lot of refunds for events lined up. Then in March, they returned, and the U.S. got hit with lockdowns. A lot of our business is driven by events. Artists sell at fairs, cons and other events, and corporations will [make items] for conferences or team events. Pre-Covid, we were up only, and since then, we've been working hard to really focus on tightening up what we do and how we do it to help stand out. Although we have had growth the past two years, it's not until this year that we are seeing the energy back in people to create again.

6,What Damian Lillard Taught Me About Personal Branding,"Apr 11, 2024",Nicole Bernard,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-damian-lillard-taught-me-about-personal-branding/472150,"
For Christmas, we got my son two tickets to the Portland Trailblazers vs. Milwaukie Bucks game. We live about an hour from PDX, so technically, the Blazers are our home team. And we love them — always have. I grew up watching Clyde the Glide take on Jordan, Pippen and Grant in the 1992 finals (they lost to the Bulls, by the way). I'm not sure who was more excited about the tickets — me or my 10-year-old son!If you're unfamiliar with Damian Lillard, aka Dame Time, you should be! Drafted in the 1st round (6th overall) to the Blazers in 2012 from a small school in Utah, Damian has spent his entire career in Portland — until this season.When the opportunity to play with Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks came up, nobody could blame him for taking the opportunity for a chance to win a championship.



You would think the people of Portland, and Oregon, for that matter, would be mad.Far from it.


When my son and I went to the game, you could feel the love and appreciation for Damian. The organization even put half of its iconic Rip City structure in green in front of the Moda Center! It is typically red and black only.When they announced his name, there was a two-minute standing ovation. I have the video of it; I can prove it. Some signs read, ""Win Your Ring and Come Home,"" and many read, ""We Miss You."" Adidas dedicated a basketball court at their Portland campus to him the day before the game. It is the first and only time they have dedicated any building to an athlete. Portland was still selling Lillard jerseys (for twice the price of last year, I might add!)So, after seeing all of this and feeling love for him at the game. I wondered, what makes him so different? Why do people feel so connected to him?Related: I Emailed All 30 NBA Owners, Asking Them to Meet With Me. Here's What Happened.


What makes Dame differentHe has truly connected with his fans. But on a personal level. Yes, he shares pictures of his adorable children, his music and his brands on social media, but it's more than that.As mentioned above, he came from a small school. He has shared how he wasn't always sought after and how he had to work harder. He's shared how he had to put time behind the scenes when nobody was watching (or, quite frankly, cared) and didn't know if he would actually make it to the NBA.I feel like many of us can connect with that. Especially entrepreneurs. We put a lot of work in behind the scenes, and we're unsure if it will be enough.All athletes, celebrities, and mega-successful entrepreneurs are real humans, but we don't always get to see that side of them or really connect with them. Damian has brought us along for the ride.


In addition to his personal story, Damian has spent (a lot of) time giving back to the city of Portland. Not only is he the all-time leading scorer for the Blazers, but he also founded the Lillard Foundation, was highly involved in the RESPECT program in many PDX high schools, and gave his time to the Special Olympics. He is like a family member at college for a semester, and we're ready for him to come home.A few weeks ago, the Blazers played the Bulls in Chicago. Guess who was at the game? Dame Time. He literally drove from Milwaukee to Chicago to support his old team. For most people, a two-hour drive to see an NBA game wouldn't be that crazy, but for a professional athlete on a Monday night?That shows who Damian is. I honestly don't know how many professional athletes would do that on their night off. And that's why people love him. He shows that he cares. He gives without expectation.Related: 5 Simple Steps to Build a Personal Brand


How to improve your personal brand like Damian LillardMarketing will always be based on relationships. Creating them. Building them. Strengthening them. Enjoying them.Damian crushes this.Personal branding is becoming more important because people crave more connections (especially post-pandemic). And the fact is, like Dame Time, we all have a personal brand whether we like it or not, so it's advantageous to put some effort into your brand. We may not have his exposure, but we all have a story to tell. People to help. Dreams to pursue.A personal brand is so much more than your color scheme, tagline, or logo. It's your vibe. It's how you want to make people feel when they come across your social media platforms, sign up for your email list or browse your website. It's more than pictures of your products, travels or kids. Don't get me wrong, those are part of it, but it's how you make them feel.

7,Is the Company Tagline You Want to Use Already Someone Else's Trademark? Here's How to Avoid Legal Issues and Infringement.,"Apr 8, 2024",C. Lee Smith,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-avoid-the-pitfalls-of-trademark-infringement/471812,"
If you have developed a new product or service, the next step is to develop a memorable brand, or trademark and slogan. Before you begin displaying these on product packages or your website, take a few minutes to be sure each is available for use. If you don't, you may run into an expensive problem in the future.I'm talking about trademarks and the risk of infringing on someone else's legal rights.It takes only a few minutes to check whether the brand for your new product is already someone else's trademark or confusingly similar to a trademark in use. Start by quickly searching Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo and both of the major mobile app stores — Apple App Store and Google Play.



Don't stop there. To ensure the brand name or slogan is available, run a free search on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office website.You don't have to register your brand or trademark to start using it. In fact, the USPTO won't register your trademark unless and until you have products in the marketplace that bear that trademark. Trademark rights stem from your use of the trademark, not from registration.


This is good practical advice for any entrepreneur. But let me state upfront, for legal advice, you'll want to contact a good attorney specializing in intellectual property (IP).Related: Startups Must Protect Their Trademark. Here's How and WhyThe value of registered trademarksYou may be surprised to learn that you can register taglines and slogans as trademarks to protect your intellectual property. A registered trademark makes it easier to brand products and services and build up goodwill and recognition in the marketplace. Unique trademarks also reduce confusion.Business owners feel so strongly about protecting their IP that they submitted over 181,000 trademark applications in Q1 2024. Securing a registration for your trademark from the federal government requires paying a filing fee and either using an online service or hiring specialty attorneys to handle the paperwork — I recommend the latter. In addition, trademark owners must renew their trademark registrations every 10 years.


Trademark violationAs a small business owner, you may decide to start using a slogan you like without checking to see if it's available. Perhaps you think it'll be fine if you only serve a local market and the owner of the trademark operates somewhere else. But if the name or phrase has already been registered for use on or in connection with a product or service that's related to yours, you may be guilty of trademark infringement.You might believe it's clever to mimic a famous brand or registered slogan by making a small tweak. Unfortunately, courts often treat that usage as an infringement if the relevant public assumes, mistakenly, that your product or service is endorsed or sponsored by the company holding the registration or that you and your business are somehow affiliated with that business.You may wonder whether the threat of an infringement action matters. It does. If you are caught using a slogan that is the subject of or confusingly similar to someone else's registered trademark, don't be lulled into thinking you can ask for forgiveness instead of permission. Most business owners will be vigilant in protecting their investments. After all, they have spent years working to ensure that consumers or other target audiences associate the slogan with their company.Related: All You Need to Know About Using Trademarks for Your Business


Trademark holders are required to protect themPart of the responsibility of owning a trademark is protecting its use. If you don't, you lose your ability to enforce it when a direct competitor tries to steal it from you or uses a confusingly similar trademark. So, don't blame the trademark holders for sending you an email or a cease-and-desist notice. It's their obligation — and it's your misstep. The worst thing you can do is ignore this kind of communication and hope it goes away.I have invested significantly in trademarks as a way to brand my business. My registered slogans appear on my company's online and email marketing collateral. I've SEO-optimized my taglines to rank when potential customers are seeking the solutions we sell.I recently stumbled upon a business that was using one of my trademarks in an app store.When consumers search for my trademark, they may click the link that will lead them to a different app. That outcome, leading to a potential loss of revenue and misled customers, is exactly the kind of situation trademark rules are designed to protect against.


In this case, I proceeded with the assumption of positive intent. To address the problem, I wrote the infringers an email, explained what I discovered and asked them to stop using my trademarked product name. Fortunately, they agreed to cease and desist.Unfortunately, not all trademark violators respond so positively. In another situation, a direct competitor ignored my polite email messages regarding their illegal use of my registered trademark.I was particularly concerned in this case because there was a real risk of confusing potential customers. When I pointed out this concern, the violators did not apologize. Instead, they argued that there would be no confusion in the marketplace.My next step was to ask our legal counsel to reach out and explain the infringement. We continue to vigorously defend against this violation.Related: Do You Need to Copyright Your Logo? Here's What You Need to Know.If you, as a business owner, intend to use a certain wording, design, logo or slogan as a way to brand your product, take a few minutes to ensure that it's available and is not confusingly similar to someone else's trademark. Even better, develop and register your wording, design or logo.The law of trademarks protects the intellectual property of the owner. Avoiding customer and revenue loss are the primary goals. Regardless of whether the illegal use occurs in the local market or on a national scale, or is accidental or intentional, entrepreneurs must be careful to avoid using someone else's trademark or something that is confusingly similar.

8,6 Ways to Pioneer Creative Content with AI the Right Way,"Apr 8, 2024",Jaxon Parrott,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-pioneer-creative-content-with-ai-the-right-way/471914,"
Creative marketing teams integrating AI into their content production process face a unique set of challenges, especially regarding audience and customer perception. Against the backdrop of the widespread adoption of GenAI, authenticity and human connection are emerging as essential values with a large percentage of the public. As a result, the way brands use AI can significantly affect their reputations.Media brands have always been at the forefront of creative innovation. AI offers an exciting new toolset, promising to streamline workflows, unlock new forms of expression and personalize content at scale. But there's a fine line between using AI to augment creativity and relying on it in ways that may seem inauthentic or impersonal to their target audiences.The recent backlash from fans of the BBC sci-fi TV series Doctor Who against some promotional emails written by GenAI illustrates the potential danger for brands whose creative teams use the technology to produce their content. In the case of Doctor Who, it was a relatively small-scale use — just a little bit of AI-generated text to promote the show's upcoming season.



Fans of the show, which ranks as the single most successful science-fiction TV series of all time (based on broadcast ratings, DVD and book sales), reacted negatively so strongly that the BBC ceased the campaign immediately and promised never to use AI to create promotional content for Doctor Who again.The opposition among Doctor Who fans to AI-generated text is consistent with recent polls indicating that worldwide public trust in AI has dropped from 61% to 53% since 2019, according to a survey of 32,000 people worldwide conducted by the PR consulting firm Edelman.


In the US, trust levels for AI are even lower, with just 35% percent of people now saying they trust the tech, whereas 50% said they did five years ago. The downward trend in trust has continued through the so-called ""AI revolution"" launched with OpenAI's release of ChatGPT in 2022. This negative public perception recently led the technology market research firm Gartner to predict that, by 2027, ""20% of brands will lean into positioning and differentiation based on messaging the absence of AI in their businesses and products.""Related: How AI Is Transforming HealthcareYou can't stop progressLet's face it, though. If the history of technology is any guide, GenAI's promise to increase productivity and even enhance creativity makes its continued widespread adoption among marketing teams practically inevitable.As with any powerful new technology, GenAI brings risks that must be carefully considered and managed. For marketers and their creative teams, the importance of genuine human personality is paramount, so GenAI's potential impacts on brand perception remain a front-and-center concern.


It takes a thoughtful approach to understanding audience and customer concerns about AI-generated content that revolves around several key issues — authenticity and originality. Does the content genuinely reflect human experience, or is it a cold, algorithmic output? Does it maintain the uniqueness and original voice that audiences value in creative work?To address these critical concerns, I recommend six principal pillars that inform how marketers integrate GenAI into their operations, guiding our work at Presspool.ai. We work with talented creative marketing teams from various industry verticals and have observed first-hand how they are adopting GenAI with varying degrees of confidence and success. Regardless of the size or nature of the business, these same six principles apply.1. Be transparent about AI usageTransparency is crucial. Communicate with your audiences how and why AI is used in content creation. This openness can help mitigate fears of inauthenticity, as it shows a commitment to honesty and integrity in the creative process.2. Use AI as a tool, not a replacementEmphasize AI's role as a tool that enhances rather than replaces human creativity. Highlighting stories of human-AI collaboration in creating compelling content reassures audiences that the heart and soul behind the work remain fundamentally human.


Related: AI vs. a Human Touch: Finding The Right Balance When It Comes to Branding3. Foster open dialogueEngage with your audiences to understand their views on AI in content creation. This can be done through surveys, social media engagement, or public forums. An open dialogue helps address concerns directly and adapt your AI strategy based on audience feedback.4. Prioritize ethical AI useEnsure that AI technologies adhere to ethical standards, especially with regard to copyright. Using AI ethically reinforces your brand's commitment to upholding creative integrity.Related: AI Isn't Evil–But Entrepreneurs Need to Keep Ethics in Mind As They Implement It


5. Educate your audienceMany negative perceptions of AI stem from misunderstandings about the technology. Educational initiatives that demystify AI and explain its role in enhancing creativity can shift audience perceptions from skepticism to curiosity and acceptance.6. Highlight the benefitsFocus on the benefits of AI-assisted content, such as increased personalization, accessibility and the exploration of new creative frontiers. Demonstrating the value that AI adds to the audience experience can help win over skeptics.Integrating AI into content production is a delicate balancing act for marketing teams. While the innovation potential is vast, so is the need for sensitivity to audience perceptions. Media brands can navigate potential pitfalls by approaching AI integration with transparency, ethical consideration and a commitment to genuine human creativity.Ultimately, the goal is to use AI not just as a tool for efficiency but as a catalyst for exploring new dimensions of creativity, with human imagination and emotion at its core.

9,This Is the Framework You Need to Create a Brand Worth Your Customers' Loyalty and Make More Money Doing It,"Apr 8, 2024",Jonathan Brierre,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-create-a-brand-worth-your-customers-loyalty/471134,"
Storytelling has been an inherent part of human culture since the dawn of time. We both share our stories with the world and take in the stories of others. Either way, stories shape our perspectives and, thus, our shared reality. Furthermore, a compelling story is provocative and emotionally resonant. Frankly, no one ever remembers a bad or boring story unless it's to recall how bad or boring it is.This is particularly true when it comes to marketing and building websites. Compelling storytelling in this context is significant for making your brand stand out in the sea of others. Not only will an effective brand story improve user engagement, but it will also enhance overall brand loyalty and, thus, conversions.But how do we craft such a narrative for our sites? When consulting with my clients, I always introduce them to the Hero's Journey framework. In applying this framework to our websites and funnel pages, we take our prospects through narratives they can resonate with, thus encouraging them to take action with our services.



Related: The Hero's Journey Is Your Path to Winning Over Customers for LifeThe Hero's Journey: A quick overviewPopularized by the American writer Joseph Campbell, The Hero's Journey outlines a universal pattern of adventure and transformation in storytelling traditions worldwide. This narrative arc involves a hero embarking on an adventure, facing and overcoming challenges and returning transformed.


When we apply this framework to our marketing copy and website design, we need to position the site visitor as the hero of the story. From there, your brand is the guide or sage that helps the hero through their hardships and catalyzes transformation.Applying the hero's journey to your website1. The call to adventure: Engage visitors immediatelyYour website's homepage should act as a call to adventure, instantly engaging visitors by presenting a relatable challenge or aspiration. Such a challenge could be a prominent problem your target audience faces, which your brand promises to solve. You capture their interest from the outset by aligning with their initial search intent.2. Introducing the hero and the guide: Building a connection


In the context of your website, the hero is your visitor. Make it clear that you understand their challenges and desires early on. Then, introduce your brand as the guide, an expert ally equipped with the wisdom (your services or products) to help them overcome their obstacles. This positioning builds trust and establishes a personal connection with your audience.3. The journey: Mapping the user experienceAs you build out the different pages in your user experience, consider each page a chapter in the hero's story you're creating. Map out your website's layout to mirror their exploration for answers. Each page should ideally address a challenge they face and how your offerings can address it. You can achieve this by outlining steps, highlighting advantages and presenting testimonials and case studies.4. Challenges and trials: Demonstrating value


Pointing out the difficulties and obstacles your hero could encounter is an excellent way of showing that you're both on the same page (remember, empathy). You can also demonstrate how your product or service provides the necessary solutions, thus emphasizing the worth of your offering and strengthening the narrative's emotional connection.5. The transformation: Showcasing successEnsure your website vividly illustrates the transformation that customers experience after using your product or service. Do this by showcasing before-and-after scenarios, success stories and testimonials. Visitors must see the potential for their transformation, as it motivates them to take action.6. The return: Encouraging action


The culmination of the Hero's Journey on your website should lead to clear, compelling calls to action (CTA). Whether it's making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter or booking a consultation, CTAs are the steps that lead to transformation.Related: 5 Tips to Boosting Your Website Conversions (and Why It Matters)More principles for maximizing engagement and conversionsBeyond the Hero's Journey, maximizing engagement relies on presenting our stories in ways that appeal to the site visitor. Now, we are talking about paying attention to design, usability and overall content quality. When optimizing our websites, be sure to ask these four questions.Is it smooth? It often takes a designer's eye to ensure that the right elements are in the right place. Nonetheless, having an intuitive, uncluttered and user-friendly website is paramount to driving conversions. It doesn't matter how compelling your story is if your website is unusable and unappealing.


Is it streamlined? We want to ensure that our pages are as streamlined as possible, avoiding multiple narratives and redundancy. When leading a user to a CTA, it's ideal to present one CTA at a time. Especially on our landing and funnel pages, showing multiple CTAs at once often leads to confusion and a lack of focused engagement.Is it stellar? Blending a focused narrative with engaging content will inevitably draw prospects deeper into your brand. Be sure to include vivid imagery, video and engaging copy to reel people in. Remember, no one remembers a boring story! So, aim to be memorable, not mundane.Is it split-tested? Don't expect your first few web pages to be perfect. Continuous split testing is the key to creating a website that converts. Test different aspects of your website to see what engages your audience the most. Test everything from headline copy to imagery, CTAs or even the website as a whole.Related: How to 'Split Test' Your Website to Engage Online Customers Better


ConclusionThere is undoubtedly an art to compelling storytelling. As with any art form, understanding the basic principles is the key to finding mastery.Whether you're a personal brand or representing a giant corporation, your storytelling influences how the world perceives and receives you. By applying the right storytelling principles to your websites, you'll be sure to not only make more money, but also create a brand worth remembering.

10,How to Better Manage Your Brand's Reputation in the Digital Age,"Apr 5, 2024",Kevin King,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-better-manage-your-brands-reputation-in-the-digital/471895,"
It was a salutary tale of how not to do reputation management. The skincare brand Sunday Riley was forced to settle with the Federal Trade Commission after its leadership had directed employees to post fake reviews to the influential Sephora website and dislike negative reviews to have them taken down. Review manipulation is a growing phenomenon. In 2023, Amazon took 44 bad actors to court in Europe, and this year won a civil case in Milan against a review broker that had tried to facilitate five-star ratings on Amazon's Italian store. At a time when trust among consumers is precariously low, manipulating online ratings can destroy public confidence in a brand.For the past 30-plus years in the hospitality industry, perhaps the pioneer in online reviews, I have seen many scenarios of both good and bad reputation control. As social influence and social proof amplify traditional word of mouth and media influence, negative news and negative feedback can spiral out of control — and fast. However, with so many booking platforms and social channels today, it's nearly impossible to manually flag individual reviews. Companies need a more positive, ethical and proactive approach to lifting standards and addressing public concerns.Related: Don't Fall Victim to a Digital Hitman — Here Are 6 Ways to Protect Your Online Reputation From Fake Reviews



Strive for authenticityFor better or worse, the ""wisdom of the crowd"" is holding sway over where people are spending their money. After the Edelman Trust Barometer declared 2022 ""the cycle of distrust"" among consumers, things hardly improved last year as economic optimism at large collapsed. Online reviews have increasingly occupied this trust void, with Tripadvisor finding they are the biggest factor influencing buying decisions for 66% of U.S. consumers.The flip side for businesses like hotels is one negative review can set off a chain of complaints that drive down new bookings, customer loyalty and revenue; and drive up operational costs. Nor is consumer trust blind. Tripadvisor found that 49% of consumers worldwide believed brands manipulated reviews, while Boston University research concluded that people were more likely to trust four-star reviews because they were perceived as more thoughtful and accurate. A separate study found that purchases peak in the 4.0-4.7 ratings band and then declined the closer they got to 5.0.


All these findings constellate around the perception of brand authenticity, and in the sometimes fickle world of online reviews, this may be the most valuable currency of all.Become your own influencerOver the last few years, we have witnessed influencers reaching a massive audience when they review just about anything — hotels included. Cleanliness issues lead to live-streamed disputes with staff, making any real or imagined wrongdoing painfully public. Virality on apps like Instagram, X (formerly Twitter) or TikTok amplifies their disproportionate power.During Paris Fashion Week, influencers let the world know that local businesses, especially hotels, were infested with bedbugs. While the pest problem may have been growing well before the event, it was only when influencers posted about the issue that it gained traction. For retailers and brands, high-volume events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday or Amazon Prime Day represent both risk and opportunity. If their websites, supply chains and customer service are not prepared, even a few hours of downtime can do major damage to their reputation.The cost of negative publicity is staggering. Peloton saw almost $1.5bn wiped off its value after a backlash against its ill-advised Christmas advertisement went viral. There is a thin margin between success and failure, and according to internal research that I was shown by a leading reputation-management company in Europe, hotels can expect a 20% revenue drop if their online rating dips from 7.0 to 6.9 on Booking.com. The answer is to actively monitor customer feedback and take immediate steps to remedy negative sentiment.


Related: Being Attacked Online? Online Reputation Expert Shares How You Can Defend YourselfHow to better manage online reputationsWhile businesses are extremely sensitive to negative online reviews, the opposite is also true with positive online reviews leading to improved reputations. That is borne out by the ""Very Good 8+"" criteria being one of the most used search filters on Booking.com. To increase the likelihood of positive reviews, practice these four strategies:Implement service recovery: Asking for feedback at multiple touchpoints can help companies identify recurrent issues. In one internal study by a luxury hotel brand, a customer's satisfaction score went up by 13.8% when they were asked to complete both in-stay and post-stay surveys.Increase review volume: Invest in review generation programs that make it easy for customers to leave ratings and feedback immediately after an interaction or purchase.Create targeted team responses: Segment feedback data and ensure the right teams get actionable insights matching their roles and responsibilities.Stay away from review manipulations: The short-term increase in revenue and visibility might seem great, but the risk is too high. Even if competitors are involved in review manipulation, it is never worth the risk.Adopt data-breach response strategies: With retail and hospitality so dependent on tech, a response plan for data breaches is essential. It should provide transparent communication with consumers about a breach and the planned steps to fix it.Related: Why You Must Monitor Your Online Reputation Before it Hurts You


From investment to impactThe UK hospitality management company, RBH, uses a third-party solution that collates and analyzes thousands of reviews and post-stay surveys to identify weak spots and trends in feedback. With rich data at its disposal, the group found that just a one-point increase in Global Review Index (GRI) score could lead to a revenue increase of £3 million ($US3.8 million) across its 45-plus hotels.Reputation-management software helps brands understand what issues to address based on sentiment analysis in order to reduce negative ratings over time as this space continues to evolve. The review market share of Google, Yelp, Booking.com and Tripadvisor has shifted a lot over the past five years — and if Instagram added reviews to its functionality, it would change again overnight. Businesses dependent on public ratings cannot afford to stand still. A proactive approach that leverages the latest data tools can safeguard reputations as consumers continue to vote with their ratings.

In 2022, Elenor Mak, now founder of doll company Jilly Bing, was busy balancing her business development role at a healthcare company and raising her 2-year-old and 4-year-old children. Back then, she ""was definitely not looking to start"" a side hustle. She'd founded an ecommerce fashion company in the past and knew what it took to get a business up and running. But that changed when her young daughter Jillian began playing with stuffed animals and dolls.Image Credit: Courtesy of Jilly Bing. Elenor Mak.""It reminded me of my own childhood,"" Mak tells Entrepreneur. ""You're playing with dolls; you're trying to make sense of the world.

""They gave them an Asian name, like Ling, or like a bad haircut.

Although she admits the creative component wasn't where she excelled (""My 6-year-old son is a better artist than me,"" she quips), she had a clear vision when it came to the business side and the potential for major demand: ""The Asian American population is one of the fastest-growing — we're 7% of the country's population.""And how hard could it be to make a doll in an age where we're churning out Teslas and developing AI? She recalls thinking. As it turns out, ""it's really hard — really hard — to make a good doll,"" Mak says. Fortunately, her business background helped her develop an essential ""superpower"": ""finding really good people."" Mak did cold outreaches to Asian designers at large toy brands and leveraged her own extensive network to connect with professionals who could bring the dream to life.

Mak conducted a lot of research over the next several months, speaking with Asian families and looking at photographs of kids and dolls to really try to understand what parents wanted. ""It's not just about saying, 'Oh, this doll's Asian,'"" Mak says. ""But what mattered to them? What were the features? What were the backstories?"" In December of that year, the prototype for Jilly Bing, named for Mak's daughter Jillian and the Chinese word for cookie, ""bing gan"" (Jillian's first word), was ready to share with the world.Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a Month""Adult women would write in and be like, 'Oh my gosh, it's like healing for my inner child.'""Jilly Bing started shipping dolls in August 2023 — and sold out of its stock of 2,000 within six weeks.

At that point, Mak realized the ""high-risk, high-effort"" passion project she'd worked on as a side hustle for the past couple of years — taking late-night business calls after her kids were asleep and balancing it all with her full-time day job — would benefit from her undivided attention.Jilly Bing also appeared on the Today show around that time, and the positive response was ""overwhelming."" ""Adult women would write in and be like, 'Oh my gosh, it's like healing for my inner child. Life would have been so different if I had a doll that looked like me growing up,'"" Mak says. ""Even non-Asian parents writing [in to say], 'Oh my gosh, I think my kids should have dolls that look like their friends.'""By early this year, Jilly Bing was on shelves at Macy's; the retailer reached out after the Today segment. ""It's a company I grew up with,"" Mak says, ""so it was just really wonderful that they saw the value of Jilly Bing so early on.""

""And hearing the stories [from them] — and my own daughter — saying, 'She looks like me. She has black hair like me.' [And] little Asian boys saying, 'She's beautiful like my mama.'

Mak had to ""trust her gut"" to start the side hustle turned full-fledged business that's leaving its mark on the toy industry and beyond, and she looks forward to building the brand out in the years to come.""I am most excited about being able to create characters,"" Mak says. ""We started to branch into comics because it's a doll, but we're starting to create the stories. I've got a vision of a whole cast of Asian American characters that actually reflect what Asian America looks like today. We have mixed Asian children, you have boys, you have Southeast Asian. Jilly's our first doll, so I'm excited to grow and introduce the world to the rest of Jilly Bing's friends.""

12,Why DEI Still Matters for Small Businesses and Startups,"Mar 28, 2024",Murali Nethi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-dei-still-matters-for-small-businesses/471543,"
All businesses want to succeed, but there is something many of them may not realize can support their growth. They say diversity is our strength as a society and encourages new ideas and perspectives. Well, I am here to tell you that the same things — diversity, equity and inclusion — can give businesses an edge. Some small company owners may think focusing on making sure their business and culture are unbiased, fair and welcoming to all types of people is just about being politically correct. Let's see how centering on these values — what I will call DEI for short — can truly help startups and smaller companies be stronger and more profitable over the long run.Related: Prioritize DEI and Crush Your ROI Goals — How Inclusive and Authentic Marketing Drive Business GrowthAttracting top talent is getting more competitiveOne big reason why DEI is important for small businesses is because attracting top talent is constantly becoming more competitive. Nowadays, when people, especially the younger generation, are looking for jobs, they do not just look at pay and benefits. They also want to work for companies whose values match their own. Top candidates may leave a small business or startup to work for organizations that value DEI; hence, the latter risk losing out on excellent applicants. As smaller businesses look to expand, having an inclusive culture and a diverse team can help them attract the most incredible talent available.



A better reflection of your customer baseHaving a more diverse workforce can help you better understand and service a broad consumer base, which further motivates startups to focus on DEI. It will be more difficult for employees to relate to and address customers' demands from different backgrounds if they all have similar experiences. On the other hand, a diverse team of employees from various backgrounds may offer insightful advice on connecting with and pleasing clients from all backgrounds. More satisfied customers and growth prospects will follow from this.Related: The Burden of Breaking Barriers is Pushing Black Leaders to Breaking Point. This DEI Expert Reveals Where We Are Going Wrong.


Improved creativity and innovationResearch repeatedly shows that having a varied group of people with different viewpoints, experiences and backgrounds fosters greater creativity and more creative problem-solving. A workplace where all views are heard can help spark innovative solutions that may not originate from a homogeneous group. This is beneficial for smaller companies and startups that are attempting to remain dynamic and come up with fresh ideas. Diverse perspectives produce more creative products, services and methods, essential for any expanding business.Setting the right example for othersEven if your small business is just starting now, you can set the right example when it comes to DEI from the beginning. While some established companies may find it hard to change their culture, new startups can build inclusion into their foundations. Leading with strong DEI practices from day one allows you to attract like-minded customers, partners and investors who want to support companies demonstrating fairness and equality. It also prepares you to be a responsible community member and role model for positive change as your company succeeds.Related: 4 Ways Inclusive Leaders Can Respond to the Weaponizing of DEILegal and regulatory complianceFocusing on DEI for small businesses is also essential simply for legal and regulatory compliance reasons. As anti-discrimination laws and regulations continue to strengthen over time, companies of all sizes must ensure equitable policies and an inclusive culture. This reduces the risks of unfair treatment claims that can damage brands or result in lawsuits. Having defined DEI best practices and annual training shows that even a young company is operating ethically and by the law from the start.Some practical ways small companies can improve DEI:Commit from the top. The CEO and other top leaders must fully support and champion DEI from day one. They will need to communicate to all employees that promoting diversity and inclusiveness is a core value of the company. Leaders must provide the motivation and resources for DEI efforts to take root within the organization truly. When managers demonstrate their investment in these issues through their words and actions, it will encourage everyone else to get on board.Support employee resource groups. Employee resource groups (ERGs) allow workers with shared backgrounds or life experiences to connect, raise awareness on issues impacting their communities, and advise company leaders. Small teams can sponsor one or two ERGs made up of volunteers. This allows employees to lead in promoting inclusion from peer to peer while getting necessary support and visibility from high levels.Audit hiring and promotion practices. To address potential biases or inequities, small businesses must examine how they hire, develop and promote workers. Companies can review applicants and leadership demographics over the past few years. Do these numbers properly represent the diverse pools of talented individuals in their industry and community? Are there patterns indicating unfair barriers that held some groups back from equal opportunities? By reflecting on hiring metrics, businesses gain insight into whether implicit prejudices need addressing to establish a more just system open to all.My advice would be to analyze how balanced and welcoming your business is, look for low-cost ways to enhance fairness and continue working on DEI as your operation expands. If you prioritize DEI and focus even a little each month on improvements, your business will be on the right track to attracting and keeping talent and customers for the long run.

14,Want Success? Invest in Your Biggest Enemy,"Mar 26, 2024",Jon Michail,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/want-people-to-follow-you-invest-in-yourself/471357,"
When most people think, talk or try to research investment, they often focus on opportunities in areas like real estate and stocks. For many people, investment is all about financial gains. Of course, pursuing and building an investment portfolio that would yield financial gains is a commendable feat. Yet, an investment that is equally as important, if not more, is self-investment.Self-investment is hard because one can often be their own worst enemy, as they are intimately aware of their weaknesses and insecurities, which can lead to self-doubt and self-sabotage. Their inner critic often amplifies their fears and magnifies their failures, hindering their progress and potential for growth.According to Warren Buffet, one of the most successful and wealthiest men in the world, ""The best investment you can make is an investment in yourself… The more you learn, the more you'll earn."" This statement is not cliché; it is straightforward and practical, but people still often overlook the importance of self-investment.



Whether you want to earn the highest figures, reach the peak of your professional career or become a better person overall, investing in yourself is non-negotiable. It's that sort of investment that yields a substantial gain every time.Now that we're in a constantly and rapidly evolving era, self-investment — an investment in personal development and self-growth, is the best insurance policy for these challenging times. Here are some instances of how self-investment can set you up to nurture growth, personal fulfillment and career success.


Enhancing personal growth and developmentIt's impossible to talk about self-investment without its impact on personal growth and development. Self-investment involves using available resources to improve your overall well-being. This goes beyond formal education; self-investment sets one on a path of continuous learning and development by pursuing passions, curiosity and innate skills. Apart from the apparent rewards, those who remain dedicated cultivate adaptability and resilience — the ability to be flexible, composed and decisive in crucial times. These traits are essential for anyone who will successfully navigate today's competition and uncertainty.By investing in their personal growth and development, individuals become self-aware and authentic to their true selves. This sets the foundation for a purposeful and successful life.Related: Want to Succeed? Learn to Say 'No'Promoting mental and physical well-beingMost people are not proactive, paying little to no attention to their mental and physical well-being in pursuing success until a problem arises, and then they react. People often believe their physical and psychological well-being must suffer if they're to attain success until a problem arises. This couldn't be farther from the truth; to give yourself the best chance of achieving your goals, your mental and physical well-being has to be in the best conditions possible. By investing in your mental and physical well-being, you get to


Sustain your energy and productivity for longer periods due to improved fitness levels.Cultivate the habit of remaining focused and peaceful because you know how to manage stress.Operate at your optimal level and give your best effort daily because you're well-rested.By investing in a sound mind and body, you strengthen your cognitive and problem-solving skills, thereby increasing your chances of excelling in your ambitions.Facilitating financial excellenceWhile it's true that the reward for most investments is money, self-investment promises more than just financial gains. Self-investment helps nurture a healthy relationship with the pursuit of money. You can create feasible financial goals because you understand the importance of savings and planning. The result is that it almost looks like you earn more than you do because you still have enough to pursue your goals and aspirations. By investing in yourself, you equip yourself with the basics and foundational knowledge necessary to live the life you aspire for.Advancing your careerGlobal incidents in the last couple of years, like the pandemic, have emphasized that the modern workplace is dynamic. You can't afford to stay stagnant. However, when you consciously invest in yourself, you plug yourself into lifelong learning and the perfection of your strengths. By so doing, even when there are disruptions, you're well equipped not just to cope and stay relevant but also to use such disruptions to further advance your career.Also, proper self-investment allows you to refine your skill set continuously, thus giving you the right to establish yourself as a thought leader in your industry.


Related: Why You Need to Invest in Your Happiness (and How to Do It)Improving social and emotional intelligenceThe success and meaning of every relationship, whether personal or business, are determined by those involved's social and emotional intelligence. By investing in yourself, you develop the ability to communicate effectively. Improved emotional intelligence means not only knowing what to say and when to inspire those around you, but you're also able to gracefully manage and resolve conflicts, thereby making you a professional and distinguished leader. This modern day is characterized by diversity, so interpersonal skills, empathy and emotional regulation are needed to navigate social complexities with grace successfully.Building legacy and impactThe final reason we're going to discuss self-investment is the subsequent impact such a person can have in the community. By striving to become the best possible version of ourselves, we spread our impact and influence across our immediate environment. This impact can come from providing resources, mentorship or philanthropy to drive progress and build a legacy in society. To put this in simple terms, the better we become as individuals, the better our contributions and services to society will be.Related: 4 Ways to Begin Investing in Yourself


ConclusionIt's worth remembering that the best investment anyone can make is to invest in themselves. This is particularly important in our present-day society, where material success and external validation are primarily the order of the day. An investment in core values like self-development and purpose-driven growth will set anyone apart. Not only does self-investment set you apart, but you also give yourself a better advantage in achieving all your goals while living a prosperous and fulfilling life.In navigating the challenges of our modern society, we should always remember that our greatest investment lies in treasures within. When leaders and entrepreneurs embrace and practice this reality, they realize their 'value' possibilities in new and inspiring ways.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dr. Jenny Woo, educator and founder of Mind Brain Emotion, the company behind a line of card games and other tools for the development of emotional intelligence. The story has been edited and condensed for clarity. There's some research that shows that today's college students are way less emotionally intelligent compared to those a decade ago. And this research was done before the pandemic, so you can imagine what that looks like post-pandemic. I've also seen a lot of research on the impact of distance learning and social isolation, where adults and kids just don't have the same opportunity to interact with people. For kids, this translated into social anxiety and regression [in] communication skills and language, and just that unwillingness to connect with people.Image Credit: Courtesy of Mind Brain Emotion. Dr. Jenny Woo.



I've done management consulting for Fortune 500 companies, and through working with senior leaders, I found that soft skills in the workplace are not quite emphasized, which really impacts the health of an organization's team. When I was researching this area at the children's level, I realized, Oh my gosh, these are the skills that basically weren't really taught or discussed in school. So, while at the Harvard Innovation Labs, I took a research-backed approach to develop a tool in the form of a card game that anybody could enjoy — you don't have to go to school or anything. (I wanted to do something that was easy and accessible because I'm the first one in my family to graduate college.)Related: This Gen Zer's Stylish Side Hustle Earns About $20,000 a Month and Paid Off His Parents' $200,000 Debt: 'I Enjoy the Hands-Off Nature'


The development of my first card deck, which launched in May 2018 with the help of a Kickstarter campaign, stemmed from a combination of education research and industry experience. I was in a master's program in education that was focused on the intersection of cognitive science, neuroscience, education and child development, and I guess psychology sprinkled in there. I started with the 52 Essential Conversations to really help people have purposeful conversations in an authentic and vulnerable way. This would be parents with children, adult parents and grandparents with children in school. It's almost like the pearls of wisdom that you want to leave someone close to you — to feel good that they're set for life and can make responsible decisions.I didn't even really think about developing more card decks, but organically, as I was testing the game out with users and gathering these case studies, understanding how people are actually engaging and interacting with it, I realized that in order to even begin to have these vulnerable, heart-to-heart conversations, you need to have that trust, respect and understanding first. And so that is where I created the second deck, which is the Relationship Skills deck — to help people go back to the drawing board, connect with each other and build that caring trust necessary to even have a conversation. I released that one in January 2019.Related: Her 'Crude Prototype' and $50 Craigslist Purchase Launched a Side Hustle That Hit $1 Million in Sales — Now the Business Generates Up to $20 Million a YearAmazon is a platform that's continuously growing in terms of people who rely on the service, so selling there is a no-brainer. These days, I launch a new deck every four to six months on Amazon, and the sales bring in $33,000 a week. I have other streams of income as well. I lecture at the University of California, Irvine. I'm lecturing but also providing a service through my online course as Mind Brain Emotion, my company. So every quarter I teach, and they pay me directly per person taking my online course. We do some real estate too.


I speak a lot to entrepreneurship classes at the graduate college level, and one time I got this question from someone: ""Can you start a business if you're not really passionate about what you're selling if it will make a lot of money?"" My answer is, ""Why would you want to do that?"" My advice is to do something that you're truly passionate about and hopefully passionate about for a long, long time because it is a grind. You're going to get negative customer reviews, which is like a death sentence for a business. And you have to love what you're doing enough to just pick yourself up and keep going. That also goes into knowing what your values are; you're going to have so many dilemmas and decisions that you need to make, and in order to weigh the pros and cons, you have to go back to your values and what's important to you.Related: Learn How You Can Take Advantage of Amazon's Advertising Tools to Get More Eyes on Your BusinessAdditionally, as a solopreneur, you don't know what you don't know, and that's one of the biggest challenges I see when I talk to other entrepreneurs. Sometimes you could be so in love with your idea, but it's really important to talk to as many people as you can and listen to the customer first before yourself or the product to understand if this is meeting a need and if there are demands for this product.Looking for your next side hustle?

16,AI is the Antithesis of Authenticity — But There's Hope. Here's How We Can Align Our Human Values with AI.,"Mar 20, 2024",Sunny Dublick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-align-human-values-with-artificial-intelligence/470900,"
Everyone's talking about AI. There's excitement, fear, apprehension, confusion… let's just say a lot of mixed emotions.The plus side is the concept of saving money and eliminating redundancies. I've worked with many organizations that are using ChatGPT to write their copy or create procedures for their organization. Generative AI gets smarter and more accurate over time as it learns, so surely the future is ripe with possibilities for how businesses can use this.Something about it has felt yucky to me from the start, though.



It began with conversations I had with friends in the marketing industry about fears their livelihoods would be affected. Who wants to pay a graphic designer when you can get AI to make you a logo? Who needs a copywriter when you have ChatGPT? A lot of creatives feel uneasy, and understandably so. Are our skills so easily replaced?Look at the recent actor's strike or the Sarah Silverman-led lawsuit about ChatGPT. Anytime AI comes up, copyright concerns are right along with it. Today's news was an article about fears AI could use deepfakes to influence the upcoming election. It's clear the uncertainty surrounding how we use AI technology is everywhere. One of the biggest concerns is who's steering the ship. With regulation low and possibility oh so high, how do we know how to use it? What is cringe-worthy (I'm looking at you people using AI-generated LinkedIn headshots), and what is acceptable?


Related: AI Is Coming For Your Jobs — Anyone Who Says Otherwise Is In Denial. Here's How You Can Embrace AI to Avoid Being Left Behind.I recently read that some companies are now using AI influencers on Instagram. They look 100% human and even get brand deals to promote their products, such as clothing and hair care. Again, I am talking about a robot here (have I entered the Matrix?). Something about this struck a deep chord with me. It felt deceptive and, frankly, lazy.I am a human who values authenticity very highly. To me, AI is the antithesis of authenticity. Using ChatGPT to write content feels like having a friend do my homework. Using AI to create graphics feels like a slight to all the talented creatives I know. I struggled with my resistance though: was I like my parents who didn't want to sign up for an email address or the internet because they thought it was just a fad?In an effort to not make myself a technology dinosaur, I posed myself this question, and I invite you to do the same:How can I use AI in a way that is aligned with my values?When I ask myself questions like: would I want to read content by others created with ChatGPT? My answer is no. So, I write all my own content. How would I feel about AI creating my headshots? No, again. So I hired a photographer, putting out my photos unfiltered.In business and in life, I value creativity, authenticity, quality and fun. When I return to this — when I root myself in the question of how to utilize technology in a way that is in line with my values — the answer becomes crystal clear.I use AI for inspiration. Sometimes, when I am stuck on a headline or brand statement, I will ask it to find similar words or ways of saying something so I can play around with it. It's fun for me and aligns with my value of creativity. I also love the concept of using it as a way to poke fun at our culture, like when McDonald's Brazil asked ChatGPT to name the world's most iconic burger and displayed the full result in outdoor ads throughout São Paulo (which led to an AI retaliation from Burger King). That was such a fun way to approach trending technology and apply it to brand marketing.


So I leave you with this: While we're still figuring it out — which, as entrepreneurs and marketers, we are always doing in some way or another — I like to take on the role of a scientist. I observe, see what works for me, and figure out what I feel good about using and applying to my brand as the technology evolves.Related: How to Keep Yourself Relevant in the Age of AII think AI has the potential to bring out the best and the worst in us. As an entrepreneur, you don't have all the resources at your disposal, so AI has so many amazing implications. I just want to encourage us not to lose the plot: we're still marketing to human beings — the species of complex emotions, competing priorities and, above all, heart — which is something AI can't replicate.The brands that win the AI game are going to be the ones that use it in line with their values; it's a way to show how we live those out. No one would be surprised if the dollar store was using AI influencers and ChatGPT prompts. If Louis Vuitton did, that would be a much different story.

17,"She Never Wanted to Start a Business, But Chronic Insomnia Was Motivation — Here's How She Achieved 8 Figures in Sales and 8 Hours of Sleep a Night","Mar 19, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/bearabys-founder-surpassed-20m-in-sales-gets-better-sleep/471256,"
Dr. Kathrin Hamm, founder and CEO of sleep-wellness company Bearaby, never wanted to be an entrepreneur. After graduating with her Ph.D. in economics, she started as an economist at the World Bank. Her work took her all over the world and provided invaluable insight into the small, medium and women-founded enterprises she tried to convince banks to lend to — but she ""learned firsthand how hard it is, especially in developing countries, for women to get access to finance and start and grow their businesses.""During her time in India and Bangladesh especially, Hamm faced long, ""exhausting"" travel days. She'd ""never been a good sleeper,"" waking easily even as a child, and she developed a chronic case of insomnia. It began ""on a more moderate level,"" with difficulty falling and staying asleep, before the periods of wakefulness became longer and longer, motivating her to look into different solutions.Image Credit: Courtesy of Bearaby. Kathrin Hamm.



She started by investigating various mattress options, but when she dug deeper, she found an article discussing weighted blankets. The piece focused on helping children with sensory issues, Hamm recalls, but it also mentioned that evenly distributed weight on an adult body could support better sleep. Hamm was immediately intrigued — as a potential customer.Related: The No-Excuse Approach to Sleep and Work Performance for Entrepreneurs


""Let me buy a product, sleep better and then move on with my career.""""I came from a consumer lens,"" Hamm says, ""and knowing how hard it is for women to start a business, I [was] like, Yeah, I'm good here. I don't want to start a business or even think about becoming an entrepreneur. Let me buy a product, sleep better and then move on with my career.""However, the purchase process proved difficult. Unable to find options online, Hamm had to go to a pharmacy in Germany, where she's from, to place an order. Six weeks later, a ""big bean bag"" arrived. It was orange and blue and ""very noisy,"" Hamm says. She was reluctant to even try it at first and wondered if she'd made a mistake.""But then I put it on during the day on a weekend, and I just passed out after 10 minutes,"" Hamm says. ""And I woke up more than two hours later, [after] a solid nap, completely passed out, and I'm like, Wow, this is magic. This thing works for me.""


Related: Fighting Sleep Is a Losing Management Strategy. Let Your Employees Take Naps.So Hamm kept using the blanket at night, but there was a problem: Because the blanket was filled with plastic beads to add weight, she often got too hot. The underlying functionality works; the weight on my body works, Hamm remembers thinking, but how it is made doesn't work. After some research, Hamm discovered that the technology, which largely consisted of bead-filled chambers between layers of blanket, had been around for 30 years — ""Nobody had innovated anything about this product.""""Why can't you just use strips of cotton?""Hamm decided to experiment with alternative designs. She drew some inspiration from her time spent in India, ""where there's a culture of making rugs, knitting, crocheting,"" but the ultimate breakthrough came from a conversation with her mom. Hamm had been considering changing the material or adding holes for airflow when her mom said, ""Why can't you just use strips of cotton?"" They would create a thick yarn that could be knit together for natural airflow, eliminating the need for heavy artificial materials that shift around and reduce comfort. That idea led to the development of Bearaby's first small blanket, made from a cut-up t-shirt.


Confident she was onto something, Hamm opted to take a year's leave from her job to focus on the business. ""I didn't want to take too much of a risk, again, knowing that it can get really hard,"" she admits. ""[But] my boss was super supportive, and she said, 'Look, if it doesn't work out, we make a case study out of it.'""Hamm withdrew $120,000 from her retirement fund and raised just over $250,000 from a crowdfunding campaign to fund the prototypes for the first batch of blankets. She also looked into patents, but they were expensive, so she did the drawing herself, then had a lawyer put together a provisional patent application, which entitles the filer to 18 months before they have to pay more money. That went through just a couple of days before launch in December 2018; the blanket sold out in two weeks and was the only product of its kind on the market for a couple of years, Hamm says.Image Credit: Courtesy of BearabyRelated: How to Take Advantage of the 'First-to-File' Patent System


Despite the early success, the more than 50 factories that Hamm approached weren't inclined to take on the product. They'd never seen anything like it: It wasn't apparel, and it wasn't bedding. So, for that first year and a half, Hamm rented a small garage outfitted with knitting machines and knitters to churn out the first products. The strong sales helped the business continue to finance production, which was a good thing, too — because people still weren't all that interested in investing in the first-of-its-kind product.""In hindsight, we had to learn to be profitable.""Hamm leaned into the ""bootstrap"" mentality, which was a blessing in disguise. ""In hindsight, we had to learn to be profitable,"" she explains, ""to become in tune with our production processes and marketing processes, to be efficient, which sometimes you didn't see at that time in the direct-to-consumer space. Everyone was like, 'I raised that much money, and I'm putting that much million on a marketing spend.' So we never had it, but now, in an environment where money is not flowing [as] freely, we never had that money in the first place, so we are feeling pretty good right now.""Bearaby saw another major advantage in brand loyalty. Hamm notes that people seeking wellness and sleep tend to form an ""emotional connection"" with the blanket,"" and that it's easy to fall in love with a brand that helps you sleep better. Substantial interest also translated into an early retail presence. Just five months in, Bearaby was in West Elm, thanks to customers who walked in and wanted to try the blanket. That happened with Nordstrom, too.

Here's How to Cultivate It.As Bearaby considered expansion, it centered on functional products that would uphold its commitment to quality and sustainability (the company is certified by third-party organizations, including The Global Organic Textile Standard, The Forest Stewardship Council and The Global Recycled Standard). Because anxiety so often goes hand in hand with insomnia, the company landed on its warmables line; boasting a weighted and heated neck wrap, bottle and lap pad, it ""takes the nervous system to zero,"" Hamm says.Image Credit: Courtesy of BearabyNaturally, Bearaby's products have become an integral part of Hamm's own sleep routine, and as she's gotten older, she's realized even more just how much sleep she actually needs. ""Now I sleep for a minimum of eight hours,"" she says. ""I'm training myself to get nine to 10 hours of sleep, obviously not every night, but definitely every weekend. Also, [it helps] whenever I get a chance to take a nap, like just a 20-minute nap to reset. [I make sure that I have] these conscious breaks, whether [it's] napping or deep breathing because running a business is a marathon, and if we don't take care of our bodies, we're not able to do that over a very long time.""


""Just have tunnel vision for one year, and then reevaluate after those 365 days.""Hamm's five-year marathon with Bearaby has led to over eight figures in sales and more than 10 patents — but it all started with a single, somewhat reluctant leap of faith. And according to the founder, that's exactly what it takes to be successful.""Once you believe in a product, just take a chance and give yourself a year,"" Hamm says. ""It's much more manageable if you [have] a considerable time frame where it's like, Okay, in that year, I'm giving everything I have, 100%. Because sometimes we second guess ourselves. After [a few] months or six weeks, we don't see the success, [and] we start doubting ourselves. You say [I have] one year, and I'm not asking if this is working. Just have tunnel vision for one year, and then reevaluate after those 365 days.""This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

18,Why Being Your Own Influencer Is the Key to Success For Entrepreneurs,"Mar 18, 2024",Sunny Dublick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-being-your-own-influencer-is-the-key-to-success-for/470892,"
I want to tell the tale of two talented sisters: Jessica Simpson and Ashlee Simpson. Jessica started as a singer, and her first two albums earned $4M and $2M worldwide, respectively. Her third album, released on the same day as her MTV reality TV show debut, Newlyweds, grossed a total of $7M worldwide — her highest-selling album to this day.We then look at her sister, Ashlee. Other than her family connection, the general public knew nothing about her. On June 16, 2004, her reality show debuted on MTV. A month later, her debut album releases, and it winds up being 2004's biggest debut by a female artist, selling over $5M copies worldwide.Why am I talking to you about the story of the Simpson sisters in the early 2000s? Because it is a textbook example of the power of people in marketing. Both TV shows allowed the Simpson sisters to show their personalities to a wide audience. We got to laugh with them, go behind the scenes of their lives, and, in the case of Ashlee, see their creative process in making their music. It catapulted sales of their products (albums) because we resonated with the people behind them. We wanted to hear what they had to say because we felt like we were a part of it.



Related: Mark Zuckerberg Is Becoming Meta's Ultimate InfluencerThis principle doesn't just apply to the music industry. Think about some of the biggest people we think about in today's business environment. Elon Musk, Oprah Winfrey, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs. Our perception of them as people has influenced how we perceive and buy their products.


The legacy of Steve Jobs is that of the rebel risk-taker who started out of his garage and went on to build the biggest brand in the world. Etched in our minds is the image of his black turtleneck and glasses as he presented the latest Apple products on stage. His legacy had us believing in innovation and risk and that, by proxy, as Apple consumers, we could be those things too.Oprah's stamp of approval means we'll trust her opinions on books, political figures, gifts for our families — you name it — because we believe her to be one of the most credible people alive today. We trust her, and as such, her influence is massive.Related: 11 Oprah-Approved Books Every Entrepreneur Should ReadWhy you should be your own brand influencerIn marketing, we talk a lot about influencers — creators. People you pay to make your brand stand out because they amass such large followings. While that can benefit brand growth, I want to advocate for Entrepreneurs to consider themselves the ultimate influencers for their brands. Why?


Because people buy from people — ones they know, like and trust.What better person to tell that story than you when creating a new offering and bringing your dream alive in this world? To be a great brand, you need your customers to trust you and truly believe in what you are selling. How can we cultivate trust when we're not creating a two-way street? When they're just associating your brand with a pretty logo instead of a person on an amazing mission?When we fail to show ourselves as people in our brand and business, we become commodities. For example, Uber and Lyft use these interchangeably based on price because we have no loyalty. Toothpaste is notoriously the least brand-loyal category in Consumer Packaged Goods. For Legal Services, if you don't know anyone or have a reference, you're likely to go with whoever has the best online presence and reviews. You'll go somewhere else if you don't like your initial interaction.People will betray brands but have a harder time betraying humans with whom they feel connected.


The downside of influencersWhen you pay an influencer to promote your brand, you are paying for them to expose your brand to their audience. The problem is that followers are loyal to them and not you.For example, Kelly Clarkson is a spokesmodel for Wayfair. When that contract ends, her followers are going with her. The draw is associating Kelly as a highly likable person with the brand — which they hope to make highly likable by proxy. While there is efficacy, people recognize that this person is getting paid to say positive things about the brand. It doesn't always feel 100% genuine. So, while your brand is getting more attention, is it getting more loyal customers?Related: A Face Behind the Brand: How to Humanize Your Business for Maximum GrowthInfluence + creationOne of the most powerful mergers we have seen in the business world is the creation of brands by people with massive influence. I'll use the example of the beauty industry, which has been completely shaken up in the past few years by two key trends:


The rise of low-cost/quality ""dupes"" (e.l.f.)The rise of the influencer/creator brands (Rare Beauty, Fenty Beauty, Haus Labs)The first category is based on commodities — getting 'the look' for less. The second is a powerful look at the results that happen when a person of influence creates their own brand. Rare Beauty was projected to do over $300M in sales last year alone. Fenty Beauty is estimated to be worth $2.8B. This is the compound effect of what happens when a person of influence creates a brand of their own.How to become your own brand influencerWe know influence works and why it's important, but we also know we'll never have as many followers as Selena Gomez. That's OK and, actually, preferable. When we talk about influence, we want to think less about width and more about depth. We want to get close to your audience. Focus your 'influence' on making a presence with and impacting the community you have created for your brand.Examples of how to harness that:Talk to your audience. Be curious about your customers and potential customers. Ask them questions about what they like/don't like. Introduce yourself as someone making waves in this space and get their perspectives on the problems they're facing.Find out where your clients are, and meet them there. Are they on TikTok or LinkedIn? How do they like to hear from you? What do they want to hear? If you don't know, ask. See the point above.Share your story and journey. Human beings are hardwired to connect with other human stories. It makes us relate, empathize and ultimately desire what you are selling. This doesn't mean you need to livestream your whole life. Do what feels comfortable to you. Share what feels authentic and good, and take your audience along for the ride. They want to see you win.Make your audience part of your brand. Have a new product drop? Why not invite 30 of your top-selling customers to an event where you get up Steve Jobs-style and present it? Ask them to beta-test your newest offerings before they drop. Find what matters to them most and be part of the solution, whether through your offerings or giving back in a way that impacts your community.Related: 6 Ways Your Company Will Benefit From Better Community Involvement


Bringing it all togetherBeing visible in your brand as an entrepreneur does not mean you become the entirety of your marketing strategy. It means you are seen as someone your customers can associate with your brand, understand/emphasize with and ultimately trust. As entrepreneurs, this is crucial as you grow your brand, especially as so many of us are multi-passionate and create other businesses. People loving your offer is one thing; connecting with your story and trusting your brand is a whole new level of success.

19,She Started a Side Hustle While Working 2 Jobs as a Line Cook for $22 an Hour Combined — Now It's an 8-Figure Brand You've Probably Seen on TV,"Mar 13, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/an-apron-side-hustle-turned-into-a-multimillion-dollar-brand/470978,"
For Ellen Bennett, founder of kitchenware brand Hedley & Bennett, food has been a life-long love. ""I'm half-Mexican and half-English, and so I grew up with this very unusual combination of eating tamales and caldo de pollo, and things that are very Mexican, alongside shepherd's pie and tea with my English grandpa,"" she tells Entrepreneur.But before Bennett built the apron business named for her English and Mexican families, she attended culinary school in Mexico City, where it was more affordable than in the U.S. She took modeling jobs and translation gigs to support herself there, then moved back to Los Angeles, where she was raised, to work at some of the city's best restaurants.Image Credit: Shayan Asgharnia. Ellen Bennett.



""I've always put one foot in front of the other towards the thing that I want to do, never stop and don't stare too long because then you'll get scared and won't do it,"" Bennett says. ""So I keep myself moving always and forever. And I feel like that has been one of the successful traits for me: I don't analyze — I just do.""In 2012, at 24, Bennett was doing a whole lot: She worked as a line cook at Providence, which boasts a two-star Michelin rating, and at Bäco Mercat, pulling in $22 an hour between the two jobs. In the mornings, she also worked as a personal chef for a family. ""It was around the clock,"" she recalls, adding that 14-hour days within the industry were par for the course.


Related: She Used $10,000 in Savings to Turn Her Side Hustle Into an 8-Figure Brand You've Probably Seen""If I can make the [equivalent] uniform piece of dignity [and] roll [that] into this world of cooking, maybe I change this whole industry.""Despite the ""hustle"" of her day-to-day, Bennett had a big idea, one that served as a ""funny through line"" from her life as a ""hardcore line cook"" to the ""other life"" she led — in Mexico City she'd often donned suits for work events, and as an avid runner with marathons under her belt, she knew a thing or two about athletic attire that could stand up to the rigors of the sport.""So I combined the two in my head,"" Bennett says, ""and I thought, Man, if I can make the [equivalent] uniform piece of dignity [and] roll [that] into this world of cooking, maybe I change this whole industry. Because we're getting our asses handed to us. We work so hard, [and] everybody looks like shit.""


A few weeks later, a chef at one of the restaurants where Bennett worked presented her with the perfect opportunity to start her side hustle. He said he was going to order aprons for everybody, and Bennett, who'd been thinking nonstop about chef coats and various aspects of the uniform, ""blurted out in Ellen Bennett fashion"" that she had an apron company.Image Credit: Courtesy of Hedley & Bennett. Related: At 23, She Started a Side Hustle for 'Quick Money.' Now the Business Brings in More Than $1 Million a Month — and Boasts Celebrity Fans.Of course, Bennett didn't have a business at that point, but she said she'd been working on an idea — ""and by working, I meant it was in my head,"" she admits. Still, she managed to convince the chef to place an order for 40 aprons, and with ""absolutely nothing other than willpower and chutzpah,"" she ""started the whole damn thing."" Bennett showed up anywhere she could find chefs who might be interested in her aprons — from farmers' markets to Eater LA events.


""I would walk up to people and just be like, 'Hey, I'm a cook at Providence. I work there, and I have an apron company. Can I show you what I'm working on?'"" Bennett says. ""So it was very much from a place of humility, but I also was shameless about talking to anyone. And I never hid behind a computer waiting for people to email me. I just stood in front of you, and if you had ears, I was going to talk to you.""""'Oh my god, Japanese denim? That's cool. American canvas? Hell yeah.'""Bennett didn't have a sewing background, but she'd always loved design, so her process in those early days ""was truly scrappy."" She'd sit down with chefs and listen to their pain points (which she knew all too well as an industry professional), drilling down on the finer yet crucial details that so often went ignored in the apron game — like durable fabric.Image Credit: Courtesy of Hedley & Bennett.


Quickly, Bennett leaned into ""elevating the core materials,"" much like how a Michelin-starred restaurant raises the bar for food. ""We're still just selling food,"" Bennett explains, ""but it's the best fish you've ever had in the world because we sourced it from the best place. So I applied that same logic."" And Bennett's aprons were an instant hit.Related: For Years, This Black Founder Learned an Uncommon But Essential Craft on the Side. Now His Creations Are Beloved By Celebrity Chefs — and Can Sell for More Than $1,000.""These chefs got really nerdy about it,"" Bennett says. ""They're like, 'Oh my god, Japanese denim? That's cool. American canvas? Hell yeah'. And then, instead of using plastic hardware, I'd be like, 'What if we use brass hardware?' And they'd be like, 'Yes, I love that.' So I essentially just collaborated and listened.""Now, Hedley & Bennett is an eight-figure brand, and if you've tuned in to any cooking show or show about cooking, you've no doubt seen it in action: 70% of chefs on the Food Network wear Hedley & Bennett aprons, and nearly every chef who appears on Top Chef and The Bear is donning one too, according to data provided by the brand. Hedley & Bennett also boasts partnerships with The Beatles, NASA and Crocs, among others, and has since expanded into general kitchenware, including knives, potholders and more.


""Even if you go out and raise $50 million, you still have to build community to get customers.""Although Bennett's apron idea resonated with other chefs immediately and has seen enormous growth in the past decade-plus, she stresses that Hedley & Bennett was far from an overnight success — and that, realistically, there's no such thing.The brand didn't have any outside investment. Instead, she grew Hedley & Bennett ""the old-school way,"" reinvesting every penny back into the business as she built ""brick by brick,"" ""street by street"" and ""customer by customer,"" securing that essential brand loyalty along the way. And the people she sold her aprons to in the beginning remain customers, Bennett notes: ""There's a love that exists that you can't buy from an Instagram ad.""""Even if you go out and raise $50 million, you still have to build community to get customers,"" Bennett says. ""You just happen to have more money in the bank. Are you willing to show up and talk to people? Are you willing to listen, pivot, adapt your product to them and what they actually need? Everyone goes through the same struggles. It's just how many resources you can throw at it. And because I had limited resources, I got a lot more creative than I would have if I had all the money in the world.""


Related: Using Social Media Alone to Build Your Brand's Online Community Means You Risk Losing It All. Here's Why.What's more, Hedley & Bennett's initial business-to-business (B2B) model meant a ""slow and steady"" approach that benefited from ""brutally honest chefs"" who didn't mince words when it came to letting Bennett know what was and wasn't working. The feedback was invaluable, but despite an influx of requests for additional products, Hedley & Bennett remained ""hyper-focused"" on putting out the perfect customizable apron — until the pandemic hit. We need to actually create a systemized streamlined menu of how we outfit these restaurants in a way that we can scale it, Bennett realized.So Hedley & Bennett incorporated a direct-to-consumer approach. Within one month, the brand went from shipping everything internally to shipping with third-party logistics (3PL). ""It was not clean or smooth or anything like that,"" Bennett says. ""It was just the right thing for the business, and the whole world couldn't meet in person. So it was like, 'How do we get it online as fast as possible?'""From there, Bennett considered all of the feedback they'd received — and which products it made sense to tackle next. ""We're like, 'Okay, well, what's the natural extension from aprons that's an essential, because we don't like making tchotchkes.'"" Bennett recalls. ""We're all about longevity, quality on things you need, not just like a lemon squeezer, which is fine, but you can squeeze a lemon with your hands, too."" That led the brand to knives.


Image Credit: Shelby Moore.""There's nothing wrong with taking longer to build something great.""Hedley & Bennett's journey has been lengthy and full of ""little peaks and valleys"" trending upward overall, but because she's ""such an action-oriented person,"" Bennett says she rarely dwells on what she didn't do along the way.Still, in the beginning, Bennett does wish she'd taken a step back to value herself and her contributions the way that other people did. ""I don't mean that in an ego-driven way,"" she says. ""It's not about being like I'm the coolest, I'm the best, but it's simply respecting yourself for the work that you did and saying, 'Not only did I build the table — I built the chair that I got to sit in at the table. I made this.'""

A Reflection for Women Entrepreneurs.And her best advice for other entrepreneurs who want to take their big idea from side hustle to multimillion-dollar brand?""I'm a huge believer in the long game,"" she says.

There's nothing wrong with taking longer to build something great. I know our whole lives are oriented towards speed and how quickly things grow and [becoming] a unicorn, but you can be a long-game unicorn too.""

You work so hard to build up your own name and protect the reputation you have developed. Yet in our super-connected and politically evolving world, everything you post — every comment, photo and status update — could also be used against you. For a CEO, leader or entrepreneur, the task is all the more high-stakes: managing your online persona.This article will explore social media's profound benefits and potential pitfalls for personal brands and reputations like yours. You will learn strategies that can help you harness its power for maximum effect while sidestepping traps that may otherwise cost you your reputation.What is personal brand, and why does it matter?Your brand is that shimmering something of skills, experiences, values, and even your little quirks that make you unique and an increasingly attractive choice in your business.



It is the constant reminder you etch into people's minds about how you need to be perceived and interacted with. Authentic personal branding can make all the difference in the world. It enhances you and increases your solidity, much in the same way that a thick layer of chrome adds to something.Establishing a well-defined personal brand opens the door to valuable new opportunities, as it allows you to attract like-minded people who resonate with your message. It also prepares you to be the trusted authority, building bonds of trust with audiences so tight it would take steel cables to pull them apart.


This means that if one typifies the loud, clear proclaimer who overflows with contagious passion concerning one's purpose, one presents a consistent narrative that will resonate as a tuning fork does with one's people. In summary, this will lead to business growth and career and personal development galore.Related: Reputation Management Starts Before Your First Bad Review — Here's How to Develop a Proactive Crisis PlanThe relationship between an online presence and brand reputationThe connection between your presence on social media and your brand reputation has never been stronger these days. Your presence on social media is a high-definition digital mirror that showcases your brand, values, thoughts, triumphs and spirited interactions for the world to see.Every LinkedIn post, tweet, and digital status update is another brush stroke on the canvas of your portrait, building an unshakeable representation of your radiant essence for others to view. Intentional social media can take your brand to the stratosphere, get your people consistently dialed in, and have you firmly positioned as the thought leader in your space.


In contrast, a poorly managed online presence may easily vanish like a sandcastle in front of an aggressive tide, washing out the foundation of trust that one has built up with hard work.Every mistake, every controversy, every fight, or one inappropriate overshare on the Internet can take a life of its own and go viral, so much so that it might cause unthinkable, possibly irreparable damage to your reputation. You've got to understand that we're in a digital age that casts a stark spotlight. Every move you make prints an indelible record for the world to scrutinize.Here are five ways social media can make your personal brand and reputation authentic.Visibility. Always lead with gravitas. Social media hands you a bullhorn through which you amplify your expertise, insights, and every single win to a global audience who would not have the time to catch up otherwise.Builds good relations. Avoid Ai generated auto responses, use your real voice in comments, candid conversations, and genuine talks builds up loyal brand connections more effectively than any steel rope ever would.One will manage to show oneself as an expert. Your constant authoritative content, unique perspectives, and lively activity within the sphere of industry discussions make you a respected thought leader. Indeed, your credibility and influence are drawing close to that of a gravity well.Brand your reputation. Social media gives you the ability to proactively craft and control your brand message and to act quickly on anything positive or negative that could potentially alter your hard-earned company reputation.Dominate your network. Social networking makes possible easier communication and collaboration with other visionary competitors, industry bigwigs, and potential partners, hence throwing wide open, opportunities for growth, creative synergy, and win-win-win action.Digital amphitheaters, which are equaled by a huge potential to create authentic personal brands and reputations, bring substantial risk. One errant step or poorly executed post can deal catastrophic damage in the twinkle of an eye, unraveling years of patience and painstakingly earned progress more quickly than a Jenga tower kicked by a mule.


Related: How to Balance Between Personal and Professional Social MediaPotentially provocative, offensive or controversial contentWith all shares potentially provocative, offending, or controversial, you may very literally switch off your reputation's light as if it were a light bulb and lose the audience in thousands.Inconsistent inauthenticity. Poor presence and lack of earnestness consistent with the cause breeds dissonance. You either seem less credible, confusing, or just disingenuous, worse.Unengaged Ghosting. Don't play the pretend ""I'm too important to respond"" game. Ignoring followers, comments, or concerns on social media is a better way to lose trust and loyalty than even leaving a half-melted icicle in the heart of summer.Unprofessional Faux-Pas. Trudging through embarrassing online meltdowns, the moronic slinging of insults and abuse at other people's comments, or conducting oneself in an unprofessional manner can damage your reputation faster than a wrecking ball through the drywall.Failure to Address. Burying the head in the sand and bungling controversies, PR crises or negative feedback only fans the flame by providing it with more oxygen. To make things worse, problems get nurtured to create almost insurmountable barriers while trying to rebuild lost public trust.After all, personal branding in social media is a double-edged sword since, on the one hand, it gives great power to multiply your voice, create absolutely valuable connections, and become a leader of thought for the world. On the other hand, even a small slip can cut very painfully deep with grievous wounds to your reputation.You must learn to use these digital tools to become an adept brand leader, influencer, or entrepreneur. Achieving the art of appropriately presenting yourself and getting your community involved to grow it to next level is synonymous with enhancing your reputation.


The same reputation you have labored to secure over the years can be gone in the blink of an eye due to controversy, inconsistency, or simply not being professional. Be aware of these perceptions and still know how to use today's social media power.

22,The Miley Cyrus Approach To Marketing — Why It's a Radically Different Method For Achieving Brand Impact,"Mar 1, 2024",Sunny Dublick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-miley-cyrus-taught-me-about-marketing/469675,"
Miley Cyrus took home her first Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance this year. Shocked and elated, she took the stage to accept the award from none other than Mariah Carey and shared a very heartfelt speech:""And so there's a story I wanna tell that sums up this moment, and I wasn't gonna tell it, but now Mariah's here. So there was a little boy that all he wanted for his birthday was a butterfly. And so his parents gave him a butterfly net, and he was so excited. He just went outside out in the sun and started swinging and swinging. But with no luck, he sat down on the ground, he finally let go, and he surrendered, and he was okay that he wasn't gonna capture this beautiful butterfly. And right when he did is when the butterfly came and landed right on the tip of his nose. And this song 'Flowers' is my butterfly.""So, what does it have to do with marketing? Everything.



Current marketing theory is centered around amplification: more ads, emails and automation. The idea is that the more times we can reach a customer with our message, the better. Push out social posts, text ads, and Spotify spots, and hit them at every path along the buyer journey until they're worn down enough to buy.I liken this to chasing a customer down the street screaming, ""BUY NOW!"" as they frantically run as far away as possible — only we're doing this through screens, so it feels tolerable. Is it really effective, though? Or are we just casting the widest net possible over and over again, hoping to scoop up more (proverbial) butterflies?


I want to advocate for a different way, one that feels far less cringe-worthy. I want brands to stop chasing down business and start attracting it. What does that look like?Related: 7 Marketing Strategies You Need to SucceedStart with your offering(s)You need to have something that is ultimately an attractive offer to your audience. I ask every client what are the brands they aspire to be like. Apple always comes up. The new iPhone comes out, and there is a line around the block. We all want that kind of brand loyalty, right? The real question is: are we willing to do the work to get there?Apple didn't become a brand giant by creating the same products as the rest of the industry. It pushed category conventions every chance it could get. It constantly innovated and became cool because it was always on the cutting edge of new technology. Buying an Apple product was like a promise that you had the new, shiny toy everyone wanted. Their marketing just lets you know it's available, and frankly, they barely need it.


Apple's customers do most of their marketing for them. Think about what it would be like for your business to have an offer that's so good you know there will be a waiting list. Push yourself out of the thinking that 'this is the way things have to be.' What would it look like if you created something so amazing that you didn't have to force the message to convince people to buy? That is how you become an attractive brand. That's how you get your butterflies.Related: How to Bring Connection, Creativity and Results Together in MarketingKeep it realOne of my biggest takeaways from the Grammy speech was the need for surrender. Accepting the reality of where you are right now. That level of honesty and authenticity is crucial in building a great brand. It's the opposite of giving up; rather, it is realizing you have control over certain things, but a lot is out of our hands as businesses.It's letting go of our vice grip on metrics and being fine with letting life and joy become part of our marketing practice. Marketers have become so trained that everything has to have a way to measure ROI — and while I am not advocating wasting money, I am advocating that we allow wiggle room in our budgets and hearts for authentic brand connection. Not the PR stories, not the influencer partnerships. I mean genuine ways to live out your brand's purpose for your customers and employees.


If you created a business, it wasn't only to make money. I am guessing it was created to help people. Sometimes, we get so far away from where we've been and our purpose that the best thing we can do is surrender. Remind ourselves why we started or why we were so excited to work for a company in the first place. How do we get back to being a great brand?Related: How to Create Authentic Relationships and Build Customer TrustBe a good stewardThink about the brands you admire — do they need to convince you to buy? To chase you down? No. What does the boy with the butterfly do once it lands on his nose? Does he hop right up and start chasing it again? Or does he know he doesn't have to? Will he continue to attract great things because he is a magnet for success? I want to encourage you to be this magnet as well, and how you do that is by being a good steward to your customers.That means protecting their data, their interests, and their privacy. That means treating them with the respect they deserve. So often, we treat customers like numbers on a balance sheet. Just bombarding them with information to get their sale. This is not the way to make a great brand. This is being that pushy car salesman that no one feels comfortable around. When in doubt, all you have to do is put yourself in their shoes. Is this how I would want to hear about a brand like mine? Or does it feel weird? Is there a better way? Let empathy towards your community inspire you to do better and become the magnet of great customers.


One thing I feel passionate about as a marketer is that we have to find a better way. What this industry has become is a never-ending spiral of advertising. In essence, marketing should be about connecting with the people you want to help. We're not connecting by shouting messages at them all day, every day — in short, we're not being great partners with our clients.I hope that I can inspire you to new ways of thinking about marketing in a way that lets you attract all of the businesses you can handle without ever having to chase a thing.

23,"Navigating the Diverse Marketing Landscape of Black America — How to Foster Authentic Engagement, Loyalty and Respect","Feb 28, 2024",Christine Alexis,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-navigate-the-diverse-marketing-landscape-of-black/470004,"
As the United States commemorates Black History Month, corporate marketers must challenge the oversimplified perception of Black Americans as a monolithic group. The United States comprises a diverse array of Black experiences, encompassing descendants of enslaved Africans, recent immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean and various cultural groups that have flourished over generations.As a Black marketer, I recognize the critical need for brands to connect authentically with the wide range of Black culture, crafting marketing that truly resonates without diminishing our diverse experiences.Related: Celebrating Black History and Culture Is the Right Thing to Do — and Good for Business. Here's How.



The diverse landscape of Black AmericaThe diversity within the Black American demographic is deeply rooted in the complex history of the United States, tracing back to the descendants of enslaved Africans brought to North America through the Transatlantic Slave Trade. This group's history has profoundly shaped the country's cultural, political and social narratives, characterized by resilience, cultural amalgamation and a rich legacy of contributions across various spheres.From this historical backdrop, unique cultural groups such as the Gullah Geechee in the Carolinas and Louisiana Creole have emerged, each with distinct identities shaped by their unique histories and cultural influences. The Gullah Geechee people have preserved their African heritage through language, crafts and community practices. Similarly, the Louisiana Creole community reflects a rich blend of French, African, Spanish and Native American influences, evident in their language, cuisine and music.


Adding to this, the Black American demographic is further diversified by significant immigrant populations from the Caribbean and Africa. Data from the Pew Research Center indicates that the Caribbean is the primary region of origin for Black immigrants, with nearly half (46%) of the foreign-born Black population originating from this area. Jamaica and Haiti are the most significant source countries, comprising 16% and 15% of the Black immigrant population, respectively. These communities, alongside other African immigrants, enrich the American cultural landscape with their diverse cultural backgrounds, adding new layers of complexity and richness to the Black American identity.This intricate blend of Black America presents unparalleled opportunities for targeted engagement. Marketers aiming to authentically engage with the broader Black community must grasp and appreciate these sub-communities' unique heritage, preferences and cultural narratives.The strategic importance of cultural specificityThe buying power of the Black American population is projected to exceed $1.8 trillion in the coming year — surpassing the annual GDPs of nations like Mexico and the Netherlands. Understanding and tapping into this market with respect and authenticity can significantly boost brand loyalty and market share.The demographic landscape of the United States has seen the Black population grow by 30%, to 36.2 million individuals as of 2021, emphasizing the importance of culturally specific marketing strategies. This significant change in demographics is characterized by the fact that roughly one in five Black Americans are immigrants or the children of immigrants.


Related: Unpacking the Black Demographic Shift and Why Marketers Must Re-Examine Their StrategiesCompanies doing it rightGoogle:Through its innovative Google Doodles, Google has spotlighted prominent figures from Haitian and Jamaican history, effectively bringing their stories and achievements to the forefront of the international community. These doodles serve as a gateway for millions worldwide to engage with and learn about the profound impact of Haitian and Jamaican cultures. Further amplifying its commitment, Google's Arts & Culture platform stands as a testament to the company's commitment to cultural preservation and education, offering users curated exhibitions and narratives celebrating Haiti and Jamaica's unique cultural identities (alongside a plethora of other countries).Peloton:


Peloton has played a pivotal role in amplifying diverse voices within the fitness industry, providing a significant platform for instructors like Alex Toussaint to share their unique perspectives and cultural heritage. Toussaint's presence and narrative on Peloton do more than add depth to the brand's instructor lineup; they offer a blueprint for leveraging personal stories and cultural heritage in marketing strategies.This strategy enhances the brand's representation efforts and positions Peloton as a leader in promoting inclusivity and understanding through fitness, demonstrating the profound impact of integrating personal heritage with brand identity in today's digital marketing landscape. By aligning with voices like Toussaint's, Peloton demonstrates how brands can successfully integrate representation into their marketing strategies, turning their platforms into arenas for positive change and community building.Disney:Despite The Princess and the Frog premiering in 2009, Disney has strategically embraced and celebrated Louisiana Creole culture. The film introduced Tiana as the first Black Disney princess and was set against the vibrant backdrop of New Orleans. Disney's promotional efforts skillfully highlighted these cultural elements, appealing to a broad audience while paying homage to the cultural significance of the film's setting and characters. Disney's marketing successfully balanced cultural authenticity with timeless appeal, from merchandise featuring Tiana to collaborations with renowned Louisiana Creole chefs. This long-term commitment has manifested in several significant initiatives that continue to pay cultural and commercial dividends for the brand.


In the fall of 2023, Tiana's Palace opened in Disneyland Resort's New Orleans Square, extending the narrative beyond the screen with a dining experience offering Louisiana Creole cuisine and the vibrant atmosphere depicted in the movie. Additionally, the announcement of ""Tiana's Bayou Adventure,"" slated to open in 2024 as a reimagined ride replacing Splash Mountain, further demonstrates Disney's commitment to celebrating Louisiana Creole culture along with the Louisiana ecosystem, thus enhancing its brand identity as inclusive and diverse.Related: 20 Brands That Are Actually Making Progress on their Commitments to Serving the Black CommunityTo authentically engage with the diversity within the Black community, brands can incorporate culturally specific phrases or expressions into targeted marketing efforts. These strategic integrations, particularly in areas with a significant Jamaican and Haitian community presence, like New York and Florida, deepen connections and showcase respect and appreciation for cultural diversity. By commemorating cultural events and infusing these subtle nuances, brands can significantly enhance engagement. Collaborative initiatives with community leaders and influencers further authenticate these campaigns, while diverse representation in advertising accurately mirrors the community's spectrum of identities, fostering trust and loyalty among customers.In today's marketplace, where authenticity and genuine connection are highly valued, brands must acknowledge and celebrate the diversity within the Black community. Embracing Black Americans' distinct cultures, languages and historical narratives enables brands to foster deeper engagement, loyalty and respect among their audiences. This strategy demands a dedicated effort to grasp and weave these cultural identities into marketing initiatives, ensuring authenticity and a commitment to diversity and inclusion. By doing so, brands enrich their relationships with diverse communities and set a standard for meaningful engagement in the industry.

24,Are You the Face of Your Business? You Shouldn't Be — These 3 Practices Can Help You Change Your Branding,"Feb 28, 2024",Cynthia Kay,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-reasons-why-you-shouldnt-be-the-only-face-of-your-brand/469624,"
When most of us think about a small business, we think about a local retailer, a restaurant owner, a service provider or a small manufacturing company. In a smaller organization, the owner is often the ""face"" of the business. After all, the individual started, purchased or took over the family enterprise. In the early phases of business, the owner or manager plays many critical roles.They have a vision that sustains and moves the business forward. They build and maintain those all-important relationships. They may have even developed the product or process. People do business with people, and one of the reasons that many choose to do business with a small business is the owner.When customers work with a large entity, they have a salesperson or an account manager as the initial contact. They make the sale but often hand it off to others who do the work. With a smaller business, the owner is more hands-on. They work on every aspect of the company. After all, their name is often literally ""on the door,"" and they must protect their reputation. They are visible. They are accessible. Customers like that they can work directly with the decision maker, the person who is the business's brand.



Related: 5 Levels of Brand Visibility and How to Make it to the Top in 2024Time for a ""facelift""I often hear experts talk about the importance of the owner being the brand. In fact, some go so far as to say that without the owner, there is no business and no brand. In theory, I agree. I love receiving calls from customers who want me to work on projects. But while it is flattering to be in demand, being the face of the business is also dangerous. It can impact the owner's ability to grow the business and make it sustainable for the long term.


Small business owners are notorious for wanting to do it all. The reality is you just can't be everywhere. You need backup. What would happen if you suddenly became ill? Had a huge surge of business? Or simply wanted to sell and retire? Move on and be a serial entrepreneur?If you are the only face of your business and past the start-up phase, it is time to think differently and consider a facelift to your public persona. Here are three things to get you started.1. Educate employees to be customer-facingOwners have a great deal of historical knowledge and experience with the business. That's why customers want to work with the owner. When you educate and train your employees, they have the tools to step in and assume tasks that can be offloaded. You must do this before you are overwhelmed with business and can't be there when customers expect to see you.Transferring knowledge builds credibility in your organization — not just your credibility. Larger customers also want to know that you have a depth of experience. They have invested in you and your organization; if you have not trained others, you put your customers at risk.


Education should include more than just what you provide or do for customers. Help employees understand the unique preferences of clients, how they like to communicate, and what they value. You want them to be prepared and comfortable to provide the best customer experience.2. Set employees up to shineHelping employees become another face of the business does not just happen. And not everyone is suited to the task. This effort takes a thoughtful approach. You have to choose employees who can lead an effort and inspire confidence. Some will have that ability but not the desire to play that role. It may take a few tries to find the right individual or individuals.Set them up slowly and deliberately. Start introducing them to customers by including them in communications and have them attend meetings and observe. When they are ready, give them a portion of the agenda. You must also consider which customers will accept an employee's expanded role. Some will resist. Others will make the transition easily.Ensure that you point out the skills and accomplishments of employees to customers. Describe some of their recent wins. Did they manage a great event, go out of their way to do something for a client, or develop a new process or product? Brag about them and their good work. It may take some time, but soon, customers will call them — not you. And that's a good thing.


Related: How to Turn Every Employee into a Sales Superstar3. Do an about-faceI often talk about the importance of showing up and being present. Customers appreciate this. However, there are times to step back and maybe do a little about-face. This is hard for owners who are used to being out front. This can also be difficult because customers view the owner as a security blanket. When you have educated and set your employees up to shine, find an opportunity for them to take on tasks without you. Start small and be sure to prepare them. That means running scenarios, role plays or whatever it takes for them to be successful.One word of caution. You cannot disappear. As the owner, you need to still be involved. Sit in on critical meetings or initiatives. Don't swoop in to try and take over. That undercuts all your efforts. Instead, be there to reassure customers and support staff.More faces, more opportunityAn owner has the unique ability to be the face of the company and make the brand come alive. But when there are more faces, it creates more business opportunities. And one last note. As you approach the time to exit or retire, you want to show that employees have relationships and knowledge that will keep customers engaged and doing business with the company. Otherwise, the total value of your business is diminished. So be the face, but also bring others alongside you.

25,The Waitlist for This Sushi Spot Numbers in the Hundreds. Here's the Secret Ingredient of Its Success.,"Feb 27, 2024",Shawn P. Walchef,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/inside-sushi-master-jesse-itos-omakase-room/470141,"
There's no fast path to becoming a master — it takes work.As a renowned sushi chef and owner of Royal Sushi & Izakaya in Philadelphia, Jesse Ito carries a legacy of culinary excellence and rich tradition. Jesse embarked on an apprenticeship at the tender age of 14 at his family's Japanese restaurant, before immersing himself in the intricate world of sushi.""You can read books and you can just watch YouTube and learn a lot, but the only way is to learn through a chef working with the product,"" Jesse says to Shawn Walchef of Cali BBQ Media.



In 1979, before Ito was born, his parents opened Fuji in New Jersey just a few years after moving to America.Related: Celebrity Chef Maneet Chauhan Shares Her Best Tip for Aspiring TV Chefs


Shaped by his early years working with his parents at their restaurant Fuji (his mom at the front of the house and his dad making food) Ito's culinary journey began with a hands-on apprenticeship. ""The best way to learn is through apprenticeship,"" he says. ""You have to apprentice and work at places, and work with the product.""Starting as a teenage dishwasher, he was soon thrust into the sushi bar, navigating the challenges of mastering the craft.Ito's father was instrumental in shaping the Japanese food culture in the tri-state area and became known among top chefs as a culinary authority. They sold the restaurant in 2015 to help their son fulfill his dream of opening Royal Sushi & Izakaya.Ito now has the honor of working alongside his dad at his own restaurant. ""He kind of built this foundation. He was part of building the Japanese culture food scene in this tri-state area. So it was big shoes to fill. And having him there is really great,"" says Ito.


Related: 24-Karat Gold Syrup Is Just One Part of This Self-Taught Chef's Empire""Family has always been the #1 driving force for me to show up and execute,"" Jesse Ito wrote in an Instagram post about family and running a business.""It's one thing to fail yourself… that's not impossible to recover from. It's another thing to fail people relying on you. That may sound like a heavy burden, but it's also very empowering and will push you to move mountains.""The Next Generation of OmakaseFrom behind a back curtain at Royal Sushi & Izakaya, Jesse Ito brings a unique vibe to the traditional omakase experience — blending contemporary Japanese aesthetics with modern comfort and fusion of cultures. (Omakase translates to ""I leave it up to you,"" meaning that the customer leaves it up to the chef to select seasonal specialties.)


There are only 8 seats available at a time for the 17-piece, hand-crafted, tasting experience. Hundreds have signed up for the waitlist online.In his omakase room, Ito orchestrates a unique ambiance, deviating from the traditional omakase setting.Drawing inspiration from old-school hip-hop, funk, and artists like David Bowie, Ito sets the stage for a relaxed and enjoyable culinary journey. He intentionally fosters an atmosphere where guests feel at ease, encouraging conversation and camaraderie.Related: How This Chef Navigated a $80,000 Turnaround for His Business


""My omakase room, which has a bit of a different vibe,"" expresses Ito. ""All my guests feel super comfortable talking to each other, talking to other guests, talking to me. It doesn't feel pretentious where you feel so stuffy, where you're like, okay, I can't just let loose and have fun here.""Though he hasn't scaled Royal Sushi & Izakaya or the omakase concept quite yet, he understands that taking the next steps, both internally and externally, is necessary.""I know inevitably that's something I'll have to come to terms with because it's part of the process. It's part of growth.""About Restaurant InfluencersRestaurant Influencers is brought to you by Toast, the powerful restaurant point-of-sale and management system that helps restaurants improve operations, increase sales and create a better guest experience.

""When we started [McBride Sisters Collection], we were young, we were women, and we were Black women,"" Andréa McBride says. ""So we didn't look like what had traditionally been really successful in the wine industry.""The McBride sisters' path to business partnership wasn't traditional either.Half sisters who were raised as only children across the world from each other, both happened to grow up in wine regions: Andréa in New Zealand and Robin in Monterrey, California. They connected with the help of family members in 1999 after their father's passing, and it wasn't long before they discovered their shared passion for wine — and decided to follow it into business.



McBride Sisters Collection was founded in 2005. Nearly 20 years later, the Oakland-based venture has become the largest Black-owned wine company in the U.S., boasting several wine collections, including its Black Girl Magic wines ""sourced from some of California's finest winegrowing regions"" and She Can wines and spritzers.Image Credit: Courtesy of McBride Sisters Collection


Related: This Black Founder Was Denied a Business Loan and Set Out to Prove the 'Gatekeepers' Wrong. He's Made More Than $500,000 So Far — But It's Just the Beginning.To get to this point, the sisters have had to be disruptive and nimble in an industry that's ""at a really interesting crossroads"" in terms of reaching a diverse consumer base, the McBrides say. Across the board, wine consumption is on the decline, falling roughly 6% between 2017 and 2022, according to International Organisation of Vine and Wine data reported by CNN Business.""Baby boomers, the main consumers of wine really since they came of drinking age in the 1960s, are now in decline,"" Andréa McBride explains, ""and if you're targeting that market, you're only going to grow by fighting for share.""That's why the McBrides have always been eager to tap into new consumer bases, especially college-educated women of color. The gap is shrinking between men and women who drink, and college-educated women across all demographics are more likely to drink and drink more days per month, according to research from Futurity.


""Distributors and retailers hold the most power in our industry and have been running this playbook for brands,"" Andréa McBride says, ""and the results don't seem to be working for those that do see the value that our portfolio provides in terms of being way more accessible, socially conscious, culturally conscious.""Related: For Years, This Black Founder Learned an Uncommon But Essential Craft on the Side. Now His Creations Are Beloved By Celebrity Chefs — and Can Sell for More Than $1,000.The McBrides note they've also seen a ""stylistic"" difference between the types of wines that baby boomers gravitate towards and those that younger consumers prefer: ""a trend pattern of lighter styles of wine versus big, heavy Cabernet Sauvignon [or] big, buttery Chardonnay.""People are also drinking wine in different ways. ""A lot of the time, the wine industry has focused on occasions around the dinner table through a very Eurocentric lens,"" Andréa McBride says. ""But within our circle, the foods we eat are very global, so we just think through that lens.""


The McBride Sisters Collection ""is incredibly food-friendly"" and pairs well across a range of cuisines, the co-founders say, adding that ""occasions in this generation aren't fully focused on the dinner table — [they] can be, but wine is also showing up in different contexts.""Related: 3 Authentic Ways Brands Can Celebrate Black History MonthThe McBrides admit the wine industry isn't an ""easy"" one: ""We got a lot of pushback because the way that we thought and the way that we moved and acted was very different.""But it's also been ""so rewarding"" and ""so much fun,"" and they encourage other Black founders to ""come on in.""

27,Your Secrets Won't Stay Hidden For Long — Follow These 6 Ways to Help Protect Your Reputation,"Feb 26, 2024",Adam Petrilli,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/6-ways-to-navigate-a-crisis-and-protect-your-reputation/469607,"
In the hyperfast world of digital commerce, your company's reputation is as valuable as its balance sheet. And whether it's a new or established business, safeguarding this reputation and protecting that brand on the web is paramount.So, when an internal crisis hits and gets traction online, it can travel and tarnish your brand's image faster than a viral video, especially when it's not managed correctly.Fortunately, if you know and stick to the right strategy, navigating an image crisis and minimizing the damage is possible.Here are six ways to steer your business through that next P.R. storm and keep your company's trustworthy reputation intact.1. Embrace transparency: The first step to trustTransparency isn't just a buzzword; it's the foundation of trust between your brand and your audience. So, when an internal crisis strikes, resisting the urge to cover it up is crucial.



With any internal or even external problem, it's vital to be open about the situation and show customers you're handling it responsibly. Of course, this doesn't mean airing all your dirty laundry, but instead focusing on what's relevant to your stakeholders and what steps you're taking to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.Remember, in the age of social media, secrets don't stay hidden for long. But, a proactive and transparent approach can help prevent rumors and misinformation from spreading and doing further damage.Related: Leading With Transparency in Times of Uncertainty2. Act fast, but don't hurryIn any company crisis, time is critical. The longer you wait to respond, the more control you're likely to lose over the brand narrative. That said, acting fast doesn't mean rushing out a half-baked statement. Gathering all the facts, understanding the implications, and consulting with your team are key to crafting a thoughtful and effective response.


A quick but carefully considered approach not only demonstrates your commitment to resolving the issue but can help stop things from escalating on digital platforms, where news travels lightning fast.3. Craft your message carefullyOnce you're ready to speak out, nothing is quite as important as crafting the right message. Such a statement should be clear, concise, and consistent across all channels, including your website, social media, press releases, and anything else used to reinforce your brand.What to know: Within any crisis response, be sure to acknowledge the issue, express empathy with the audience, and detail your action plan (doing so within reason, of course). Try to avoid jargon and corporate speak; a human touch can go a long way in connecting with your audience. Remember, the goal is to reassure stakeholders and the public that you're on top of the situation.Related: Your Public Messaging Strategy Starts With Your Inner Circle


4. Social media is your ally in crisis managementIn any crisis, social media can be a double-edged sword and must be leveraged carefully. While it can easily escalate a crisis, it can also be a powerful tool for managing one, making it essential to put your social outreach in the right hands.When rolling out your response on social media, take care to use your platforms wisely, and to communicate directly with your audience. Provide updates and respond to concerns without divulging unnecessary items that can put your brand at further risk.Social sites like Facebook, Instagram, and even LinkedIn can be invaluable for dispelling rumors and maintaining control over the narrative, but it's important to monitor these spaces closely.Related: Squash the Online Hate — A Business Owner's Guide to Taming Trolls on Social Media


5. Monitor and adaptWith the crisis out in the open and your response plan in action, monitoring the situation closely across the web is crucial. Social listening tools can help track what's being said about your brand and the crisis, delivering real-time feedback and, by extension, critical insights into how your message is being received, as well as how your strategy is rolling out. The digital landscape is fluid, and flexibility can be your best asset in managing a crisis.Related: Unleashing The Potential Of Social Listening (It's Not Just About Being Responsive!)6. Treat every crisis as an opportunityOnce the storm has passed, try to avoid the tendency to simply ""move on."" Every crisis presents a valuable learning opportunity, and analyzing what happened and your response can provide critical insight into what went wrong, what worked across your messaging, and what could be improved. This time can also be used to strengthen any weaknesses you find in your operations or crisis management plan, helping you better prepare for future challenges.Beyond the horizonIn the aftermath of a crisis, it's essential to focus on rebuilding and strengthening your brand's reputation. This might involve continued transparency about the steps you're taking post-crisis, highlighting positive actions or contributions to the community, or engaging in initiatives that reaffirm your company's values. Remember, the goal is not just to recover from the crisis but to emerge stronger and more resilient.


Navigating an internal crisis requires a strategic blend of transparency, speed, communication, social media savvy, teamwork, adaptability and a learning mindset. Following these principles can help protect your company's reputation on the internet and turn a challenging situation into a great opportunity for growth and improvement.

      Key Takeaways    



        Gooljar began arranging the flowers his roommate brought home from Trader Joe's in 2020.
      


        He grew the IRIS blossom Instagram account to more than 40,000 followers and has made over $500,000 in just a few years. 
      


        Gooljar is on a mission to keep growing and lift up other diverse creators along the way.
      












""I've always been an artist,"" Rob Gooljar, founder of IRIS blossom, says. ""I've always been a creative person. I've done a lot of mixed media, painting, drawing, music, photography, but my medium shifted to floral.""In 2020, Gooljar was struggling with depression while working toward his Ph.D. in urban, social and economic geography, and he credits his then-roommate Becca Whittier as ""the catalyst"" for his new creative outlet. Whittier would bring flowers home from Trader Joe's, and Gooljar would arrange them.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom



Arranging flowers became a passion, and Gooljar decided to start an Instagram to bring others along on his artistic journey, especially those who might feel excluded from an industry known for lacking diversity. The average florist in the U.S. is 47 years old, and most of them are women (77.2%) and white (77.3%), according to data from Zippia.With his social media platform, Gooljar put out the kind of representation he wanted to see: ""Hey, I'm a queer Black florist — kind of, not really. I'm just playing with flowers, but watch me, and let's see what happens.""

Meanwhile, he's working with another business partner, Jihann Hanchell, to get IRIS blossom's sister business, island IRIS, off the ground in Turks and Caicos. The idea there is to offer ""full-scale design"" for luxury events.""He was really kind, but looked at me and was like, 'Well, you're not going to get a business loan.'""Gooljar isn't entering into these floral ventures ""blindly,"" he notes. He also has a holding company and a consulting firm. Still, despite Gooljar's entrepreneurial savvy and IRIS's track record of success and growth, its journey hasn't been without some serious challenges. Two of the biggest barriers, according to Gooljar? Funding and space. And in the floral industry, those tend to go hand in hand.


""It's very hard for small businesses to exist in Charlotte without being pre-existing,"" Gooljar says. ""Pre-existing meaning that A, you come from money or B, you have somebody to help you. So we worked out of our two-bedroom apartment [when] we were doing events that were $15,000-$16,000, and we were doing it on our kitchen island that was six-and-a-half feet long. We had buckets all over the house.""IRIS blossom has been ""100% self-funded"" from the start and able to accomplish all it has thanks to its supportive clients, Gooljar says. The revenue earned goes back into the company's growth, a strategy that's helped it achieve its milestone of $500,000 in revenue in just a few years. But in the early days, Gooljar did try to secure a business loan — and was turned away.Related: This Black Founder Stayed True to His Triple 'Win' Strategy to Build a $1 Billion Business""I had a white banker in Charlotte, and he was really kind, but looked at me and was like, 'Well, you're not going to get a business loan because you have to be in business for a few years,'"" Gooljar recalls. ""And then I would ask, 'Well, how are people who are just starting a business getting a loan?' 'Oh, they probably have an online presence, or they probably just go into it with money, and then they can put up their own money.' That kind of quasi, not-really-plausible explanation about funding and gatekeeping funding.""


Affording space in Charlotte remained a significant obstacle. Eventually, Gooljar and Whittier moved into a three-bedroom apartment. But there still wasn't enough room for the rapidly growing business, and Gooljar didn't want to spend all the money they made on rent. At one point in their search for a reliable place to store their expensive, perishable materials, someone offered to rent them an Airstream travel trailer for thousands of dollars a month sans air conditioning or running water.Now, Gooljar lives and works out of a house in Florida.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom


""It's cool when people look at me, and they're wondering if my business is working out: All I can do is smile and say, 'You know, it is.'""Throughout his time building IRIS blossom, Gooljar says he's ""stepped on a few toes"" within the gatekept industry and has had to field some pointed questions: ""Well, who are you?"" ""Is your business going to last?"" ""How's your little business going?"" ""How's your flower thing going?""But none of that has deterred Gooljar, who comes from a ""very long line of people working hard.""""My grandma cut sugar cane for 40 years in Trinidad,"" Gooljar says. ""My parents came here with nothing and worked and tried their best. And I'm trying to change that tide. So yeah, it's cool when people look at me, and they're wondering if my business is working out: All I can do is smile and say, 'You know, it is, and I'm putting in the work for it.'""

Now She Has $25 Million in Funding — and Smart Advice for Fellow Black Women Founders.Gooljar admits that ""there's still a long way to go"" in transforming the industry into a more inclusive space, but he's happy to report that other diverse floral businesses popped up in Charlotte after his own — because ""there's room for everybody.""""I see some of the landscape changing, especially when I go into the floral cooler, and I see somebody else that's Black, or I go into the floral cooler, and I see somebody that's young, or I go in there, and I see somebody with pink hair or something,"" Gooljar says.""You have to face those obstacles and keep pushing because there's always going to be people who are preying on your downfall.""Next, Gooljar plans to implement a national subscription program for IRIS, a sort of ""color-by-numbers"" approach. He'll ship the flowers nationwide, and customers can follow along with his arrangements via video. ""I want people who don't feel creative in their current jobs or current lives to get that creative outlet just the same way that I needed that outlet,"" he says.In the long-term, Gooljar's goal is to collaborate with a tech company to make it possible for people to order IRIS flowers on an app ""like they do an Uber."" But even though Gooljar envisions IRIS as a wide-scale service allowing employees to run ""little mini IRIS blossoms out of their own homes,"" quality remains a top priority.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom

It's not always easy, and Gooljar admits there have been ""plenty of times"" he wanted to give up, but he's always kept going — never wavering in his belief that great things are on the other side.""You can ask anyone that I know, and they will tell you that they don't know anybody that grinds the way that I do,"" Gooljar says. ""And I'm not saying that you just have to throw yourself into everything all the time. But I think a big part of this is that you have to face those obstacles and keep pushing because there's always going to be people who are preying on your downfall. There are always going to be roadblocks. There are always going to be obstacles. There are always going to be things to climb, but you have to just keep going.""

        Nelson's first massive beanbag took three weeks to make and quickly caught people's attention. 
      


        Nelson sold the first beanbags to fellow college students, then branched out to boat shows, trade shows and more. 
      


        Once Lovesac had about 40 store locations, Nelson appeared on Richard Branson's reality TV show and secured a $1 million investment. 
      


        Growing the company from that point was filled with more twists and turns, but Lovesac continues to see rapid growth today with an estimated $700 million in annual sales. 
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Shawn Nelson, founder and CEO of furniture manufacturer Lovesac. The company saw annual revenue over $650 million in the fiscal year ending January 29, 2023.Image Credit: Courtesy of LovesacWhen did you start Lovesac as a side hustle, and what inspired it?



It's 1995, and I'm 18, sitting on my parents' couch in Salt Lake City, Utah. One morning, I had an idea and thought, Wouldn't it be funny to make a giant beanbag chair — like the size of my entire living room floor? So, I got off the couch, drove down to the fabric store and bought enough fabric for something that massive. Then, I began sewing it together. It took three weeks to fill it up with soft stuff I cut up from around the house — but everywhere I took it, people loved it and begged me to make them one. Eventually, I did. It cost me $25 to register the name, and in October 1998, Lovesac officially began as a company.Related: The Side Hustle She Started in Her Princeton Dorm Room Led to a $510 Million Business: 'Don't Take No for an Answer'What were some of the first steps you took to get that side hustle off the ground?When I started college at the University of Utah, I lived in my parents' basement, which was the perfect place to roll out huge, long rolls of fabric. My buddies and I would make the Sacs in the basement and sell them at our college. We quickly became known as the ""Lovesac guys"" around campus, with even the frats and sororities buying a few Sacs for their houses. From there, we were a fixture at any event we could find — boat shows, home shows, car shows, Oktoberfest — and this is how we grew the company in those earliest days.Were there challenges that came with running the side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those?After two or three years of running Lovesac as a side hustle in college, it was apparent that it would not make any real money in its current form. In fact, it probably cost me money to keep it alive. Sure, we'd make a profit selling the product — but then the van would break. Or the foam shredder would break. Or the state would fine me and my buddies for some workplace violation. The bottom line is: Building a business is hard, and it can take a lot of money to make it to some kind of meaningful critical mass.


As we grew, I was working harder than ever. It was draining, but I couldn't help but give it one last shot at a trade show in Chicago, hoping to get to the next level. One of the biggest retailers in the U.S. placed an order for 12,000 Sacs, not knowing that it was just me and a buddy working out of a rundown building with a wood chipper as a foam shredder.Despite every inefficiency, we completed the order, but then we realized we had no other big customers to sell to. We went to the furniture stores, but they all laughed at us and said it was a stupid idea — so we decided to open our own store. The first Lovesac store opened on November 17, 2001.Image Credit: Courtesy of LovesacRelated: The 'Easy' Side Hustle He Started in College Hit More Than $1 Million in Revenue — and Taught Him 3 Business Lessons He Still Uses TodayWhen did you decide to take the business from side hustle to full-time venture?Our first store changed everything — this is when I pivoted the company to a full-time venture. Consumers were obsessed with Lovesac. They came in, bought Sacs, flopped down and hung out with friends. The product was the best sales pitch we could give. We were doing six figures in just the first few weeks, and I had never seen money like that. We promptly ran off to open the second store in Provo, Utah, then Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Southern California. Growth went ballistic.What were some of the biggest hurdles that came up over the years once you were running the business full-time? How did you overcome those?We had grown to 35-40 locations when I got recruited to be on Richard Branson's reality TV show, The Rebel Billionaire, in 2005. It was a national primetime show on Fox Network, and I won a $1 million investment! Of course, I was $2 million in debt, having built this growing retail chain, but what are you going to do? We took the winnings, paid off some debt and raised more money through venture capital. However, the venture capitalists wanted to bankrupt the company and start over cleanly through Chapter 11 reorganization. I was devastated. We had made it all this way, yet somehow, the only way forward was to begin again.


We moved the company to Stamford, Connecticut, downsized the staff to a skeleton crew and started over with just 12 locations and about 12 employees at our tiny new HQ on the East Coast. It was the right move in the long run. We learned, focused and built the company back up to 30, 40, then 50 locations. Some people might have coasted after that, but I got another wild idea. Ironically, this one happened because of a couch, too.In that first store, we had a couch in the corner to show the Sacs in a living room-type environment. We noticed that customers always asked to buy the couch, but it was too big to sell. So, the idea was, What if we could shrink down this couch the way we shrink down our Sacs? And that's how the concept of Sactionals was born.Related: This College Student Started a Side Hustle So He Didn't Have to Bartend Until 4 am. Now He's Earning $7,000 a Month — and Putting It to Good Use.In 2012, Lovesac was named the fastest-growing furniture company in the U.S. by Furniture Today — what made that rapid growth possible? How has the company approached scaling over the years?Around this time, I recognized that if we were going to really compete, we needed to pivot the business. With this in mind, I changed our focus to becoming a direct-to-consumer furniture brand with Sactionals as the primary driver. I took a risk and invested in local and then national TV advertising for the Sactionals, along with every emerging digital approach. Sactionals quickly became the fastest-selling couch solution in the United States. Lovesac expanded to nearly 80 locations, and then [we] took the company public in 2018 with $100 million in sales.After you go public, the sky's the limit. The company was worth $200-300 million overnight. It felt like a dream; I couldn't believe it. We grew to hundreds of locations by the 2020s. We have thousands of employees, and we've been named the fastest-growing furniture company in the U.S. numerous times. Our sales have multiplied and will likely grow to a billion dollars and beyond. The Sactionals gave us a new future. Their rapid adoption revealed that people love the idea of things being built to last a lifetime and designed to evolve with you throughout your life. We're proving that planned obsolescence was the wrong way to make a brand that lasts. We call this new approach to innovation Designed for Life, and it will inform everything we do from here on out.Image Credit: Courtesy of LovesacWhat is the company's current valuation? How much revenue does it bring in today?


Looking back at the past year, Lovesac's growth and performance results are a testament to the resilience of our brand and disruptive business model that has consistently delivered category outperformance and customer loyalty. Through a challenging year for our category, we've been able to maintain momentum with our commitment to product innovation, compelling marketing and a highly productive omnichannel footprint. These strategies continue to drive consumer demand and further distinguish our unique brand from a crowded market. Looking ahead, we believe that we are poised to continue investing in the future with an accelerated pace of expansion and innovation to further garner customer enthusiasm.Prior to reporting year-end results, Wall Street analysts estimate Lovesac's sales for the fiscal year that just ended to come in at around $700 million, with high single-digit adjusted EBITDA profitability. The company has fluctuated in multiples and market cap valuations over the past four years hovering in the $300-400 million range, peaking at over $1 billion in 2021 when the home category hit all-time highs during the pandemic.Related: The Side Hustle He Saw on YouTube Earned Him a Multi-Year Deal With Sony and Income Streams Generating Tens of ThousandsWhen you look to your company's future, what are you most excited about?At Lovesac, innovation is at the center of our design philosophy as we continue to prioritize developing breakthrough technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the furniture category. Challenging traditional definitions of comfort and home style is what has set the Lovesac brand apart since its inception, and over the past few years, we've been working with a variety of high-end fashion brands in the space to create something truly unique in the market. Anti Social Social Club, Jeremy Scott, alice + olivia and KidSuper are among the brands that have collaborated on covers and accoutrements for our two signature styles. We look forward to creating a blend of fashion-forward design and unparalleled comfort that speaks to the modern consumer.What are some of the biggest lessons you've learned over the course of your entrepreneurial journey?In my new memoir Let Me Save You 25 Years: Mistakes, Miracles, and Lessons from the Lovesac Story, I detail the ups and downs of my 25-year saga building the Lovesac business from its days as a college side hustle to a successful IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange and beyond. If you can learn from my mistakes, however, then perhaps your ambitions, big or small, can be realized in less than the 25-plus years it has taken me to finally learn something and get somewhere with mine.Here are some of the biggest lessons I've learned:


1. Heed what the experts have to say, but on occasion, you need to trust your gut.2. There comes a point before any major change in your career, business or personal life where you can greatly improve your odds for good outcomes by making a bold decision to ditch the safety net and fully commit.3. Play along the way, taking the time you need to keep yourself relaxed and sharp.4. You're no good to anyone as a miserable, uptight workaholic.Related: He Started a Side Hustle in His Dorm Room With 'a Bunch of Ingredients From Amazon and a Crockpot' — Now It's a $56 Million Brand in Walmarts NationwideDo you have any advice for others interested in starting a side hustle or business of their own?The entrepreneurial journey I've faced over the past quarter-century has been full of triumphant victories and humbling defeats, born from sweat, tears and relentless determination. With my new podcast series and memoir, I look forward to creating and fostering a sense of community through these channels and shining a light on real, raw stories from industry trailblazers on the movements they have built to bring valuable insights and knowledge to those that seek it.Growing Lovesac into what it is has taken my entire adult life and is the hardest thing I've ever done. I have so many memories and have built so many lifelong friends throughout this journey that make all the stumbles, roadblocks, sleepless nights and unrelenting stress worth it. My advice for anyone considering starting down the road of being a founder would be this: Get off the couch! Trust your instincts, and just keep going. That life-changing moment could be right around the corner, and the last thing you want to do is turn back just before you arrive.Entrepreneurship is a never-ending pursuit, but the journey is the gift. With an open mind, an honest heart, some ambition, time, help and a little bit of luck, all things are possible.

No one knows everything. There's no need to pretend that we do. A great leader is honest about their limitations and strengths. Accept that you will fail. Being honest and open about failure is not a weakness.A great leader is not defined by having all the answers but by a willingness to grow and learn, a curiosity that leads to finding the required answers. It is about stopping, refueling, and being the best version of yourself.Think about it. Do you want a team that comes to you for the answers? That has no mind of its own? No creativity? We all know the answer to that. Command and control is a thing of the past and won't cut the muster in today's ever-evolving business landscape, not if you want to be a business of tomorrow.

31,How to Make PR Campaigns Customer-Focused Instead of Company-Focused,"Feb 21, 2024",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-make-your-pr-campaigns-customer-focused/468757,"
When I started out as a marketer of both people and places, I'd learn as much as I could about my clients and then create collateral that presented them in their best possible light — relaying how educated and experienced someone was, broadcasting loud and clear how financially successful a business had been, how they dominated their market share.Nowadays, however, the very floor upon which I built my career and my business has been renovated. Nowadays, the public isn't so interested in hearing about what makes a company better than its competitors; their ears and eyes are more attuned to what the company can do to make their own lives better.In other words, instead of a professional culture of ""me, me, me,"" we're now in a culture of ""you, you, you."" Instead of saying, ""Look at how great our internal operations are,"" corporate voices are telling their buying public, ""We see you. We see your needs. You matter. You matter to us."" This has created some interesting developments in how we conduct business.



Related: Secrets Behind the Most Successful PR CampaignsThe age of the customer-centric marketplaceCustomer-centricity is a perspective that focuses on creating a positive experience for the consumer throughout all stages of your interaction with them. It's a mindset, but it's also a business strategy that informs an organization's decision-making by cultivating a deep understanding of customer needs and then designing deliverables to meet those needs.


Though the model is not particularly new, the ways it's being implemented in the marketplace are quite modern and pervasive, infiltrating all that businesses are advised to do. In ads, don't blow your own horn, offer solutions to your market's problems. In website copy, don't tout your own merits, engage with the customer where they are. In sales decks, make it about the audience, not the presenters.Putting the customer at the center of any type of business transaction has become SOP, both for brand reputation purposes and, of course, for earnings potential, with a white paper by Deloitte positing that ""client-centric companies are 60% more profitable compared to companies not focused on the customer.""Related: 4 Reasons Your PR Campaign Isn't Driving Sales — and How to Fix ThemExamples of customer-centric PRHere are a few ways my own business has embraced and leveraged this new normal.


Example #1: A restaurant. Traditionally, dining establishments pretty much always promoted themselves by sharing their menu, featuring photos of their ambiance, and sending invitations for special events. Since all that can easily be found online now, this client has pivoted to offering more immersive culinary experience to would-be diners — bringing the dining to them instead of vice versa. For instance, we're aggressively promoting the award-winning chef of the restaurant on TV and podcast segments, where he openly shares ""secret family recipes"" with viewers. A swanky new food truck can cater events on customers' premises, and private parties are also offered at the customers' chosen location.We also talked them into a punch card: 5 visits get you a free appetizer or dessert the next time you're in. Rewards programs are in — people like to be acknowledged for their repeat patronage and appreciated for their loyalty.Example #2: A cosmetics company. Instead of this year's marketing budget allocated primarily to photo shoots that spotlight the product line in magazines and digital ads, this customer has adopted the idea of turning the spotlight on the customer — one face at a time. Its newest PR campaign starts with an emailed invitation to take an online survey to win a free makeover. The survey is quite individualized, covering skin type, skin tone, daily facial routines, preferred color palette and so on. Based on replies, appointments are set at a local salon the company is partnering with, where the customer receives a complimentary consultation.No unrelatable supermodels promising unattainable results, no expensive glossy brochures, no hard sell of the merchandise. The crux here is truly personalizing the customer experience, which is key with today's savvy and time-pressed consumer.


Example #3: A pet store. Every pet owner needs to buy food and supplies, right regularly? So they either frequent your store or they don't — usually based on convenience of location and pricing. But what if you offered them more than just products to buy? What if you offered them ""A Vet for a Day,"" an event we scheduled on a Saturday from 9 am to 6 pm? The store paid the vet, but the visitors didn't; each got up to 10 minutes with the veterinarian to ask questions, have their pet looked over and seek advice on concerns about their animal.The goodwill this event generated cannot be overstated. Yes, sales increased and brand-new repeat clients were won, but the important thing to note is the absence of a direct sales pitch here. Rather, the essence of this campaign was identifying a customer pain point and offering a means to ease it.Related: How to Meet Customers At Their Pain PointsGuidelines for a customer-focused campaignWhat do all of these projects have in common?


They all started with in-depth market research that zeroed in on learning about each business's customer base. You can't just assume you know what your customers value; you have to conduct surveys, garner direct input, investigate and really listen to what your market is saying on social platforms, and then monitor the outcomes of initiatives.They put people in front of profits. An impactful customer-centric campaign shows that you genuinely care about your customers instead of showcasing your own superiority or excellence. You're allowed to be the best and encouraged to excel, but in today's climate, forming meaningful and lasting bonds is valued more highly than purely transactional relationships.The goal was to improve the customer experience at every point of contact. The more you can make each interaction customer-centric — whether that's a visit to your website, offering a free download or coming into your place of business and encountering something unexpected and delightful — the more you will stand out in the client's memory and thus sway their consumer habits.Closing thoughtsThere's always going to be a time and place for me to herald my clients' considerable qualifications, accomplishments and impacts. People will always want to be assured that they're in good hands and can place trust in reputable establishments.Nevertheless, there's no denying that today's standard of practice is about making an impression on your customers instead of trying to impress them. Give it a shot. Design a customer-focused campaign (or hire a pro to do it for you) and see where it takes you. Chances are, you'll travel farther than you ever have before!

Everyone loves a side hustle they can do from home.

Tremont Turner has been doing it part-time for a decade, and makes about $40,000 a year in extra income.Back in 2014, Turner was working his way through college in Hammond, Indiana, making minimum wage at Chipotle and Panera and dreaming of becoming an actor. One day, a friend of his who did some work as a brand ambassador asked if he could cover for her. She was supposed to work a promotional ESPN event — a fantasy football draft — but something had come up and she couldn't make it.Turner was iffy at first. ""I know nothing about football!"" he said. She assured him it was easy, then told him how much it paid — double what he was making in fast food. ""I was like, what?!"" he recalls. ""Oh, I don't care what it is,"" he said.

Of the estimated 113+ million viewers who tuned in for the Super Bowl LVII in 2023, around 43% tuned in primarily for the advertisements — a far cry from those of us who groan at even 15-second-long ads. Super Bowl commercials have become a cultural phenomenon, with audiences anticipating creative spins from familiar brands and often comparing their favorites online afterward. While plenty of companies have secured these behemoth ad slots only to fumble the ball, many have stood the primetime test. By examining the patterns and themes of some of the most successful Super Bowl ads, business leaders can learn from the ultimate marketing play.Related: What Super Bowl Ads Can Teach Entrepreneurs About Marketing1. Emotion gets ads to the end zoneIn fact, one of the most memorable and impactful Super Bowl commercials tugged at the heartstrings of the masses, opting for pathos in the form of puppies. ""Puppy Love,"" the classic Budweiser Clydesdales ad that debuted in 2014, appealed to human consumers not through the classic can-and-condensation combo but via an unlikely animal friendship between a Clydesdale and a golden retriever puppy.



With subtle themes of rustic patriotism and all-American heroism, the Belgian multinational brewing company wooed viewers via man's best friend — and barely featured their product at all. In 2016, it was ranked as the most popular ad ever to air in the 50-year history of the NFL's premier event. The lesson here is clear: wholesome content appeals to almost everyone, and authenticity is universal — eclipsing predictable, emotionally empty product placement.When planning our 2005 ""What Did You Ever Do Without Them?"" commercial for Post-It notes, the 3M team took the same tack, opting for cuteness that resonates with a general audience. While this sentiment does play well, what doesn't make the cut are the unique challenges of filming with unpredictable (albeit adorable) animals.


2. Americans huddle up for humorWhether it's a torrential downpour of lemons forecasted by Budweiser, Homer Simpson swiping his Mastercard or the rapid transitions and smooth-talking of the infamous Old Spice guy, Super Bowl audiences are looking for laughs between plays. Since laughter is shown to improve short-term memory, funny commercials are far more memorable, and so are the brands/products they represent.While one-hit-wonders may have their moment, brands that establish likable recurring characters in their ads are especially adept at building brand awareness and memory recall of the hero products advertised. The average American will likely recognize Progressive's iconic associate Flo, Geico's recently-revived Caveman, Allstate's mischievous Mayhem man and even Liberty Mutual's seemingly inescapable LiMu Emu. The combination of clever humor and unique, original characters makes for an effective commercial that will continue to build and enhance brand awareness for years to come.Related: 4 Must-Haves for Brands Considering TV Commercials3. Social issues are shared goalsMore than ever, Super Bowl commercials are addressing social issues, reflecting a shift in consumer preferences toward purpose-driven brands. By aligning themselves with meaningful causes and communicating their commitment to societal issues, brands aim to foster a positive image and build loyalty.


For example, Dove's ""Real Strength"" commercial (2015) challenges stereotypical gender roles, including what it means to be a ""real man""; Nike supported Colin Kaepernick's social activism by featuring Kaepernick in their 2019 ""Dream Crazy"" ad. Of course, for these allegiances/political stances to be effective, companies must practice what they preach — which is to say that authentic initiatives within the company must also back up these public allyships. Otherwise, companies run the risk of a backlash similar to that against Budweiser following their controversial Dylan Mulvaney partnership.Related: 3 Questions Pepsi Should Have Asked Before Releasing Its Kendall Jenner Ad4. Pass the ball to the consumerAds that end with a Call to Action go beyond traditional one-way communication, inviting audiences to leave a lasting impact. One effective example was Coca-Cola's 2014 ""#AmericaIsBeautiful"" ad, which encouraged viewers to share their own moments of beauty using the company's hashtag. The genius of this hashtag is in its simplicity; much like Budweiser's ""Puppy Love"" ad, which featured a minimal branded product, #AmericaIsBeautiful celebrates the country rather than Coca-Cola. Impressively, the owned hashtag created an onslaught of positive conversation around the brand without actually using any branding. This interactive element cultivated a trend of user-generated content while extending the reach of the company's campaign and engagement.5. Celebrities are the MVPsWhether it's a cranky pre-Snickers bar Betty White, Ryan Reynolds parking a Hyundai or Harrison Ford chatting with an Amazon Alexa, brands often turn to celebrities to boost the appeal of their Super Bowl commercials. When humor and emotional substance may be lacking, there's no substitute for star power, and when companies can combine clever scripts with well-known faces, a viral moment is all but guaranteed. That said, companies must be careful when seeking celebrity endorsements — choosing a celebrity who resonates with the targeted audience and whose image/voice aligns with the company's brand values is essential.


With every Super Bowl, business leaders can become the brand consumers root for. Super Bowl commercials provide a unique and colossal opportunity to capture the attention of tens of millions of people who are not only exposed to the commercials but also look forward to them. Ultimately, the most successful are those who entertain and effectively communicate their brand's message and values.

Restaurant owners can build their business and personal brands simultaneously.Kelli Ferrell is a distinct personality in the restaurant space. Not just as the founder of Nana's Chicken-N-Waffles, but as a dynamic individual weaving together her roles as a mother, content creator, entrepreneur, and self-taught chef.In the world of culinary arts, Kelli transcends the traditional role of a restaurateur.



She uses Instagram as a digital platform to strategically separate her personal brand from that of the business.

""My degree was in fashion, merchandising, and design. It had nothing to do with culinary. So you'll get a little bit more fashion-inspired things. But it's food and fashion that you would really see on @whoiskelli.""On the other hand, branding is an essential element for Kelli that extends beyond her role as a restaurant owner.

        The business partners use a leadership approach honed over years on the set of 'Breaking Bad.' 
      












""I saw a clear opening with mezcal,"" Aaron Paul, co-founder of Dos Hombres Mezcal with fellow actor Bryan Cranston, says. ""You ask anyone on the side of the road, 'Name your favorite mezcal,' [and] they're like, 'Oh, mezcal is…' But they can name a vodka, a tequila.""Cranston and Paul, who played Walter White and Jesse Pinkman on AMC's award-winning crime drama series Breaking Bad, became fast friends on set. So, when Paul suggested the duo start a mezcal brand of their own several years after the show wrapped, Cranston was all in.Image Credit: Paul Quitoriano for Dos Hombres Mezcal 



Dos Hombres, which means ""two men"" in Spanish, launched in 2019. The mezcal is crafted by third-generation maestro mezcalero Gregorio Velasco, who uses traditional production methods to blend Espadin agave hand-picked from the hillsides of the small village of San Luis del Rio in Oaxaca, Mexico. It boasts notes of apples, mango, local ""zapote"" fruits, wood and an ""almost imperceptible"" smoke on the finish.Constellation Brands announced a minority stake in Dos Hombres in 2021 through its venture capital group, though the company remains independently owned and continues to manage, market and produce its mezcal.

They're determined to make Dos Hombres the No. 1 mezcal, they say, and that means doing things a bit differently than some of the many other celebrity spirits brands.""Celebrities have an opportunity,"" Cranston says. ""They have the door open. You want to come in? It's up to you. And a lot of celebrities will come in — and then go away. You want me to go and work…?""""Wait, you're not just going to write me…a check?"" Paul quips.Related: How to Be Your Own Boss and Drink on the Job


Cranston notes that ""there are far more celebrity brands that have failed than have succeeded."" But, like their on-screen characters, the pair isn't afraid to get in the trenches and do what needs to be done. Until about six months ago, the co-founders ""were on emails constantly,"" and Paul ran the company's social media accounts.""I think actors, especially, we're used to stepping into something we don't know,"" Cranston says. ""Every time we take a job, 'I think it could be this, but I'm not sure.' I'm playing a podiatrist — 'Oh, I gotta go learn all about the feet.' So we're not daunted about stepping into something we don't know. We're like a dry sponge. So we go down to Oaxaca once a year and talk to our people.""Image Credit: Paul Quitoriano for Dos Hombres Mezcal ""We break bread with them. We talk to them, and we learn.""Dos Hombres has 50 employees in Mexico and 22 in the U.S., and Paul and Cranston have personally interviewed each person who was hired onto the team. They want to make sure that everyone understands the culture they've built: ""We work hard here, and then we go home,"" Cranston says. ""That's the greatest thing. Work hard, go home.""Paul and Cranston are ""very proud"" of the team members they've brought together — and seize every opportunity to learn from them.""We break bread with them,"" Cranston says. ""We talk to them, and we learn. Every time we're down there, it's like, 'Oh wait a minute, that's a new thing. Why are you doing this? Oh right. What happened there?' And then [we] learn about the mashing, the smoking, fermentation, the distillation, bottling.""Related: Comedy Legend Dan Aykroyd Doesn't Mess Around When It Comes to Vodka


Paul and Cranston's hands-on leadership approach to building their ideal company, team and culture is a straightforward but perhaps underrated one these days. And it carries over from their years on the set of Breaking Bad. Paul, who was 28 when the show debuted, says that Cranston taught him that ""when you're No. 1 on the call sheet, you set the tone.""""[Cranston is] the hardest worker in the room but also the most immature person you've ever met,"" Paul says. ""And I say that with love and respect because he does the job perfectly, but he has the best time doing it. He loves to pull pranks; [he] jokes.""Cranston says there were a couple of hundred people on set that they felt responsible for, and to help establish the kind of close-knit culture they envisioned, they started a bowling night with not just the crew but the crew's family, too. ""We'd take over the entire bowling alley and just play,"" he recalls.Image Credit: Paul Quitoriano for Dos Hombres Mezcal 


""Down in Mexico, they say, 'You kiss the spirit.'""The co-founders might not have anticipated going into business together during their early days on set. Cranston admits he had no idea Paul had such a ""business mind,"" though he was quickly impressed by his co-star's boundless ""energy"" and strong work ethic — and adds that ""he's not at all like Jesse Pinkman.""Needless to say, the real-life friends have a more functional business partnership than Jesse and Walt ever did. They also have a lot of fun with it: Just don't ask them to take any shots of mezcal if you run into them at the bar.""We go out a lot to all the bars and restaurants, and most of the younger kids go, 'Ah, let's do shots,'"" Cranston explains.""It's sacrilegious to do a shot of mezcal,"" Paul says. ""Down in Mexico, they say, 'You kiss the spirit.'""

37,How to Understand Limiting vs. Productive Attitudes Among Day Traders,"Jan 31, 2024",Ross Cameron,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-understand-limiting-vs-productive-attitudes-among/468701,"
The requirements for day traders are straightforward:You need knowledge of the profession. There's indeed a lot to learn, but it's not mystical. If you put in the hours, you can acquire a solid foundation of knowledge over some months.You'll need basic computer gear. When I was a day trader cub, I thought it was cool to have ten monitors and a powerful computer tower. I discovered it was overload. Now, I use a standard laptop and just three monitors.You need a day trading brokerage account. U.S. accounts require a minimum of $25,000 to be maintained in the account, but you can open a foreign one with $500.This brings us to the last requirement: the right applied attitude.When I say ""applied attitude,"" I mean you can have the best attitude, but if you don't take actions consistent with that attitude, you'll fail. For example, if your attitude tells you that you need to be done with trading for the day because of the mistakes you just made — but you decide to take just one more trade — you will soon be toast.



What are examples of trading attitudes that harm or help? Here are four:1. Fear as a brake vs. fear as a motivatorMy inspiration for working hard to become a successful day trader had nothing to do with seeing myself driving a Lamborghini. It had to do with seeing myself homeless if I didn't find a solution, pronto.


I lived in a modest house in Vermont with my dog. My trading account was down to the $25k minimum, and I had $30k in credit card debt. I was also down to the last few things I could sell on Craigslist to raise cash.Fortunately, I had kept a trading journal. As a last gasp before taking up some other profession, I analyzed my winning and losing trades and found certain patterns. Long story short, I turned my trading around. If that fear had led to inaction, it would have ended my trading career.Related: Want to Make Enough Money to Live A Great Life? Start By Setting Your ""Freedom Number""2. Scarcity vs. abundanceA close cousin to a fear mindset is a scarcity one. The first saying I ever learned was: ""A penny saved is a dollar earned."" Money was always tight, as we were continually reminded.


I learned about my great-grandfather, who was on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in 1929 on the day of the crash. He lost everything. That trauma rippled down through the generations to me. I had the feeling not only of scarcity but that you couldn't depend on others for job security. That was reinforced by what happened to my mother: After four decades of working at a hospital, she was laid off.Years later, I learned about my great-grandfather's brother-in-law. He started an investment company following the Great Depression, and he made millions.Here we have a member of my extended family, in the same enveloping Great Depression, who engineered a vastly different outcome. I was intrigued by how this branch of my family did not have a scarcity mindset. It opened the door in my mind to the possibility of thinking differently.Let's jump to today. Not only have I turned $583 into more than $10 million by day trading, but I've had the privilege of working with thousands of other people on their own day trading journeys. I see two other attitudes at work in some of them.


Related: 3 Simple Strategies for Success When Money Is Scarce3. ""My situation is different"" vs. ""How can I make this work?""In one sense, of course, we are all unique. But this characteristic can be taken to an extreme — it can invalidate any advice.Let's say you're reading about a successful franchise owner. You love how this person overcame many obstacles to get where she got. Then you have a choice:You can look for reasons why your circumstances are different and her situation does not apply. For example, you might think: ""It's easy for her to succeed, but English is my second language."" Or ""It was easy for her because she benefited from the whole pandemic hysteria, and we're now over that.""


If you look hard enough, you can find endless reasons why someone's success differs from your circumstances.Or you can look for handholds.Think about rock climbers: At any moment, there are a hundred ways not to move up the wall, but they look for one little spot to grab to pull themselves higher toward their goal.The path of least resistance is to look for reasons why someone else's success does not apply to you. The path of progress comes when you find what you can use from that person's example.

But when you are learning a skill, the time to show how unique you are is after you've mastered the skill.There are three types of cooks: those who wing it and are happy, those who read a recipe but don't follow it, and those who follow the recipe. If these people try day trading, only one has a hope of succeeding.If you wing it, come across a hot tip, open a day trading account and have at it, you will be slaughtered in minutes.If you study successful traders but decide that you can modify their advice, you're doing so with no experience. Your days are numbered.If you first follow their instructions, this allows you to stand on their shoulders and learn their discoveries. In time, you can then modify their principles to match your experience.Day trading for beginners is difficult enough without hobbling yourself with ineffective methods. The right mindset is a foundation on which to make effective decisions. Those moment-by-moment decisions will determine your success in this wonderful but challenging profession.

38,3 Ways to Tackle Common Social Media Obstacles,"Jan 30, 2024",Roxanne Klein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-ways-to-tackle-common-social-media-challenges/468606,"
I have noticed that there are two types of people when it comes to social media: those that love sharing content and those that don't. Naturally, I am in the category of those who don't enjoy posting. However, since social media is basically free and a powerful tool that can increase revenue, I have developed three habits that may assist you.Related: How to Scale Your Social Media Strategies for Growth1. Create a reasonable social media scheduleThree years ago, I hardly posted on social media. My reasons for not posting often had to do with laziness and insecurities. I have overcome both laziness and personal insecurities and am now posting regularly. I am at the point where I can honestly say that regular postings have helped my business.



I overcame laziness by creating a reasonable social media schedule for myself. My schedule included two posts a month on LinkedIn and two on Instagram or Facebook. I know many out there would say one needs to post more than this. However, a person or brand can become redundant if they post too much. I am also a fan of varying posts as much as possible.For example, very rarely will I post the exact same post on more than one platform. If I post the same topic on multiple platforms, I will alter the text and switch out the image. Typically, I try to take various pictures for posts with the intent of using different images on different platforms.


Related: 6 Tips on How to Engage Your Customers Through Social Media2. Stick to your routine and nicheI created a tracking sheet in my first year of posting on social media. This allowed me to stay on task and create a routine. After each post, I would update my tracking sheet with a checkmark. Then, at the end of the month, I made sure I had four checkmarks for that month. I have been able to stick to my social media schedule for the past three years.For the past two years, I have been able to keep up with my postings without tracking. My postings have now become a habit. I am diligent about my social media postings without the need to keep track.Related: Your Social-Media Strategy Should Not Be Random. Here Are 5 Steps to Streamline It.


3. Make a list of topics to post onThe next question for anyone having trouble posting is, what should I post about? I typically will post on events, new business, business accomplishments and article postings.I have a personal commitment to myself that I need to make a post about any event I attend. When attending an event, a lot goes into it, including time and often costs to attend. If one does not post about an event, it is a waste of an opportunity. I typically will post before the event and then post at the event.New business is great to post since it shows the world that you are expanding and taking on new ventures. If you are in the service industry, such as I am in my role as a commercial real estate broker, you could post on a new assignment you have. Or if you own a restaurant and just picked up a new business to cater a significant event, that would be great to post on. Remember, the more personal you make your posts, the better they will be received.Related: 4 Trends That Are Defining the New Era of PR


Business accomplishment posts show your current and new clients that you are active and flourishing. Originally, these posts were problematic for me since I consider myself a modest person and was concerned I would come off as boastful. l have concluded not to be concerned about what others may or may not think. I now believe that if your successes are posted in a down-to-earth manner, others will be happy with your achievements.Article postings can either be articles you wrote or articles you found interesting. If you are sharing an article you wrote, I recommend including an extra piece of information in the post that is not included. If you are posting an article you did not write, I recommend including in the post your thoughts on the article and your reasoning for wanting to share it.Once you have developed strong social media habits, they will become more accessible to maintain. I recommend maintaining them on your own. I know there is artificial intelligence to assist, such as bots that will like other posts for you and AI that will generate content. Stay authentic and do your own social media. Even if you post less because your time is limited, with social media, my opinion is that quality is more important than quantity.

39,5 Goal-Setting Guidelines That Drive Success,"Jan 30, 2024",Brian Will,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-goal-setting-strategies-that-drive-success/468649,"
In the fast-paced world of entrepreneurship and business, goal-setting is the compass that guides us toward success, but there are a lot of misconceptions about how our goals should be set. In this article, we're taking a fresh perspective on the ""foundational"" truths of setting business goals and finding a practical and effective solution that will help you achieve remarkable growth without unnecessary stress.Read on to find out the five essential guidelines for setting goals.Rejecting common goal-setting adviceIt's great to seek guidance when you're trying to set the right goals for your business, but unfortunately not all commonly shared phrases align with practical success strategies.



These common phrases about goal-setting sound good on paper but not so much in practice. Let's find out why:Common Phrase #1: If your goals don't scare you, they aren't really goals.


While the sentiment here is to encourage ambitious goals, the right goals should not induce fear. They should ignite your passion and determination, propelling you forward with enthusiasm rather than causing paralyzing unease.Common Phrase #2: If you can conceive your goals, they are too smallIf you have no idea how to reach your goal, you'll likely never get there. While they should be challenging enough to foster growth, setting goals beyond your understanding or capabilities can lead to frustration and failure. Strive for goals that are ambitious and achievable, providing a clear path for progress without unnecessary obstacles.Related: The 5 Golden Rules of Goal-SettingNow, let's get down to the real business of goal-setting for success. Before you read through these five essential guidelines, you have to understand that success is a progression of thoughts, ideas and execution, and it doesn't happen overnight.Now, here's how to set goals that drive success:


1. Start with realistic timeframesGoing from $0 in profits to $500,000 in a single year might sound thrilling, but is it feasible? Set your goal up for success by creating a realistic timeline to complete it. Consider whether your goal is achievable in one year or a longer timeframe, such as three years, would be more realistic.2. Choose the right vehicleDetermine if your current role or business has the potential to reach your overall profit goals. Evaluating your current situation and identifying whether it can realistically lead to your goal is a crucial starting point in goal-setting. If where you are now can't get you where you want to be, it's time to explore other options.Related: The 10 Golden Rules of Effective Management3. Create a detailed P&LIf you don't know your numbers, how can you know what they'll be down the line? Building an accurate Profit and Loss (P&L) statement for your business is essential, as is breaking down revenue, expenses, sales, leads, and overhead. This provides a detailed financial roadmap, shows you the progress you're making as you go, and allows you to assess the feasibility of your income goal.


4. Back it up and cut backTake your ultimate goal and cut it back into smaller milestones. Say you're making $100,000 a year now, and your goal is to make $500,000. Break that larger goal into milestones of $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, and finally, $500,000. Now you have a four-step progression, and you can create a realistic timeline for each, let's say one year. Breaking your long-term goal into shorter, more manageable milestones helps you maintain motivation and track progress effectively.Related: 16 Actions to Take to Achieve Any Goal5. Set short-term obtainable goalsAdding onto the previous point, once you've broken down your ultimate goal into one-year increments and created a roadmap for each year, take it a step further and create 30-day action plans for each month. Stay focused on daily and weekly targets, and get specific with your short-term goals. This allows for the most accurate measurement of your progress and guarantees you'll stay accountable for your long-term goals.The power of progressionThe progression of short-term goals works like building blocks. Adding one block at a time is more accessible than stacking ten blocks simultaneously. This method keeps you motivated, ensures consistent wins, and prevents constant failure because these short-term goals allow you to see progress, build confidence, and ultimately achieve your desired long-term success. By setting achievable, realistic and motivational goals, you're on the path to reaching new heights in your business.


Related: The Entrepreneur's Guide to Building a Successful BusinessConclusionIn the fast-paced world of business, goal-setting is often misunderstood. Setting overzealous goals that leave you in fear of failure isn't the answer; it's about crafting motivating, realistic, and achievable goals. The path to success is a progression of thoughts, ideas, and actions, taking one step at a time. Start with practical timeframes, assess your vehicle for success, create a detailed roadmap, break your ultimate goal into smaller milestones, and set short-term, attainable targets. This progression leads to constant motivation, and before you know it, you'll reach the pinnacle of success, one goal at a time.

40,Why Personal Branding Is Crucial for CEOs in Today's World,"Jan 26, 2024",Marina Byezhanova,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-personal-branding-is-crucial-for-ceos-in-todays-world/468320,"
As a CEO of your organization, you are likely thinking about investing in your personal brand, but you are likely also hesitant. My personal branding agency works with GenX CEOs from across the globe, and I can assure you that you're not alone in your hesitation.As a GenX'er — member of the often called ""forgotten generation"" — you did not grow up with a cellphone in your hand and did not develop a habit of sharing every single opinion and all your whereabouts online. Many of the leaders we speak with hesitate to put themselves out into the public eye because they have no affinity for the spotlight. Instead, they want to focus internally — on building a world-class organization, scaling teams and inspiring enviable organizational cultures. And of course, many CEOs have internalized the importance of discretion – choosing battles with careful deliberation to avoid any controversy.Related: 7 Reasons Why CEOs Need to Develop a Personal Brand — and How to Build One.



The importance of personal branding for modern leadersAnd yet, the world we live in has changed. Hiding behind the proverbial curtains of our organizations is no longer an option. Research shows that nearly 50% of Millennials expect CEOs to speak out, and this number is growing year to year. Silent CEOs risk criticism from employees, the media and certainly consumers.Edelman Trust Barometer study showed that workers expected their employers to take a stance on a variety of societal issues, including vaccine hesitancy (84%), climate change (81%), automation (79%) and racism (79%).


As a result, we have seen the CEOs of Goldman Sachs, Salesforce and PayPal speaking out about LGBTQ rights. The CEO of Merck has spoken up on racial injustice. And the CEO of Walmart took a position on gun control.Whether generated internally or externally, the pressure to have a more visible public profile is more prevalent for you than ever. And it certainly comes with a myriad of risks to mitigate. The court of public opinion can be merciless when it comes to hot-topic issues. Just ask the CEO of Anheuser-Busch about it!And before you use the Brendan Whitworth example as another reason why a low profile is the winning strategy, let me offer a paradigm shift. I posit that the very reason Whitworth and Anheuser-Busch have faced the amount of backlash we all saw is not because of a public stance, but rather because of a knee-jerk decision to capitalize on a trend. The trend of an influencer-du-jour.You see, in branding — both corporate and personal — it is crucial to first understand what your brand actually is and what it stands for, and then remain ""on brand"" across all marketing efforts. Anheuser-Busch did not do that. And neither did many of the ""canceled"" CEOs you think of when considering your own public presence.


Let's use their examples as a reminder of the crucial importance of going through the process of brand discovery, creating a personal brand architecture, and then aligning all communication to remain ""on brand"" at all times.It all begins with identifying a brand positioning for your personal brand. And, by the way, if the term ""personal branding"" feels overly narcissistic and unrelatable, simply replace it with ""leadership branding.""Related: The 3 Biggest Mistakes CEOs Make With Their Personal Brand (and How to Turn Those Mistakes Around)Brand positioningWhat is it and how do you identify yours? In personal branding, brand positioning is a way to express who you are or what you stand for in a singular word or phrase. In order to define yours, you need to zoom out — away from what you do, away from the vertical you serve, and as close as possible to the essence of your core beliefs.


A personal brand positioning is typically a reflection of a core:BeliefValueTraitIf you have discovered your purpose, the WHY in Simon Sinek's terms, the question to ask is: WHY is that your WHY? Please forgive the tautology, and focus on uncovering what core belief fuels that purpose.For one of our clients, his brand positioning is expressed as ""timeless principles."" This is a reflection of his core values: He is someone who believes in the power of a handshake over a signed agreement and investing in gold over crypto. Another brand positioning we developed for a client was ""interiority"" — the ""inner space"" of physical spaces, with feelings over things at the core. Her WHY as an interior design entrepreneur is to give people a sense of a home, and the core belief behind that ""why"" is that spaces are built out of things, but their key purpose is to create feelings and memories.My brand positioning is centered around ""radical authenticity."" I believe in taking a stance against censorship in every possible form, including self-censorship and censorship of every opposing opinion (cancel culture is the stuff of nightmares for me).Here are some exercises to help you uncover yours:


Build out your ""lifeline."" Identify the most significant moments of your life, both personal and professional. Look for patterns. What keeps surfacing for you? Engage a qualitative researcher or a personal branding agency if you are stuck.List out your core values. Is there one that expresses the true essence of who you are?Do you have a point of view on something that is so unshakeable that you would defend it at any cost?Now take what you uncovered and hand it to a branding specialist — or put on your own creative hat — to turn it into a concept that you can ""own.""Related: How to Build a Personal Brand in 5 StepsWhat to do nextThis is merely step one. It is likely the hardest piece of the branding puzzle, but it's the one that allows you to align all of the other pieces of the personal branding architecture. Before you step out into the spotlight, you will need to have clarity on your:Brand descriptors: How do you want to be perceived?Brand voice: How do you want to sound, both digitally and offline?Content pillars: What topics do you want to be associated with, and which ones do you want to stay away from?CEO story: Gone are the days of the boring bios that nobody wanted to write, let alone read. Research shows that storytelling helps release cortisol, dopamine and oxytocin in the brain — all chemicals that enhance human connection, empathy and an emotional response. Replace your corporate-sounding bio with one rooted in storytelling. You will use its components for your social media profile, speaker page and when you're introduced at events.I spend my days speaking about the importance of personal branding with CEOs individually and from global stages. The hesitations are the same regardless of geography and, yet, so is the understanding that personal branding is inevitable for the modern leader. With 82% of people more likely to trust a company when its senior executives are active on social media, and with 77% of consumers more likely to buy when the CEO of the business uses social media, your impact on the perception of your organization is more significant than ever. Will 2024 be the year you build and scale your personal brand?

42,5 Key Elements of Selling Your Brand to the Media,"Jan 25, 2024",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-elements-of-selling-your-brand-to-the-media/467809,"
Let's clarify something right from the start: crafting your brand and promoting your brand are two distinct functions. The first is a wholly creative process, usually the foundational floor you lay before ever adding one brick to your business. Your brand is a look, a feel and a message. It has a tone, a personality, a presence — it's what you're all about.Getting that brand presence out there into the world is a whole different matter, however. It has to land with your audience, align with the current marketplace and resonate with investors and stakeholders. And when it comes to the media — those individuals and outlets that are hugely influential in determining which brands will be highly publicized and which brands will flounder amid the vast landscape of competitors — you actually have to sell them on your brand.How do you do that? By piquing their curiosity and capturing their attention. Securing media coverage depends on enticing influencers to take a closer look at your brand, then (consequently and hopefully) widely disseminating all the good news about your company that you already know.



Here's what I've discovered about selling a brand to the media in my 20+ years as a public relations specialist.Selling point #1: A compelling storyMedia people are people first, journalists second, and just like me and you when we're out shopping around for something new, they want to be interested in something potentially enriching and exciting. Nowadays, the route to elicit that interest is captivating storytelling. In fact, at the heart of any on-point media pitch is compelling storytelling, and although it's your publicist's job to compose a narrative that integrates your brand's journey, values and impact, it's your job to make sure that narrative is relatable and emotionally engaging by infusing it with authenticity and originality.


For example, there might be nothing new to say under the sun about Brussels sprouts. But when one of my restaurant clients started telling me one day about how his exposure to community gardening as a boy when he was volunteering with his uncle led to his passion for organically grown farm-to-table produce, suddenly my pitch about ""Uncle Bernie's Brussels Sprouts"" on his menu came alive with character and flair. I had a similar experience with an interior designer who just started sharing with me how sitting on the floor as a child watching her mother paint in the basement led to her obsession with color and space. Voilà, I had my brand pitch.The point is: To do something that has invariably been overdone, infuse it with the personal because that's the direction in which media coverage is moving. Your product or service doesn't matter as much these days as your givebacks, your community imprint or your origin story. Media professionals are always on the lookout for something with a touch of uniqueness — appeal to their humanity by delivering that in the way that only you can.Related: The 5 Foolproof Steps to Pitching Your Story to the MediaSelling point #2: Clarity and concisenessNext comes appealing to the ear. The media industry is abuzz with announcements of the ""latest and greatest"" this or that and is positively awash in a sea of submitted content. To get your piece to rise to the top instead of drowning, recognize that time is a precious commodity in this fast-paced industry and act accordingly.


When pitching your brand, ensure that your messaging is succinct and easily digestible. Clearly articulate what makes your brand singular and why that should matter to the modern consumer. If you can showcase how your brand addresses a specific need or accords with a particular trend in the market, all the better. Short and punchy; a well-crafted elevator pitch — that's what the media wants to hear.Related: You're Not Just Selling a Product or Service — You're Selling Your Brand Story. Here Are 3 Steps To Ensure It Sells.Selling point #3: Visual interestAppealing to the eye is equally vital to lure attention to your brand, and this step is actually fun to pursue. Enhance all your brand materials with visually arresting images, high-quality and thought-provoking photos, spiffy infographics and entertaining video snippets. All should support your brand's story and messaging, and yet all do so in graphic format instead of text-only language. People like this; the media loves this — you're supplying them with ready-to-use content that's already primed for public viewing!Selling point #4: Data-driven impactA picture may be worth a thousand words, but in business spheres, facts will almost always trump even the most imaginatively composed fiction. The story still matters — the story will always take center stage — but you'll want to back up your brand's story with concrete data and evidence of effectiveness.


The media is drawn more to brands that can demonstrate quantitative, not just qualitative, success, so brand pitches are an ideal place to seamlessly work into the narrative customer satisfaction ratings, market share percentage and social impact. Appeal to the intellect here by incorporating applicable statistics, case studies and testimonials that speak to the relevance of your brand in the market and give your story backbone and validity.Related: Time to Hire or Time to Fire? How to Rank Employees to Identify Low and High PerformersSelling point #5: Media-friendly assetsLastly, don't underestimate the value of supplying the media with eye-catching, user-directed assets that have been custom-tailored to present your business in its best possible light, in its most irresistible packaging. You're appealing to the media's sensibilities here with materials that serve as excellent resources to supplement and support the pieces you're hoping they'll write or air.I recommend creating a media kit that includes high-resolution images, print-ready logo formats, links to video content, key points that make you stand out and any other pertinent information that will infuse journalists' articles with details and descriptions exclusive to your brand. Then, when requests for interviews start coming in, be responsive and make yourself easily available. The objective for brand pitches — for any kind of pitch, really — is to snag the media's interest in further exploring your brand. When you get them on the line with your hook, the sale has been made!

43,PR Isn't Everyone's Forte. Is It Time For You to Bring in the Pros?,"Jan 24, 2024",Liang Zhao,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/pr-isnt-everyones-forte-is-it-time-for-you-to-bring-in/467114,"
As any startup founder or entrepreneur will tell you, managing your company's press and public relations can be a daunting task. The decision of whether to handle it in-house, consult with a freelance expert or bring in a PR agency is a crucial one that requires careful consideration. Here are some key factors to explore that may indicate it's time to enlist the expertise of a PR firm or freelancer for your startup and what options might work best for your team.Related: When to Spend on PR and When to do It Yourself (or Not at All)Lack of expertise: A complex media landscapeFirst and foremost: Know your limits. One of the primary considerations when deciding to hire a PR agency is the level of expertise within your team. If you or your colleagues lack experience in media relations, navigating the intricate media landscape can be especially challenging and take up a massive amount of time that could be focused elsewhere. A PR agency brings a wealth of expertise, helping you craft effective media strategies and secure meaningful coverage based on their wealth of knowledge, which much less stress on you and your team.



Freelancers are another fantastic resource offering cost-effective solutions for specific PR needs, allowing startups to access specialized skills without a long-term commitment. Hiring a freelance communications manager for a campaign, engaging a content creator for blog posts or bringing in a crisis management expert for a specific situation can be a huge value add without straining a startup's limited budget.By entrusting the complexities of media relations to seasoned professionals, you not only ensure that your brand is presented in the best light but also free up valuable time and resources to concentrate on your core business functions. This allows you to tap into the agency's proficiency, drawing on their insights and connections to navigate the media landscape efficiently and strategically. Ultimately, partnering with a PR agency or freelance expert becomes a strategic investment, enabling your team to benefit from their specialized skills and experience while optimizing your overall business focus.


Limited resources: Juggling responsibilitiesStartups often operate with limited resources, and if your team is already stretched thin with various responsibilities, dedicating time to effective media relations may be a luxury. A PR agency can efficiently manage your current media efforts, as well as plan crucial next steps, allowing your team to focus on core business functions while gearing your company for success.PR agencies also play a pivotal role in shaping strategic messaging for startups. They bring a fresh perspective, market insights and a deep understanding of how to position a brand for the best results. By working closely with your team, a PR agency can help distill complex ideas into clear and impactful messages that resonate with the media and your target audience, which is of particular importance when you're working to build your brand and reach your target customer demographic.It's important to note that collaboration, as in many industries, is an ongoing process. Regular check-ins and feedback loops help maintain alignment as your startup evolves and responds to market dynamics. A dynamic collaboration, rooted in a shared vision from the outset, not only enhances the efficacy of PR initiatives but also contributes to a more enduring and mutually beneficial partnership between your startup and the PR agency.Related: Should You Hire a PR Firm or a Boutique PR Firm? (And What's the Difference?)


Crafting a consistent narrativeConsistency is crucial in messaging. Whether it's a press release, a media pitch, social post, talking point or thought leadership article, the messaging should seamlessly align with your brand's identity, reflecting a cohesive and recognizable narrative. PR agencies invest time and effort in thoroughly understanding your brand, its values and its unique selling propositions. This deep understanding allows them to distill the essence of your brand into a comprehensive messaging strategy that resonates with your target audience — whether it's addressing journalists, engaging with stakeholders or crafting content, the agency ensures that the messaging remains coherent and aligned with your overarching narrative.The consistency achieved by PR agencies is not just about repeating the same phrases but about creating a holistic and evolving story for your brand. This involves meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that the tone, language and key messages align across all communication touchpoints. Consistency breeds familiarity, and a well-crafted narrative that remains constant across diverse channels fosters a sense of reliability and trust among your audience.Need for specialized services: Beyond media relationsPR agencies offer a multifaceted approach extending beyond traditional media relations, providing specialized services such as crisis management, social media management, media training and content creation. This comprehensive strategy ensures startups receive a holistic PR solution addressing both proactive and reactive communication needs.Additionally, PR agencies bring pre-established networks, saving valuable time in building relationships with journalists and media professionals. With connections spanning diverse media outlets, industries and even global markets, these agencies enhance a startup's reach, credibility and influence. The breadth of services and expansive networks collectively contribute to a well-rounded PR strategy, aligning with the unique needs of startups and positioning them for success in an ever-evolving media landscape.

How to Choose a Reliable PR Agency in 6 StepsGoals for growth: Strategic investmentIf your startup has ambitious growth objectives, investing in a PR agency or consulting a freelancer can be a strategic move. The enhanced visibility and credibility garnered through effective PR can open doors to new opportunities, partnerships and investor interest, contributing to your company's overall growth.Overall, keep it simple — be sure that the decision to hire a PR agency aligns well with your startup's unique needs and goals, and be aware of the collaborative nature of working with a PR team or freelancer. If you find that your team lacks expertise, faces resource constraints, requires specialized services, aims for broader reach or is looking to grow aggressively in the coming year, it may be the opportune moment to consider bringing in the professionals. A well-crafted PR strategy can be a game-changer for startups, propelling them into the spotlight and paving the way for sustained success.

44,Your Differentiators Suck. Follow These 5 Steps to Stand Out From Your Competition.,"Jan 17, 2024",Andrea Olson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-steps-to-stand-out-from-a-crowded-market/468049,"
Every company tries to stand out from the competition. We tout our differentiators and push them across all of our presentations and marketing messages. Yet, more often than not, these differentiators are simply not different. For instance, take this example from a major advertising agency's website:""We are trailblazers in our field and have worked directly with some of the industry's top companies. Our focus is the client. Our goal is to help you achieve success. Our people are some of the best you'll find working in the industry today."" While all these points may be true, they surely don't stand out. One would be hard-pressed to identify what company this is, and that's the problem. Too many organizations focus on building the proverbial tick-list of differentiators they believe they must communicate, and not enough time on what their customers actually care about and what truly makes their organization unique.

45,What Really Makes Up the Heart of Your Brand? Your Employees. Here's How.,"Jan 17, 2024",Summit Ghimire,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/building-your-brand-starts-with-your-employees-heres/466931,"
Businesses operate in crowded landscapes, both physical and digital. It goes without saying that it is a fight for survival for small to midsize organizations. In this struggle, entrepreneurs are always on the hunt for all possible ways they and their teams can boost their odds of surviving and thriving.Getting customers' attention is one part of the customer experience, arguably the most important. Sales are sales, after all. In this struggle to achieve a sustainable operation, though, retaining their continuous patronage and loyalty requires something altogether beyond that.Related: 3 Ways a Strong Brand Identity Can Lead to Greater Success for Your Small Business



Brand identity: What makes a company truly unique?Establishing a cohesive brand identity is an essential element for establishing a strong foundation. An incredible product or flawless service, paired with streamlined operations and prudent financials, all coalesce to warrant a spot on the carousel of commerce for a company.The final piece of the puzzle is the company's brand. It's this aspect of an organization's existence that comes to define it. Terminology can begin to blur when professionals dissect a concept, breaking it down into its minutia. Sifting through the haze, you can zero in on the core concepts that carry the most weight and the central element woven throughout this DNA.


A business's brand is the essence of itself. The central elements of a brand identity can be defined as:A defined purpose, mission and values or principles.A trusted reputation is achieved via the customer experience and visibility within the community.Clear messaging in all customer interactions, marketing efforts and employee engagement.Consistent content in marketing with quality written, audio and visual elements across all platforms, locations and formats (both digital and physical).And the lynchpin that is woven throughout this entire process, the force that holds it together? The employees. The comprehensive establishment, communication and understanding of that which defines a company directly impacts long-term survival and potential for growth.Cohesive brand management and the interplay of internal operations and external perceptionsA company's identity is seen in the strategy, culture and operations that make up its daily reality. The clearly defined mission statement, established principles and expected attitudes and behaviors of all employees. These all combine into the soul of a small-to-midsize business, a soul that must be paired with recognizable graphics and messaging.Establishing and maintaining this ethos and these characteristics across all aspects of a company's internal operations and external perceptions is referred to as cohesive brand management.


To establish strong roots and unshakeable ""personality,"" employees and customers alike must buy into this brand. Every experience, interaction and impression must align. It is this brand alignment that is experienced throughout the customer journey and across all media and engagement platforms. Wielded properly, this process cements customer loyalty and fuels the exponential growth of reputation.Related: Branding Is More Than an Accessory: It's the Foundation of Any BusinessEmployees: The backbone of authentic brand representationEmployee engagement is essential to achieve vital brand alignment. For the comprehensive saturation of a brand identity, a workforce must feel ownership of their company's image and ethos. The specific details of achieving this participation will vary with every business, impacted by where it lands on the scale of small-to-midsize operations and the industry and location where it functions. More so, the extent of and characteristics of employee involvement will naturally evolve as an organization experiences growth and achieves scaling. It must persist in an impactful way despite this evolution.Clear communication from leadership and effective employee training are the core means of ensuring the comprehensive understanding and ownership of a company's brand identity. The customer experience is a complex journey, beginning with an entity's logo and marketing content down to the images, words and overall design. This first impression can occur on a company's website, across its social media presence and relevant physical location(s). It continues through the product or service provided and the various interactions had with employees.


The customer journey is dependent upon streamlined operations, which consist of everything from website performance and social media management to accounts payable and receivable, manufacturing and fulfillment and every element that impacts a smooth, positive customer experience.6 key factors influencing brand management and employee engagementConsistent customer experience: Employee embodiment of a brand's identity ensures a consistent customer experience in every interaction.Workforce engagement: When employees connect with a brand's identity, a greater sense of purpose, increased motivation and commitment can be achieved.Word-of-mouth marketing: When a small business's brand is consistent, it's easier for both employees and customers to describe and recommend the business to others.Standing out in the crowd: A firmly established, fully embraced brand identity sets a business apart from competitors, a fact that can prove critical in saturated markets.Talent acquisition and retainment: Quality employees want to work for a business they can believe in, a company with an established reputation anchored by trust and values. A clear and positive brand identity helps attract and retain this talent.Impact on decision-making: Business decisions made with brand identity in mind ensure commitment to a company's mission and values, delivering strategic and cohesive decision-making.Related: If You're Not Approaching Your Brand This Way, You're Losing CustomersSMBs and the inextricable link of branding and workforceBrand alignment and cohesive brand management are both sides of the branding coin. Brand alignment is focused on syncing internal operations with established ethos, a process that creates the brand identity. Divergent from that process, comprehensive brand management centers on achieving a consistent experience, such as service and messaging, across all touchpoints.These separate but equally essential parts of the branding experience are intrinsically linked to an organization's workforce. By prioritizing the establishment and communication of brand identity and investing the effort required to achieve and maintain brand alignment, SMB leadership will directly contribute to a positive environment for all parties.

47,"10 Reasons Why Branding Is Important, Even For Startups","Jan 12, 2024",Athalia Monae,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/10-reasons-why-branding-is-important-even-for-startups/467587,"
Branding refers to the process of creating and establishing a distinctive identity for a product, service, company or individual. It involves shaping the perceptions and associations that people have with a particular entity, to build a positive and memorable image.When I first started my journey of entrepreneurship, I knew branding was an important part of any business, but at that time I didn't realize just how important it was for my startup. For whatever reason, I assumed that branding was more important for larger brands than it was for startups. The more I delved into my journey, the more I learned. The more I learned, the more things started to make sense. I had several ""AHA moments."" It was a struggle for me because I was doing everything on my own, with no guidance. Still to this day, I cherish my teachable moments.Branding is crucial for businesses and individuals alike because it helps establish a unique and memorable identity in the minds of consumers.



A well-defined brand can contribute to customer trust, loyalty and long-term success. It involves a combination of strategic planning, creative design and consistent messaging to create a brand that resonates with the target audience.Related: Six Reasons Branding Is More Important Than Ever Before


Like many other entrepreneurs, I started to get familiar with tools that I felt would come in handy for branding, like Canva, which is a user-friendly online design tool that's helpful with creating images, cards, infographics and slideshows. Adobe Illustrator is a professional graphic design software for creating logos. Coolors has been around for less than ten years and is a hit with creatives when it comes to generating color palettes.Google Fonts is a collection of free, open-source fonts for websites and other projects. While Frontify helps you create and maintain brand style guides, Bynder is a great comprehensive brand management platform that includes guidelines. Asana or Trello are project management tools that keep branding projects organized. Buffer is a social media management tool that can help maintain brand consistency, and Slack facilitates team communication for discussing and refining branding strategies.You have multiple options for whatever your branding needs are, but the choice of tools depends on your specific needs and the scale of your branding efforts. It's often a good idea to integrate a combination of tools for a comprehensive branding strategy. There are different components when it comes to branding.The key components of brandingBrand identity: This encompasses the visual elements of a brand, such as the logo, colors, typography and design elements. Consistency in these visual elements helps in creating a recognizable and cohesive brand image.Brand positioning: This involves defining where a brand stands concerning its competitors and how it wants to be perceived by its target audience. It often involves highlighting unique selling propositions and key differentiators.Brand image: This is the perception that people have of a brand. It is shaped by the brand's messaging, communication strategy, customer experiences and overall reputation.Brand awareness: The extent to which a brand is recognized by potential customers. Effective branding aims to increase awareness and make the brand easily identifiable.Brand loyalty: The degree to which customers consistently choose a particular brand over others. Building strong brand loyalty often involves creating positive emotional connections with customers.Brand equity: This is the overall value of a brand, which includes both tangible and intangible assets. A strong brand with positive associations often commands higher perceived value in the market.Related: Why Is Branding Crucial For StartupsWhy branding is critically important for startupsDifferentiation: Startups often enter markets with established competitors.

This consistency can lead to a more polished and professional image.Long-term success: Startups often have their sights set on long-term success. A strong brand can contribute to building a lasting business that can weather challenges and adapt to changing market conditions.Value creation: Over time, a successful brand can become one of your startup's most valuable assets. It can command premium pricing, drive revenue growth, and contribute to the overall valuation of the company.Emotional connection: A powerful brand can create an emotional connection with customers. It can tap into their aspirations, values and desires, fostering a deeper bond and increased brand loyalty.In summary, branding is important for startups because it helps them establish a strong identity, build credibility, attract customers and investors, and lay the foundation for long-term success. It's an investment that can pay significant dividends as a startup grows and matures.Related: 4 Branding Strategies Every Startup Founder Should Know About

49,How I Boosted My Website's Revenue Tenfold in 5 Months,"Jan 9, 2024",Jim Campbell,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-i-boosted-my-websites-revenue-tenfold-in-5-months/466398,"
In July of this year, I purchased Honeymoons.com for mid-six figures. The acquisition was a strategic shift from managing multiple online businesses to focusing on one. While it was a gamble to move away from the portfolio model, the past five months have resulted in a 7x increase in traffic and a 10x increase in revenue for the site.Here's how I arrived at the decision to purchase a premium domain name and how the purchase has resulted in a much stronger overall business. Whether you are struggling to manage multiple businesses, seeking to grow organic search traffic or just starting to build your online business, I hope my lessons can help.Related: I Spent the Last 3 Years Building My Side Hustle Into a Full-Time Business. Here's What I Learned.



Pursuing a portfolioIn 2022, I was able to quit my full-time job managing a portfolio of websites for Thrasio and focus fully on my own portfolio. My strategy was to continue working on my main site, HoneymoonGoals.com, and build a portfolio of websites in correlated niches, such as engagement rings, weddings and Caribbean travel.Portfolio models are hot right now. Influencers like Codie Sanchez have built a massive following promoting buying and running multiple businesses (she owns more than two dozen). My previous employer, Thrasio, built a portfolio of Amazon businesses and became the fastest U.S. company to reach a $1B valuation. While the diversification of a portfolio makes sense, I uncovered some serious downsides to running multiple online businesses that led to my decision to purchase Honeymoons.com.


2 deadly problems with the portfolio model for organic search trafficThe main benefit of building a portfolio of websites is diversification. Running a single website can be risky. Google Core Updates can decimate organic traffic. Critical partners can shut down significant sources of revenue. A portfolio can provide safety through multiple sources of traffic and income streams.But a portfolio is hard to manage and harder to grow. After raising over $3 billion to create a portfolio of Amazon businesses, Thrasio is preparing to file for bankruptcy. The portfolio model is not quite as ""cookie-cutter"" as it seems.Websites that rely on organic search traffic, like mine, need to excel in two crucial areas: quality of content and authority. I discovered that a portfolio model makes this extremely difficult.Problem 1: Producing and maintaining top-quality contentI have a staff of freelance writers who are skilled at researching and formatting articles for SEO. However, instead of focusing on honeymoons, they needed to delve into engagement rings, weddings and Caribbean travel.


Google has been clear for decades that it wants websites to produce ""helpful, reliable, people-first content."" To rank at the top of Google results and stay there, you need to create the best content on that topic, which is the most helpful information online. Hiring experts to create this content in multiple niches is incredibly difficult.Problem 2: Being a genuine authorityGoogle evaluates websites on E-E-A-T, which stands for experience, expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness. These qualities are commonly called the ""authority"" of a website. Demonstrating true E-E-A-T is the fastest way to climb Google rankings and generate search traffic.One leading indicator of E-E-A-T is links to your website from other websites. For example, if the Wall Street Journal references you and your website as an expert in travel, that is a sign to Google that your website has authority in the travel niche. Splitting focus across multiple websites creates a serious issue for building this authority.Related: How I Turned My Love for Travel Into a $50k a Month Business


Going all-in on honeymoonsAfter a previous conversation, the owner of Honeymoons.com contacted me and told me he was accepting offers for the business. I realized that focusing on a single business with a premium domain name may solve the two biggest challenges of running a portfolio of businesses.The acquisition was a serious gamble. Five months later, here are the results:Massive improvements in quality and authority with an expert content teamSince acquiring Honeymoons.com, the content has drastically increased. The authoritative domain name has made it easier to attract top talent to contribute their travel expertise and experience to the website. We even hired a travel agent to assist visitors and edit content.Moving from multiple niches to one combined has produced better, more focused content. Writers and articles are able to level up their subsequent articles instead of plateauing. For example, the website has over 250 honeymoon destinations. As we add destinations and improve the quality of existing articles, the team is able to dive deep into evaluating a honeymoon destination, as opposed to moving to a different topic.


Recognized as an authority by leading websitesThe premium domain name, alongside my focus on honeymoons, has made it exceptionally easier to get mentions and links from leading websites and institutions.In the past five months, Honeymoons.com has been referenced by The Wall Street Journal, Yahoo.com, AskMen.com and many other popular websites. After trying for years to build these mentions with subpar domain names, I am certain that the premium domain name accelerated the increased trust needed to cite our content and opinions.700%+ increase in organic trafficThe combination of improved content and authority has skyrocketed the SEO traffic for Honeymoons.com.For transparency, I will use metrics from the popular SEO tool ahrefs. Before my acquisition, the website was receiving an average of 5,500 organic visitors per month. Currently, it receives nearly 44,500 monthly organic visitors.


Google is rewarding the investment into quality content and the recognition of Honeymoons.com as a leader in romantic travel.10x increase in revenueConcurrently, with an increase in traffic, the revenue of the website has increased substantially.The value of the monthly organic traffic to Honeymoons.com in June was $3,500, according to ahrefs. By December, the value of the organic traffic had jumped to $35,000 per month. Traffic value has increased faster than traffic volume, due to high-value search terms ranking, such as ""honeymoon packages,"" which would cost around $0.50 to acquire a user via CPC advertising.This increase is directly correlated to the improvement in content quality and the jump in authority, all made possible by focusing our efforts on building a premium domain name.

While it presents challenges, including high cost and strategic planning, the potential for a strong ROI makes it a worthy consideration for small to medium-sized business owners looking to elevate their digital presence.

50,A Guide to Socially Conscious Posts (And Their Consequences),"Jan 2, 2024",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/a-guide-to-socially-conscious-posts-and-their-consequences/466454,"
Over the last 15 years or so that I've been running my PR business, a lot has changed in the U.S. political and socioeconomic landscape. But what hasn't changed and likely never will is the power of the almighty dollar. The transformation that is currently underway, however, particularly among the younger generations, is how we're going about chasing that dollar.The quality of a product or service still counts. Effectiveness and affordability still count. But the newest variables that have been added to the equation predicting where consumers will spend their money are the beliefs that underlie a company's mission, the ethics that inform its practices, and the footprint it's making on the planet (both ecologically and politically). We're seeing the effects of these remarkably influential factors across virtually all industries, in small ways (like the vernacular shift to ""vegan leather"") and large ways (like the ESG scores various agencies are assigning to corporations that hugely affect their investability).We're a dollar-driven economy, it's true. But based on what I'm seeing in the marketplace concerning my clients, we're becoming, more and more, a values-driven society. What does that mean for small businesses, and what are the repercussions of this evolving mindset on consumerism?



Related: How Social Entrepreneurs Are Changing the WorldSocial media as the new world stageIn this day of blogs, blogs everywhere, much has already been written on this topic. I'm neither an economist nor an ethics professor, so all I can add to the discourse is my perspective as a public relations expert immersed daily in social media.


It's there that all the world's stories are being told and all the central players are creating their own narratives, so it's there that companies and organizations of all types and sizes have been opting to speak up or, in some cases, stay silent on issues of societal importance.Whether or not to post on such issues has become the prime question for businesses. My answer? Every business has to decide what part it wants to play in the unfolding drama around us and what voice it wants (or doesn't want) to add to the dialogue.Related: Should Your Brand Embrace Social Issues?Guidance on brand voice and stanceI was recently asked for my advice on a dilemma a company in the beauty space was facing. They were experiencing a totally unanticipated backlash after posting what they thought was a brief, commonsensical, utterly unobjectionable statement supporting a cease-fire in Gaza.


When numerous disgruntled customers started commenting within moments — some pledging to boycott them forever, some explaining why they now had to give up their favorite moisturizer reluctantly — they asked me what they should do. Never post a socially conscious message again? Issue an apology? Stick to their guns with a follow-up post? Here's what I told them.Do your homework. The general directive out there these days is for brands to ""get personal"" with their client base. So their posts aim to foster connection with increasingly subjective messaging, which can have both positive and negative outcomes. Consumer Goods Technology reported in 2022 that a whopping 82% of shoppers want a brand's values to align with their own. If they don't, most will abandon the brand, and 15% will make their thoughts known on social media.Your current and potential customers are educating themselves on locating companies aligned with their ideals (through resources such as World Changer), so you should stay informed, too. What are your closest competitors posting? What share of your market prioritizes values over products or price? Does your client base want facts-based or feelings-based social content from you? If you don't know, find out.Know your audience. The way to find out is to know your target market. You can better hit the mark with your social content when you have a solid understanding of their preferences and a good grasp of their ideological underpinnings. This doesn't mean you should compromise your belief system and pander to your market just for capital gain, but it does mean that if you have a captive audience, you'd be wise to speak to them in ways and on topics that matter to them.


Determine what's most important to you. We each get to decide what's most critical to the future of our business. When you settle on your driving force, you can adhere to the map that will get you to your intended destination. If profitability is the topmost objective of your business plan, there's no shame in that. If sustainability is what revs your engine, that's great, too. It's your business. Write out your chief aims, rank them in order, then pursue them in that order.Weigh your options. No matter your post, it won't align with everyone's principles. So posting is a matter of calculated risk, not across-the-board acceptance. On the one hand, you need to be prepared to lose some customers. If you can't afford to alienate even a fraction, think long and hard about posting anything remotely antagonizing. On the other hand, by appealing to your base's sentiments, you exponentially increase your chances of retaining their long-term loyalty even as you simultaneously attract new clients who agree with your position and admire your courage to declare it.Hire a professional to craft your posts. Because socially conscious posts are so fraught with potentially hazardous consequences, I'd strongly advise hiring an experienced social media marketer to compose your content. PR teams specialize in reputation management and know how to field good and bad feedback. Brand neutrality, I'd say, is quickly becoming obsolete. So if you're going to post, having an expert draft your content is a reliable means to establish your brand's core values in the marketplace and, when necessary, reestablish them when your reputation takes a hit.Related: Businesses Must Make a Stand on Important Social Issues


A final word: Stand firm and stay trueI personally admire companies that choose to speak out. And because my success in my industry owes more to my heart than my head, I endorse being vulnerable and transparent with followers. People can sense authenticity, and they can sniff out self-serving fawning.So if you have something to say and you're clear on wanting to say it, just choose your stance and then stick with it. If you deviate from it under public pressure, you must not have been that committed to it in the first place. And if it's significant enough to what you and your team are creating, then it's more of a necessity and less of a choice to speak up.But it's important to remember that people mess up; they always have and always will make mistakes. Our foibles just weren't so publicly and immediately aired before the digital revolution. So if you misstep, know that that's to be expected — and that you can course-correct in the future.None of us will earn an A+ from every consumer we're trying to reach — a 100% approval rating just isn't realistic. Knowing that you're going to displease a certain sector no matter what you say, isn't it worth speaking your truth? If it matters enough to you and your brand, yes, it's worth it!

51,7 Things Brands Should Consider Before Collaboring With an Influencer,"Jan 1, 2024",Oliver Goulden,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/forging-ahead-understanding-influencer-partnerships-in/465904,"
In today's digital-first world, brands are increasingly turning to social media influencers to amplify or be the face of their brands.The decision to collaborate with influencers, however, is not one to be taken lightly. Compared to traditional marketing channels, influencer partnerships come with their own set of challenges and opportunities. There are several factors brand managers and marketers should consider in evaluating whether an influencer collaboration aligns with their brand strategy and goals, and it goes far past their follower count.Related: Influencers Have Some Serious Power — Are They a Worthwhile Spend for Brands?



1. Authority and trust in the categoryIn the realm of influencer brands, authority and trust reign supreme.Founders who have established themselves as authorities within their respective niches are poised for success. Influencers with extensive knowledge and expertise will earn the unwavering trust of their audience, regardless of the industry. When an influencer boasts such authoritative credentials, their recommendations carry a level of trust to their audience.


Related: 5 Things You Should Know Before Collaborating With An Influencer2. Influence that sellsWhile a substantial following certainly helps an influencer brand reach a broad audience, it's not just about the numbers. Some influencers amass followers for various reasons unrelated to their industry acumen — be it their dating lives, roles in movies or prowess in sports.Others demonstrate the principle that true influence isn't solely based on follower count. Micro-influencers may have smaller audiences, but they often boast higher engagement rates and a more targeted reach, making them increasingly popular among brands seeking authentic and effective partnerships. These influencers possess the unique ability to sell products earned through a history of reliable recommendations and endorsements. It's this trust that underpins someone's overall influence in the market.True influence is about having the power to sway preferences and decisions through a genuine, proven connection with an audience.


3. An authentic brand story and aestheticAuthenticity serves as the cornerstone of influencer-driven brands. It's the authenticity that initially attracts followers, and transitioning that authenticity to a brand is a formidable challenge. In a market saturated with brands, a name alone is often insufficient to capture the attention and loyalty of consumers.Today's customers seek a deeper story, a genuine connection and an aesthetic that mirrors the founder's identity. To truly resonate and sell effectively, influencers need to align closely with the brand's values, story and ethos. This alignment ensures that their promotions and endorsements do not feel forced or superficial, but rather, they appear as a natural extension of the influencer's own narrative and principles.When an influencer shares a strong correlation with the brand — be it through shared values, lifestyle or aesthetics. It enhances the credibility and impact of their endorsements, leading to a more authentic and effective partnership.Related: 5 Ways to Identify Influencers Worth Your Brand's Time and Money


4. A product that serves a market needMost consumer markets are saturated, making innovation and market relevance paramount. Standing out amid the sea of products and services necessitates identifying and addressing a genuine market need. If an innovation meets an unaddressed market need, then it can put itself in a position to be successful.A product or service might be interesting thanks to the influencer's marketing skills, but if the brand and its products don't meet a need, it will have difficulty succeeding.5. Product excellence beyond expectationsProduct mediocrity will be swiftly dismissed. Influencer-owned brands face heightened scrutiny, with the burden of proving their products' superior quality given that they are personalities rather than scientists or manufacturing experts. Their fame in the market presents a challenge — the need to exceed customer expectations. These brands must deliver products that not only meet industry standards but also surpass them.The influencer's reputation hinges on delivering the highest quality; this commitment is the brand's greatest asset. Whilst an influencer may know what they want to create, working out where in the world to manufacture it, how to negotiate MOQs and pricing, adhering to regulations and making the product meet expectations should not be underestimated.


Bad decisions here can kill a young brand or business before it's even started. Poor decisions can also set these brands up for failure as they grow.Related: Why Consumers Care About Influencers, and Why You Should Too6. Smart and effective operationsEcommerce operations, from warehouse management to shipping logistics, fulfillment and customer service, are intricate and demanding. Customers anticipate a seamless shopping experience. Anything less than excellence can tarnish a brand's image.Influencer brands must master the art of efficient operations, ensuring that the customer journey is flawless, from browsing to delivery. Regardless of the industry or market, many sales take place online and making this as easy as possible for the customer is essential for success.


7. Continual community buildingThe community an influencer has built should never be neglected. It must always be the brand's guiding principle. Deviating from this ethos risks alienating the most loyal followers, who may turn against the brand if they perceive a shift in priorities. Nurturing the community, engaging with followers and actively seeking their input and feedback ensures that the brand remains aligned with the expectations and values of its audience.In the dynamic world of influencer brands, it's not just about capitalizing on an influencer's following. Success hinges on the fusion of trust, authenticity, innovation and exceptional operations. When harmoniously orchestrated, these key factors create a brand that not only reaches for the stars but firmly grasps them, delivering substantial returns and leaving an indelible mark in the field.The magic isn't in the follower count alone — it's in the mastery of these crucial elements that distinguishes thriving influencer brands from the rest.

53,How to Establish a Distinct Brand Identity in a Saturated Market,"Dec 22, 2023",Chad Willardson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-establish-a-distinct-brand-identity-in-a-crowded/466846,"
In today's digital world, crafting a standout personal brand is essential for success as a business leader. One thing's for sure: Consumers trust and purchase from real people more than impersonal brand names. This is especially true with a service business. According to the recent national research study, ""Trends in Personal Branding,"" personal branding is more than just a social media personality contest. The data showed that 67% percent of ALL Americans would be willing to spend more money on products and services from the companies of founders whose personal brand aligns with their own personal values.A personal brand that captures your unique expertise can elevate your business and create a loyal customer base. That same study mentioned above showed that 74% of all Americans reveal they're ""more likely to trust someone who has an established personal brand."" In perhaps the most powerful statistic of the entire study, it turns out that 82% of all Americans agree that ""companies are more influential if their executives have a personal brand that they know and follow.Let's explore some action steps you can take to build a brand identity that cuts through the noise of a crowded marketplace.Related: 8 Reasons a Powerful Personal Brand Will Make You SuccessfulCrafting and communicating your brandYour personal brand is the story you tell the world, and your audience wants to learn something genuine about you and your brand story. It's crucial to share not only your professional triumphs but also the personal stories and passions that make you relatable, such as your hobbies, family, travels, etc. Consistency in your messaging creates a coherent narrative, while authenticity fosters a trusting relationship with your audience.



Embrace the platforms where your audience engages the most. For professionals, LinkedIn is often the go-to, serving as a space to demonstrate expertise and share personal insights. Authoring books and hosting podcasts can elevate your authority, allowing you to reach a wider audience with in-depth knowledge. My brand and reputation on LinkedIn didn't soar until I added a lot of authentic posts and stories and less boring business-focused posts. Sharing personal aspects should be done thoughtfully, ensuring each story aligns with your professional message and adds value to your brand narrative.Building community and engagementThe goal of a personal brand is to create a community, not just a following. Engagement is key. Encourage your audience to participate in conversations or debates through comments, forums and direct messaging. This interaction makes your brand relatable and accessible.Responding to feedback and adapting your brand message is important, but remember to stay true to your core values. Avoid the trap of overpromotion, and strive for a balance that promotes engagement over sales. Your brand should inspire interaction and foster a genuine connection.Building relationships with other like-minded entrepreneurs can open the door to opportunities that are mutually beneficial, such as speaking on a podcast or attending an upcoming event. When you collaborate with others outside of your immediate followers, you're able to tap into their audience, gaining exposure to potential customers who already trust your collaborators' judgment.


To be most effective in growing your audience, select partners whose personal brands resonate with your own. Their followers should have interests that overlap with the products and services you offer. For example, if your brand is built on financial literacy, partnering with influencers in the personal development space could be advantageous.Scaling your business through personal brandingSuccess in personal branding can often be qualitative. Look for engagement beyond likes and shares — genuine messages from your audience and opportunities for collaboration are indicators of a resonant personal brand. As your brand gains traction, use your influence to support your business goals. A strong personal brand can lead to new ventures and partnerships while amplifying your reach. As you scale, maintain the integrity of your brand. Growth should enhance, not compromise, the personal touch that distinguishes your brand from the rest.Building a personal brand is an ongoing process that involves sharing your journey and leveraging your experiences. It's a powerful strategy for entrepreneurs, offering a platform for growth and the opportunity to make a real impact. Maintain authenticity, consistency, and focus on community. These principles will guide you in creating a personal brand that not only stands out but also stands for something meaningful.A reputation is built up by trust, and a personal brand is a trust accelerator. Another recent study found that 76% of American Millennials are more likely to buy from a person with a personal brand.


Related: 6 Strategies You Need To Ensure Your Personal Brand Stands Out1. Define and deliver your value proposition clearlyImagine you're a chef at a bustling food market. Every other stall is offering a range of dishes, each with its own mix of flavors and ingredients. To stand out, you need to have a signature dish — something that no one else offers, that tells your story and satisfies a unique craving. Your value proposition is that dish.What is it that you provide that no one else does? Maybe it's a unique combination of services, or perhaps it's a particular approach to wealth management that's both approachable and highly effective. Once you've defined it, communicate it consistently across all platforms — be it on your LinkedIn profile, on your podcast shows or when speaking at events. Make it clear, make it appealing, and ensure it speaks to the core of what your audience values.2. Personalize your client experienceImagine each client interaction as a handcrafted gift. It's not just about the content inside the package — it's about the wrapping, the note that accompanies it and the perfect timing of its delivery. Your clients should feel that every piece of advice and every service you offer, is tailored specifically for them.


This doesn't mean creating entirely different services for each individual, but it does mean understanding their unique challenges and goals. Use client feedback to refine your offerings. Send personalized communications. Host events that cater to their interests and values. By personalizing the client experience, you build a relationship that feels exclusive and deeply connected to their needs.3. Educate and empower your audienceJust as a gardener nurtures plants to grow, so should you cultivate your audience's financial knowledge. Education is empowerment — and by providing valuable, easily digestible information, you position yourself as not just a service provider but a guide and mentor.Start a blog or a YouTube series focused on financial literacy, using simple language and relatable analogies. Explain complex concepts using common life experiences, like comparing diversified investments to a balanced diet. Not only will this reinforce your brand as a source of valuable knowledge, but it will also foster trust and deepen the relationship with your audience.Related: The 3 Questions You Must Answer to Make Your Brand Stand Out


In a saturated market, your personal brand isn't just a label; it's your distinct edge. Your key to success is authenticity and engagement. By genuinely connecting with your audience and consistently delivering on your unique value proposition, you create more than just a brand; you build trust and long-term loyalty. It's about being relatable yet professional, innovative yet grounded.Remember, in the realm of entrepreneurship, your personal brand is a powerful tool that drives not just visibility but real, meaningful business relationships. Cultivate it with intention, and watch it become your most valuable asset in navigating the competitive business landscape that we all find ourselves in.

54,Your Brand Will Flop If It Doesn't Stand Out. Try the Contrarian Design Strategy That Worked for These 6 Founders.,"Dec 22, 2023",Frances Dodds,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/6-brand-design-tactics-that-will-make-you-stand-out/467163,"
How many times have you walked past a storefront, perused a grocery store aisle, or scrolled through your Instagram feed and experienced a little ""I want that!"" ping to your brain after seeing a particularly compelling image? That, in a nutshell, is the power of great design.According to research from Insights in Marketing, 93% of consumers say a product's appearance is the most important factor in their purchasing decisions, and 85% say they're heavily influenced by the colors of a product or brand. And because the average consumer spends so much time looking at their phone, brands have more ways than ever to make a visual impact. Bankrate found that 48% of social media users have impulsively bought something advertised to them on social media, and a whopping 72% of Instagram users base their buying decisions on content they see on the platform.So, in a time when consumers are endlessly bombarded with brands, how do you create something that stands out? Something unconventional and unexpected, but still appealing to the established tastes of your customers? We asked some founders who leaned on design to build best-selling brands. One common strategy? They all looked at their categories and figured out what wasn't there, and designed into that blank space.

55,"Early Bud Light Boycotter Kid Rock, Who Fired a Rifle at Cases of the Beer, Just Changed His Stance — Here's Why","Dec 13, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/kid-rock-tells-tucker-carlson-his-bud-light-boycott-is-over/466913,"
It's been a rocky year for Anheuser-Busch InBev-owned Bud Light following the company's partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, which led to calls for a boycott and a subsequent decline in sales.Now, musician Kid Rock — who vented his frustration with the brand by firing at cases of Bud Light with a rifle — told Tucker Carlson on his X show that he will no longer be boycotting it, per CNN.""So, do I want to hold their head underwater and drown them because they made a mistake? No, I think they got the message,"" Rock said in the interview.Image Credit: Jeff Bottari | Getty Images



Bud Light saw sales fall as much as 42 percent in some U.S. metro areas in the four weeks that ended on July 22, according to Nielsen IQ data analyzed by the consulting firm Bump Williams, per The New York Times.Related: Angry Customers Boycotting Bud Light Haven't Meaningfully Impacted Sales, Says Anheuser-Busch CEOBut for all his talk of boycotting the brand, Rock's actions appeared to tell a different story. When CNN visited a bar in Nashville owned by the musician over the summer, Bud Light was being served, and in August, Rock was spotted drinking the beverage in pictures obtained by TMZ.""Hopefully, other companies get it too, but you know, at the end of the day, I don't think the punishment that they've been getting at this point fits the crime,"" Rock told Carlson. ""I would like to see people get us back on board and become bigger because that's the America that I want to live in.""


Bud Light attempted to combat slumping sales with discounts and advertising tied to football and music, and Anheuser-Busch announced that its U.S. chief marketing officer, Benoit Garbe, will resign at the year's end to streamline operations.During its latest earnings call, Anheuser-Busch acknowledged a nearly 17% decline in sales to U.S. retailers, largely attributed to the plummeting volume of Bud Light. But in an October analyst call, the company also revealed that 40% of former customers are willing to give the beer another chance.Related: Bill Gates' Foundation Just Made a Big Bet on Anheuser-Busch and Bud Light, Despite Declining Sales""This gives us some certainty that we are moving in the right direction,"" AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris said on the call.

57,How to Get Your Business Noticed (and How to Brag About It),"Dec 7, 2023",Cynthia Kay,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-brag-about-your-business-accomplishments/465818,"
Companies all across the country are doing great work that goes unnoticed. Why? There are many reasons. Some businesses don't like to brag about their accomplishments. They don't apply for awards that might put them in the spotlight because they don't want to be seen as boastful or conceited.It's great to be humble, but recognition is important to be known as an expert in your field. And who doesn't want that? Let's face it: no one wants to work with an average company. We all want to do business with innovators, those who continuously improve and push the limits.So, how do you get appropriate bragging rights? Get noticed for your work? Generate positive word of mouth and establish your ""brand promise?""Related: 20 Ways to Master Your Personal Brand on LinkedIn in 2024 and BeyondAwards that build credibilityAwards are one way to differentiate your business. However, I learned early on that to get noticed, you must do something truly award-worthy. I like awards that demonstrate business results. For example, I sit on the Michigan Celebrates Small Business (MSCB) board, a 501c3 that awards the 50 Companies to Watch. These are high-potential, second-stage companies that demonstrate excellence and support the economy.



Industry or supplier awards are also impressive. An industry group or professional organization usually sponsors these awards. They show that the work is excellent and noteworthy compared to your peers. Before you apply for any award, do your homework. What do you know about the sponsoring organization? Are the criteria specific and understandable? Is there a rigorous process? Are the judges independent experts or individuals who will simply select their buddies? Does the list of past winners include well-known and respected companies? If so, you might want to apply.Finally, there are community awards. Many non-profits recognize individuals and companies that ""do good"" and help advance their programs or mission. Using your skills and your company's resources for these non-profits can provide visibility. However, I believe this should not be your goal. Give without expecting anything back, and don't do it unless you really care about the organization. If you are honored for your efforts, accept the accolades humbly.Related: The Secret to Winning Awards for Publicity and CredibilityContent that gets you noticedHere are a few tips for making your award application stand out. Avoid boring, typical information. No one cares about detailed historical information. Instead, focus on what others will consider remarkable. Did you develop something avant-garde? Have you managed to find a simple solution to a complex problem? Are you starting or defining a whole new industry? Be creative and tell a story. It takes time and attention to apply for awards. I spend as much time writing an award application as on a client project. Sure, it's lots of work, but it is also a great way to showcase what you can do and be recognized as a leader. If you aren't going to do the hard work it takes to win, don't bother.


My company was asked to apply for — and won — the Woman Owned Small Business Supplier of the Year from Siemens in 2018. It was a great honor. Over the years, we have won five Telly Awards, which ""honor excellence in television and video across all screens."" In 2023, we won our sixth Gold Telly for a documentary titled ""A Story to Remember"" about a woman's dementia journey. These awards, and many others, have helped our team be recognized for work that we love to do. (See, that is how you brag.)One thing to note: an award is not an award is not an award. Some are just vanity awards. This year, I was told I could be ""An Inspiring Woman Leader"" for $1800, an ""Admired Leader"" for $1500 or a ""Top 10 Influential Leader"" for a mere $900. I know individuals who take advantage of these promotional opportunities, and I do not judge. However, I like to stick to awards that have substance. Not those that are pay-to-play.Related: Winning Small Business Awards Can Boost Your Company's Credibility. Here's How to Get Started.Spread the wordIt shows staying power when you are consistently recognized, and you should capitalize on the news.


Today, social media and online communities can help spread the word. But it is not just going to happen. You need to have an established social network and understand what you want to be known for in advance. You can blog or share content you have aggregated on relevant communication channels. Then, when you do win a big award or get noticed, people will promote and share that news on your behalf. Be sure you make these announcements on time.There are also some simple ways to pass along the news and brag. Add an announcement to your company phone greeting. Put a tagline on the bottom of your e-mail signature or other digital communications saying ""The Winner of..."" Add it to your website or Facebook page if you get press coverage. You want the information to live on beyond the initial announcement.Knowing how to go after important recognition awards and then leverage them can impact your business in the long term. It adds credibility as you expand your reach into new markets. It boosts employee morale and pride. And, if you are looking to position your business for an acquisition, merger or sale, the goodwill you get from recognition makes your firm more desirable and saleable.So, start applying for awards, and when you win, go ahead and brag. It's not a bad thing.

58,7 Reasons Why CEOs Need to Develop a Personal Brand — and How to Build One.,"Dec 7, 2023",LaQuita Cleare,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/7-reasons-why-ceos-need-to-develop-a-personal-brand-and/465239,"
We all make purchasing decisions based on our connection to brands. One runner, for instance, may be dedicated to Asics running shoes, while another wouldn't dream of buying anything but Nike.These days, thanks to social media, choosing our favorite brands or which companies we give our money to heavily relies on who is heading that company. We want to do business with people that inspire us, people we like and trust. It's for this very reason that CEOs must develop their own personal brand.Over the years, I've had the honor of working with business leaders from around the world, enabling them to harness the power of compelling narratives to craft and communicate their brand's unique origin story. I am excited to share with you the profound importance of CEO branding in today's fiercely competitive business landscape and provide actionable insights on how you can effortlessly embark on your own CEO brand-building journey.



Related: The 3 Biggest Mistakes CEOs Make With Their Personal Brand (and How to Turn Those Mistakes Around)The importance of CEO brandingYour own personal brand is what reflects your priorities and values. Branding helps you, your colleagues and the customers you serve define who you are and what value you offer as a leader. Without a powerful and visible brand, CEOs may find it hard to grow their business, become an influencer or take their career to the next level.


But, when you grow your brand, doors open and opportunities present themselves to you. People are more likely to listen to what you have to say, connections are made and those connections are apt to turn into paying customers and lifelong advocates.Let's dive in and take a look at some of the biggest benefits of CEO brand building.1. Broaden your impactYour personal brand not only reflects your work ethic but also how you interact with and relate to others. These ""others"" include the teams you manage, shareholders and consumers. Your brand is recognized in the real world in face-to-face interactions as well as in virtual interactions.2. Stand out from the crowdThe entire world is online, and everyone is creating and sharing content. This creates a lot of noise.


Cut through that noise with your own unique vision. A personal brand helps you be an authentic voice in a sea of pandering. Always remember, people can smell phony from a mile away. When you develop your personal branding, every word you utter and the action you take is genuine to who you truly are.3. Others seek you outWhen your personal brand is authentic and attractive to others, opportunities come knocking. You'd be surprised at the number of new clients or customers that suddenly appear without any further effort on your part. Vendors may contact you, as well as the press, for interviews and event organizers about speaking engagements. Other companies may also get in touch with you, hoping to snag you for their operation.Put the work in upfront to develop your brand and the opportunities almost effortlessly follow.Related: 8 Strategies for Developing a Strong Personal Brand


4. Incredible networking opportunitiesNetworking events are important for doing business and moving your career forward. But let's be honest — these things can be a nightmare to navigate. Who should you talk to? What should you say? Will others find you (dare I say it)... boring?When you've taken the time to thoughtfully craft your own brand, you become one of the most interesting people in the room.People walk up to you with hands outstretched. People ask you questions because they want to know even more. CEO branding turns a potentially awkward (but necessary) event into a simple and rewarding one.5. Grow your bottom lineDo any of us really know what the economy will do from year to year? Heck, month to month? With so much economic uncertainty, it can be challenging, to say the least, to continue to grow your bottom line and meet shareholder expectations when consumers are tightening their wallets.


People are far more likely to give their hard-earned money to a company whose CEO is charismatic and vocal, no matter what the economy is doing. Case in point: Research by FTI Consulting found that those companies who had strong and vocal leaders during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic elicited stronger investor confidence. Numerically speaking, this translated into $260 billion in additional shareholder value during a time that was, for many, economically uncertain.6. Gain confidenceIn my experience, one of the biggest reasons leaders have confidence issues is because they don't know who they are as a leader. They may know who they are as a husband or wife, mother or father, or friend, but when it comes to leadership, they don't know their own beliefs, strengths, weaknesses or unique value proposition.Developing your brand requires you to uncover your skills and values. The entire process allows you to see yourself in an entirely new way. And once you know who you really are as a leader, your confidence soars. And when this happens, those you have been leading recognize it and the entire dynamic in your organization shifts.Related: How to Stop Your CEO's Reputation From Damaging Your Business


7. Attract better clientsHaving a powerful personal brand means you inevitably attract better-quality clients. Why is this? Because people will always seek out an expert to work with. Your brand will cut out the competitive process entirely.Tips to begin building your CEO brandNow that you know the benefits of CEO brand building, here are some ideas to help get you started:1. BrainstormSelf-evaluation plays a key role in developing an accurate and effective personal brand. So, spend a little time thinking and jotting down any ideas or insights. What is something you love about the work you do? What skills do you offer? What are you known for? How do you view your industry? What are compliments you often get from others? What do you know in your heart you could improve upon regarding your leadership style?2. Ask for honest feedbackYou need to know what others really think of you. Get feedback from friends and family, as well as colleagues and clients. Does this feedback align with how you want to be perceived by others? If not, what changes do you need to make to begin living your ideal brand?


3. Develop your elevator pitchNow that you are starting to get a sense of what your brand is, it's time to be sure you can articulate that brand to others quickly and easily. And this is where the elevator pitch comes in.You most likely know people use an elevator pitch to introduce their fledgling company to prospective investors or to introduce themselves when looking for employment. However, CEOs can use this same exercise to encapsulate their personal brand in a few sentences. In no more than three sentences, how would you describe your unique leadership values and contribution?Once you've got your pitch ready, you can use this as a daily reminder of who you want to be, as well as use it on your personal social media pages.4. Audit your social media accountsFor many people who are new to your company, your social media presence will be their first introduction. Now that you've taken some time to brainstorm and think about what you want to project, it's a good idea to audit your social media accounts to ensure someone's first impression of you jives with your intended brand.


If you need help with this, take a look at some other leaders in your industry to see whose profile best fits the brand you are building. Don't copy them, but feel free to emulate and take ideas from their profile.5. Keep tweaking and adjustingBuilding your CEO brand is a process. You won't necessarily discover your authentic leadership self and be able to communicate your value right away. That's okay. Just keep at it and tweak and adjust your brand and your content as you go.ConclusionI hope you now recognize the importance of CEO branding. Though it will take some time to build, your brand will ultimately help you connect with your audience in a deeper and more meaningful way. And, because people tend to align with brands that mimic their own values, your branding efforts will also help you to create loyal followers rather than customers.

60,How to Build a Socially Responsible Employer Brand (and How It Can Help You Tackle Attrition),"Dec 6, 2023",Gloria St. Martin-Lowry,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-build-a-socially-responsible-employer-brand/465758,"
The world has changed. People have changed. Why shouldn't businesses change, too?Fact is, they should, and they should do it wholeheartedly — and soon. Employees and consumers alike expect more. And they're making their employment and purchasing decisions based on the values that organizations demonstrate rather than just espouse.Gen Z is leading the pack when it comes to putting corporations' feet to the fire. Deloitte research indicates that Gen Z is motivated by purpose and a brand's good global citizenship reputation. This only makes sense. Growing up in an era of rapid information dissemination, Gen Z was hyper-aware of global issues like climate change, social inequality and human rights abuses.



Of course, we shouldn't assume that only Gen Z workers care about social responsibility. People of all ages and from all generations have become skeptical about companies' corporate social responsibility efforts. They want to make sure that their employer (or future employer) isn't just ""checking the box"" but is following through on promises. For instance, more than 5,000 organizations have earned Certified B Corps designations. In the future, that designation may be not just expected but standard.Related: Why Should Your Business Care About Social Responsibility?


But what exactly does it mean for a business to walk the walk, not just talk the talk? For some, it means investing $100 million in the brand's Racial Equity and Justice initiative, which is focused on addressing systemic racism through educational support. For others, it means sending 7.5% of pre-tax profits back into community organizations throughout the nation, as well as championing human rights, social and economic justice, and environmental protection. For many, it means working toward 100% carbon neutrality.However, for every positive corporate example, the opposite exists as well. More than one brand has found trouble in the last few years due to greenwashing ventures. Or maybe it's a viral PR disaster like a failed commercial that made light of ongoing and serious national tensions. Audiences today will hold brands accountable for missteps as much as celebrate their success.The point is that your company can't hide behind slogans or statements. To appeal to modern workers and customers, you have to showcase your commitment to social responsibility. If you don't, you can be sure that your competitors will be the first to call you on the carpet.To get started, try these methods to initiate the process of folding social change into all the fibers of your corporation's brand and culture fabric.


1. Engage your stakeholders, not just your shareholdersThere's no doubt that you have to be conscientious about your shareholders when you're a business leader. Shareholder value has been the primary focus for companies for decades. However, sometimes corporate social responsibility conflicts with a focus on profits. Why? The simple answer is that corporate social responsibility often requires a sizable financial investment. Not always, mind you — consumers are starting to pay more for products and services backed by socially responsible companies. Nevertheless, your job is to look beyond just your shareholders and engage your stakeholders.When I refer to stakeholders, I refer to everyone with a stake in your organization, including team members. Remember: They have a choice as to where they're going to work. Nearly seven out of 10 professionals planned to resign in 2023. You can't afford that kind of attrition, so you need to collaborate with your employees to build a collective vision and commitment around social change. Be aware that your team members will have different visions and different appetites for what social change means. That's a good thing because it elicits deeper conversations and helps you get closer toward your goals.Related: 10 Ways to Make Your Business More Socially Conscious2. Listen to what matters to peopleInstead of automatically arguing or debating social points, put yourself into a ""listen and learn"" mode. Find out what's really important to others. Ask questions. Why do they feel the way they do? What's important to them? What kind of stand would they like to see you take as their employer or preferred brand? You don't have to do everything they want, but you'll be in a better position to make decisions if you ""get"" them.After educating yourself through active, open-minded listening, you'll be prepared to problem-solve and lead your company and team forward. By leading the charge, you can show your authentic desire to make a positive impact based on the needs and wants of your stakeholders. In other words, you'll have a rare opportunity to demonstrate proactive leadership, innovation and creativity to the biggest societal challenges we face today.


3. Lean into major headlines and movementsWhen the ""don't say gay"" headlines hit the front page of every major media outlet, did you consider saying anything about it as a company? Or did you shy away from the topic? Right now, employees and buyers want to know that their favorite brands care about what's happening. You don't have to rush into making a statement, of course. You just shouldn't avoid creating a space for respectful dialogue and discussion about the subjects of the day.Can these types of conversations be awkward? Absolutely, which is why I recommend turning to resources and guides to help you navigate these conversations. By enabling everyone to speak their piece, you show that you value transparency within your workplace. And transparency begets trust, credibility, and accountability — all essential for building tighter teams where people feel psychologically safe and can bring their best selves to work.Initiating social change requires dedication, consistency and a genuine commitment to making a positive impact. Although it takes energy and investment, it's worth every minute and penny to transform your company into one that's seen as unfailingly socially responsible.Related: Corporate Social Responsibility Is More Than Just Charity — Here's Why It's Good for Business.

Liza Anderson, now founder of Anderson Group Public Relations, got her start in PR more than 20 years ago working for Warren Cowan of Rogers and Cowan. ""Considered the godfather of PR,"" Cowan was one of the first to represent Hollywood icons like Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor outside of the studio system in the 1950s, Anderson says.Needless to say, a lot has changed in the decades since Anderson's early PR days. Back then, she was ""literally Xeroxing press kits and mailing them to reporters and television producers"" to secure interviews for clients.Related: What Is an Organic Growth Formula, and How Can It Help Your Business?

""Let's create those headlines together. [It's time for PR] when you have anything — whether it's yourself, a product, a project that you're proud of — that you want to make noise [in our] crowded world.""Related: Should You Hire Your Own Publicist? How to Stay Relevant in an Ever-Changing Business Landscape.Of course, one of the most significant transformations in PR over the years has been the rise of the internet and social media, which add additional layers of complexity for anyone hoping to boost their image and can make it more difficult for PR professionals to forge the strong client relationships to help them do it, Anderson says.


""You were a bit more connected in a very strange way,"" Anderson says of the pre-social-media era. ""You had to call your client to tell them what was going on, whereas now, I'm always saying in my Zoom staff meeting, 'Pick up the phone and call your client. You can email and text them, but there's nothing like a good old-fashioned phone call.'""""It's [about] finding those little nuggets and those things that [make] you go, 'Oh, this would be a great angle.'""Despite the shifting media landscape, which includes the proliferation of influencers and AI (and, as it turns out, handsomely paid AI-generated influencers), some tricks of the trade do remain the same. The No. 1 most important way to determine if a PR specialist or firm is the right fit for you — or, alternatively, that you can actually help a given client — hasn't changed much over the years.""You have to put your heart into what you do,"" Anderson says. ""When you're representing a client or a brand, you have to find the things that you love about them, the things that make you excited about working with them.""


And that remains consistent no matter how big or small a person or brand happens to be.""I'm always taking meetings with people I don't know,"" Anderson says. ""It's [about] finding those little nuggets and those things that [make] you go, 'Oh, this would be a great angle. This is what makes them special. This is why they're so unique.' And it's no different than any relationship you have in real life.""Related: I Accidentally Became a Successful Entrepreneur.

Having a PR professional guide your next steps when you find yourself at the center of a controversy can be invaluable. When facing backlash of any kind, the first question to consider is this, Anderson says: How did it get to this point?That's because the most effective PR approach hinges on if the person or brand experiencing backlash was a bystander or an active contributor to the events leading up to the controversy, Anderson explains. Based on that information, you can ""come up with a game plan"" — perhaps one that begins with a sincere apology or taking a step back, depending on the situation.It's clear that some PR secrets withstand the test of time — even two-plus decades' worth filled with ever-evolving technologies and trends — and Anderson's had a front-row seat through it all.

64,Expensive Pain: The Untapped Social Capital for Entrepreneurs,"Nov 16, 2023",Terry Rice,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/expensive-pain-the-untapped-social-capital-for/459728,"
Do you have expensive pain? Here's how to find out.When was the last time you shared something personal with your audience, even if it felt a bit uncomfortable?And I understand why you may be hesitant to do so, especially when those personal stories involve painful moments. But what if there was a price to pay for holding this information back?



I call it Expensive Pain. But, why is it expensive?Because people give you opportunities when they feel connected to you, and shared pain brings people together.


This isn't just my opinion. A study from the Association for Psychological Science concluded that ""despite its unpleasantness, pain may actually have positive social consequences, acting as a sort of 'social glue' that fosters cohesion and solidarity within groups.""So if you're trying to grow your business, your network or just from stronger connections with those around you, that ""social glue"" is crucial to attracting the right opportunities.What opportunities could you be missing out on? I'll share a few examples from my own experience. But first, I'll need to tell you about my most painful story.My son, Terry Junior (TJ) died on May 29th 2017. I'll go into details at a later time.


But as you can imagine this tragedy has had a profound impact on my life, and many people don't know about it. Reason being, I didn't talk about it publicly until June of this year while speaking on stage at a ConvertKit conference.Based on my recent experience, here's what expensive pain can cost you and the rewards that come from being more transparent.It can cost you relationshipsAfter talking about my son on stage I was immediately flooded by attendees who had their own experiences with losing someone they cared deeply about.They expressed gratitude and, in many cases, were overjoyed by my willingness to connect with them on a human level.


But a specific conversation stood out to me among all others. One of the attendees let me know their friend recently lost a son and was burying him the same day as the event.He shared my story with her that morning and focused on how I used the pain of losing my son as a catalyst, encouraging me to help other people as a way of honoring his legacy.This gave her comfort during a difficult time. And I can't ignore the coincidence here, her son is also named TJ.Sharing my pain allowed me to create a stronger relationship with those in the audience and help people I'll never even meet.


It can cost you moneyRemember, people give you opportunities when they feel connected to you. I'll explain why this is so important for your business in a moment but I'll share another story first.Audience feedback is incredibly valuable so I always encourage people to fill out a survey after my keynotes. One of those questions is ""Do you know of other event organizers who may be interested in featuring me as a speaker?""Sometimes I get one or two responses, sometimes I don't get any. After speaking at ConvertKit I got five solid referrals, one of which is moving forward rather quickly.So what changed? This was the first time I talked about my son on stage and that made me stand out even more as a speaker.The truth hurts but keep this in mind; being an expert at your craft is a prerequisite. It's not enough to make you stand out among the crowd.Your personal brand is your only real unique differentiator. It's the key to making connections and unlocking opportunities.You can't have a personal brand without telling personal stories.What stories can you tell that will build your brand?


A valuable lesson you learned, perhaps the hard wayStruggles you've overcome, and how they made you a better personHow you juggle your personal and professional life, even if it's not always perfectYour stories will always be your best marketing channel, so don't limit your income by staying quiet. Related: The Entrepreneur's Guide to Crafting a Successful FutureIt can cost you your identityConvertKit has a series of books and videos called ""I Am a Creator"" that features inspiring stories from creators.I was able to share my background in Volume 3 of the series and, if you've been following me for a while, you've probably heard most of it.I worked at Adobe and FacebookThen I started my own businessNow I write for Entrepreneur magazine, speak on stages and have a podcastThen I went into the same story that so many other experts share. You know you've heard it before.""I struggled to get my business off the ground, I finally found something that worked, now I'm sharing it with the world so you can learn from my mistakes and succeed more quickly""Still awake? Congratulations if you are, because that story has already been told thousands of times. It's predictable, boring and impersonal.In my case it also leaves out one of the most important parts of my life, my kid died.And once you know that about me you can better understand not just what I've done, but who I am as well. You'll understand my identity.Before we move forward, let's unpack the meaning of identity. Psychology Today states ""Identity encompasses the memories, experiences, relationships, and values that create one's sense of self.""So why is knowing - and expressing - your identity so important?Here's one more citation for you from Frontiers in Psychology.""Researchers find that entrepreneurs' identity has a significant influence on entrepreneurs' individual characteristics, such as passion, persistence, and self-efficacy. Evidence also shows that identity can influence entrepreneurs' psychological status such as well-being. O'Neil et al. (2020) suggested that if entrepreneurs are not able to assure their own identity, it would harm their well-being.""In short, getting clear on your identity can help you perform better while also maintaining your mental health.You'll also be better understood by those you interact with. This is crucial when the impact of those painful moments requires you to take a mental break.Beyond that, it can lead to more meaningful connections and partnerships.And speaking of partnerships, I reached out to ConvertKit for another chance to share my story, the full story that includes my son TJ.They immediately agreed and we spent the last several weeks producing a video documentary about my life. The footage captured includes me working at my office, playing with my kids, exercising at the gym and visiting my son's grave.To be honest, I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable about sharing such a private moment. But that's how I know I'm on the right track. I don't have a desire to be comfortable, I just want to help people overcome setbacks, embrace opportunities and perform at their highest level.


This is part of my identity and I avoid expensive pain by taking actions that are aligned with my identity.And when you're ready, I know you can help a lot of people - including yourself - by sharing your full story and taking these actions as well.Next StepsIf you'd like to hear more about my journey, including the impact of losing my son, you can view the keynote I delivered at ConvertKit on my YouTube channel.

65,5 Priceless Lessons the Rolling Stones Teach Us About Business Success,"Nov 13, 2023","Brian T. Edmondson, Esq.",https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/5-business-lessons-from-the-rolling-stones-61-year-career/464396,"
The Rolling Stones are, in my humble opinion, the greatest rock band of all time. There is no better rock song than their soaring 1969 anthem, ""Gimme Shelter."" But really, their whole catalog is full of hits and fan favorites, including their latest release — and 26th album — Hackney Diamonds.It's no wonder I've been to more than 17 Rolling Stones shows. I even had front-row seats during the limited five-concert tour they did to celebrate their 50th anniversary. It was amazing!But there's another reason I admire the Stones so much.



I'd say that although their songwriting, unique sound and style, Mick Jagger's swagger and his unique interplay with guitarist Keith Richards and bassist Ron Wood had everything to do with their enduring success, they would not have lasted so long without business savvy.The way they've conducted themselves as a business in their 61 years as a band can teach us so much about how to run our own ventures.Here are five business lessons learned from the Rolling Stones:There is no substitute for putting in the workIn their early days, the Stones had to make do with ""cheap"" instruments and equipment as they played their first live shows and recorded their first singles. They even all lived together in a grimy apartment with little furniture.They focused on rehearsing, mastering their instruments, writing songs, convincing club owners to give them gigs and the like. In other words, they put in the work.It's like that with a business.


It's tempting to think that if you get a shiny new computer, fancy office furniture, expensive software programs and a sleek website, then pour a ton of money into ad campaigns, your success is just around the corner.But the truth is that the most critical part of business success is understanding your target market, creating a product you think will resonate, testing it and trying different marketing approaches to see what sticks.Find out what works while spending as little money as possible. Once you have some wins under your belt and a proven marketing strategy, you can start investing money into ramping up the business. Only then should you consider getting that fancy office chair.Your intellectual property matters — and you should protect itLike many bands of the era, the Rolling Stones did get a bit taken advantage of. Theiraccountant in the 1960s managed to take ownership of songs they wrote before 1971 — and cashed in on some of their biggest hits without writing a note of them.


But the Stones learned their lesson. They pivoted to creating spectacular live shows that toured stadiums and arenas worldwide for decades to come — and were huge moneymakers. They were also sure to take ownership of their subsequent songs and other creations.The Stones also vigorously defend their trademarks and copyrights. Their famous mouth and tongue logo, for example, is often ripped off for bootleg posters, t-shirts and other merch by others trying to cash in on the band's fame. They are quick to sue anybody who does so.You must defend your hard-earned IP as well. Use copyright and trademark protections to make sure nobody can cash in on anything you create in conjunction with your business, like logos, slogans, your company name, product names and more. In some cases, filing an infringement claim with the online platform where the violator is using it or their web hosting provider is enough. In other cases, you might need to take further legal action, like a cease and desist or even a lawsuit.Related: Influencer Hit With Cease-and-Desist by Mattel For Using 'Barbie' In Her Username


Build your unique brand, and people will become your biggest fansIn the 1960s, there was a tremendous rivalry between the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. They were both part of the British Invasion and had drawn influences from blues, as well as early rock-n-roll and R&B.One of the ways the Stones differentiated themselves from this competitor was by building a unique brand. They became the ""bad boys"" to the Beatles' more clean-cut image in how they talked to the press, dressed, performed and the like — especially with their harder-edged and more ""rockin'"" songs.As a result, many people started choosing to become Stones guys or gals or Beatles guys or gals. Something about either group resonated with those fans. By clearly showcasing their unique approach to music and their lifestyle, the Rolling Stones were able to cultivate a fervent fanbase for decades to come, with many of the original fans among the most dedicated.The lesson here: Don't be like everybody else in your niche. You might draw inspiration from the same places, but you have to find what sets you apart and emphasize that in your approach to product creation, branding and marketing.


Related: What Entrepreneurs Can Learn from The Beatles: Lessons in Creativity, Playfulness, Collaboration and InnovationPay attention to your legal and tax obligationsAs I mentioned, one of the Rolling Stones' accountants somehow managed to own the rights to many of their early songs. It was simply a matter of them focusing on being rock stars and not paying attention to the nuts and bolts of the business behind it all.Around the same time, the Stones also had some tax troubles. It turns out whoever was in charge hadn't been paying taxes properly in their home country, the UK, for years. As a result, they had a huge bill come due unexpectedly. They decided to decamp overseas to officially reside in tax havens to protect their income, where they have remained ever since.I'm not advocating that you dodge taxes or anything. But as your business grows, you have to keep up with your paperwork and play by the rules, so to speak.


Hire an experienced accountant to help you legally pay as little tax as possible. This might mean creating a specific business structure, for example.You should also ensure that all your copyrights and trademarks are kept up to date — and that you protect your creations and stay vigilant against violations.Keep an eye on renewal dates for web hosting and other online services you use. You don't want your website to go offline or have somebody else grab your domain!Familiarize yourself with the laws regarding your business and follow them. If you are in the natural health space, for example, you should know what the Federal Trade Commission allows you to say in your marketing. If you are an influencer working on Instagram, you should understand how you must disclose your paid relationships with brands in your posts.Related: Amazon Used a 'Secret Algorithm' to Inflate Prices by Over $1 Billion, FTC SaysKeep on rockin'Don't stop creating, innovating and growing. The Rolling Stones released their latest album in October 2023. The surviving band members are well into their 70s. For a band to have longevity like this is almost unprecedented.Most of it does have to do with the incredible music that has enthralled multiple generations of fans. How many bands can you say that grandparents and grandkids — maybe even great-grandkids — love to jam out to?But you can bet that without paying attention to the business side of things, the Rolling Stones would probably not have had such an outsized impact on the world.

67,Waiting For a PR Crisis Is Like Wearing a Bullseye On Your Back. Here Are Some Proactive Steps You Can Take That Could Save Your Brand.,"Oct 27, 2023",Adam Horlock,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-safeguard-your-brand-from-pr-disasters/459004,"
A new brand or an existing brand decides to rebrand. Strategy is implemented, growth begins, employees are hired, and growing pains begin. Consistency is maintained by staying on core messaging, social media audiences and impressions grow, and some PR is even generated. Current customers start to advocate for the brand, help promote, and perhaps believe and partake in any social or philanthropic causes the brand represents or helps support. All the boxes are getting checked, right?Until one day, it happens. An employee makes a misstep or big blunder, and somehow, it's now on social media. A c-suite executive makes a near-fatal decision on the brand that the core audience dramatically disapproves of, and sales begin to drop fast. An accident occurs thanks to a vendor of your business, but somehow, your business gets pulled into the controversy. Neglect in accounting, or worse, surfaces and funds are missing or removed, directly impacting clients and the company. Sound familiar? The horror stories continue to mount every week. Like identity theft, a PR crisis happens quickly and unexpectedly, takes hard-earned money away, and severely damages reputations.Related: A 3-Step Plan for Handling Any PR Crisis



Build PR nowMillions now take preventative measures to prevent identity theft for themselves and their businesses. Monitoring services have exploded in recent years, preventive action can be taken, and it is commonplace to dispute charges, refute actions caused by hacking or other means; and most understand how this can happen, and it is not the fault of the individual or business.In the same way, reputation monitoring services have also exploded in growth. Most understand that a negative Google review, social media posts or other online statements may be untrue. Many try to speak up on behalf of a targeted individual or business. While plenty will pile on and try to create more drama and unnecessary rumors, most dismiss or recount a positive experience with the individual or company.


What is the best way to build preventative measures against potential PR missteps? Start building PR now. Without PR, the only story the public knows is the misstep or controversy. It is the first search result on Google, the first impression on social media, and nothing else is available for the public to consume. By gaining some PR before something happens, at least there is a portfolio of content and articles on your brand before any PR mishaps.First steps to building a PR portfolioMany assume their brand speaks for itself, or founders prefer to avoid drawing attention to themselves through PR; instead, they want to focus on raising capital or getting in front of new customers. The daily grind of running the business takes a lot of time, and long hours are already dedicated to business growth.Entrepreneurs and founders are not politicians (most of the time) and do not think about public image other than the success of their brand. Nonetheless, we are all human, and we hire humans. Mishaps and chaos will happen.The first step to building a solid PR portfolio is to utilize key and core messaging strategies already developed. It is incredible how many brands spend on building a core strategy that is never implemented. From there, start creating small wins in PR, even if it is not the day's lead story. Small expansions in services, adding to an existing product line, or even sponsoring a youth sports league are all solid wins that can be leveraged into more extensive media attention.


Build on small wins. New hires, new community involvement, first full year in business — keep getting the brand's story out there, even if it is through a limited press release that is only picked up by a few media outlets. While careful to stay on topics with some newsworthy value, continuous PR coverage of what's right and working will help deflect when things go wrong.From there, keep reinforcing that the brand strives to be a solution-oriented organization that continuously helps solve problems for your customer base. Significant PR wins will follow, and if the PR nightmare does happen, the media and the public will see a PR portfolio of growth, achievement, services and above all — humans trying to work together to build a business or organization — flaws and all.Overall, suppose the brand is built and viewed as a solution-oriented market leader or influencer, and a portfolio of good work and PR is created. In that case, the missteps and possible nightmares are easier to push through. It used to be said that the first 24 hours were the worst, and while that still holds, in most cases, it can continue longer and more painfully if an ongoing PR campaign is not a part of overall marketing efforts.

Arovia


In this ongoing series, we are sharing advice, tips and insights from real entrepreneurs who are out there doing business battle on a daily basis. (Answers have been edited and condensed for clarity.)Who are you and what's your business?My name is Alex Wesley. My business is Arovia, you can find us at arovia.com. We make Splay, a groundbreaking, patent-granted, 2-in-1 display and projector solution, designed for users seeking portability without compromising on screen size. You can visualize Splay as a screen that is about 3-times bigger than a laptop screen that folds like an umbrella to fit inside a Bose headphone case.



Its three key innovations are (1) a nanomaterial-based rear projection screen that can fold to a small size without deforming (recently awarded an R&D 100 award), (2) durable retractable arms that expand the screen so it is flat, and (3) the most portable ultra-short-throw projector (projects a very large image, very close to the wall). See how it works below and check out this tutorial to learn how to use it.What inspired you to create this business? What was your ""aha moment""?Prior to starting Arovia, I was an optical engineer and product manager in high-end semiconductor equipment. If you ever worked on a large desktop monitor, you feel very inhibited and frustrated when working on small screens. If you ever had to give a presentation on a laptop or tablet, you know it's a very trying experience. From my experience as a product manager, I knew there was a gap waiting to be filled: large screens without sacrificing portability.What has been your biggest challenge and how did you pivot to overcome it?To date, manufacturing has been the biggest challenge. Inventing a new technology is one thing, figuring out how to mass manufacture is an extremely involved process. For example, the company that makes iPhones for Apple told us that our product had too many new components for them to consider making. We had to develop the supply chain from scratch, which involved years of predominantly living overseas (our key manufacturers are in Taiwan and mainland China). Along the way, we dealt with many issues like key components stopped being made, manufacturers over-promising and under-delivering, manufacturers suddenly drastically increasing prices, as well as many other supply chain issues related to the pandemic (including getting stuck in China for a good portion of the pandemic). We had to stop making our first product due to a variety of manufacturing obstacles including the projector suddenly stopped being produced. We are very excited that we have overcome these obstacles and are producing Splay in mass production!

If you are part of a community (e.g. alumni, startup, etc.) these can be great places to find your first investors. Also, accelerator programs can be a great resource while also providing funding. We did two programs that came with funding when we started out: OwlSpark (Rice University's tech accelerator) and the National Science Foundation's i-Corp program. We also did top-tier hardware accelerators, including Luminate (for optics-focused startups) and SOSV's Hax program. I've made it a habit of not ""hard-selling"" on investment because if you are not totally comfortable with the risks of investing in our company and/or technology startups in general, it is better that you do not. Tech startups provide a lot of upside though are not trivial endeavors.What does the word ""entrepreneur"" mean to you?It means solving a problem that provides enough value such that you ultimately turn a profit and/or provide significant value to the world.Related: How the Founders of SpaceIt Are Re-Building the Way Real Estate Brokers Do BusinessWhat is something many aspiring business owners think they need that they really don't?When I started my first company, I focused on window dressing: patent filings, the website, and naming the company. These are extremely minor compared to intimately knowing your customers and the problem you're solving. Once you know the problem you're solving is worth solving, it's important to get to paying customers as fast as possible because you only really know if people are going to pay once they pay. We launched our first Kickstarter campaign as soon as we could, and those paying customers instilled a lot of confidence in us and our investors. Subsequent post-Kickstarter deals have further cemented that confidence.


Is there a particular quote or saying that you use as personal motivation? Don't make decisions out of fear, shame, and/or guilt. This was an extremely important lesson for me to learn. It's much better to have hope drive your actions!

69,Kim Kardashian's Skims Is Making Underwear for Men — But the $4 Billion Brand Could Soon Announce Even Bigger News,"Oct 24, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/kim-kardashians-skims-expands-into-menswear-considers-ipo/464196,"
Skims, the American shapewear and clothing brand co-founded by Kim Kardashian, Emma Grede and Jens Grede in 2019, was recently valued at $4 billion — and it's not stopping there.Not only did the ""solutions for every body"" brand announce its expansion into menswear with its new line of briefs, undershirts, boxers and leggings, but it's also eyeing an initial public offering, CNN Business reported.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by SKIMS (@skims)Related: What Businesses Do the Kardashians Own? Skims, Kylie CosmeticsThe global shapewear market is estimated to hit $3.7 billion by 2028, per Grand View Research. Skims has already made a name for itself in that space and other categories of women's apparel — from dresses to bodysuits, pajamas and more.



Skims' women's sizing is meant to promote body positivity, as does its men's, which ranges from extra small to 5X. Items in the new men's line run from $16 to $54 and come in cotton, ""stretch"" and ""sport"" fabrics, according to CNN.The company, which raised $270 million in its latest fundraising round led by Wellington Management this past July, said that men already make up 10% of its existing customer base, per the outlet.Skims hired chief financial officer and former Nike executive Andy Muir, which could be a sign that an IPO isn't far off.Related: Kim Kardashian Slammed For Lecture at Harvard Business School


Additionally, Wellington Management has a reputation for taking companies public — and Skims' CEO Jens Grede recently told Dealbook that the company sees an IPO on its horizon. ""At some point in the future, Skims deserves to be a public company,"" he said.

70,How Diagnosing Your Brand Through the Metaphor of Mental Health Can Help You Get Unstuck,"Oct 23, 2023",John Emery,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-diagnose-your-brand-through-the-metaphor-of-mental/463746,"
When dealing with the ever-nebulous nature of branding — discerning, dissecting and designing reputations — sometimes it's helpful to use concrete metaphors to anchor into.A lens I often use to view brands through, albeit delicately, is that of common mental health diagnoses. It's a sensitive landscape, so bear with me for a moment while I explain.I've found it helpful to personify the brands I work with — thinking of them as people I can meet, talk with, and develop relationships with. Instead of ""brand strategy,"" we talk about soul. Instead of ""brand attributes,"" we talk about personality traits. Instead of ""visual identity,"" we talk about wardrobe. Instead of ""brand campaigns,"" we talk about behavior.



So, in regular rhythm, we like to look at our brands (our own and the portfolio of brands we manage) through the lens of mental health. If humans can experience depression, then brands can as well. If we get sucked into insecure thoughts and brash behavior, then brands can as well.Related: 4 AI Tools To Keep Your Mental Health In Check


One final note about the maturity and care required here. Mental health diagnoses aren't something to take lightly. My reason for using them as a metaphor is to provide a fresh lens for which entrepreneurs to understand their brands — not tokenize or make light of the actual conditions those we love (myself included) have suffered from.That said, here are some common mental health metaphors we see in companies:SchizophreniaSymptoms: Your company seems to have multiple personalities. People surrounding your brand, both internally and externally, will get different versions of you depending on who they talk to. Your salespeople might be bubbly and effervescent, but your customer service reps are grumps. There's inconsistency across your touchpoints, leading your audience to believe you're untrustworthy.Potential Treatment: The equivalent of 'talk therapy' with a trusted brand strategist or consultant. You need someone to see you — truly see you — and mirror who you truly are back to you. Someone who knows you and loves you will help you better understand what others see in you and help provide some anchor points for your personality to be tethered to. This 'soul work' should provide clarity and confidence for you.Related: It's No Longer About Competition or Cooperation. This Is the New Force That Is Driving Business Success.AnxietySymptoms: Your company feels overwhelmed. Your competitors are moving faster than you, and you're struggling to keep up. You feel pressure to perform but don't know which step to take. You let worry creep in, and it begins to control your decision-making. Your brand's behavior becomes reactive, erratic, and irrational.Potential Treatment: Paradoxically, you need more rest and physical activity simultaneously. Create boundaries in your professional life to spend less time and energy focusing on your competitors and more time on 'self-care.' Buy yourself some time by moving deadlines back and creating space for reflection. Once you've had time to breathe, focus on one small project to tackle, potentially something you've been putting off for a long time. Simply start moving with intention and working things out rather than staying stuck thinking about them.DepressionSymptoms: Hopelessness about your company's future. The challenges that inspired you in the beginning have turned into stresses that overwhelm you and make you want to give up. The things that used to give you life now feel like a drain. You're unmotivated, unfocused and ready to throw in the towel.Potential Treatment: Facilitate a 'near-death experience' for your brand. Look failure straight in the face and imagine that it actually happened. Write an 'obituary' for your brand. What was your dream for this venture? What did you accomplish? What potential have you left behind in your passing? Often, these sorts of activities can renew our sense of purpose and draw us back to our first love that inspired us in the first place.Related: How This Entrepreneur Overcame Depression When Self-Help Didn't Work


Eating disordersSymptoms: There's an unhealthy level of input from outside sources. Either too much consumption, which leads to an intellectual obesity of sorts — or not enough, which leads to starvation/lack of awareness of the broader culture. Both of which are a result of an abnormal relationship with 'food.' Both overconsumption and under-consumption lead to lethargy, which is a long, slow death in entrepreneurship.Potential Treatment: We all know business leaders who consume far too much outside content to neglect actual activity (I'm guilty of this!). In this scenario, it's time to turn the faucet off for a bit. You've stored up plenty of calories and simply need a season of working things out in real time. For the inverse, where perhaps an old-school entrepreneur who had successes back in the day abstains from fresh input, the treatment is to consume. Find a healthy relationship with outside input.Related: 3 Strategies Entrepreneurs Can Incorporate to Build Brand AwarenessPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)Symptoms: Perhaps the most common disorder amongst seasoned entrepreneurs, PTSD affects every aspect of your being. You have flashbacks from previous startups. You have intrusive memories from former angry investors. Small things trigger you and overreact in irrational ways to seemingly small threats. You can suck the air out of the room so people walk on eggshells around you. As a result, the whole company feels fragile and on the brink of collapse at any given moment.Potential Treatment: You can use your experience to share wisdom from past learning experiences but also not let it define your new endeavor. You don't want your future company defined exclusively by your past. Share your leadership responsibilities with new blood. There are likely younger leaders in your organization who are hungry for promotion, and pairing that with your battle-tested guidance, they might just be your best path forward.And there are many more to consider. I hope this article helps illuminate a way to understand your company's ailments better and potentially break free from what's been holding you back.The beautiful thing about entrepreneurship is the ability to reinvent ourselves at the drop of a hat. If you sense that your company might be struggling with one of these, invite trusted colleagues into the conversation. Observe, diagnose, and create a treatment plan together.Your future selves will thank you.

71,Want to Attract Diverse Talent? You Need to Work on Your Employer Brand — Here's Why.,"Oct 20, 2023",Nika White,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/want-to-attract-diverse-talent-you-need-to-work-on-your/459203,"
Now more than ever, this question of what a business' values, perspective, and stance are on certain social issues is under the microscope of diverse applicants. According to Monster.com, 86% of applicants actively engaged in a job search care about an employer's reputation with regard to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). The same survey found that 62% of applicants would turn down a job offer if their employer did not support DEI.In this hiring climate, where hundreds of thousands of jobs have been added to the economy in 2023 alone, employees are looking for their perfect match and feel certain they can afford to wait until they find it. Without communicating DEI as a key value of your business on online platforms, you could be turning off high-value applicants who could join your team.So, how can businesses like yours stand out in the vast sea of ""now hiring"" signs and attract the best of the best diverse talent? The answer is clear: Develop an employer brand.



What is an employer brand?Employer branding is a marketing and communication strategy that builds an emotional connection between the potential employee and the employer by demonstrating a positive image and reputation in its marketing.Employer branding involves the rhetoric that's written on the company's website, the posts it touts on LinkedIn, and the word-of-mouth reputation that represents its staff makeup, values, and commitments.


When a diverse applicant sees your newly posted job description and is curious about your business, they likely go to your LinkedIn profile or website to see if yours is the kind of organization they'd like to be a part of. One of the ways companies can present themselves in the most positive light to these applicants is by discussing their values and initiatives around DEI.However, there are several missteps companies make when engaging in employer branding that could turn diverse employees off in seconds.Related: How Employer Branding Can Help Your Company Be Perceived As A Great Place To WorkHow employee branding could be turning off diverse candidatesFrom the brand's policies to its website messaging, these five mistakes may cause diverse candidates to dismiss your job posting before they even apply.


1. Your business doesn't have a DEI statement on job applicationsIf you don't have a DEI statement at the end of your job applications, you're sending the wrong message to diverse candidates. This statement can be simple and should say something to the effect of ""We're an equal opportunity employer and are committed to providing equal employment opportunities for all applicants and employees, regardless of race, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, marital status or veteran status.""As basic as this statement may sound, it acts to lower the perceived barriers to entry for some diverse applicants. It's the first step in DEI-centric employee branding that serves as a handshake to diverse candidates. It communicates that ""all are welcome"" and that one's identity doesn't qualify or disqualify someone from being here. It's a small step that can lead to more diverse applicants applying for your open role.2. Your business doesn't offer ERGs, BRGs, or wellness groupsAn employee resource group (ERG), business resource group (BRG), or wellness group is an important component of promoting a sense of belonging in a company. Diverse applicants are looking for businesses that offer affinity groups, especially if the staff makeup has a sizable group of individuals who share a similar identity.It doesn't always have to be about race, gender, or other common identities. Groups can also be formed around shared values like faith, health, sports and more. The goal is to demonstrate that your business is making a good-faith effort towards promoting community and belonging, and these are important components of a desirable workplace, especially for diverse applicants. Having a page on your business's website or social media showcasing special groups that employees can join can help your business stand out and appear more welcoming to diverse applicants.


Related: How to Utilize Employee Resource Groups for a More Diverse3. Your business doesn't offer a flexible work environmentIt's 2023, and more applicants are looking for flexible workspaces, whether they're a parent or someone looking for more work-life balance (or work-life blend, as I call it), companies who brand themselves as flexible or accommodating workspaces are more attractive to potential employees than those who enforce rigid work schedules and mandatory in-office days.Since the world was taken by storm by the Covid-19 pandemic, more diverse applicants, including people of color, those with disabilities, and gender minorities, began looking for ""safer"" spaces to work. Minorities have always had to face microaggressions and adapt to the dominant culture in the workplace. However, having more flexibility around their office environment and schedule has helped those individuals find a work-life blend and has eased the burden of daily microaggressions and code-switching in the workplace.Related: How Code-Switching Hurts People of Color in the Workplace


4. Your business doesn't offer outside-of-work activitiesWe all like to have fun and enjoy quality time with others. Companies that brand themselves as ""fun"" workspaces or ones that offer outside-of-work activities like company outings, retreats or sports activities can attract more diverse applicants and likely retain them longer. Although not every employee should have to participate in these activities, it's nice to have the option for diverse candidates who are seeking community in the workplace.These activities aren't just for show; they allow employees to bond and cultivate a true sense of belonging and community. Belonging is a critical element of a diverse workplace and should be promoted. Most companies do the bare minimum in offering outside-of-work activities. The consequence is that it can lead many minorities to feel isolated or disconnected from their coworkers–and this certainly does not attract or retain diverse talent.5. Build an employer brand that attracts — not repels — diversityYour business could have some of the best benefits packages and offerings available, but if you're not actively discussing them, writing about them on your website and on social media, and sharing them in company emails, your employee brand isn't going to benefit.Don't neglect to speak about issues potential employees care about, like maternity and paternity benefits, flexible hours, and remote working, as well as diverse representation at all levels of the organization.


These components of an employee brand can make or break your business's competitiveness in the hiring market. Be the brand that stands out and attracts the best of the best by honing your employer brand and letting diverse employees come to you.

72,How to Preserve Your Brand's Humanity in the Era of AI,"Oct 20, 2023",Lindsay Tjepkema,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/3-ways-to-preserve-your-brands-humanity-in-the-era-of-ai/463773,"
Would you like a side of fries with your AI?Wendy's is betting that your answer is yes.Earlier this year, the company unveiled a plan to bring generative AI technology to its drive-thru visitors. Instead of dealing with a person, hungry patrons would be greeted by a chatbot programmed to get their orders right.



Those of us who've tried to converse with a fast-food worker through a scratchy sound system would probably find this move a blessing. Who wouldn't want to remove obstacles to getting grub for a bunch of hungry, restless kids in the back seat? Yet Wendy's foray into AI might well serve up more than just a meal. It might be yet another sign that AI is being used to bypass the brand-customer human touch.This isn't to suggest that AI tools aren't valuable. They are, and leaders know it. McKinsey & Company found that 55% of businesses have adopted AI in some capacity. But the almost-feverish desire to automate has some executives worried. At a Yale University summit, a full 42% of CEOs sounded alarm bells about AI's potential for humanity's destruction. That's pretty scary stuff.


At the same time, you can't allow yourself to be left behind in the AI arms race. You need to figure out a way to remain competitive without losing your brand's human side. And that's doable if you take steps to preserve the humanity of your organization.Related: The Complete Guide to AI for Businesses and How It's Making a Difference1. Bring AI solutions into the fold thoughtfullyThere's nothing wrong with using AI solutions to enhance and optimize your processes. Fair warning, though: You shouldn't just adopt tools left and right. Rather, take a more thoughtful, pragmatic approach and ask if an AI product will help or harm your company's humanness.Where should you start? Research scientists at MIT Sloan recommend studying the ethical effects of all AI you're evaluating. Does the AI free up time and space for your employees to have deeper interactions with buyers? Or does it have the power to hurt some end users or stakeholders? For instance, consider a generative AI software like ChatGPT. It can churn out content faster than humans, but the content may lack depth and contain inaccuracies. Therefore, although it may technically make populating your blog simpler, it could steal from your ability to provide truth and value.


Each time a team member brings up an AI product to test, think about the long-term effects. Map out the good, bad and unintentional outcomes. That way, you'll be able to see if you're about to gain more positives or negatives if you bring the AI into the fold.2. Gear up your human-to-human outreach effortsLet's say you have a customer service chatbot and AI-powered marketing campaign generator. Both products could allow you to rev up your team's efficiency. Nevertheless, you may still be worried that customers won't get as much of a chance to see the people, purpose and humanity behind your brand. One way to overcome this issue is with authentic outreach vehicles.Take podcasts, for example. More and more B2C and B2B brands have entered into the podcast realm, my professional arena. Podcasts are excellent opportunities to send your voice and message out to the world. Plus, they're popular: More than 100 million people are expected to tune in next year. When you're sharing information over a podcast as an expert, there's no barrier between you and the listener. On the contrary, you're creating a stronger, richer bond between you and the people you're reaching.Other outreach options that are also effective at bridging any AI-constructed gaps include webinars, video blogs and even live #AMA (""ask me anything"") sessions. All of them encourage you to tap into your storytelling and teaching skills. Consequently, you get the benefit of increasing your thought leadership acumen while simultaneously upping your brand's humanity.


Related: AI vs. a Human Touch: Finding The Right Balance When It Comes to Branding3. Resist the temptation to hide behind AI techI've always appreciated technology and what it can do for businesses and their workers. With that said, I'm not a fan of those who hide behind AI. For example, you might use an AI plug-in to elicit feedback from customers. That's a great idea. Surveys — particularly those taken right after a purchase is made — can reveal how satisfied your customers are.But what happens when a customer isn't happy and makes it quite clear on a survey? Do you immediately try to get in touch to find out why or do the right thing? Or do you simply allow this critical moment to pass because it feels like ""just another data point?""Ideally, AI should free up your (and everyone's) time so they can make the most of touchpoint opportunities like the one I just described. It may not be your favorite thing in the world to call a cranky customer. Nevertheless, it's a lot better — and more lucrative — than losing the customer for good. American Express research reveals that acquiring a new customer is up to six times as costly as retaining one. And nothing beats a personal reach-out to soothe a buyer's irritation and highlight the empathetic humans behind your company.


The development of AI innovations isn't going to stop. Fortunately, AI doesn't have to interfere with your brand's humanity. As long as you use AI consciously, as well as balance it with human outreach and connections, you can avoid problems. And that's advice you can take all the way to the drive-thru.Related: 3 Ways to Lean into Tech Without Losing the Human Touch

74,How Generative AI Will Revolutionize The Future of Your Brand,"Oct 16, 2023",Zaheer Dodhia,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-generative-ai-will-revolutionize-the-future-of-your/444576,"
Is artificial intelligence the future of branding? AI is limited — even stunted at times. Branding requires a deft touch — an understanding of who people are, what makes them tick and what they want. It's about building the human connection, following through on promises made, and reaping the benefits: customer satisfaction, engagement and loyalty.AI tools in any business realm require a delicate balance in order to get the best outcome, but generative AI tools are already making an impact in the world of branding. There are tons of AI tools out there that offer unique features that may not have previously been in our branding skill sets — but now they are.Here are some ways in which entrepreneurs are even now using generative AI to enhance their branding efforts.



Enhancing and streamlining the brand design process.Creating a wide variety of unique branded designs.Increasing appeal with personalization.Related: What is AI, Anyway?Using generative AI to streamline the brand design processIteration is one of the most common pitfalls that startup owners fall into — and one of the biggest black holes into which your time falls, never to be regained. For instance, getting a logo just right takes time, feedback and more time.


This is why generative AI for visual design in branding is one of the most valuable applications. The creative touch of a human designer is vital, but there's no doubt that using AI can streamline the process of design.A quick example is the use of logo design software. For example, at my company, LogoDesign.net, we use AI to help users get suggestions on iterations — and to generate hundreds of variations of a single design all at once. For an entrepreneur wondering whether their logo would look better in black and white, in red and black, enclosed in a circle, with a different style, and a dozen other possibilities, generative AI is the tool to use.Using generative AI to create content that is uniquely on-brandOne of the main selling points of generative AI is the ability to create different types of content. Branding requires a host of visual content — logos, advertisements, web design and more. Color choice, font choice and all the other elements need to be set and recognizable.But within the set-in-stone elements of branding, there's still a lot of room for branching out. Generative AI tools can be excellent jumping-off points for crafting a variety of branded content that stays within the realm of the brand while bringing in the appeal of the truly unique.


An excellent example of this is a 2017 campaign by the eat-it-by-the-spoonful brand Nutella. This campaign, titled Nutella Unica, used generative AI to create a whopping seven million custom, unique product labels for its jars. Using AI algorithms to create the designs allowed the minds behind the campaign to set on-brand parameters for the designs. It generated a seemingly endless parade of wholly unique designs. Without AI behind it, such a design task would have taken up far more time — and a lot more of the budget.This example is evidence that AI branding and design tools can be used to expand brand designs while still maintaining the aesthetic and spirit behind the brand.Related: Six Reasons Branding is More Important Than Ever BeforeUsing generative AI to increase appeal with personalizationAlong with branching out to new potential demographics for a brand, there's also the focus on pinpointing established or intended audiences and giving them what they want. The type of content, what the content includes, and other content that they're likely to be interested in are all factors that can be fed into generative AI and utilized to refine branding and advertising.


Ads like these can also be fed by other data about demographics to create a branded ad design with a heightened appeal to the individual. There's data behind every aspect of design, from how people react to certain fonts to which colors appeal more to women than men and vice versa. Generative AI can be utilized to tweak and fine-tune targeted ads to create the optimal experience for each individual. Ultra-personalization of branding and marketing content is a step forward for creating that connection between client and company.Custom products and on-demand production can cut down on overhead costs for the company and be a good thing on all fronts. Print-on-demand sites indicate how these AI tools can be more widely utilized; they give the customer the opportunity to influence the design, and they're automatically more invested, engaged, and likely to buy from the brand.Ensure that they have a unique, educational and entertaining experience as they interact with your website and product catalog, and you're building investment and loyalty.Related: Six Ways to Build Customer Loyalty


AI design tools — changing our branding now and foreverAI is everywhere, and the process of branding can only benefit by incorporating these new tools, expanding our ability to interact with our audience. It's not perfect by any means, but AI has been progressing by leaps and bounds and will continue to do so.You don't even need a crystal ball to tell you that.

75,Supercharge Your Brand Awareness with These Game-Changing PR Tools,"Oct 12, 2023",Heidi Cortez,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/supercharge-your-brand-awareness-with-these-game-changing/459737,"
In today's business, establishing a strong brand presence and gaining authority are crucial for entrepreneurs and businesses. To achieve those goals, you must have a solid public relations (PR) strategy in place — and there are two key pieces of that strategy: guest appearances on podcasts in your niche and using social media properly.So how do you do it? Well, let's first go over the importance of PR and media coverage, as well as the benefits of being a guest on podcasts and using social media. Not only can using these strategies enhance an entrepreneur's reputation, expand their reach and ultimately drive more traffic to their business, but it helps give an entrepreneur trust and credibility. If a potential client can't find much about your business on Google or social media, you're in trouble. Staying relevant with current PR, podcast interviews and repurposing them for social media content will help you achieve the success your business needs to scale.Related: How to Attract Sales Leads through Your Podcast Guest Appearance



Build brand awareness through pressPublic relations is a strategic communication process that helps entrepreneurs create and maintain a positive image in the eyes of their target audience and the public. By leveraging PR, entrepreneurs can manage their reputation, effectively communicate their brand's story and differentiate themselves from the competition. All well-known businesses have press, and you should, too.Media coverage and press releases are essential components of PR and branding. Being featured in reputable publications and or having press releases published can significantly boost a business's credibility. Media coverage provides third-party validation, positioning the entrepreneur as an authority in their niche and gaining exposure to a much larger audience. Additionally, the right media coverage can lead to increased brand awareness, which can convert into new customers, strategic partnerships and investor opportunities.


Hire PR helpHaving the right team to help properly share your story with the media is a huge part of building a public identity with trust and authority. A great public figure business coach or PR agent can help you gain a competitive edge in your industry, as they will have established relationships with journalists, editors and influencers. This allows them to secure media coverage and feature placements, increasing your brand visibility.Podcast guest appearancesThe popularity of podcasting has opened up new doors for entrepreneurs to reach their target audience. Appearing as a guest on popular podcasts allows entrepreneurs to share their expertise, give insights and connect with a new audience.Podcasts provide a valuable opportunity to tell one's story in a conversational format, allowing entrepreneurs to showcase their personality and authenticity. By sharing their experiences, lessons learned and industry knowledge, entrepreneurs can establish themselves as thought leaders and build a rapport with listeners they may have not had before. The credibility gained from these interactions can lead to increased brand loyalty and new customers.Additionally, podcasts often have a niche focus, catering to specific industries or interests. By requesting to be a guest on podcasts aligned with a like-minded audience, entrepreneurs and business owners can reach a highly targeted demographic and generate quality leads and possible fans. Each podcast appearance serves as an endorsement and recommendation from the podcast host, enhancing the entrepreneur's reputation with the listeners, which is why being a guest is so valuable.

Find podcasts that align with your expertise, interests and story so that you can add value to their audience. You can use platforms like Apple Podcasts, Spotify or Podchaser for your research. It's wise and recommended to listen to any podcast show before you send a pitch. Get a feel for the type of guests they typically have on their show.Create a 1-page media kit to give a brief on who you are. Include photos, a short bio, website link and your social media handles with insights. This makes it easy and attractive to present yourself professionally, especially if the show gets lots of pitches.Once you have done your research, know you're a good fit for the show and can add compelling content, it's time to develop a strong email or DM pitch. Make sure to include your credentials and potential topics that you can share with their audience. Your pitch should be what you can do for the podcast and their audience, not why you want to be on their show.


I recommend pitching yourself first for free, however, if time is money for you, hire an expert to do the pitches for you. A good PR firm can easily book you on ideal podcast shows.Synergistic impactWhile PR and podcast appearances are powerful strategies on their own, their true potential is realized when they are combined. By strategically coordinating PR efforts and podcast appearances, entrepreneurs can amplify their brand's visibility and credibility exponentially.For example, entrepreneurs can leverage their media coverage by sharing it with podcast hosts and producers, increasing the likelihood of securing guest appearances. On the other hand, podcast appearances can generate interest from media outlets, resulting in additional press coverage and creating a cycle of positive exposure.The synergy between PR and podcasts helps create a consistent brand narrative. When entrepreneurs align their messaging across media coverage and podcast interviews, they strengthen their expertise and brand identity. This consistency builds trust and recognition among the target audience, building long-term relationships and loyalty.

77,When to Know If Rebranding the Right Move For You — and What You Should Focus on When It's Time,"Sep 25, 2023",Jason Miller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-do-you-know-if-you-should-rebrand-heres-some-advice/458345,"
Should you rebrand? On average, 74% of the S&P companies rebrand within the first seven years. Rebranding is a significant endeavor that can evoke a mix of emotions for companies. It involves many variables and can be both exciting and scary. There are a lot of questions my clients have on whether or not they even need to rebrand.At my company, Strategic Advisor Board (SAB), we help clients through opportunity analysis and strategic planning. Sometimes in the strategic plan, we advise the clients to rebrand. If our clients are the ones who bring up wanting to rebrand, we always ask them a few key questions first:Why do you want to rebrand now?Have your clients changed?Is your brand out of date?Is your growth potential being impacted?Is your brand no longer in line with your current clients' needs and wants?Have you outgrown your brand?Is it difficult for your clients to tell your brand apart from your competitors?Has your services or business model changed?The first question holds significant importance. At times, businesses consider rebranding simply because it's been a while since they did any changes to their image. But the why behind the rebrand is what gives way to your brand strategy.



Related: Is Rebranding the Right Move for Your Company? Here's How I Knew It Was TimeWhen rebranding, what key areas do you need to focus on?Brand audits are crucial for aligning your brand identity with your new brand strategy. There are three types of rebranding: brand refresh, partial branding and full branding. A brand refresh will only change a few minor elements, usually within the visual side of things.


This could include changing a few elements in a logo and or slightly modifying the brand color palette to keep it modern. A partial rebrand would include changing some elements but not others. A full rebrand would change all elements of the brand as if you were a brand-new company. Whichever route you decide to go down, keep in mind that a brand strategy has to do with your company's positioning in the marketplace and there needs to be a goal in mind of why the strategy is being done in the first place. These are elements of your brand you could change to suit your strategy:Business name Rebranding can include changing your business name. Start with your brand name. Does your name still connect with your audience? If you're trying to reach a new audience, does it connect with them? A good name is unique and uses clear, easy-to-remember words. Stay away from trendy words or slang since words can change meaning over time.Mission and vision statements 


Do they still align with your company's focus? Remember, a good mission statement should include a company's ethics, values, culture and goals and it should affect how your employees and stakeholders operate. It should be clear and concise and easy to understand the first time it's read and keep it around 1-3 sentences long. Make sure you re-evaluate your values and see if they fit with your new image. A good vision statement should include looking into the future and explaining where the company is going. Also, it should be 1-2 sentences max.Related: How to Rebrand Without Losing Your Search Engine RankingsLogo design I've included typography and brand colors in this section as they're all a part of the visual components of your brand. Brand colors can increase brand recognition by 80%. When most small business owners start creating their brands they're not thinking about the psychology of colors and how they play on human emotions.


There's a whole world behind brand the psychology of color theory and if you look at certain industries you'll notice there are some common themes in colors. For example, in the restaurant industry, red is used in order to create an appetite. So don't underestimate the power of brand colors in your logos! A good logo will be simple, look good on all scales, whether it's on a business card, website or billboard, and it will evoke a sense of feeling of what the brand's personality is like. If you've noticed, in most of the mentioned categories of rebranding, a common theme is simplicity. It's no wonder that 95% of the top 100 brands in the world only use one to two colors in their logos. Brand voice Your brand voice is the personality that comes out in all of your marketing and it must be consistent in all communication you have with your clients. From your online presence to the way your employees conduct themselves within their customer service roles.It's important to stay consistent. I would argue this is one of the most important parts of your brand because it's how you directly connect to your clients. So when you're rebranding think about if your current voice reaches a demographic you want to continue reaching, or if you want to branch out to another demographic, will they resonate with your brand personality? Maybe your current demographic has connected well to your informal voice but in order to expand to another demographic you would be better off adding a bit of humor to the mix.

Here's Why, When and How You Should Do It.TaglineTaglines aren't necessary for your brand but they do help in creating first impressions of what your business is all about. A good tagline is short, relevant and creative and it helps with your company's brand identity and recognition in turn setting you apart from your competitors.There are a lot of great reasons to rebrand, just keep in mind that your rebrand should help drive brand loyalty and engagement, create excitement, increase revenue and have a clear purpose and strategy behind it. By updating either some or all of your branding through your business name, mission and vision statements, logo, voice and tagline, you'll be able to reach new markets, stay modern and stand out from competitors.

78,Why Recent Layoffs and Unaddressed Employee Grief Are Hurting Your Company's Bottom Line,"Sep 23, 2023",Megan J. Shen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-unaddressed-grief-is-hurting-your-companys-bottom-line/459054,"
It's no mystery that continued major waves of layoffs in the tech industry are causing suffering for those who are being laid off. But a major elephant in the room is overlooked among remaining employees: grief. Ignoring the grief that the remaining workers are experiencing threatens to impact the remaining workers' well-being and companies' bottom lines negatively.More than 234,000 tech workers have been laid off this year. Major companies like Amazon, Spotify and Meta have cut tens of thousands of workers' jobs this year, including Google's recent round of layoffs this September. Obvious to most business analysts is that these large-scale layoffs create instability and inefficiencies within teams. What is less obvious, however, is that many remaining employees are dealing with grief around the loss of coworkers, work rhythms and stability amidst continued layoffs.Research demonstrates and experts have long warned that layoffs cause detrimental effects on both individual employee performance and corporate performance. Additionally, major layoffs can cause issues for companies in future employability because future candidates remember how companies handled economic uncertainty through massive layoffs.



What is notably missing from the conversation around the current tech layoffs, however, is that many major companies are now facing a grief problem amidst their remaining workers. Failing to address this issue may make workers suffer and cost companies a lot of money through the loss of worker productivity, efficiency, and satisfaction.Related: What the Future Looks Like for Fresh Graduates in the Tech Industry


The remaining employees at these companies are currently experiencing two major types of grief. The first is the actual grief of losing colleagues, work friends, team structure and dynamics, and often work schedule and range of responsibilities. Unfortunately, most companies and managers fail to acknowledge the psychological stress and grief their remaining employees might be experiencing after losing valuable team members.The second form of grief is anticipatory grief, which refers to grief around the potential of losing someone or something. Most remaining employees remain under constant stress of worrying about losing their jobs, another member of their team, and stability within their role.Because most of these layoffs are happening remotely, there is often an added layer of loneliness and isolation experienced by remaining employees. Remaining employees often lose meaningful social connections by being suddenly unable to reach their coworkers, many of whom they only had means of connecting via workplace channels. All this is happening against the backdrop of a loneliness epidemic in the U.S., as declared by the U.S. Surgeon General.Related: How to Combat the Growing Epidemic of Loneliness in the Workplace


Following layoffs, remaining workers suffer. Prior research indicates that after a layoff, 74% of remaining employees report a decline in their productivity, 69% report the quality of their company's product or service declines, 87% report being less likely to recommend their organization as a good organization to work for and 77% report making more errors and mistakes.Moreover, the most commonly reported feelings after a layoff are anger, anxiety and guilt. These are all common symptoms of grief. The post-layoff period is a fragile time within a company, one in which employers should provide adequate support and communication with their remaining workforce.Whether employees are experiencing grief, anticipatory grief or both, the best way for companies to support their workforce is to address the grief head-on through open, candid conversations. Grief research shows that avoiding conversations around loss only delays the healing process and worsens things.The translation for companies is that their employees will remain bitter, stressed and potentially angry about the situation if they do not feel seen or heard or their feelings remain unacknowledged. This, in turn, can reduce worker productivity and prevent new teams from forming positive and supportive team environments. Team dynamics are one of the biggest and best predictors of workplace efficiency, so ignoring this problem will be costly in the end, both in terms of well-being and productivity.


Companies hold a lot of power to course correct during this unstable time. Prior research indicates that following layoffs, workers who feel their managers are visible, approachable and open are 70% less likely to report drops in productivity and 65% less likely to report a decline in their organization's quality of work or service.Managers must communicate with team members through one-on-one conversations, allowing their direct reports to process their feelings. This open, candid and empathic communication can create space for a new and positive team dynamic to emerge.The best places for companies and managers to start are with key communication tactics that work in supporting those who are grieving and promoting resilience and growth:Acknowledge how remaining employees might be feelingNormalize experiencing feelings of guilt, anger, sadness, uncertainty, denial or regret following a major layoffBe candid about reasons for downsizing and layoffsFocus on the future and how employees can move forward with the company's new visionConnect employees with their new teams in meaningful ways to create social cohesionThroughout the entire trajectory of layoffs, from announcing that they are coming to laying off individuals, companies should be mindful to keep their communications candid, consistent and transparent. Resources should be devoted to training managers and team leads in empathic communication. Designated spaces and meetings should be created for discussing the topic of layoffs. Employees should be given ample opportunities to ask questions.


Avoidance is the enemy of good communication, whereas transparent, empathic, and person-centered communication can go a long way in creating trust, stability, and vision in an organization's very unstable time of grief. This will, in turn, improve the company's bottom line as well.

79,Why Brands are Becoming the New Badges of Belief and Belonging,"Sep 22, 2023",John Emery,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-brands-are-becoming-the-new-badges-of-belief-and/458997,"
People are increasingly leaving their previous places of belonging. The past decade has witnessed seismic shifts in society, driven by the proliferation of smartphones, the ubiquity of social media and the rise of remote work.These changes have reshaped the way we perceive ourselves and construct our identities. Traditional affiliations, such as religious groups, are waning in influence, particularly among the Gen-Z demographic. Whether they recognize it or not, people seek fresh avenues to define themselves and find new ways of belonging.In the vacuum left by organized religion and other former ways of belonging, brands have become the new badges of identity. Individuals are piecing together their identities from the brands they identify with. It's a reflection of their values and aspirational lifestyle. In essence, brands have become the storytellers of our lives, and people are embracing this shift in stride.



Related: 3 Tips to Turn Your Brand Into a ReligionToday's brands are not merely selling products or services; they're being embraced as integral components of our identity. As entrepreneurs, this paradigm shift presents both a challenge and an opportunity.


Whether brands asked for this role or not, they must acknowledge the authority being bestowed upon them. Consumers now expect more than just products or services; they seek meaning and purpose in these affiliations.So what can you do today to embrace this moment and become more intentional about the good you introduce into your customer's lives?Related: Integrity Matters: The Importance Of Ethics In The Consultancy BusinessStep 1: Identify your customer's aspirational identityYou know your customers. You know the problems they have. You know where they live, their income bracket, and what they value in the buying process. But we need to take customer personas one click further. We need to know who they want to become.


Yes, they might want your product, but what do they want behind that wanting?This is where Theodore Levitt's quote comes in handy. Levitt, a Harvard Business School marketing professor, famously said, ""People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!""Your customers don't want your product. They want what your product brings them.I'd take it even further. They don't want a quarter-inch hole; they want to hang a shelf. And they don't even want the shelf; they want to organize the garage. And they don't even want to organize the garage; they want to be the type of person who can do hard things. And beyond that, they want their spouse to be proud to be married to the type of person who can do hard things.

And how can you help them get there?Related: 5 High-Profile Reputation Nightmares Your Brand Can Learn fromStep 2: Define your brand valuesTaking that fresh discovery of who your customer wants to become, you can begin to position your brand specifically to help unlock that new truth in them. You can reverse engineer your brand values to match who they want to be someday.


If your company sells drill bits, your brand values may include ""efficiency"" and ""integrity."" Those both apply to the drill-bit business and your customer's aspirational identity.""Efficiency"" keeps things structured and clean. If you're organized, it saves you time, and your tools last longer, ultimately saving you money.""Integrity"" applies to the strength of the drill-bit itself, but also fixing things that need fixing, making time to finish the job, and being a good partner in your relationships.Your brand values quickly become your customer's personal values.


Step 3: Give your customers mantras to live byHow do we make these values memorable and easily embraced by our customer base? We turn them into mantras. Instead of singular words as your values, you conversationalize them. Turn them into fortune-cookie-type phrases that are memorable and fun to say.Instead of ""efficiency,"" your brand says, ""Measure twice, cut once.""Instead of ""integrity,"" your brand says, ""Do the right thing, even when no one's watching.""If you do this across all of your company's corporate values, you drastically increase your customers' likelihood of embracing these same philosophies.And your brand's importance in their lives solidifies.Related: 5 Easy Exercises to Find Your Brand's VoiceAs leaders of companies, we wield a platform, and the question is, how will we use it?

80,AI vs. a Human Touch: Finding The Right Balance When It Comes to Branding,"Sep 21, 2023",Tatiana Dumitru,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/ai-vs-a-human-touch-finding-the-right-balance-when-it/457495,"
In a world where digital interactions dominate, the symbiotic relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and branding is transforming the landscape. While AI can't replicate the genuine human touch, it's emerging as a powerful tool to forge authentic connections with consumers.In the competitive business landscape, companies of all sizes are looking for opportunities to work smarter, faster and better than the competition. An increasing number of AI tools can assist with branding and reputation management, but the overwhelming number of options leaves many falling short.Related: How AI is Forcing Marketers to Reinvent the Industry



The human connection beyond the algorithmThe first and most important step is to understand AI as an assistive technology, not a replacement for human effort entirely. Secondly, it's critical to be aware of the personalized, connected interactions that today's consumers demand. Emotional connections create a resonance with potential customers, leaving them with confidence and trust in the brands they choose.In today's world, branding is all about making that connection with your audience. By nature, it's a process that requires empathy, understanding and creativity. You're trying to figure out:


How to present your brand as an authority within your industry.How to use branding to build trust and connection with your audience.What ""branding"" even means to today's audiences.How you can bring this all together to succeed in branding your business properly.Understanding human interactions and behaviors can help you create more successful strategies in branding, marketing and beyond. When you add the power of AI, you can do even more.AI as a catalyst for personalizationAs we've learned from the use of various AI tools and machine learning models, vast amounts of data can be analyzed in a very short amount of time. For businesses looking to improve their personalization, this is a huge benefit. No longer do your employees have to spend hours sifting through and organizing customer data to deliver personalization. They can simply put the AI to work to gather insights on preferences and user expectations.This will allow you to deliver an enhanced customer experience that includes everything from tailored recommendations for products and services to customized messaging in your marketing campaigns. And you can do it all without having to cull the data yourself when you enlist the help of AI.In the past, the focus was mostly on market segmentation, or dividing audiences and defining customer personas based on certain demographics or other factors. Businesses were looking at this as a more targeted option than blanket marketing, and it became the norm. AI takes that one step further, refining the targeting process even more and allowing your brand to make connections with your customers on a deeper level.


Related: 3 Timeless Elements of Storytelling That Will Grow Your BusinessThe role of AI in storytelling and creating emotional connectionsThere are several AI tools that you're probably already using to help you tell the right story with your content. Keyword research, topic generation tools, analytics reports (that are AI-generated) — the list is longer than you might think.AI is a powerful element in storytelling because it can use the data provided to identify narratives that resonate with various audiences. Artificial intelligence and automated tools can help you optimize the delivery of your content, too, so that your stories find the right users at the right time.This also helps brands identify the emotional triggers that drive consumer behavior, which makes it easier to create an emotional connection in the brand experience. Emotional AI is even becoming more popular, as tools that can identify emotions through words or facial recognition are being developed by many big players in the industry.


And those emotional connections are what will set your brand apart. Take, for example:Brazil's Yellow Line used AdMobilize emotional AI to measure face metrics and display ads based on people's emotions.MetLife implemented an emotional AI coaching tool to help agents better detect emotional states and provide real-time tips and assistance for agents. This increased their NPS score, Perfect Call scores, and issue resolution and decreased call handling time.These are just a couple of examples of how many brands are starting to use AI to create emotional experiences that today's audiences enjoy.


Enhancing brand consistencyOf course, we can't talk about AI and automation without discussing the benefit of consistency. With AI, you can maintain brand consistency across all platforms and touchpoints without having to even think about it. AI can help you align messaging, tone and design to come up with a cohesive brand identity that you can share with the world.AI can even help you identify areas where things aren't consistent or instances of your brand that may need a second look. This helps you further ensure that you're staying ahead of the competition and delivering the connected experience that people desire. AI can even go as far as to outline a strategy or process for you so that you can further refine it into manageable touchpoints and provide a consistent experience from start to finish.Related: What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? Here Are Its Benefits, Uses and MoreAI and human authenticity: A synergyAI cannot replace the authenticity of human creativity and conceptualization. However, it can enhance several areas of the human experience. In an era of AI-driven innovations, maintaining those authentic connections with your consumers remains a priority. While AI is a tool that can optimize data analysis, personalization, storytelling, and branding, the human element remains at the core of brand-consumer relationships.


By embracing AI as an augmentation to your human efforts, your brand will be able to forge a path toward meaningful, personalized interactions that resonate in today's digital world. AI is poised to become a powerful tool for branding and marketing, amplifying the capabilities of your human employees and delivering data-driven insights that will help you create more effective branding strategies moving forward.

This proactive approach fosters trust and builds a loyal community around the brand.



Enhanced customer engagement is another unique advantage of social branding. Platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn provide a unique opportunity for startups to interact directly with their customers and build lasting relationships. On Twitter, startups can engage in real-time conversations, respond to feedback, and address concerns, while LinkedIn allows for professional networking, sharing industry insights and fostering community discussions.Similarly, startups can create community groups, host live sessions and run targeted ads to foster engagement on Facebook.

Consistency is key, so ensure that your logo, colors, fonts and messaging are uniform across all social media platforms. Most importantly, always ensure your brand's messaging is laser-focused on your target audience.2. Choose the right platformsNot all social media platforms are created equal. Each platform has unique features, demographics, and content formats; understanding these nuances is the first step in mastering social media branding. For example, LinkedIn is a hub for professionals and B2B marketing, while Instagram thrives on visual content, making it ideal for lifestyle and fashion brands.To ace social media branding, it's essential to identify the platforms that align with your startup's target audience and objectives. Researching and understanding the demographics of each platform will guide you in selecting the ones that resonate with your brand's voice and goals.3.

Use relevant and branded hashtags to increase your content's visibility and reach. For example, creating a unique hashtag for a specific campaign can help you track its success and engagement.

Influencer partnerships can help you reach new customers, increase brand awareness, and drive conversions. By choosing the right influencers, you can tap into their established trust and credibility, making your brand more appealing to their followers.6.

Analyzing this data will help you identify trends, measure the success of your campaigns and make data-driven decisions to optimize your social media branding efforts. Regularly reviewing these insights allows you to understand what resonates with your audience and what doesn't. It's not just about numbers; it's about understanding the behavior and preferences of your audience, enabling you to tailor your content and strategies for maximum impact.


Applying effective social media branding for startups in the competitive online space requires a strategic approach and consistent effort. It's not just about crafting creative campaigns but understanding your audience deeply and making data-driven decisions catering to their needs.

84,Should Your Brand Embrace Social Issues? Here's What to Consider,"Sep 12, 2023",Christopher Tompkins,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/should-your-brand-embrace-social-issues/458340,"
In a recent LinkedIn poll of mine, I asked my audience, ""How likely are you to engage with a brand that actively supports a social issue?"" You may or may not be surprised to learn that over 3,000 votes were ""very likely.""With the digital landscape evolving at a rapid pace, consumers are not focusing their search strictly on products and services - they are also seeking to connect with brands that share their values and support social causes. As a result, many businesses find themselves asking a crucial question: ""Should we embrace social issues and integrate them into our brand identity?""Together, let's dive into the complexities of this decision, exploring the potential benefits and challenges of aligning your brand with social issues.Related: Consumers Demand a Stance on Social and Political Issues. Are You Ready to Speak Out?Building stronger connections with consumersPurpose-driven branding has emerged as a powerful marketing strategy that resonates with modern consumers. By aligning your brand with social issues, you demonstrate a commitment to making a positive impact beyond profits. This approach fosters emotional connections with your target audience, leading to increased brand loyalty and advocacy.



Consumers seek to engage with brands that stand for something meaningful, and this approach appeals to emotions, creating a sense of trust and admiration for your brand. It strengthens brand loyalty as like-minded consumers join your cause and become advocates.However, authenticity is crucial. Consumers can detect insincere attempts at purpose-driven branding, which may lead to reputational damage. To succeed, ensure that your commitment to social issues goes beyond marketing rhetoric and is deeply embedded in your brand's culture and practices — more on this below.Related: 10 Things Entrepreneurs Never Want to Talk About, But ShouldRetaining like-minded employees that drive resultsEmbracing social issues goes beyond its impact on customer relationships — it can also significantly influence a brand's ability to attract and retain top talent. With the job market being more competitive than ever, employees (especially the younger generations) place a strong emphasis on finding purpose and meaning in their careers.


Their focus is on seeking opportunities that align with their personal values and offer not only financial support but also mental support. When your brand is actively associated with the employee-first mentality, you're likely to resonate strongly with these job seekers.It has been shown that when a company makes an effort to stand for social causes and contribute to positive change, it sends a powerful message about its core values. This, in turn, attracts employees who are not just seeking a job but are eager to be part of something greater, where they can contribute to initiatives that matter to them on a personal level.When companies embrace these issues, it not only attracts talent but also plays a role in retaining these employees, thus saving the company time and money.Employees who feel that their contributions positively impact society are more likely to be motivated and loyal to the organization. Brands that prioritize social initiatives enhance their reputation and create an internal culture that attracts and retains loyal and eager individuals.


Related: How to Build Reputation in an Industry From ScratchNavigating the challenges of social issue alignmentWhile embracing social issues can bring numerous benefits, it also comes with potential challenges that require careful consideration. Let's review some of the key factors to bear in mind.Authenticity matters - Consumers are becoming increasingly discerning and can spot disingenuous attempts at social issue alignment. Ensuring that your brand's commitment to the cause is genuine and backed by tangible actions is essential.This means continuing to make your stance known all year long. For example, it would be a bad idea to advocate for Pride Month but not mention the importance of inclusivity in your marketing after June. To reiterate the above, these issues must be a part of who you are as a brand.


Potential backlash - Publicly aligning with certain social issues may invite backlash from individuals or groups who hold differing opinions. Thoroughly research the issue and assess its alignment with your customers' values before taking a stance. And, when this backlash comes (and it will), don't backtrack. If it truly aligns with what you stand for as a brand, stick with it.Bud Light is a perfect example of this. After the company partnered with the transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, it sparked major backlash and boycotts from many of its customers. Despite this scrutiny, Bud Light stayed true to its values and stance on the issue.Avoid bandwagoning - This refers to using social issues merely as a marketing ploy without meaningful action behind them. Ensure your brand's commitment extends beyond lip service and is reflected in concrete initiatives and partnerships.Striking a balanceWhile embracing social issues can be a powerful tool for connecting with consumers, brands must exercise caution and find the right balance. Not all social issues will seamlessly align with a brand's identity or core values, and attempting to address every possible cause can dilute the brand's message and authenticity.


Instead, the key lies in identifying the issues that genuinely resonate. Conducting thorough research and soliciting feedback from both internal stakeholders and the target audience can aid in identifying the most relevant and impactful causes.Brands should consider partnering with reputable nonprofit organizations or dedicating resources to projects that directly address the identified issues. Transparency in these efforts is crucial, as consumers value authenticity.While embracing social issues can be a compelling strategy for brand-consumer connection, it requires a careful and balanced approach. Brands must be selective about the causes they associate with, ensuring alignment with their core values.When executed thoughtfully, brands can create a profound and lasting impact while strengthening their relationship with consumers who share their values.

85,Branding in a 'Barbie' World — How to Harness the Power of Your Brand,"Sep 12, 2023",Tyler Metcalf,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/branding-in-a-barbie-world-how-mattel-succeeded-in/458217,"
Hi, Barbie!The ""Barbie"" movie was magic in a bottle (or, more aptly, magic in a box with a cellophane front), but not for the reasons you think. Its box office didn't break $1 billion just because of its great branding — it was a fantastic product, full of heart. Yes, it had a massive marketing budget. It had memes. It became the definitive summertime cinema experience of 2023. But now it raises the question: What does Mattel do next? And what lessons will they have learned from all this success?Related: 'Barbie' Was a Publicity Machine — Here's How Barbie and 4 Other Blockbusters Mastered the Art of Marketing



Pink on the silver screenGreta Gerwig and Margot Robbie were focused on making the most creative and thought-provoking movie they could within the confines and potential of ""Barbie,"" one of the most recognizable toy brands in the world. I know toys. I cut my teeth on toys, moving everything from dolls to hula hoops in the early days of Amazon.Gerwig and Robbie explored Barbie's breadth of humanity, from the magic of playing with toys to the corporate management of the brand. Because they made the right creative choices for the movie, defending all aspects of Barbie, it added up to something wonderful — something pink. So pink, in fact, painting the set created a world shortage of fluorescent pink paint. The movie is bright, tactile and creative, and the marketing reflected that.


Warner Bros. wouldn't have put $150 million into the marketing budget if they didn't know they had a great movie on their hands. They harnessed the power of other brands that were ""Barbie"" in their own right. There was the AirBnB Malibu Dreamhouse. Pink Barbiecore Crocs. The standees in theaters nationwide were giant toy boxes in which people took pictures. Flo and Jamie, the Barbie and Ken of the Progressive commercials were even at the premiere. Enough premium content was made to generate intrigue and excitement, but that doesn't even touch the organic buzz around the ""Barbie"" movie.The natural spontaneity of memes and the coincidence of release dates made Barbie and Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" the perfect pair. The memetic nature of seeing the smiling face of Margot Robbie's Barbie next to Cillian Murphy's J. Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb, created a dichotomy for people to identify with one or the other. With the simple choice between pink and black, people were in on the joke and the conversation around these films. It also prompted many people to double feature ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" — Barbenheimer. There is no way this reaction to Barbie could have been manufactured; it was a magical, rare response to a refreshed brand.Related: What the 'Barbie' Movie Can Teach Businesses About Effective Multicultural MarketingBox office brandsMichael Bay's ""Transformers"" set off the toy movie renaissance in 2007. Hasbro had a hit on its hand, but the film is a technical marvel with impressive explosions and sound design. It's marketed to the 18 to 34 male demographic who grew up with Transformer nostalgia and an urge to watch Megan Fox working on a Camaro. The darker, hardened version of past toys and brands is on its way out. Hasbro tried with the action-packed ""G.I. Joe"" movies and ""Battleship,"" but each one focused more on the action than the brand's heart.


The king of maintaining the heart of their brand is LEGO. The movies, the games and the toys all support the soul of the LEGO brand, as well as the brands they partner with. ""LEGO"" comes from ""Leg Godt,"" meaning ""Play Well"" in Danish. Everything within the brand inspires fun play. ""The LEGO Movie."" ""The LEGO Batman Movie."" The LEGO Star Wars specials. LEGO's success hinges on their respect for play. Hasbro and all other companies need to learn that their brands' hearts must be nourished, not made louder and more explosive.""Barbie"" was pure heart and inviting to all. If you weren't there for Barbie, you were there for Ken. Theaters were devastated by COVID-19, but Barbie piqued theater-going interest again, offering something on the big screen people have never seen before. A survey found that ""Barbie"" brought 9 million people to the theater for the first time since the pandemic had started. People have seen giant robots fighting on the big screen. But they hadn't seen a doll filled with existential dread before.Related: 'Barbie' Is Driving a Huge Surge in Vintage Car Buying Says Hagerty CEOWill they ever learn?So, how does Mattel keep people going to the movies? Mattel's going to try mining all of the brands at their disposal. They already have at least 14 active projects in development, including Polly Pocket, Hot Wheels and Barney.


Will the Mattel cinematic universe be as manicured and intertwined as Marvel is for Disney? No. Of course not. But, if they do want to see success, they need to make sure the core heart of each brand is maintained on screen, just like Gerwig was able to accomplish with ""Barbie.""Does that seem like the case at the moment? We don't know. Lena Dunham is attached to write and direct ""Polly Pocket,"" which must differentiate itself from ""Barbie."" Daniel Kuluuya's ""Barney"" (yes, the purple dinosaur from the 90s) will have an A24-like surrealistic tone aimed at adults. Hot Wheels will be ""emotional and grounded and gritty,"" according to J.J. Abrams. These creative minds appear to be exploring each brand from novel approaches, though. Whether or not Mattel lets them fully explore will determine their success.You have to care about your brands. You can't just get excited about the money you can stand to make — and make safely, calculated choices to maximize that number. You must trust your creatives to love your brand, like your fans and customers. A story from a recent New Yorker article sums it up nicely:At the start of the ""Barbie"" process, Gerwig decided to write the screenplay with her partner, the writer-director Noah Baumbach. Mattel and Warner Bros. insisted on seeing a preview of the script's contents. The couple balked—they needed the freedom to experiment. Jeremy Barber, an agent at U.T.A. who represents Gerwig and Baumbach, is close with Brenner, so he could be blunt. ""Are you crazy?"" he told her. ""You should've come into this office and thanked me when Greta and Noah showed up to write a fucking Barbie movie!"" In the end, Gerwig presented executives with a poem in the style of the Apostles' Creed. They agreed to take their chances—and, after the script came in, the budget was set at about a hundred million dollars.Would ""Barbie"" have been as successful if non-creatives were more involved with the creative decision-making? Well, would any Mattel or Warner Bros. executives have been able to write an Apostle's Creed poem about Barbie? Probably not. Instead, with Gerwig's and Baumbach's experimentation, the world was given a heartfelt exploration of the Barbie brand. One that brought families and friends to the theater together in an experience they were not expecting. If Mattel wants another ""Barbie,"" they should let their creatives play.

86,5 Ways Writing and Publishing a Book Can Elevate Your Brand,"Sep 8, 2023",Tom Freiling,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-writing-and-publishing-a-book-can-elevate-your-brand/458442,"
In our digital age driven by content consumption, entrepreneurs and business executives are constantly seeking ways to elevate their brands and establish themselves as industry influencers. When you're recognized as an influencer, your opinions, insights and recommendations carry more weight, positioning you as a trusted source of valuable information in your field. It also increases your brand's visibility and recognition. As your insights reach a wider audience, you and your brand gain exposure, attracting potential customers, partners and collaborators.One important way to broaden your reach as an influencer is to write and publish a book. As a seasoned C-suite executive and entrepreneur in the publishing industry, I've personally experienced and observed the powerful impact of becoming an author. There's probably no better way to boost your and your brand's credibility and authority. In this article, we'll explore why writing a book trumps all other means when it comes to brand elevation.Related: Here's How Writing a Book Can Give Your Brand a Much-Needed Boost



Five reasons a book will elevate your brandWhen it comes to brand elevation, there are a variety of different ways to achieve success. As a lifelong book publisher, I've observed five ways becoming an author will increase your reach.First, authoring a book requires in-depth research, analysis and a thorough exploration of your subject matter. The process compels you to dive deep into your field, fostering a comprehensive understanding that goes well beyond surface-level knowledge. This depth of expertise is evident in your writing, positioning you as an authoritative figure in your industry. It gives evidence that you indeed are a subject matter authority. You'll also appear on bookselling websites, including Amazon, helping to expand your reach.


Second, publishing a book inherently carries a sense of authority and credibility. A book is a representation of your knowledge and insights, establishing you as a thought leader. Your position as an author commands respect, and readers are more likely to view you as an expert in your field compared to a podcast host, a blogger or social media influencer. A published book is a tangible asset that you can hold in your hands and showcase on your shelves. This physical representation of your expertise serves as a lasting reminder of your accomplishments and a powerful conversation starter in professional settings.Third, books are perceived as valuable resources that people pay money for. Readers often associate authors with wisdom, experience and the ability to offer solutions to their challenges. This perception of value can lead to increased interest in your brand and a higher willingness to engage with your products or services. Books are also less fleeting in nature compared to other digital content because they have a timeless quality. Once published, your book remains available to readers indefinitely, allowing you to consistently reach new audiences over the years.Fourth, the media often seeks out authors for interviews, expert opinions and feature stories. Being an author can open doors to media exposure that podcasts might not offer to the same extent. Media coverage can significantly expand your brand's reach and visibility. I've worked with hundreds of authors who landed appearances on regional and even national TV and radio, not to mention on podcasts and in print. Program producers are regularly looking for authors to book as guests on their shows, sometimes helping you find new customers and generating more income.Finally, the process of writing a book encourages thoughtful reflection and refinement of your ideas. This careful consideration translates into content that is well-structured, coherent and impactful — qualities that resonate with readers seeking valuable information. Authors often become synonymous with their ideas, creating a strong connection between their personal brand and their work. This connection can enhance your brand identity, making it more memorable and recognizable in your industry.


Related: Why Writing a Book Is the Most Powerful Step In Becoming a Thought LeaderBecome an author to create a lasting legacyThink of the books you've read that have influenced your life. You can probably point to at least a few that made a significant impact in your personal life and at work. Their words have shaped your perspectives, inspired new ideas and guided you through challenges. Becoming an author yourself offers the opportunity to join their ranks — to create a lasting legacy that resonates with readers. Just as you've been impacted by the wisdom and insights shared in the books you read, imagine the potential to leave a profound imprint on others.The depth of expertise, authority and perceived value associated with authorship, coupled with the timelessness and media opportunities it offers, make writing a book a superior choice for entrepreneurs and business executives aiming to enhance their brand's reputation and reach. So, if you're looking to solidify your position as an industry leader, consider picking up the pen and writing a book that will stand as a testament to your expertise for years to come. Today's technologies also make it a fast, easy and affordable way to elevate your brand. And once you're an author, you'll always be an author.Related: 5 Reasons Why Writing a Book Is a Smart Move for Entrepreneurs

Understanding your starting pointBefore you can amplify your brand's digital footprint, knowing where you stand is crucial. Imagine setting off on a journey without a starting point on your map. Wouldn't make much sense, right? The same principle applies here.



Begin with a comprehensive audit of your digital assets. Use tools like Google Analytics to monitor your website's daily visitors. Is it 50, 500 or 5,000? Next, hop onto platforms like Instagram or Twitter. Note down your current follower count.Services like SocialBlade offer real-time insights into your growth rate and engagement.

This isn't just about numbers; it's about setting a clear foundation for the massive growth journey ahead.2.

That ""100,000"" isn't just a shiny number; it's what this figure represents for your brand.Is it 100,000 monthly website visitors, social media followers or perhaps brand mentions in various online forums? Specifying this is paramount.Once you're clear on what your 100,000 looks like, it's time to break it down using the SMART goals methodology:Specific: Is it Twitter fans or blog hits? Nail that down.Measurable: Get the right tools. For website peeks, Google Analytics is your pal. For social, think Hootsuite.Achievable: Dream big but stay grounded. Aiming for 100,000 on Instagram? Check today's growth. Can you get there?Relevant: Align goals with your brand. If you're a tech firm, maybe Pinterest isn't your arena. Choose wisely.Time-bound: You've got half a year. Break it down. Maybe aim for a steady 20% bump monthly.Each step you take with this roadmap is laser-focused on that big win.Related: Building A Social Media Strategy That Can Bolster Your Brand's Online Presence: The How-To3.

Want to hit the mark? Understand your audience's content love. Look at the data. Which blogs hold their attention? Which social posts do they rave about? This info shapes content they'll love.Now, for the secret sauce. Certain content types tend to generate waves online:Infographics: Turn big data into eye-catching, share-worthy visuals.Listicles: Lists like ""Top 10 tips..."" or ""5 must-have tools..."" give quick, handy information.How-to guides: Teach them something.

4. Leverage social media for rapid growthSocial media is your brand's fast track to the spotlight. Picking the right platform is crucial. Is your audience professional? Dive into LinkedIn. More youthful? TikTok or Instagram might be more fruitful.Collaborate with influencers, but choose wisely. It's not about follower count but engagement. An influencer with 10,000 active fans might outdo one with 100,000 casual viewers.Finally, let's optimize for organic growth:Post Timing: Be regular. Know when your audience tunes inEngage: Use polls or Q&As for interaction. They're engaging and fun.Community: Respond to comments, use brand hashtags and nurture a community vibe. Turn followers into fans.With a smart social strategy, you're gearing up for impressive, lasting growth.


5. Paid strategies: Making every penny countImagine PPC like a digital billboard. You only pay when someone shows interest by clicking. Social ads? Think of them as tailored posters in a community center, shown only to those interested.Here's how to get the most out of your ad spend:Niche down: Be picky. Selling handmade candles? Aim your ads at 'handmade craft lovers' or 'home decor enthusiasts,' not everyone.Test and learn: Try two ads — one with a family picture and another with just candles. See which gets more love, then use that style more.Set a spending cap: Decide your daily spending. Maybe start with $10. See what happens, then decide if you want to spend more.Keep an eye on numbers: Platforms give you numbers - like how many clicked and how long they stayed. Watch them. Change your strategy if numbers aren't good.Simply put: spend wisely, watch results, tweak and repeat. Every penny should earn its keep.Related: 5 Steps to Creating a Content Marketing Strategy That Actually Works

88,The 11-Step Guide to Crafting the Perfect Media Kit for Startups,"Aug 29, 2023",Vikas Agrawal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-ultimate-11-step-guide-to-crafting-the-perfect-media/456678,"
Did you know that 90% of startups fail within their first five years? One of the key factors behind this alarming statistic is the lack of effective branding and public relations strategies. This causes startups to fall behind in credibility and recognition, resulting in failure to establish their new brand. But there's a solution!I have seen firsthand how a well-crafted startup media kit can solve this predicament and raise the chances of a startup's success manifold. So, I will share my insights on creating the perfect media kit for startups to ensure your startup gets the attention it deserves.Related: Monetize Your Website By Creating a Media Kit That Sells



Why startups need media kitsA media kit is a collection of materials about your startup, including its mission, products or services, team members and achievements. Media kits serve multiple purposes for startups, the first and most obvious being attracting the media.Journalists and bloggers are always looking for stories that stand out, and your startup could be one of them if you have a well-designed media kit. Why? A media kit that's visually appealing, concise, and filled with relevant information can be a goldmine for writers. It gives them everything they need to craft a compelling story about your startup.


The second purpose is to build trust. Trust is the foundation of any successful business relationship, and building that trust can be a steep climb for startups. Potential investors, customers and partners need to know that you're not just another fleeting idea; you're a serious business with a vision. A professional-looking media kit can be a powerful tool in building that trust. It's like a firm handshake that introduces your startup to the world. By including detailed information about your mission, products or services, team members, and achievements, you're sharing facts and telling a story of commitment, innovation and integrity.That's not all! Startups thrive on collaboration and partnerships, and media kits can play an instrumental role here by convincing potential partners that your startup is the right fit for them.

This includes high-resolution photographs showcasing your startup, logos representing your brand, catchy taglines summarizing your business and the specific fonts and colors that are part of your brand's identity. These elements ensure consistency and professionalism in your media kit.Related: Why Small Businesses Need Strong LogosStep 2 — Set the platformThe format of your media kit can make a significant difference. Choose a platform that best suits your audience's needs, whether it's a downloadable PDF, a slide presentation or an interactive website.

Remember, the presentation is as important as the content.Step 3 — Create an introductionYour media kit should start with a compelling introduction. This section should encapsulate what your startup is about, its mission, its vision and what sets it apart from the competition.

These words of affirmation act as social proof, assuring potential partners, investors or customers that they are making the right choice by engaging with your startup.


Step 9 — Include contact informationThis might seem basic, but it's vital. Ensure that journalists, investors or potential partners have a clear and easy way to reach out to you. Whether it's for media coverage, investment opportunities, or collaborations, make your contact details easily accessible.Step 10 — Design a visually appealing layoutA well-designed media kit is not just about content but also aesthetics. Use your brand's colors, fonts, and logos consistently to create a cohesive look. Incorporate images, graphics, and infographics to make the kit visually engaging and easy to digest. And arrange all the content you gathered in the previous steps in an organized, logical, and visually appealing manner.Step 11 — Make it shareableIn today's digital age, ensuring that your media kit is easily shareable is paramount. Whether a link to a website or a downloadable file, ensure it can be shared seamlessly via email or on social platforms. This increases the reach and accessibility of your media kit.Moreover, don't hesitate to seek professional help from design agencies to ensure consistent quantity and quality of content. After all, 32% of brands find continuous visual content creation difficult, and such brands must go with an experienced partner to make a media kit that ensures a strong impression. It's your brand's media image at stake!

89,What to Do When a Personal Brand Clashes With the Corporate Reputation,"Aug 28, 2023",Marina Byezhanova,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-to-do-when-a-personal-brand-clashes-with-corporate/457884,"
Personal branding is experiencing a universal moment. We are seeing people from all walks of life building their visibility, promoting themselves both online and offline. Once reserved for those of us looking to monetize side gigs, personal branding has since become a mainstream endeavor. Research shows that people who are ""able to discover their own points of competitive differentiation and creatively turn them into compelling narrative and imagery, while doing that strategically and socially-appropriately, have greater chances of professional success."" A personal brand can open doors to internal mobility, unlock new career opportunities and even lead to greater career satisfaction.Employees from all walks of life are following the likes of Gary Vee to learn how to build their own personal brands and leverage social media effectively. And yet, many are fearful and hesitant. They are fearful not only of doing it wrong thus damaging their careers, but they are actually concerned that their pursuit of increased visibility will ring loud alarm bells across the HR team and the executive offices of the company that employs them. No surprise there! Disparaging language when discussing personal branding continues to prevail. Look at this BBC article which refers to personal branding as an act of ""touting oneself,"" in turn positioned as being at odds with company loyalty. Talk about being out of touch with modern reality.Related: How to Understand Corporate Branding vs. Personal Branding for Success



The tension between personal branding and corporate falloutArticles with their disparaging language aside, employers' concerns can definitely be worthy of empathy. After all, employee-related scandals can easily go viral, whether it's in the private or the public sectors. In the era of social media and our shared love for a juicy story with a dramatic plot twist, what an employee says or does can quickly come under scrutiny and even quicker cast a shadow on the employer and their reputation. As a result, organizations are crafting what they believe to be iron-clad social media policies, blocking access to social media platforms from office equipment and quite frankly employing some of the stringiest methods aimed at mitigating potential reputational risk.This tension between personal branding and corporate fallout isn't unique to the cubicles of corporate America. Even sectors that traditionally thrive on individual expression, such as the entertainment industry, are not immune to the challenges and pitfalls of personal branding.


Cue in the most recent Disney drama surrounding the Snow White remake of its age-old classic. News outlets and vloggers across the continent are sharing clips of the actor hired to play Snow White positing that her off-putting demeanor, unlikeable behavior and questionable statements are damaging the movie's chances of box-office success. Here we've got an actor speaking her mind and freely expressing her opinions about the remake versus the original version, expressing her disdain for the original and feeling that she is doing her best to promote the remake. In her mind, she is likely simply sharing how wonderful the new version is going to be. Yet, as a result, Disney's executives are predicted to be having emergency meetings to damage control. A clear case of a personal brand gone rogue!Related: Why Investing in Reputation Management is Crucial for Your Business StrategySo, what can we learn from this? What policy can we draft as employers, or how can we make sure that our own personal brands are not blamed for the reputation crises of our employers?The simple answer is this: We cannot.


You see, unless we condone the cancellation of the First Amendment right and believe that people must be censored for the greater good of their employers, these situations will continue to occur. But here are some tips to try and reduce the probability of this happening to you:Hire for shared values and not only for skill: Assemble a team that resonates with your organization's ethos. Their alignment with your values is key to ensuring their personal brand doesn't diverge from your organizational identity. And when you are looking for a job, do the same: Look to join an organization that shares your values and will thus be likely to align with your actions and behaviors.Be crystal clear with your brand positioning and your point of view, both as a corporate brand and through your personal brand: A well-defined brand narrative serves as a guiding star. When employees' personal brands harmonize with your corporate identity, it's a win-win. At the core of any brand — corporate or personal — lies a very clearly defined point of view.Don't fight your employees' personal brand-building efforts, but rather invest in training them to do it right: Educate your team about the nuances of personal branding. With the right training, they can navigate the digital landscape adeptly, projecting their individuality while safeguarding your brand's reputation.Related: 7 Ways to Recover After a Reputation CrisisMost reputation crises occur because of a faux pas. These can be reduced, or perhaps even avoided entirely, through media training for your higher visibility employees and social media training for your whole team. Personal branding is here to stay and, as an employer, you can derive a multitude of benefits from having high-profile employees. They can help attract higher-caliber hires to your organization, as well as high-ticket clients. You should embrace your team members' visibility and derive the value but equip them to do it right and to avoid saying or doing something that can be damaging both to you and to them.Personal branding is experiencing a universal moment, and it is not something we can curb. Let's instead devise a strategy that will allow our employees' personal narratives to unfold in harmony with our organizations' tales, making for a story that captivates, rather than a subplot that becomes our demise.

90,Why You Shouldn't Let Your Own Personal Taste Drive Your Brand Design,"Aug 28, 2023",Taja Dockendorf,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-you-shouldnt-let-your-personal-taste-drive-your-brand/457868,"
Your brand is not your baby.Okay, it kind of is your baby — in how you nourish it, support it, invest in it and stick with it on both good and bad days. But what I mean is, you don't necessarily want to treat it like it's 50% of your DNA.While your company should be tied to your passion and dreams, the company brand doesn't have to be an exact extension of you. It doesn't need to (and sometimes really shouldn't) reflect your own style or your personal brand.



I get that you might want it to. And it might make sense for you. You can have a company brand that is a complete reflection of who you are — your ethos and mindset, your individual taste and who you are as a consumer — if and only if your research findings line up to reveal that your brand's target consumer is in fact you. But ... it might not.Often, you've got to make a choice. Do you want your brand to appeal to you or to the customers who are most likely to buy it? Do you want your product to belong in your shopping cart or in theirs? In other words, would you rather your brand be focused on your preferences or would you rather it be profitable by focusing on your core audience?


Related: How to Cultivate a Customer-Centric Approach to Brand BuildingFollow the researchIf you ultimately want it to be profitable, you've got to follow the research.Research is the essential first step in impactful branding; it helps you truly understand your customer, giving you a vital foundation to design from. Research might lead you to a brand that reflects your own tastes, or it might not. But with it, what you'll have is the groundwork for creative, effective magic.The importance of groundwork and preparation cannot be overstated. It's like what any five-star chef would tell you: You must start with the mise en place.


Mise en place is a French culinary phrase that means ""putting in place"" or ""gather."" Before making an amazing meal, you get everything together and ready. You julienne the carrots. You dice your tomatoes.With branding and brand design, your mise en place is doing thorough creative, consumer and strategic research, then organizing that information and agreeing on what elements (ingredients) to leverage.In the research stage, an agency should ask:Who is your consumer audience?What other brands are they buying?What does their lifestyle look like?What brands will be next to your product on the shelf?What area of the aisle will feature your product in a store?What are other brands who have invested heavily in the same space doing well?What consumer challenges are you solving?What makes your brand unique?Why should people care?And (sometimes most importantly) why do YOU as an owner care? What is your brand's reason for existing?Once these buckets of information are clearly defined, an agency or designer will then turn them into pieces of information that can be used in the creative process. They will outline and identify which elements can contribute to the brand's success.Related: 5 Key Questions to Ask Your Audience When Conducting Market ResearchHow to successfully navigate a consumer-centric brand designFrom here, the creatives, strategists, and client work together to agree on what key aspects to use in brand design to create a consumer-centric (not brand owner-centric) road map. As a brand owner, this can be exciting but unfamiliar territory. Here are some ways to navigate it strategically and successfully:


If you're working with an agency, realize that the multiple viewpoints they offer work to your benefit. Approach ideas with an open mind.Using the research-driven possible elements, see what resonates with you for your brand, keeping your audience in mind first.If you love elements that also align with the research, this part of the process should be easy. But maybe it's not that simple. For example, maybe your consumer loves pink — wears it, decorates the house with it and uses it in their Instagram stories — but you can't stand the color. Then you have to ask: Can you live with it anyway, if you know it will help your brand succeed and be profitable?When evaluating potential design concepts, be sure to take elements out of their silos and picture them within their natural home. For example, if your product is a frozen food product, don't just look at an image and react. Picture it in the freezer first. This is essential because what pops and speaks to a consumer in the frozen food aisle can look a little weird when considered out of context.Do consumer testing. There are many ways, including a number of online tools and consumer research companies, to get real-time, quick feedback. If you are unsure which design will perform best, spend the money to do the consumer testing and find out. And just to be clear, I'm not talking about surveying your friends, 20 investors, or your family members. That is not a good idea (even if they are designers). You need real consumers without a vested interest in your feelings giving you real, hard data. Sometimes the truth hurts, but it can also set you free.If you go through this process, know that while it is not always a straight line, you're on the path to creating an incredible, consumer-centric brand.And when your team presents their first ideas to you, keep in mind that these are the ones they've determined — through research and expertise — will have the highest impact. The process is definitely iterative and sometimes it takes a while to find the best option, but remember it's also a common experience for people to initially reject the first ideas just because they're too far from their own taste. But then find their way right back to those original concepts once they realize they want branding that drives profitability.This research-driven process builds a road map and foundation for branding that may or may not reflect your own creative preferences. But what it absolutely can do is help build a brand that grows and remains profitable — and has the impact on the world you intend it to. And for most of us, that's ultimately the most aligned and deeply desired outcome.

91,Why You Must Understand Visual Literacy to Help Your Brand Grow,"Aug 25, 2023",Christina Chara Ioannou,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-visual-literacy-can-help-your-brand-grow/457089,"
Our culture is based on visual imagery — even oversaturated with it. In the most general terms, your visual literacy is the ability to interact and understand visual communication — or, in other words, bits of information expressed in the form of images rather than written words and numbers. Colors, forms and shapes can also be parts of visual communication, expressing certain feelings or evoking associations.Over the centuries, symbols and concepts constructing visual culture and the means of interacting with it have changed drastically. A seventeenth-century Dutch still-life with fruit and flowers may look like a nice decoration today, but the audiences read it like an open book at its creation. They knew that some symbols — like lilies or fish — represented religious symbols and others, like a half-peeled lemon, expressed the high status of the painting's owner, celebrating their piety and abundance in their household. More complex and multilayered messages were coded into history paintings or portraits - sometimes up to a point when only a small amount of highly educated noblemen could decipher them.Related: How to Innovate Your Brand Through Visual Thinking



The present age has such symbols, too, although most are much more accessible to the public. Think of road signs or brand logos or icons on your smartphone: most of them were designed to be almost universally understandable. Yet, not all symbols mean the same in different cultures: for instance, white, often associated with mourning in China, would likely confuse a Western European funeral.Understanding symbols could help an entrepreneur construct a clear and successful image for your brand and product. So, how can visual literacy help an entrepreneur?


Formulate your messageA good product design can express much more than written text pages. Form, shape and color can formulate associations with the brand. References to Classical art are usually associated with stability, if not conservatism and work great for financial institutions, while a frivolous hot pink logo would rather help a lingerie brand.Pay attention to symbols and their migrating meanings and contexts, and avoid overcomplicating things. Remember that some images do not age well: the hand salute from Jacques-Louis David's Oath of the Horatii now evokes associations with Nazism and not Roman patriotism.Related: Before Spending Thousands on Custom Designs, Prioritize This to Elevate Your Brand InsteadAttract your customer's nicheJust like in the case of a Dutch still-life, you want your audience to understand and react to your message. If you are looking for customers who share your values and ideas, you must send them a personalized message! Think of your audience, their habits, hobbies, dreams, aspirations and expectations of your brand.


Remember your target audience's cultural and religious background to avoid misunderstandings — some symbols originating in Christian culture would not make sense for Muslim or Hindu customers.Related: How to Thrive in Niche MarketsRecognize trends and react to themSome brands choose to interact with the latest trends in their niche, while others prefer to keep in their lane and do what they do best. Both approaches are valid and understandable, yet recognizing and understanding trends and tendencies within your sector could be a life-saving tip.Instead of simply replicating the aesthetic of a trend, analyze it from the position of values.


Think of a trend like cottagecore: under its mass-marketed surface, it offered something more than just floral dresses; it offered a more sustainable lifestyle, closeness to nature and value of artisanal labor.Related: 5 Ways to Spot and Capitalize on TrendsHow to develop visual literacyVisual literacy is not a skill to learn overnight; unfortunately, it has no shortcuts. Watching and learning is the main strategy to develop your understanding of the visual culture around you. Yet, simply wandering through museums and scrolling through feeds will not help. You need to think, analyze and ask the right questions.Pay attention to the world around you. Although this advice sounds pretty obvious, most of us skim through the masses of visual information without a second thought. We are so used to interacting with images daily that we barely pay attention to how they work and make us feel. Think and ask questions. How does a particular design make you feel? Is it understandable? Do you feel the designer's intent to make it as it is, or is it a random combination?Go to art museums and galleries. Studying art history is your next fundamental step in developing your visual literacy. Once again, pay attention to your feelings, notice recurring symbols and compare contexts. Instead of turning away from a painting you genuinely hate, ask yourself what exactly provokes such a strong emotional response. Is it a personal association or a more or less universal thing? Every art movement had a philosophy and message behind it. Exploring art movements and their ideas could help you formulate your visual language so your customers can associate their needs and desires with your brand.Take breaks! Last but not least, give your brain a rest. In the age of social media, the ubiquity of images and meanings is suffocating and overbearing. To make sense of things and take them seriously, sometimes you have to physically stop the flow of visual information. Turn your attention away from the screen to a printed book, a homecooked meal, or nature — sometimes, it offers the best solutions.

92,How to Transform Your Business through Social Media Branding in 2023,"Aug 25, 2023",Jessica Wong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-transform-your-business-with-social-media-branding/456621,"
In less than two decades, social media has transformed how people communicate. Social media platforms have also dramatically altered how brands reach potential customers and build long-term relationships.Social media enabled brands to break down barriers and reach their audiences directly. As a consequence of making it easier for companies to reach audiences, more businesses are leveraging social media for growth. Effective social media branding can help companies stand out in busy marketplaces and strengthen their brand identity simultaneously.Social media platforms may have started as a way for individuals to connect. But as millions and now billions of people have joined them, they have also become powerful marketing tools. The latest statistics at the time of writing showed that more than four and a quarter billion people globally used social media at least once a month.



While that figure is impressive, the power of social media is not limited to user numbers. According to industry experts, nine out of ten people buy from brands they follow on social media platforms. There is no doubt about the strong connection between an engaging social media presence and conversions. Social media platforms are powerful tools to help build brands.Related: 5 Social Media Marketing Mistakes You Need to Avoid


Defining social media brandingSocial media branding combines the strengths of two cornerstone elements of successful marketing strategies — branding and social media marketing. To deliver transformative results for a business, social media branding strategies must do more than add a logo to a post.Brand teams must integrate the brand's unique value proposition with its look, voice and feel to craft memorable messages. Some of the most captivating social media branding is focused on encouraging interaction and engagement between a brand and its audiences.Using social media branding to build brand awareness and reachThrough social media platforms, brands have an unparalleled opportunity to extend their reach beyond their existing audiences. By developing captivating content, companies encourage their existing audiences, or followers, to share it with others. Without additional effort on the side of the business, the audience grows.Hashtags are another excellent way of reaching new audiences interested in a topic the brand is discussing. As non-followers pick up your company's content and share it, there is an opportunity for it to go viral and be seen by thousands or even millions of social media users who may otherwise never have known about your company.


Related: Why It's Smart to Focus on Strategic Growth Instead of Going ViralEstablishing brand identity and differentiation through social media brandingBuilding awareness and reach are only two components of successful social media branding. As social media use grows, more brands use these platforms for their marketing, and it is becoming increasingly more challenging to stand out from competitors.Social media branding allows companies to show their audiences what differentiates them from their competitors. Few other channels offer the same level of choice of communication, what to talk about and how to interact with their audience without a barrier. This is why social media platforms are such powerful tools for sharing value propositions and clarifying how brands are different.Engaging and connecting with target audiencesConnecting with audiences has been somewhat of a side note throughout this article. However, connecting and engaging directly with an audience is perhaps the greatest strength of social media channels.


This immediacy allows brands to listen to feedback from their audience, respond to it directly and build stronger relationships. At the same time, brands can show their personality more easily than on other channels. For example, Taco Bell's social media content and interactions have a distinct funny and sarcastic tone to them.But brands can also showcase their values to their customers as Starbucks does with its community-focused Facebook content. One of the keys to maximizing the impact of social media branding is consistency in both verbal and visual messaging to reinforce the brand's identity.Related: How to Make Social Media Marketing Effective for Your BrandLeveraging user-generated contentThe next step in building engagement is utilizing user-generated content. For example, by sharing a genuine product review, brands can highlight their unique value propositions through a third-party endorsement. User-generated content is a powerful tactic to build audience trust.


Influencing consumer perception and trustConsistent social media branding, especially user-generated content, consumer reviews and testimonials, can influence and change consumers' brand perception. Today, many consumers are skeptical of companies' statements in their marketing campaigns.Content that has been created by a product's or service's users automatically benefits from greater credibility and helps build trust between the brand and the audience. Brands can reinforce that trust by ensuring their messages resonate with users' content.Driving website traffic and conversionsAside from allowing brands and consumers to connect directly, another strength of social media platforms is driving website traffic and conversions.Social media posts are an excellent tool to introduce a topic and entice the audience to visit a website and learn more. Clear calls-to-action are imperative to encourage users to click on a link. Without them, it is too easy for content to get lost among competing messages.


Related: 5 Critical Website-Traffic Metrics You Should KnowMeasuring social media branding successWithout measuring the impact of different social media branding activities, brand teams cannot know which campaigns have been successful and which need refinement.Tracking critical metrics like views, reach and conversions is essential. To make analytics even more meaningful, companies can analyze the sentiment underlying reactions and adjust the effectiveness of their activity. Most social media platforms continue to develop more sophisticated metrics and tools to help brands in their journey.Social media branding combines the reach of social media platforms with the impact of carefully crafted brand messages. Together, these two can help companies build highly effective marketing campaigns. Increased brand awareness, brand trust and audience engagement all drive business growth for years to come.

94,5 Tactics to Ace LinkedIn Lead Generation,"Aug 23, 2023",Thomas Helfrich,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/a-5-step-guide-to-effectively-use-linkedin-to-find-sales/456823,"
Entrepreneurs are always on the hunt for effective lead-generation methods and ways to foster meaningful business relationships. One platform consistently rises to the challenge: LinkedIn. With its vast network of over 750 million professionals around the globe, LinkedIn has transformed networking for the digital era, providing an ecosystem that fosters professional interactions and opens the door to business opportunities.Recent research from HubSpot reveals that LinkedIn leads the pack when it comes to visitor-to-lead conversion rates, standing at a strong 2.74%. To put that in context, it's nearly triple the rates of Twitter (.69%) and Facebook (.77%).Moreover, LinkedIn asserts that a whopping 80% of B2B leads come from their platform. For B2B marketers, these aren't just numbers — they're a loud and clear message that LinkedIn is a must-have tool for business growth.



But the million-dollar question is, how can entrepreneurs optimize LinkedIn's potential for lead generation? Here's a comprehensive, five-step game plan to help you own LinkedIn's lead generation game.Related: How to Get High-Quality Leads From LinkedIn At No Cost


Deep dive into your audience's profileThe first step to effective lead generation is a deep understanding of your target audience. You need to know things like their age, job, what they're interested in, the problems they face, and what they hope to achieve. Knowing all this helps you create content they'll connect with, making them want to interact more with your brand.LinkedIn becomes a formidable tool for lead generation once you fully grasp your target audience — in fact, 40% of B2B marketers cite LinkedIn as the top channel for quality leads, with 89% using it for lead generation and 62% verifying its effectiveness.Additionally, the platform's cost per lead is 28% lower than Google AdWords, making it a more cost-effective option. In 2021, 35% of B2B marketers hailed LinkedIn as the top social media network, used by 97% of them for content marketing. These stats underscore LinkedIn's pivotal role in lead-generation strategies.Build an impressive LinkedIn profileConsider your LinkedIn profile your business's digital front porch — it's often the first stop for potential leads. It's crucial to have a complete, professional and brand-aligned profile. An engaging company description, up-to-date contact information and frequent high-value posts create a compelling profile that lures prospects.


Profiles that are fully completed on LinkedIn bag 30% more weekly views. So, it pays to fill out all the details, including logos, an overview and organizational information. This bolsters visibility as members can search using keywords.Businesses that follow this practice and stay active on their pages witness a significant boost in page views, impressions and clicks per follower — five times, seven times and 11 times, respectively. Additionally, businesses posting weekly on LinkedIn experience a two times higher engagement rate.Related: How Your Brand Can Capitalize on LinkedIn's New 'Lead Gen' OpportunitiesHarness LinkedIn's advertising muscleTaking full advantage of LinkedIn's advertising capabilities can considerably amplify your brand's visibility and conversion rates.

Marketers on LinkedIn also report up to double the conversion rate, further proving LinkedIn's effectiveness as a marketing tool.

Joining relevant group discussions, sharing valuable content and building relationships are integral to your LinkedIn lead generation strategy. Consistent, thoughtful engagement broadens your network and cements your reputation as a trusted industry resource.To ramp up engagement, consider the following tactics:


Start a conversation: Ask questions to your audience. This encourages folks to share their thoughts and contribute to the discussion, turning your post into a lively conversation hub.Stir up debate: Occasionally, being provocative can lead to more comments and interactions. However, strive for balance to avoid alienating your audience while encouraging dialogue.Forge connections: Craft posts that feel personal or relatable. Sharing stories or experiences that resonate with your audience motivates them to engage more readily.Stay current: Posting about timely events or trends that matter to your audience helps grab their attention and encourages them to comment, ensuring your content stays fresh and relevant.Implementing these tactics can significantly increase comments on your LinkedIn posts and foster greater engagement with your content, boosting your lead-generation efforts on the platform.Related: 6 Ways to Build Rock-Solid Business Relationships on LinkedInContinually measure and refine your strategyTake advantage of LinkedIn's comprehensive analytics tools to check how well your efforts to attract potential customers are working.

Maximizing LinkedIn involves understanding its features, crafting a rounded profile, forging meaningful connections and continually adjusting your strategy based on insightful metrics. It's not just about scoring a higher number of leads — it's about bagging high-quality leads that turn into fruitful business relationships.LinkedIn's potential is as boundless as the number of professionals using its platform, and as an entrepreneur, it's a treasure trove of opportunities you've got to explore.

95,How to Lower the Risks to Your Brand Reputation (and Build an Image that Wins New Business),"Aug 22, 2023",Adam Petrilli,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-lower-the-risks-to-your-brand-reputation-and-build/457049,"
There's little doubt about what brand reputation means to your business and your bottom line. In fact, how people size up your image and, ultimately, connect with your brand, whether online or in-person, is more important than ever.It often takes years to build an image that engenders trust and cultivates customer loyalty. Yet, all the work you put into that effort can be shattered in a moment, many times due to unforeseen events, missteps or even things out of your control.As an entrepreneur or business owner, safeguarding your company's reputation is critical for what happens tomorrow and next week and for long-term sustainability and success. And tackling reputational threats typically means taking a proactive approach, lowering the risks to your brand's reputation through planning, careful strategy execution, deep research and understanding of your audience and market.



Below, I walk you through a few practical strategies to protect and enhance your brand's reputation while maintaining the razor-sharp competitive edge you need to stand out in our fast-paced (sometimes perilous) business environment.Related: The Relationship Between Reputation and Brand


Make customer satisfaction your top priorityWhether selling cars or delivering meals, customer satisfaction is always at the heart of a strong and compelling brand reputation. That may seem obvious, but in today's online-driven, review-happy environment, customers have more power than ever to share their experiences and generate conversations (good or bad) about your company. Keeping those discussions on the positive side starts by prioritizing exceptional products and personalized services that strive to exceed customer expectations.Building a customer-first approach involves several factors, including actively seeking feedback and listening to customer concerns. It's also centered on addressing issues promptly and apologetically and providing satisfactory resolutions. Remember: happy customers are more likely to become brand advocates on the web, spreading positive word-of-mouth and contributing to your brand's positive reputation. Pursuing a top-notch customer experience model is one of the best ways to generate that praise and cultivate trust online.Related: 7 Powerful Ways to Improve Your Brand Reputation and RecognitionKeep it transparentTransparency builds trust with those your business relies on to thrive. Taking a transparent approach means being open and honest with customers, employees, stakeholders and the public.


If mistakes or crises happen, it's generally best to acknowledge them and take responsibility (if needed) as quickly as possible. Concealing or downplaying problems can lead to PR nightmares that often do even more reputational damage down the road.Instead, aim for transparency whenever possessive, and leverage that approach as an opportunity to showcase your commitment to integrity and accountability.Monitor online presence and respond to feedback quicklyIn our hyper-digital age, your business reputation can be influenced, swayed or even destroyed by what's said online. Monitoring your online presence, including social media, review sites and forums, is essential for knowing what's being said about your brand on the web and staying ahead of negativity and optimizing your crisis mitigation strategy. Responding proactively to customer feedback, both positive and negative, is also a must. Engaging with customers online shows that you value their opinions and are dedicated to providing a positive experience.Create (and execute) a crisis communication planNo matter how well-prepared your team is, online crises can attack anytime. Having a crisis communication plan in place allows you to keep things in perspective and take control of the situation before it snowballs into a major brand disaster.


An effective crisis plan provides the chance to identify potential risks and scenarios that could harm your brand's reputation and develop a clear protocol for responding to problems. A well-executed crisis communication strategy allows you to mitigate the impact of an adverse event while preserving your credibility with customers.Foster a positive company cultureYour business reputation extends beyond just your products and services; it includes your company culture and how employees perceive and connect with your brand. Cultivating a positive and inclusive work environment that values employee well-being and professional growth is critical to strengthening your image among those you depend on and earning positive, reputation-enhancing ratings on popular employee sites like Glassdoor.A satisfied and engaged workforce is more likely to advocate for your business and convey positive company sentiment that resonates with customers and the public.Engage in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)Incorporating CSR initiatives into your business strategy demonstrates your brand's commitment to social and environmental causes. Engaging in meaningful CSR activities benefits society and strengthens your reputation as a responsible and compassionate organization. It also shows many stakeholders (customers, employees, etc.) that you share their values and have a sincere, proactive investment in building a safe and healthy community.

Here are the highlights of that conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity.On the 75th Anniversary Edition selling out in minutes""We believe this is the best electric piano ever made. And when we launched, we sold out all 75 instruments in 25 minutes, so that was really reaffirming. This is not a cheap instrument and so it was a testament to its quality and its regard in the music world.""


On the birth of Rhodes""During WWII, Harold Rhodes was in the US Army Air Corps. He played piano and gave lessons to wounded servicemen as a form of therapy, and he had the idea to make a small portable piano that people could use in their hospital beds. So using scrap aluminum tubing from B-17 bombers, he created something called a 'Xylette' which was a 29-note xylophone-like instrument. It became known as the Army Air Corps Lap Piano and over 100,000 were made. It was the seed of the first electronic piano. Harold later hooked up with Leo Fender (who made Fender guitars) and that's when Rhodes really took off in popular music. It was used in rock, pop, soul and jazz. Miles Davis would always insist on a Rhodes rather than a traditional piano as part of his progressive jazz fusion sound.""Related: This Legendary Music Retailer Made Millions Online. So Why Did They Open a Studio?On making Rhodes accessible to all musicians""Musicians aren't always the most well-endowed financially. So we've released a software version of the MK8, which is very detailed and a very accurate representation of the hardware. Albeit it's not that beautiful piece of furniture and you haven't got that tactile feel that you have with the real thing, but it's been going down really well with music makers. There may have been some initial criticism about whether the Rhodes brand is synonymous with anything like digital software, but we really wanted to make the brand more accessible to a wider portfolio of people.""Related: The Beatles Will Release a 'Final Record' Made With AI, Paul McCartney Says


On the balance of innovation and tradition""We knew we had to prove ourselves as worthy guardians of the brand, so we knew we had to build the best Rhodes piano ever. That really took us three years, but that always had to be job number one. The digital software spinoff I just described is the first step for us to pivot into being able to connect with a new generation of music makers. Because if we only look to tick the box with those who are already familiar with Rhodes, the customer base will dry out pretty quickly. So we are moving slowly and carefully to diversify from the core — which currently is people who understand us as Rhodes keyboards — and expand. Our website is RhodesMusic.com for a reason. We want to move the goalpost wider and bring more accessible products to a wider audience.""

97,How to Master the Art of Brand Messaging With Clear and Consistent Communication,"Aug 22, 2023",Jessica Wong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-master-the-art-of-brand-messaging-with-clear-and/456620,"
Pick up any guide to brand messaging, digital or analog, small-business-focused or addressed to multinational conglomerates, and you can be sure to find reminders to be consistent. Consistency and clarity are the keys to effective brand messaging,But is brand messaging an art, a craft or a science? And how can brand teams create messages that stand out from the competition and stand the test of time? Answering these questions and developing outstanding brand messages helps shape public perception, expand a brand's target audience and drive business success.Related: Why Consistency Is Vital to Your Branding Efforts



Understanding brand messagingBrand messaging refers to how your brand speaks to its audiences. Including verbal and nonverbal elements, effective brand messaging conveys a unique value proposition and your brand personality. It ties language, visual features and design elements together with the company's products and services. Together, they form the basis of consistent communications that your audience can relate to.To develop effective brand messaging, your brand team needs to be clear about the brand's identity and target audiences.


1. Identifying Target Audience and Brand Persona. Except for very few brands — Coca-Cola comes to mind — rarely any business markets to everyone. Most leading brands, including those with a global audience, target specific population segments.Before considering brand messages, define your target audiences. Start by listing demographics such as your audience's gender, age, geographic location and disposable income. Demographics alone may give you enough information to split your audience into different audiences.Next, think about your audiences' needs, pain points and preferences, and ask yourself how your brand can address those. Dove's long-running 'Campaign for Real Beauty' is an excellent example of this. The campaign made it clear that it wanted to break down unrealistic beauty standards and reach women who felt they were not represented by brands touting unreachable ideals. The campaign has a wide audience, which is not unusual for this consumer brand.Narrowing down your target audience to some degree is the first step toward brand messaging. Defining a brand persona will help sharpen potential brand messages further. A brand persona is not unlike your brand identity. It humanizes your company and makes your brand relatable by allowing potential customers to think of the brand as if it were a person. Integrating your brand story into your brand persona is another powerful tactic to make your business more relatable.


2. Defining Brand Positioning, Tone and Voice. Moving from audiences and personas back to your brand, think about what sets your brand apart from its competitors. Does your business occupy a certain niche within your market, for example? If yes, your messaging needs to align with that market position to differentiate yourself from other brands in the same space or with similar offerings. Spending time analyzing your brand position helps clarify the unique value propositions your brand team wants to communicate in your brand messages.Brand tone and voice address how you want to communicate your brand messages. Older audiences will respond better to a more mature tone, whereas younger audiences will likely find it easier to engage with more casual messaging. If you want to speak to a specific niche audience, you may even consider using jargon with which the audience can identify. The most important thing is that your tone and voice align with your brand persona and values.Related: Why Your Brand Plan Is More Important Than Your Business PlanDeveloping key messagesBy now, your brand team should have written documents detailing your audience(s), brand persona(s) and the tone and voice you want to use to reach potential customers. It is time to distill this information into key messages at this stage.


Writing key messages tends to take time and requires several iterations. Ask yourself how those messages tie into the brand's unique value propositions. Do not be afraid to shorten and refine those messages.Some of the best brand messages are very short. Nike's 'Just Do It' is one of the best-known examples of this approach. Despite its simplicity, the message communicates an athlete's commitment to training harder, getting better and eventually becoming great.Related: 5 Easy Exercises to Find Your Brand's VoiceApplying key messages internally and externallyApplying key messages effectively starts internally. Think of your team as brand ambassadors. These are the first people to help spread your brand messaging widely and authentically. Avoid assuming that your entire team understands your brand messages intrinsically and instead plan training or familiarization sessions to ensure every department and every team member understands the importance of consistent communications.


Speaking of consistency, your brand messages must be aligned across all communication channels. Even if someone has never engaged with your brand on a particular channel, they should be able to recognize the business.Dove is a good example of this. Across its website, social media and other channels, the brand uses real women rather than models to highlight its products, making them instantly recognizable.Related: How Social Media Can Build Trust and Engagement Within Your CommunityTesting and measuring the impact of key messagesBefore settling on final key messages, consider A/B testing variants of your messages with your audiences to gather data on which option will likely be more impactful.


Once your brand messages are being distributed across your digital marketing and communications channels, start measuring their impact. Different digital channels allow brands to evaluate a variety of key metrics. Starting with likes and comments, you may also want to analyze the underlying sentiment of the engagement you receive and whether your messaging has the desired impact on audience perception.Effective brand messaging combines elements of being an art, a craft and a science. Measuring effectiveness involves science. Messages and identities are crafted, but there is an art to that. The most powerful brand messages create strong bonds with your audiences and help your brand grow for years to come.

98,While Building a Personal Brand Might Be More Accessible — It's More Complex Now Than Ever. Here Are 6 Strategies You Need To Ensure You Stand Out.,"Aug 21, 2023",Gideon Kimbrell,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/6-strategies-you-need-to-ensure-your-personal-brand-stands/454122,"
Why is Panera Bread on TikTok? Social media makes it easy for consumers to feel connected to the companies they love most. This means the idea of a faceless business is likely on the path to becoming obsolete. Panera understands something more people are beginning to realize: The increased importance of personal branding in modern marketing.Personal branding has been a significant part of many marketing efforts for years now — ever since Facebook hit it big. However, personal branding has evolved along with the way we interact on the internet. As an entrepreneur who's worked hard to build his own personal brand, I've experienced this evolution firsthand.One of the biggest changes over the past decade is that personal branding is no longer reserved only for celebrities and household names. Nowadays, if you have access to the internet and a drive to get your name out, you can have a personal brand, which is perfect for intrepid entrepreneurs.



Related: 8 Reasons a Powerful Personal Brand Will Make You SuccessfulSEO is also no longer the end-all, be-all of marketing. Suppose you're trying to build a brand around entertainment and multimedia, for example. Social media platforms such as Instagram, Discord, TikTok and Twitter have proven more effective for growing and keeping engaged followers. In other words, while building a successful personal brand is more accessible, it's also more complex. It requires the right tools for the job and a more, well, personal approach.


Personal branding in actionTo better understand what successful personal branding looks like in the entrepreneurial space, let's look at two notable examples.Gary Vaynerchuk is one of the first names that come to mind when people think about entrepreneurs who have turned themselves into successful brands. Nearly every entrepreneur knows his name, but not because of specific business dealings. In fact, many would be hard-pressed to name what businesses he's involved with. His personal brand trumps everything else.Vaynerchuk's blunt style has captured people's attention and provided him with a level of authenticity that's hard to replicate. But this approach can also be a turnoff. His brand is a good reminder that what works for one person won't necessarily work for you.Simon Sinek is a good example of a different approach to the same strategy. He's an entrepreneur who focuses on creating unique and inspiring content that informs and entertains people. His content comes in a variety of different forms, including podcasts, talks, articles and videos.


Related: 6 Tips for Successfully Communicating Your Personal BrandRather than build a personal brand based on his personality, Sinek has chosen to base it on his content. Through the study of human behavior and psychology, Sinek seeks to help other entrepreneurs improve while concurrently amplifying his reputation as an expert in the field.It's important to understand that one approach is not necessarily better. But what does leaning into your unique self look like from a branding perspective? In a world where more and more people are crafting their own personal brands, how can you harness the power of your personality to stand out? Let's look at six ways to do just that.How to build a personal brand that stands out from the crowdThe truth is that most people start building their personal brands long before they realize that's what they're doing. Just the act of creating a LinkedIn profile is the beginning of creating a brand. That's where I started. Only around the time I was launching my first startup and meeting with potential investors did I realize just how important a strong personal brand was.


So, I began in earnest to become more proactive in my branding. I worked to become a thought leader, which has helped me grow my success. Along the way, I learned some important lessons that I believe anyone can apply to their own approach to personal branding.1. Settle on a consistent voice that showcases your passionFeel free to play around with what your brand looks like before choosing a specific direction. But once you make that choice, own it. Decide what topics to position yourself as an authority on and ensure you're passionate about them. This will let the authenticity flow naturally.It's easy when you start building your personal brand to jump on the bandwagon of trendy topics — artificial intelligence (AI), I'm looking at you — but doing so is a mistake. Focus on what you can add to the conversation, not on joining the conversation.2. Be actionableI've learned that actionable stories and advice perform the best. Everyone has an opinion, but if you share steps that achieve a result, you'll have a better shot at getting noticed. One example of this is HubSpot. Hubspot offers service solutions for marketing, sales, content management and more. It offers free courses related to its services as part of its marketing strategy so that potential customers are better educated about the industry. This initiative has given HubSpot a lot of favorable brand awareness, and its courses have even become a part of some companies' internal training curricula.

Involve yourself with groups of other thought leadersI've learned that what I share touches some people deeper than expected. But to create things that touch people, I had to find people who could speak to me in the same way. Having great mentors or even just great people around you who are passionate about the same things will help inspire the content you create.4. Don't be on a social media platform just to be thereWhen social media became mainstream, the trend was creating a profile on every possible platform, even if you didn't find any value in it. While building your personal brand across various channels can help you extend your reach, without a reason to be there, you're just generating. If you choose to be on a platform, ensure you can deliver content that matches its intended use.Related: Want More Clients? Focus On Your Personal Brand


5. Find the timeAs an entrepreneur, it can be difficult to fit another thing into your daily schedule. But you have to force yourself to make the time. One trick I use is maintaining an ongoing thought sheet that I add to throughout the month. These are thoughts I have that I may want to write about.6. Track your reachIf you don't measure your reach, you won't know what's resonating and what isn't. A wide variety of tools are available to track your readership levels on what you author; make sure to take advantage of them. When tracking your reach, pay close attention to where audience overlap occurs. Avoiding this will help you reach a broader audience.The scope of branding has transcended the corporate realm. We are entering a digital age where everything you post online mirrors your identity. Take advantage of the digital tools within your reach to tell a cohesive story about who you are, what you stand for, and why you do what you do. More and more consumers are looking for brands and personalities they resonate with — why not let that be you?

This story originally appeared on Under30CEO.comIn the business world, having a consistent brand identity can set your enterprise apart from the competition. However, many companies grapple with a chaotic brand image that leaves customers unsure of their core identity.By finally injecting your brand with some consistency at a planning level, you can finally give yourself an advantage that's difficult for other competitors to match.



Why consistency mattersEveryone wants to talk about the ""sexy"" parts of branding – logo design, taglines, and color schemes. But flashy marketing doesn't provide much value without consistency.Brand consistency, which is essentially the degree to which your brand is what it says it is at all times, is vital for a number of reasons. Here are a few:


1. Recognition — For starters, a consistent brand is much more recognizable than one that makes things up as it goes. While you might not ever have the widespread recognizability of a Coca-Cola or Google, your commitment to brand consistency can give you recognition within your corner of the market. The more people see the same logos, colors, and messaging, the more they feel like they know your brand.Related: Why Problems Are More Powerful Than Products2. Credibility — A consistent brand helps build trust with your customers. If your brand delivers the same message and values across all touchpoints, it comes across as reliable and credible. On the contrary, inconsistent branding can lead to confusion and distrust.Related: Nearly 3 out of 4 Marketing Professionals Use AI to Create Content, New Study Shows


3. Efficiency — Don't underestimate the efficiency that consistency breeds. When you have defined guidelines of what to follow, it requires less time and effort to create new content or brand assets. Everything is in one place and is easy to find.There are plenty of other benefits – including customer loyalty, professionalism, and carving out a competitive advantage over less organized and consistent competitors – but these three should be enough to convince you to get better at improving your consistency.Practical ways to give your brand some consistencyThe need for consistency is clear. The question is, what do you do with it? Here are several practical ways to begin giving your branding a little more consistency as you push toward a competitive advantage in this area.1. Take inventory — The foundation of a strong, consistent brand lies in clearly defining your mission and vision. Your mission statement is a brief description of your business's purpose and the value it brings to customers, while your vision statement is a forward-looking declaration of what you aim to achieve in the future. Ensuring that these two elements align not only provides a roadmap for your business strategy but also gives your brand a solid identity around which you can build a consistent brand image.


2. Establish a visual identity — Your brand identity runs deep. However, the surface-level stuff matters more than most brands realize. For example, your color palette should reflect your brand's personality. Colors evoke emotions and associations, so you don't want to mess this up. Blue gives off vibes of rust and reliability. Green is associated with sustainability and nature. Red is used for passion or urgency. Do your colors align with your identity?Related: Don't Do These 3 Things on LinkedIn. Recruiters Will 'Spot Them From a Mile Off.'3. Get clear on your voice —Treat your brand like a person. Think about its voice – and don't deviate from that voice. To find and define your brand voice, consider your brand's personality, mission, and target audience. Are you formal or casual? Serious or playful? Irreverent or respectful? Your answers to these questions will shape your brand voice. It's important to keep this voice consistent in all communication to maintain a cohesive brand image.4. Develop brand guidelines — Once you've taken some time to understand your brand and get clear on some of the key components, you'll want to consolidate all of this information into a single document. We call these brand guidelines. To create your own set, start by outlining your mission, vision, and unique value proposition. Then, detail your visual identity, including your logo usage, color palette, typography, and imagery. Next, define your brand voice and provide examples of how it should be used across various platforms. Finally, consider including a section on what not to do to prevent misinterpretation.


Is this a comprehensive look at what it takes to develop a consistent brand? Absolutely not. But it is a great launching pad to help you build some momentum in the right direction. From here, you can further flesh out the details.Putting It all togetherGiving your brand some consistency takes work. It's not something you can do overnight and forget about. It requires a steady, long-term commitment to get right. However, if you implement some of the tips outlined above, you'll have a massive head start. Good luck!

102,How to Get Your Brand Featured in Any Publication,"Aug 8, 2023",Jackson Cunningham,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/3-steps-to-get-your-brand-featured-in-any-publication/456844,"
For any entrepreneur, establishing a strong presence in the media is crucial for brand growth and success. Getting featured in prominent publications helps create buzz around your brand and can significantly boost your company's visibility, credibility and customer base. However, securing media coverage is not an overnight process; it requires a well-planned, long-term strategy focused on building meaningful relationships with writers and editors. I've followed this process while building my DTC cat brand tuft + paw, and it's paid serious dividends.Related: 5 Ways to Get Media Coverage for Your BrandThe importance of PR for brand growthPublic relations plays a pivotal role in shaping your brand's image and expanding its reach. A well-crafted media presence can elevate your business above competitors, attracting new customers and potential investors. It is essential to view PR as an ongoing investment in your company's future rather than a one-time promotional tactic.



Building long-term relationships with writers and editorsRather than adopting a hit-and-run approach to media coverage, focus on building lasting relationships with journalists, bloggers and editors. Once you have a good rapport going, engage with them on social media, share their articles, and provide valuable feedback. Show genuine interest in their work, and avoid bombarding them with self-promotional messages. Remember, successful PR is symbiotic — it's about collaboration, not just seeking one-sided benefits.Step 1: Create a master contact sheetOrganize your media contacts by creating a master sheet that includes information such as names, emails, publication affiliations and notes on previous interactions. Keep track of who you've already contacted, and identify the high-priority contacts. This will help you stay organized and maintain a personalized approach when reaching out to writers and editors.


Step 2: Monitor competitor coverageStay informed about your competitors' media coverage using tools like Ahrefs. Set up alerts to be notified whenever a competitor receives a link from a notable website. This provides valuable intel on which publications and writers are willing to create content about your industry/niche and gives you a starting point for your PR outreach. Over time, you'll also develop a sense for your competitor's PR strategies, which is valuable in its own right.Related: 5 Ways to Build and Maintain Valuable Relationships With JournalistsStep 3: Reach out to authors and editors directlyWhen a publication features your competitors, seize the opportunity to reach out to the authors or editors directly. Use tools like Rocket Reach to find their contact information through LinkedIn. Here's where the actual relationship building starts. Craft a concise and genuine email introducing yourself, your business and your desire for coverage. Offer free products with no strings attached to pique their interest and encourage engagement.Remember, writers and editors are inundated with free products, and their job is to determine which ones are worth their time. If you have a good product that stands out from the competition, they will be inclined to review it or include it in their content.


Step 4: Keep your email short and meaningfulWhen contacting writers and editors, keep your email short and to the point. Avoid lengthy pitches, and focus on building a connection instead. A simple and genuine message can go a long way in forging a lasting relationship. Here's an example:Hi X, I'm Jackson. I run a DTC cat brand and I'm looking for coverage from good writers/editors. Can I send you a free product no strings?In two sentences, I'm letting them know who I am, the purpose of this email and what I can offer them. Instead of spending time on compliments, I simply ask for coverage from ""good writers/editors,"" which expresses my admiration for their work.The ""no strings attached"" inclusion is a crucial aspect of this strategy. Don't go in expecting something right away. As a stranger, it's best to do them a favor first, let the product do the talking and see where it leads.


Related: How to Build Strong Relationships With the Media (and Why It's Vital to Your Success)The goal: Building lasting relationshipsUnderstand that immediate media coverage might not be achieved through initial outreach. The primary goal is to build rapport and trust with writers and editors. If your product resonates with them, they might cover your brand in the future or even recommend you to their colleagues. Focus on creating a lasting bond, as this can lead to more significant opportunities down the road.Securing media coverage for your brand is a powerful way to elevate its reputation and attract new customers. However, successful long-term PR is not about seeking quick coverage but rather building strong, lasting relationships with writers and editors. By following the steps laid out here and employing a well-planned approach, creating a master contact sheet, monitoring competitor coverage and crafting meaningful outreach emails, you can increase your chances of getting featured in any publication.Plugging away at this manual PR work over months and years will create a snowball effect that can lead to even greater rewards. Remember, genuine connections and mutual benefits form the foundation of fruitful PR endeavors that pay off in the long run.

103,The Consumer Playbook for Today's Leading Brands: What It Truly Means to Be 'Consumer-First',"Aug 8, 2023",Kate Cronin,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/what-it-means-for-brands-to-truly-be-consumer-first/455396,"
Terms like ""user-friendly,"" ""consumer-first"" and ""customer-centric"" have become buzzwords across industries in recent years. From pharma to fashion, today's great brand leaders all understand that taking an audience-first approach to developing and selling products and services is critical to their company's success. Consumers are becoming savvier when it comes to selecting the items they need in both their personal and professional lives; they are not only carefully vetting specific products and services, but also the brands behind them.Despite all this, I've observed that the bridge between consumer-first rhetoric and action is still not always as strong as it needs to be to sustain long-term brand loyalty. With that in mind, I'm sharing three tips from my company's ""consumer playbook"" that I believe can benefit all brand leaders. While the industry I'm in — life sciences — is obviously quite a different business model than retail, for example, lessons learned from our industry are still applicable to others. In fact, due to all of the rules and regulations governing health care, we arguably have to work even harder than other sectors to create meaningful connections with consumers.Throughout this piece, I'll use the biopharmaceutical sector — which is ripe for disruption and in need of new and innovative ways to connect with consumers — as a case study from which leaders in other industries can draw. Biopharma is a great example, because while we're very lucky to have robust drug development in the U.S., drug makers themselves have historically had a fairly negative reputation among Americans — that is, if they're on consumers' minds at all.



Related: How Entrepreneurs Can Establish a Successful Customer-First StrategyThe pandemic effectAs happened in so many industries, Covid-19 fundamentally changed the way consumers view biopharmaceutical manufacturers. For the first time, people started thinking about the brands that develop the medicines they take. Those receiving a Covid-19 vaccine asked one another, ""Moderna or Pfizer?"" For people who couldn't see their loved ones, go to the grocery store or return to work, getting vaccinated represented getting back to life. For many of them, this experience also created instantaneous brand loyalty with vaccine makers.


This scenario isn't unique to biopharmaceuticals. Many brands across industries innovated to add value and comfort to consumers' lives during a time characterized by fear and isolation. By adapting offerings or creating totally new products and services to meet the specific needs of this unprecedented period (think of how grateful we are for the services provided by companies like Uber Eats and Doordash, FedEx and UPS, and Amazon and Zoom), they too were rewarded with exceptional brand loyalty.The question today then becomes, ""How do you bottle that brand loyalty into an ongoing consumer experience and sustain a relationship post-Covid?""Tip #1: Respect your customer's ongoing appetite for information and provide transparency about how your products and services are createdThis means communicating updates, optimizations and improvements in our foundational technologies so that consumers understand the potential value and safety profile of the medicines we are making — and not just for fighting Covid-19, but for preventing and treating a number of other conditions. When Moderna's mRNA technology is used to develop a new vaccine, that's like an updated product release. We can expect improvements for each vaccine as we optimize our whole platform, and we need to communicate to our customers just as Apple would with an iPhone update.This heightened demand for transparency is true across industries. A recent Nielsen report around food transparency found two-thirds of shoppers (64%) say they would switch from a brand they usually buy to another brand that provides more in-depth product information, beyond nutrition facts. Consumers today want to know exactly where their products and services are coming from and how they are made.


Tip #2: Go deeper than market researchConsumers today have a heightened awareness of what they're putting in their bodies as well as a desire to understand — and approve of — how these products are made. We bring consumers along to understand how mRNA teaches the body to fight and prevent diseases. This is similar to an operating system with updated ""apps"" or in the case of mRNA, new therapeutics and vaccines.To better leverage market research, we cannot start with assumptions. We need to find nuance in what consumers want, especially when it comes to areas of innovative technology that fundamentally change how consumers interact with a product or brand. Artificial intelligence applications across industries, for example, need to be broached carefully on a case-by-case basis and surrounded by clear communications. Ensuring your brand is going beyond general market research results to understand specific, unique circumstances will be critical in the coming months.Related: Want Your Business to Succeed? Use These Tips to Understand Your CustomerTip #3: Look at reputation not as a reservoir of goodwill, but as a river of growing loyaltyHistorically biopharmaceutical companies treated reputation as a buffer for tough times or bad news. Instead, we need to bolster loyalty around a pipeline of products, like Nike, for example. We can do this by creating brand experiences outside of products that help consumers learn about the company's mission and values. Athleta, a popular women's athleisure brand, continues to tap strong female athletes as brand ambassadors, recently forming ""the Power of She Collective,"" which has a mission to empower women and girls — their core consumer audience.


My team is leaning into, not out of, the halo effect of our enterprise brand and continuing to grow it through interconnected consumer experiences beyond any one product or milestone. I urge other brand leaders and entrepreneurial innovators to do the same, as we can all benefit from doing the work it takes to build mutual trust, earn loyalty and create more ""get back to life"" moments for the consumers we serve.

""I don't need a personal branding agency. My marketing team will work on my personal brand.""I have heard this statement from so many CEOs, that it is time to share my thoughts. At the risk of hurting feelings, please allow me to be blunt:Your marketing team is unlikely to be qualified to work on your personal brand.



Marketing vs. brandingYou see, I understand where the confusion comes from. Marketing and branding have been conflated for ages. As CEOs, we often misunderstand branding when it comes to the companies we lead. So, of course, with personal branding being a new kid on the branding block, it is misunderstood even further.Let's unpack some of the differences, looking at what your marketing team can be leveraged for as you build your visibility and where their gaps lie.


Your marketing team is likely to be instrumental in helping you market your brand: assist with PR, create content you can use to promote your personal brand, help you launch a podcast, book you as a guest on other people's podcasts and secure speaking opportunities. Yet, what they are unlikely to be of support with is uncovering what your radically authentic brand is all about:Your brand essence — the positioning that is at the core of your brand, which is tied to who you are as a human being on a deep level rather than what you do as the leader of your organizationYour brand descriptors — how you want to be perceived by your audienceYour target audience beyond what serves the business, one that is distinct from the transactional needs of the businessYour content pillars that surpass your industry expertiseRelated: 8 Reasons a Powerful Personal Brand Will Make You SuccessfulWell, you might ask, but why do I need to have positioning beyond the business? Why should I have an audience outside of my customer avatar, and why should I talk about anything else than what directly relates to the business? The answer is: You don't! That is, unless you want to build an actual personal brand, rather than be a spokesperson for the business.Why build a personal brand in the first place if it does not fully serve the business, you ask? Let me answer that question with some of my own. Is your identity completely fully tied to the organization you run? Or is your identity bigger than that? Can we reduce your entire essence to your identity as owner of ABC Inc.? The answer is likely ""no."" And guess what? Your audience does not need a replica of your company's corporate social media page. If everything you post or share can happily live on your business pages, then what value is there in that messaging coming from you?


Corporate branding is the topic of much confusion also. We know that a brand is the essence of our organization, and uncovering it cannot — and should not — be reduced to something tactical, such as the creation of the logo. We know that working on our corporate brand is not a task we would delegate to our Marketing Specialist. So, why then would we make that faux pas when it comes to our personal brand?Now, let's address another elephant in the room.One of the most frequent questions I receive when I give my keynote on personal branding to audiences across the globe is this:Marina, but what happens if I build a personal brand and then make my business so tied to myself that it becomes hard to exit as a result? 


A great question. We tend to call our businesses our babies. And yet we sell these babies. Or sometimes we bankrupt them. And what happens then? You see, it is indeed hard to sell a business for which you have become a spokesperson. That's what our marketing teams would love for us. And yet, the buyers of our businesses wouldn't. Not only is it harder to exit a business like that, but we also end up with no personal brand that serves us as we pivot.Related: 5 Steps to Building Your Personal Brand From ScratchPersonal branding done rightA personal brand created right does not make you appear to be ""tied to the business."" Quite the contrary — it makes it clear to the audience that the business is one of the many facets of who you are and what you are. And yes, when done right, your personal brand helps you attract high-value clients and helps you attract talent of a much higher caliber to the organization. At the same time, however, it builds your portability, making your business more exitable and making you less irrelevant when you do sell it.Your marketing team can bring tremendous value to your personal brand-building process, but you also need to be aware of the limitations of their expertise. They can most certainly help position you as a spokesperson for your organization. They can also help you with execution once the strategy is built. Yet, if you are looking to build an actual personal brand that has portability and extends beyond the business, let's leave it to the pros: those who eat, live and breathe radically authentic personal branding.

106,Beyond Logos and Colors — How to Create a Compelling Brand Identity,"Aug 4, 2023",Danielle Sabrina,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-create-a-compelling-brand-identity/456707,"
The world we live in today is constantly evolving, so having a recognizable brand identity is important. Creating a strong brand identity is essential for standing out from the crowd, building customer loyalty and driving business success in today's extremely competitive business landscape. A well-crafted brand identity goes way beyond an eye-catching logo and color palette; it encompasses the core values, personality and purpose of a brand. Let's discuss the key elements of a strong brand identity and effective strategies for building one that resonates with your consumers and develops lasting relationships.Related: 5 Tips for Building a Strong Brand IdentityHow do you define brand identity?To put it simply, brand identity is the visual, verbal and emotional representation of a brand. It encompasses everything that distinguishes a brand from its competitors, including its name, logo, messaging and the overall experience it delivers to consumers. In order to build a successful brand identity, you need to make sure you have a deep understanding of the brand's purpose, target audience and the emotions it aims to evoke.



While brand identity is the intentional representation created by the brand, the brand image is how consumers will perceive and interpret that identity. The brand identity sets the stage, while the brand image reflects how well the audience connects with the brand's identity. A strong brand identity is crucial for influencing a positive brand image. Having a positive brand image can lead to brand loyalty and advocacy.A compelling brand identity can influence consumer behavior significantly. Brands that are able to establish a clear and authentic identity can create a sense of trust and familiarity with their audience. Consumers are more likely to make repeat purchases, recommend the brand to others and remain loyal to the brand when they resonate with the brand's values and personality.


The key elements of brand identityAt the heart of every strong brand identity lies a crystal clear purpose and set of values. Brand purpose goes way beyond just profit-making; it expresses the brand's own reason for existence and its contribution to the world. When the brand aligns its purpose with the values and aspirations of its target audience, it can create a meaningful connection that ends up going beyond transactions.The brand name and logo are two of the most recognizable elements when it comes to brand identity. A good brand name should be memorable, easy to pronounce and also reflective of the brand's essence. The brand's logo, on the other hand, acts as the visual representation of the brand itself, containing its personality and values in a single symbol. A thoughtfully and carefully crafted logo can leave a lasting impression and evoke emotional responses from consumers.Consistent brand messaging and voice are crucial for maintaining a coherent brand identity across various social platforms. The voice of the brand represents the personality and tone with which the brand communicates, while the messaging tells the brand's unique selling proposition (USP) and benefits. When a brand has a consistent brand voice, it builds brand recognition and helps the audience form a genuine connection with the brand.Visual identity captures all visual elements that contribute to the brand's identity, including imagery, typography and color schemes. In particular, colors play a significant role in brand perception, as they can evoke different emotions and associations. Brands can use colors strategically to create a psychological impact that aligns with their brand's message and personality.


Related: Define Your Brand Identity in 3 StepsStrategies for building a strong brand identityHaving an understanding of the target audience and doing thorough market research is essential for creating a brand identity that resonates with consumers. By understanding customer pain points, preferences and even aspirations, brands can tailor their own identity to meet the specific desires and needs of their audience. Another way to gather valuable insight is customer feedback. This can be great information to use for refining brand messaging and positioning.The hallmark of a strong brand identity is consistency. Brands need to make sure that their identity remains consistent across all touchpoints to build trust and recognition better. Whether through the company website, social media, advertising or packaging, maintaining a strong, cohesive identity reinforces brand recall and also fosters consumer confidence.A great way to amplify a brand's identity and reach new audiences is through the help of influencers and brand ambassadors. Collaborating with influencers whose values align with the brand's identity can help enhance credibility and authenticity. Influential figures that give the brand positive endorsements can strengthen brand perception and encourage consumer trust.


Monitoring and adapting brand identityWhen you want to evaluate the effectiveness of your brand's identity, it's crucial to monitor and measure brand perception. Key metrics, such as brand awareness, sentiment analysis and customer feedback, provide informative insights into how the brand is perceived by its target audience. These helpful data points can guide any future improvements to the brand identity and its communication strategies.As consumer preferences and markets evolve, so should a brand's identity. While it is essential to maintain a brand's core values and consistency, being able to stay flexible and adapting to changing trends ensures that the brand remains relevant and resonates with a new generation of consumers.A strong brand identity is the foundation upon which successful brands are built. Businesses can create a powerful brand identity that sets them apart, fosters consumer loyalty and drives overall long-term success by understanding the key elements and implementing effective strategies. Creating and building a brand identity is an ongoing process that requires care, attention and an unwavering commitment to delivering a consistent and authentic brand experience. With a well-crafted brand identity, businesses can forge lasting connections with their audience and thrive in an ever-changing competitive marketplace.Related: Creating a Brand Identity That Competes and Compels

107,5 Ways to Establish Credibility Through Content Marketing,"Aug 4, 2023",Jessica Wong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/lacking-trust-here-are-5-ways-to-establish-credibility-in/454280,"
Over the past few years, content marketing has become both a buzzword and a bonafide strategy for brands to establish credibility with their audiences. However, not every piece of content a brand shares has the same impact.Content pieces that make a difference and truly enhance a brand's credibility provide value and knowledge to the audience. These pieces retain their value beyond their initial publication. They become resources that audiences will draw on for years to come. In this article, we explain how your business can use content marketing to establish credibility.Related: Here's How to Improve Your Business's Content Marketing



The power of credibility in content marketingIn today's digital media and marketing landscape, audiences are flooded with messages from various sources. The sheer number of those can make it hard to distinguish between trustworthy sources and others. Establishing credibility within a brand's industry and with its audiences can improve brand perception, increase audiences' trust and become the cornerstone of long-term success in content marketing.Building a high-impact content marketing strategy starts with understanding your audience's needs and pain points. Researching your audience's characteristics beyond basic demographics and developing customer personas helps with this process.


Related: 6 Key Tips to Level Up Your Content Marketing StrategyValuable and educational contentAsk what your brand can offer the audience that no one else can. The answer to this question will help the brand team define what constitutes valuable and educational content. This type of content does more than recite product features. It solves problems and removes pain points for the audience.Valuable and educational content can take different forms. Blogs and articles work well for some brands and their audiences, while complex topics are often better explained via infographics or videos. Podcasts and webinars can also be effective in building credibility with the audience.Naturally, what constitutes this type of content will vary greatly between brands. However, there are several best practices that many great pieces have in common:


1. Based on in-depth researchOutstanding content requires in-depth research. Aside from understanding their brand and the products and services the business offers, content marketers may need to draw on independent, external sources, including data-driven insights, expert opinions and overall industry trends. Developing quality content takes time, but it will pay dividends in the future.2. Complete with actionable and practical adviceHigh-value content would not be complete without actionable advice. Content that audiences will return to repeatedly needs to be practical and applicable. It also needs to be relevant to the audience and offer solutions readers can implement immediately.These might be examples of content created by other brands or case studies of brands that used content marketing successfully to build the businesses they represent. The collaboration platform Intuit is one of those brands. The company targets entrepreneurs and asks them to solve product challenges. The winners receive cash. Intuit's content marketing strategy has kept audiences engaged as well as fostered innovation.Related: 5 Steps to Creating a Content Marketing Strategy That Actually Works


3. Help establish thought leadershipEducational content that offers value to its audience can help brands establish thought leadership in their niche. As audiences continue to benefit from a brand's content regularly, content authors become sought-after. In many cases, they can extend their reach through engagements like public presentations and speaking opportunities.4. Incorporate social proofIf customers or peers have already reviewed your brand, it is worth including this proof in your content marketing. Social proof, especially from independent sources, strengthens your brand's content marketing messages and raises its credibility.Related: 4 Ways to Leverage Social Proof to Grow Your Business Online5. Publish consistently and frequentlyAudiences value content that they receive consistently and frequently. What that means in terms of days, weeks or months may vary from brand to brand. What matters most is that your brand keeps its promises to potential customers and other audiences.


Amplifying your content while measuring success and iteratingHigh-quality content pieces stand the test of time. For that reason, they deserve promotion and amplification. If your brand publishes long-form blogs or holds webinars, consider using shorter versions or snippets as part of your social media content. This allows you to drive traffic to the original blog post and create interest in others.Despite the most detailed strategic planning and content development, content marketing may not always work. That is why it is important to measure the performance of each piece and understand which pieces connect best with your audience.Measure impressions, conversions and engagements to understand what works best and adjust your strategy to maximize those opportunities.Content marketing has the greatest impact when it offers valuable and educational insights to its audiences. Spending the time to develop and research great content will take more time initially, but it will build brand credibility and lead to greater long-term returns.

108,The 10 Commandments of Networking You Must Know to Build Authentic Connections,"Aug 4, 2023",Lirone Glikman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-10-commandments-of-networking-you-need-to-know/455859,"
They say, ""It's all about people,"" and they are right. Opportunities that can change our lives or at least solve a current burning problem all come thanks to people. Networking is an art that holds immense power in our interconnected world. It is the key to building authentic connections that can lead us to personal and professional fulfillment.I've been researching the ""art of networking"" for over a decade, interviewing world-class experts, covering studies, books and, most importantly, listening — listening to the millions of people around the world that I have taught this art to. This has led me to know a thing or two about it and develop a methodology around fulfilling ourselves through the power of relationships, which I have been teaching in six continents.With that in mind, I'd like to present my ""Networking Ten Commandments"" to guide professionals and individuals in forging meaningful relationships and succeeding in their boundless careers and business aspirations. Let's delve into these commandments and I encourage you to explore which ones resonate with you the most.Related: How Networking Is Necessary for Effective EntrepreneurshipHumanity thrives through collaboration. Most people are happy to help if asked in a way that ignites their willingness to assist. When seeking support, approach others with a genuine request, explaining how their contribution can make a positive impact. By appealing to their altruistic nature and even needs, you are more likely to receive their support.Networking is a powerful skill for achieving our goals. To make the most of this skill, set clear targets and identify the individuals who can help you reach them. By proactively seeking out those who possess the necessary expertise or resources, you increase your chances of success.Build relationships before you need help. Get to know a diverse range of individuals long before you require their assistance. Networking is not solely about reaching out when you are in need; it is about fostering genuine connections over time first. Invest in building relationships with others, nurturing them through meaningful interactions and offering support whenever possible.Be open and approachable to everyone you meet. You never know who you might meet. A simple smile or a friendly greeting can go a long way in creating a positive impression. Treat everyone with respect and openness, as each person has the potential to contribute to your journey, the same as you can contribute to theirs.Strive to create authentic personal bonds with people. It involves showing a sincere interest in others, giving truthful compliments, finding common ground and fostering a sense of camaraderie. By making people feel like you care about them and genuinely investing in authentic relationships, you establish a foundation of trust and support that can greatly enhance your networking endeavors, and vice versa.Be ""out there"" and engage in diverse networking opportunities. The more you engage with different communities and circles, attend events and participate in professional gatherings to meet a variety of different people, the greater the likelihood of encountering potential opportunities. Embrace new experiences, step out of your comfort zone and seize every opportunity to expand your network.Design your authentic brand and how others perceive you by consistently conveying your strengths and characteristic messages. Define what sets you apart and communicate it effectively. Craft a compelling narrative that showcases your skills, expertise, and unique value proposition. Align your personal brand with your networking goals to attract like-minded individuals.""Follow up"" is the golden rule in networking. Actively manage and maintain relationships with the relevant people for you. Engage in long-term communication and stay connected. Remember, networking is an ongoing process that requires consistent effort and nurturing. There are many techniques to follow up, I talk about some of them on my social media channels.Always give without expecting immediate returns. Giving is the ""currency"" of relationships. There is so much to offer others; from sharing your experiences and giving compliments to dedicating time to help and sharing connections and resources. When you assist others in achieving their desires, it creates reciprocity, paving the way for support when you need it most.The best way to connect with a stranger is by seeking their advice. Most people are flattered when asked for advice, as it demonstrates respect for their expertise and positions you as an eager learner. This approach often leads to meaningful conversations, establishing a foundation for building and strengthening relationships.Related: 9 Reasons Nurturing Relationships With Other Entrepreneurs Is Vital



In our ""global village"" business world, these Ten Commandments serve as guiding principles for establishing meaningful connections that transcend mere transactional interactions.

109,How to Create a Strong Personal Brand by Leveraging the Power of PR and Social Media,"Aug 3, 2023",Hanna Shanar,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-create-a-strong-personal-brand-in-todays-digital-age/456515,"
In an era where anyone can command a global audience from the palm of their hand, personal branding has never been more crucial. As we navigate through the digital age, it's becoming increasingly apparent that personal branding is more than just a buzzword — it's a powerful driver of success.Personal branding refers to the practice of individuals marketing themselves and their careers as brands. It's about defining your identity, values and unique offerings, then communicating them effectively to the world. But why is it so important?The rise of the internet and social media has drastically changed the way we interact, work and do business. We live in an age where Google is the new first impression, where our online presence speaks before we do. This shift has transformed personal branding from a useful tool to an absolute necessity.



Related: 7 Reasons Why You Need a Personal BrandThe power of personal brandingThe power of personal branding lies in its ability to create trust, establish authority and differentiate yourself in a crowded marketplace. It gives you the ability to showcase your unique skills, passions and values — and to connect with your audience on a personal level. By doing so, you are not just selling a product or a service; you're selling a story, an experience and a connection.


A strong personal brand can pave the way for business success. It can attract potential clients, open doors to new opportunities and even drive the growth of a business. This is particularly evident in influencer marketing, where personal branding can translate directly into business value.Take me as an example. I truly began my social media journey in 2020, sharing basic life updates on Instagram. Over time, I established myself as an educated individual and began to learn the fundamentals of social media verification and growth. Over the years, I've been able to monetize my online presence by providing high-quality press releases and influencer marketing campaigns to dozens of established influencers. This process has allowed me to further expand my network and gross well over six figures as a now fourth-year medical student.This is the power of personal branding at work. But building a compelling personal brand is no easy task — it requires careful planning, consistent effort and strategic use of public relations (PR).PR as a tool for personal brandingPR can play a critical role in personal branding by shaping public perception and building visibility. It helps individuals establish their authority, build their reputation and manage their image. This can involve various tactics, from media relations and content creation to crisis management and event planning.


In the digital age, social media is a vital tool in both personal branding and PR.
