      Key Takeaways    



        Would you answer a late-night text message from a recruiter after a job interview?
      


        The message is a test to help determine whether someone is a good fit for a job or a culture.
      


        William Vanderbloemen said that not texting back isn't a dealbreaker, but a fast reply is a plus.

Responding quickly to a text message could help you land a job.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. You go to a job interview at 1 p.m.At about 10 p.m., you get this text: ""Hey, Tim. This is Ben. I work at Vanderbloemen. I was out of the office today. I heard you were there. Heard that everyone was really impressed with you. I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you. I would love to connect with you sometime. Hope that can work.""



Do you reply? If so, how long does it take you?Your decision might affect whether you're hired.


The test's creator and occasional proctor is William Vanderbloemen. He runs an executive-search firm in Houston. Vanderbloemen's company uses the text-message test after job interviews for certain roles at his own hard-charging firm or for jobs where clients expect workers to be super responsive.Texting back quickly might up your chance of snagging the job, at least at Vanderbloemen's 45-person firm.Sounds simple enough. But the text is also a reminder of the always-on pressure that's pushed some workers to ditch hustle culture. Trial by text message joins other offbeat quizzes meant to help determine whether a job candidate should get an offer letter. There's the spouse interview over dinner. And there's the coffee-cup test: A hiring manager shows those who come for interviews where the kitchen is, offers them a coffee, and then rejects those who don't bus their dishes afterward.The text-message test is also a reminder of how it can be difficult to land a job even as the overall US unemployment rate is low and many industries are hard up for workers. But in areas like tech, where many big employers have trimmed jobs in the past couple of years, some workers are left sending out huge numbers of résumés. And when job seekers do get a bite, interviews can drag on for round after round.Vanderbloemen is quick to note that how you respond — or don't — to an after-hours text from someone saying they're with his firm won't keep you from getting a job. And he said that even responding within 24 hours would put most candidates far ahead of their competition. ""We're just terrible as humans at responding,"" he said.


But text back within the one-minute response time his sales and marketing teams operate by? ""Then we're like, 'Yeah, no, he might be the same kind of crazy that we are,'"" Vanderbloemen said. ""Is that normal for every job? No. Would it work for every company? No.""The test came about after Vanderbloemen hired some people who seemed promising but then didn't deliver on the company's fast turnaround time for clients, which he said is essential for some roles. That led Vanderbloemen to determine he had to measure for speed — before making a hire — for jobs in areas like sales and marketing.So about a decade ago, Vanderbloemen asked one of the people on his team to text someone who'd been great in an interview. The colleague sent the text at about 10:30 p.m., and the candidate responded right away. Bingo.William Vanderbloemen. Courtesy Vanderbloemen Search Group via BIVanderbloemen, the founder and CEO of Vanderbloemen Search Group, decided the text-message test could be a good measure of whether a candidate would mesh well with a client with a move-fast culture. He compared it to pulling off a successful organ transplant by finding tissue that matches. ""Oh, you do things the way they do,"" he said. ""Doesn't make it normal. Doesn't make it right. But you guys match each other.""Switching the interview locationVanderbloemen doesn't rely just on the text-message test. One time, in New York City, he got turned around and realized he didn't have time to make it to the coffee shop where he'd planned to meet a job candidate. So he contacted the man and asked whether they could meet somewhere else. The man responded: ""No, I don't mind. I like change.""Vanderbloemen was impressed. Now he'll sometimes change the location of an interview 30 minutes before it's set to take place to see how a candidate responds.


He said it's not something he does all the time. Some jobs don't require that kind of flexibility or speed. Even with the text message, he said, it's often someone at his firm, not him, who might send it. As the boss, he realizes it's more intimidating if it comes from him. ""It's not fair because I'm the guy with the name on the door, and now I am being kind of just abusive,"" he said.Setting up some rulesVanderbloemen, who has a degree in religion and philosophy, said his company has guidelines meant to protect its workers from needing to be on at all hours. After-hours emails should get a response within 24 hours, he said. Evening Slack messages are rare but should get a response that night ""because that's like Defcon 3,"" he said. ""Defcon 2 would be if I text you after hours, I need an answer like now,"" he added. ""And if I call you after hours, pick up.""He said the firm enforced the rules. It meant he and some colleagues had to quit a group text about ""Game of Thrones"" on Sunday nights.Vanderbloemen said the text-message test still has its place in a world where some workers are trying to avoid being on call all the time.""For our company, particularly certain teams within our company, it's a direct indicator to us of whether you are dysfunctional like us,"" he quipped.

1,How to Build a Workplace Community Where Everyone Thrives,"Mar 29, 2024",Matthew Waggoner,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-build-a-workplace-where-everyone-thrives/471576,"
Too often, companies fall into the trap of treating people as secondary to a product instead of seeing that without people, there would be no product. For small to midsize businesses, it's especially easy to lose connection with employees when the focus becomes all about automation, valuation and gross profit as they scale. But remember, if an organization grows to 2000 people, it's the first 20 who tend to establish and perpetuate the culture. So the question becomes, what kind of culture do you want to set initially?To get the best out of people — and for employees to get the best out of the company — leaders must treat the employer-employee relationship as a mutual partnership. Then, we must select for cultural fit to always build on that sense of community and belonging. One of my former CEOs summed it up best when he told me: ""I want you to help me create an environment where the weekend gets in the way."" He meant a workplace where people were so fulfilled in their jobs that the end of business on Friday felt like being taken away from what they love.Related: How To Build A Strong Culture With A Remote Team



Our people are more than a ""cost""The idea of taking a community-centered approach to running a business was crystalized in one of my first executive jobs, where I was in charge of a large healthcare company's call centers. The people who called in had real and urgent problems: They were sick, had an emergency or needed an appointment. But we had become so data-driven — focused on metrics like call handle times and calls-per-hour — that we had forgotten the human toll of these exchanges.My approach has always been for management teams to be open to empathetic dialogue if one of our representatives or nurses had trouble hitting their data. We needed to allow some latitude for patients to tell their stories rather than just cutting them off. It was a formative experience because I learned to look at the data behind the data — in other words, the human dimension of the business. However, my learning was far from done.


Related: What Happened to the Workplace? How to Make It More HumanDetermining root causes of attritionI have seen the link between many resignations across an organization and hiring managers treating people as a commodity. After doing a root-cause analysis, I found the overriding mentality is: ""If someone doesn't like it here, they should be happy just to have a job.""That was the polar opposite of the culture I wanted to drive. If you are experiencing a high turnover or attrition rate, there are two tried and tested methods for gauging why people are leaving. In both cases, never be afraid to hear the truth about your organization because that's where the solutions lie:Employee surveys: Look for trends in direct feedback. If different departments are losing people, it could be the culture of the entire organization. If the same things are mentioned consistently from one department, the issue is likely centralized. Watch out for data points that cluster around an outlier for underlying problems.Exit interviews: I ask people, ""If you were to ever return, what would you like to see us enhance or implement as an employer?"" Leaders still need a good filter to know when people are just venting, but these data points will reveal whether you are selecting the right people, posting in the right areas, or in too much of a rush to put warm bodies in place.Related: 7 Lessons CEOs and Hiring Managers Learned from Exit Interviews


How to change hiring practicesThe overarching theme of changing hiring practices to create a workplace community is choosing only people who possess the right skill set and fit for your team and culture. To get everybody from C-suite down to share this emphasis, here are five practices to follow:Agree on what type of culture you want because it will affect your choices. If you have a very collaborative organization, a more authoritarian or hierarchical leadership style is a poor fit.Prioritize the candidate profile over demographics. This approach almost builds without a name, face or gender to focus on cultural fit. It helps create a diverse, inclusive and thriving workplace community.Involve hiring managers in candidate screenings. There may be the temptation to select the most experienced person, but any red flags need to be included on the scorecard.Set realistic timing expectations. In companies that always innovate, sometimes hiring is rushed. Instead of hiring 20 different personalities, try hiring five who have the right profile and build from there. If it takes 45 or 90 days to get the right person, that's how long it takes.Build your workforce through employee referrals. People tend to refer those with similar values so then your community can build from within.Related: 10 Strategies for Hiring and Retaining New EmployeesCreating true partnershipThere are two other points to consider, both of which will come across in the interview — treat the hiring process as a two-way evaluation and give people time to decide. As VP of human resources, I still do interviews, which is what I tell candidates: ""I'm fully aware that you're interviewing us just as much as we are interviewing you. And you have the right to say 'no' if it's not the right fit because this is a partnership: You're going to hold me accountable to everything that I'm saying, and I'm going to hold you accountable to everything you're saying.""Community is built on this foundation of transparency, mutual trust and responsibility. After three decades in human resources, my message to business leaders as we all become more and more automated is this: Never forget who got us here. By giving someone time to accept or reject an offer, we are really allowing that person the space to feel like they are part of something bigger, rather than feeling lucky just to get a paycheck.

Sahil Gaba via Business Insider
Sahil Gaba landed a job at Google in 2021.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Sahil Gaba was about to graduate with a master's degree in mechanical engineering when he realized the appeal of computer science.He noticed that friends who had switched to the computer-science field were having a relatively easy time landing jobs — so he decided to try it, too.""One summer, I spent a good three, four months learning programming,"" Gaba, who grew up in India, told Business Insider.""I was quite optimistic. I went to the job market, tried to get some jobs, but still couldn't get any of those Big Tech companies,"" he said.He finally landed a software-engineering role at a small fintech company in Chicago but felt he wasn't learning the most up-to-date software skills with them.""I had that itch of working in Big Tech,"" Gaba said. So he spent his evenings learning newer technologies and honing his interview skills.Catching a big breakIt paid off. After two years at the company in Chicago and hundreds of rejections later, he got his first job in Big Tech: a software-engineering role at Amazon.Within 18 months of starting at Amazon, he landed offers from Meta, Uber, and Google within a few weeks of each other. He accepted a role with Google with a starting salary of about $300,000 a year. He was 29 years old at the time.



Here's the résumé he used to land jobs at Meta, Uber, and Google:The 2021 résumé that helped Sahil Gaba land job offers at Meta, Uber, and Google. Sahil GabaWhat he'd change on his résumé todayThe résumé above landed Gaba job offers with three tech giants. Even so, Gaba says there are a few things he'd tweak on it today.


Lead with experience, not skills: Gaba said he created this résumé before landing his first Big Tech job at Amazon. ""At that time, because my work experience was not that strong, I put my skills at the top,"" he said. It would have made more sense to lead with work experience, he said. ""I would still want to include my skills, but just for the keywords purposes.""Focus on the new: Gaba said he'd reduce the emphasis on achievements from college. ""The honors and awards, they're very old,"" he said. ""I feel like if you've not gotten anything in recent times, you might as well skip them."" Similar logic applies to sections such as ""coursework.""Simplicity of language: When it comes to touting achievements, Gaba said he'd now prioritize making the language easy to understand. ""In the beginning, I would try to add cool acronyms in there — you can alienate your recruiter or hiring manager very quickly by doing that,"" he said.But there are some things he'd keep the same.


De-emphasizing education: ""I've worked pretty hard for all those degrees, but I know that in the context of the job that I'm looking for, those degrees are not that important,"" Gaba said. He put his education on the right side of the page since most people tend to read left to right and would therefore see the more-relevant section first.Hobbies: Gaba said he'd also retain the section called ""interests"" because it makes for a good icebreaker in interviews: ""If you find something that overlaps, it starts a discussion, and it leads to a warm start.""Gaba now works in Google's Seattle office as a software engineer.BI verified his employment history and his pay history.

3,Former Interrogator Shares 5 Behaviors Liars Exhibit and How to Handle Them,"Mar 14, 2024",Lena Sisco,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/former-interrogator-shares-key-behaviors-that-liars-exhibit/470777,"
I often get asked how a former Human Intelligence (HUMINT) interrogator can help me transform into the business leader I want to be in a field that has nothing to do with investigating the criminal activities of terrorists.Most of my clients work in human resources, employee relations, sales and finance-related investigations. They are entrepreneurs and business owners, C-Suite executives, coaches and auditors. I left the world of interrogation long ago and still use my HUMINT skills to lead challenging conversations with confidence and authority to accurately identify deception and go after the truth. In the past two decades of interviewing, I can accurately say that liars exhibit the same deceptive behaviors.Here are five deceptive behaviors to pay close attention to and how to handle those behaviors when you encounter them.Related: Use This Secret Military Trick to Tell if Someone Is Lying1. Inability to answer yes or noThe easiest test to give someone you believe is withholding the truth is to ask them a yes/no question such as, ""Are you being honest with me?"" The reason is that truth-tellers typically answer a closed-ended question quickly and succinctly with a yes or no answer, whereas liars tend to avoid answering them.



For example, in the post-trial interview with OJ Simpson in 2016, the reporter asked OJ, ""Did you ever have any [Bruno Magli shoes]?"" OJ paused, took a deep breath and shrugged his shoulders as he said, ""First of all, I would have never worn those ugly shoes."" He never answered the question. If he was being truthful, he should have answered ""no.""Liars tend to oversell a yes or no answer because they don't believe it is convincing enough. As a result, they will usually say ""absolutely, always"" for yes and ""I would never"" for no. Ask a closed-ended question and then listen to the response. Is it truthful or deceptive?2. Missing ""I"" and ""my"" pronounsPronouns play a big part in detecting deception. The possessive pronouns ""I"" and ""my"" indicate that a person is taking ownership of what they say. Typically, liars will replace those two pronouns with other pronouns such as ""you,"" ""we"" or ""they"" or avoid them altogether when they do not want to take ownership of knowledge or information.For example, if you ask an employee allegedly involved in an ethics violation, ""What happened?"" and they answer with, ""We're trying to figure out what happened."" They could be avoiding responsibility because they didn't say, ""I'm trying to figure out what happened."" Remember Anthony Weiner? When he was lying, he said, ""We're trying to figure out who sent the tweet from my account."" He takes accountability for his account but NOT for trying to figure out who sent the tweet because he knew he sent it. A great way to handle this behavior is to ask, ""You and who are trying to figure this out?""


3. Behavioral incongruenceBehavioral incongruence is the most accurate indicator of deception. It happens when our body language contradicts our spoken language. When we are being truthful, our words, voice, emotions, facial expressions and gestures are naturally in sync; when we lie, they are incongruent. Two great examples of behavioral incongruence that are easy to identify involve shoulder shrugs and head nods and shakes.We will shrug our shoulders in uncertainty when we doubt what we are saying. If someone says, ""I know exactly what happened,"" and they shrug their shoulders, you have a problem. They are doubting what they are saying — and so should you.In most cultures, head nodding signifies ""yes,"" and head-shaking signifies ""no."" If someone says, ""I like your idea,"" but shakes their head sideways, they may not like it. When you see incongruent behaviors in someone, do not trust them. Instead, ask them, ""Why should I believe you?"" A truthful person will usually say, ""Because I'm telling you the truth."" Any other response should be suspicious.Related: 10 Telltale Phrases That Indicate Somebody Isn't Telling the Truth


4. The smokescreenA smokescreen is a ruse to disguise someone's real intentions or actions. People will try to avoid answering a question by taking the conversation onto a different topic, so you focus on their ruse rather than what really happened.Here is an example: Drew Peterson, a former cop now in prison for murdering his third wife while his fourth wife is still missing, during an interview with Larry King, said that his marriage to his fourth wife was going through tough times because she was medicated for depression after her sister died. That is a great disguise to blame their marriage troubles on. He also claimed she ran away with another guy. Yet another cover-up to take him out of the investigation spotlight.When you ask questions to discover the truth, if a liar doesn't want you to know the truth, they may try to disguise it and use a smokescreen to take your attention elsewhere. If you notice someone using a smokescreen, redirect the conversation to the topic in question!5. How liars sound (pitch, rate, breathy)To discover lies, you must focus on the words people say and how they sound. When most people lie, they become nervous, and their vocal cords can tighten, raising their voice's pitch. They also will unconsciously change the rate of their speech. Liars may try to speak faster to avoid being questioned, while others slow down because they struggle to think of what to say. They may be so worried that their cognitive abilities are lessening, so they will speak slower. Either way, in the past 20 years of listening to liars, I will say for certain that their rate of speech will change when they lie.


Finally, when someone is lying to you, they may begin to breathe heavily, and you will hear them becoming breathy. Essentially, they are out of breath because their heart rate has increased due to flight or fight. So, when you hear a change in how someone sounds, investigate it! Ask questions on that specific topic to uncover the truth.These five behaviors are very accurate when deciphering between truth and deception. Reading about them has increased your awareness about them, so the next time you have a gut feeling that someone isn't being honest, ask yourself if they demonstrated one of these five deceptive behaviors.Related: The One Interviewing Technique Guaranteed to Get You the Truth

4,Do Children Need to Go Out of State for the Real College Experience?,"Mar 11, 2024",Mary Banks,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/do-children-need-to-go-out-of-state-for-the-real-college/470434,"
College is an unforgettable time for most of us — it's where we come into our own, begin to carve unique paths and form lasting memories and relationships. Many adults fondly reminisce about their college years, cherishing the freedom, independence, reinvention and fun.But is this experience reserved for those who attend out-of-state schools? Must it begin in a dorm room far away, or can children have the same transformative experience by attending an in-state college or even living at home? As a former admissions officer who has observed both perspectives, I can confidently say that children can enjoy this once-in-a-lifetime experience no matter how far they are from home. Let's explore this further.Related: What I Learned as a First-Generation College Student



Redefining the college experienceLet's first define the ""real college experience."" It encompasses three fundamental components: students living autonomously, forming new connections beyond childhood bonds and navigating their independence through self-directed decision-making and learning from mistakes. When we consider these elements, it becomes obvious that students can experience that special transformative college journey without putting hundreds of miles between them and their parents. In fact, sometimes students still rely on their parents even when separated by hundreds of miles, which I can personally attest to. As a college student, I would often bring my laundry home to wash all the way from Boston to Connecticut. On the other hand, even a two-mile distance can provide that necessary sense of freedom and autonomy.As I've often advised students, the campus environment is a novel experience for everyone, regardless of their college. The sense of wonder and excitement is palpable for any student taking their first steps onto campus. They are surrounded by peers from diverse backgrounds, each with their own stories, perspectives and aspirations. The campus is a hub of activity, with countless clubs, organizations and events catering to various interests. Whether it's joining a sports team, participating in a cultural festival or volunteering for a cause, the campus is always abuzz, and students have many ways to get involved.


Further, it's also a place of growth and self-discovery. Away from the familiarity of home and without their parents, students are pushed outside of their comfort zones and encouraged to take risks, try new things and challenge themselves. This process of self-exploration and personal development is an integral part of the college experience and isn't exclusive to out-of-state students.Related: 5 Reasons College Is Worth It for EntrepreneursThe advantages of staying close to homeStaying closer to home for college has several advantages. A major benefit to attending an in-state college is the cost. Tuition costs jump from a few thousand to $40,000 when attending an out-of-state school. This is especially important considering the ""freshman year flounder,"" where some students get caught up in the excitement of newfound freedom. They may not take academics as seriously and need to retake courses, prolonging their education by a year or so and, thus, increasing costs for their families. On the other hand, with in-state tuition, students can take advantage of lower costs during their first couple of years of college and then transfer to an out-of-state school to continue living the college dream for their final years.Staying closer to home also allows for a smoother transition into the responsibilities and challenges of college life. This can be particularly valuable for those who are introverted or haven't had extensive experience living independently. Encouraging your child to become independent and leave comfort behind is crucial, but pushing them to dive headfirst into living alone in a different state might be too much too soon. Attending a school closer to home will allow them to gradually step out of their comfort zone at their own pace, with the emotional support of family nearby when they feel overwhelmed. Moreover, while out-of-state Ivy League schools can offer more global degrees, students hoping to begin their careers in their home base may find it easier to network and access relevant career opportunities by attending an in-state college. To decide which option is best for your child and feasible for you financially, It's important to have these conversations seriously and first understand your child's needs and goals.Related: Should Your Entrepreneurial Child Go to College?


Setting boundaries: The key to the college experienceOn a final note, regardless of whether your child moves thousands of miles away or stays at home, the only way for them to truly have that explorative college experience is if you respect their independence and set healthy boundaries. While it can be challenging to watch them leave the nest, giving them the freedom to fully embrace this part of their lives is essential for their growth. It's important to allow them to make their own mistakes while letting them know you're there to support them from a distance, even if they're just in the next room. Create this distance by avoiding micromanaging their decisions and resisting the urge to constantly check in on them. Trust your child to navigate their college experience and discover their true potential as independent, emerging adults.

5,Back to the Office: 6 Best Tips to Hire Employees Locally,"Mar 6, 2024",Entrepreneur Deals,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/back-to-the-office-6-best-tips-to-hire-employees-locally/468660,"
Many businesses are gearing up to return to the traditional office setup and they're finding that hiring employees locally is key to creating a smooth and productive transition. Not only does this approach support the local economy, but it also fosters a sense of unity and belonging among colleagues.Here, let's explore some of the best tips to hire employees locally.1. Leverage online platforms to hire employees.One of the most effective ways to hire employees locally is through online job platforms. ZipRecruiter, for example, is one popular hiring site that allows employers to post job openings and reach a broad audience of job seekers in their local area.



With advanced search and AI matching algorithms, ZipRecruiter can help you find candidates whose skills align perfectly with your job requirements. Additionally, it streamlines the application process, making it easier for both employers and candidates.2. Understand the local talent landscape.Before diving into the hiring process, it's crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the local talent pool. Consider the skills and qualifications prevalent in your community, and tailor your job descriptions accordingly. This helps to ensure that you attract candidates with the right expertise and demonstrates your commitment to investing in the local workforce.


3. Utilize community networks.Before you set out to hire employees in your area, engage with local community groups, professional organizations, and networking events. These platforms can offer an excellent opportunity to connect with potential candidates and gain insights into the local job market. Attend industry-specific gatherings or sponsor local events to build relationships and make your company more visible to potential hires.4. Showcase company culture.Local candidates will likely be more interested in companies that align with their values and contribute positively to the community. Highlight your company culture in job postings, emphasizing community involvement, social responsibility initiatives or employee engagement programs. This can make your organization more appealing to local talent looking for a workplace that goes beyond just a job.5. Offer flexibility and work-life balance.The importance of work-life balance and flexibility has become more pronounced. When hiring employees locally, consider offering flexible work arrangements or remote options. This expands your potential candidate pool and demonstrates your commitment to supporting employees' well-being, a factor that resonates well with local talent.6. Engage in local partnerships.Forge partnerships with local educational institutions, career centers and vocational programs. By collaborating with these organizations, you can tap into a pipeline of skilled and motivated individuals eager to enter the workforce. Consider internships, apprenticeships, or mentorship programs to nurture local talent and create a talent pool for future hires.


Whether you wind up doing all of the things on this list, or perhaps two or three—such as leveraging an online hiring platform like ZipRecruiter or tapping into community networks—these tips can help give your business a head start when the time comes to hire employees in your area.

The following is an excerpt from business expert Scott Greenberg's new book, Stop the Shift Show: Turn Your Struggling Hourly Workers Into a Top-Performing Team, available now.As a manager of hourly employees, you may be eager to get new recruits working as soon as possible. But remember: you also want them to stay.Before you train them on the job, train them in your culture. Don't just tell them what your mission and values are. Discuss them. At In-N-Out Burger, no one puts on the red apron until they've watched a series of videos explaining their culture and ways of doing things. A lot of great hourly workplaces use videos, information packets, and even quizzes to confirm new employees understand the culture they're joining. Make sure new employees appreciate who you are as an organization, not just what you do. Share stories of your culture so they can understand how your workplace is different. Even better, have other employees explain the culture. It'll be more credible if it comes from co-workers.

Create your own welcoming customsNew employees have probably applied for other jobs and may still be communicating with those employers when they start with you. You need to make a good first impression so they mentally commit to staying with you. You also want to set them up for success.It's nerve-racking to start a new job—not just because they're having to learn how to do new tasks, but also because they're joining a new team. People worry about how they're going to fit in, what their social role will be, how to remember who everyone is, and how people get along. A first day at work is like your first day at a new school. Remember, we create culture on three fronts—in the head, in the heart, and on the floor. Your first priority is the heart, which means easing those first-day feelings.Begin with a memorable, warm reception. Hang a sign with their name and perhaps some festive decorations to welcome them to their new family. Have co-workers greet them at the door with a round of applause. Give them a welcome basket or bag of goodies. You'll never get another opportunity to create this moment, so give them something to tell their friends and family about.Rituals like this also communicate something to the rest of your team— that new people are important and should be treated with kindness. Your team is probably wondering how this new person will impact the work environment. A good welcome ritual cuts through that initial iciness and promotes camaraderie.


I met one business owner who sends new employees home with a small gift for their family and a note thanking them for sharing their loved one. He commits to protecting their well-being and invites the family to visit the workplace sometime. This may seem a bit over-the-top, but it's an interesting way to win over an employee's family and stand out from other employers. As the owner told me, ""You can never have too many people telling your employees how lucky they are to work for you!""Be sure to take photos of your welcome customs. Share them with the new team member and post them on social media. Let the world see your hospitality toward your employees and see how you should be the employer of their choice. 


Assign a mentorMentors (sometimes called ""coaches,"" ""big brothers/sisters,"" or ""buddies"") can offer guidance without eliciting the anxiety new employees sometimes feel around their boss. Co-worker mentorships promote a more collaborative atmosphere and get your team invested in one another's success.Also use this first day to establish your relationship with the new employee. Explain your management style. Inquire about their goals, how they'd like to grow, and what kind of management they respond to. Find out what they like (which you can use later for rewards and incentives). Explain your approach to providing feedback. Let them know you'll be checking in with them from time to time, and what to expect from those conversations. Help them see you as an advocate for their growth, not just an authority figure.Don't issue a uniform, give them swagClothing creates community. Sports jerseys and caps, college sweatshirts, military battle dress, and other uniform attire don't just identify people's affiliations—they promote them. But the power of clothing doesn't lie in what people are wearing. It's in their relationship to it. There's a pride that comes with visual affiliation. It feels good to be part of an institution with other members. Clothing is a way of saying to the world, ""I'm part of this group.""That's how you want your employees to relate to the clothing you provide them. Whether it's Walmart's blue vest, UPS' browns, or anything with McDonald's golden arches, the smart use of uniforms can create a sense of belonging.


Make a fuss over your company clothing. Don't ""issue uniforms."" Instead, give them ""swag."" Put the uniform in a gift bag, perhaps the one you give them on their first day. Or consider starting them with a low-key (i.e., cheaper) shirt or hat and let them earn the official gear once they complete training. Make it a moment when they earn their stripes. Offer additional branded clothing as prizes and incentives.Presentation matters, and so do rituals. Honor your colors. Let employees feel lucky to receive a uniform, rather than burdened to wear one.Get more management tips and strategies from 'Stop the Shift Show,' available now at the Entrepreneur Bookstore.

8,How to Take the Stress Out of the Hiring Process,"Feb 27, 2024",Jonathan Small,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/new-ai-powered-video-platform-streamlines-the-hiring-process/469757,"
Recruiting is a stressful business—perhaps more now than ever before.A 2023 survey of 1,200 hiring managers conducted by Zogby Analytics found they're feeling the pressure big time, thanks to an overwhelming number of resumes to review, often from unqualified candidates, too many vacant positions, and a lengthy hiring processes.While AI on platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed and ZipRecruiter have made it much simpler for job seekers to apply for a position in mere seconds, it has, in turn, caused a massive traffic jam in HR departments across the country.



Many use AI software to screen for candidates, but even that isn't enough to slow the deluge.Related: 55 Small Business Ideas to Start in 2024


Entrepreneur Vinay Jatwani believes he has a solution that offers managers more a effective hiring strategy. His company, CandidateView, utilizes the sophisticated ad tech technology used for customer acquisition and applies it to the hiring process. Although the company is still in its nascent state, early data indicates that the service eliminated 65 percent of unwanted applications. ""We've brought our knowledge from ad tech to HR tech,"" he says.Video killed the resume starCandidateView is an online platform allowing hiring teams to filter candidates before they meet them and candidates to vet companies before they apply for a position.The platform takes the focus off the resume and cover letter, relying on video as the primary means of communication. Candidates can watch videos provided by the employer and submit videos of themselves answering custom-tailored interview questions.""Employers are just getting flooded with resumes, but if you look at it, a resume is just a checklist, it doesn't tell you anything about an individual,"" says Jatwani. ""We want good candidates to get greater visibility for themselves. Through video, they can sell themselves above and beyond just their resume.""


How it worksOn CandidateView, job applicants are first directed to the relevant job position at the organization where they can watch short videos about the company. This helps the organization sell itself beyond a blurb on a webpage that busy candidates often don't have the interest or time to seek out.Related: Avoid Costly Hiring Mistakes With These Five Essential Tips""Through video, the company can explain their culture, what the position is, and what they're looking for,"" Jatwani says. The videos can be produced directly by the company or by AI, using a series of actors with diverse ages, ethnicities, and genders.


CandidateView then allows hiring managers to pre-interview candidates by asking them a series of questions via video. The candidates can answer the questions on their own schedule and re-record as many times as they like.Related: 6 Steps to Getting Your Business Plan In Front of InvestorsThe platform has hundreds of interview questions based on various categories or employers can write their own, allowing users to customize the Q&A process. Again, the service allows the client to upload their own video questions, use a human actor, or use an AI-generated actor.AI's not replacing HRSome critics may see services like Candidate View as a threat to HR executives. If you can use AI avatars to interview job applicants, why do you need humans?


But Jatwani stresses the goal is not to replace one-on-one human interaction but to use video interviews as a tool to prescreen candidates. Once candidates pass through the initial filtering process, they're ready to meet their potential employer face-to-face.""We want good candidates to get greater visibility for themselves and sell themselves above and beyond just their resume,"" he explains. ""And we want to make it easier for employers to meet these good candidates.""Jatwani is so passionate about the technology that he's begun using it on a personal project near and dear to his heart. A few years ago, his sons began a foundation in honor of his wife, who died of brain cancer. This year, the foundation is hosting a conference offering scholarships for students, and they're using CandidateView to get to know the candidates.Related: AI in Recruitment: The Future of Work or the End of Recruitment Agencies?

More than four in 10 workers feel ""very"" or ""somewhat"" lonely at work, according to a recent report from employee listening and manager effectiveness platform Perceptyx.But remote work, which more than tripled in the wake of the pandemic from 2019 to 2021, isn't necessarily the culprit.In fact, research suggests that employees who have the opportunity to work remotely are more likely to feel happy and productive in their roles, and a Harvard study revealed that the jobs that people feel most unhappy in were also among the loneliest jobs.Related: 3 Ways to Avoid the Loneliness of Working RemotelyNaturally, positions that call for a lot of independent work and little collaboration have the potential to be some of the loneliest.

Employees are the driving force behind any business. That's why even one bad hire can cause your company to sputter and stall.According to The United States Department of Labor, a hire who turns out to be a lemon can cost a company upwards of an entire year of that employee's salary.And finances aren't the only casualty of a faulty hiring process. Office morale and productivity also suffer, as unfit employees tend to spread bad vibes throughout the ranks.



While it's challenging to get it right every time you hire a new staff member, there are some common interview mistakes you can avoid, putting you in a better position to make the right choice.Related: 'Quiet Hiring' Is on the Horizon – Here's What Employers and Employees Need to Know


Don't rush to fill the positionIn today's fast-paced business culture, companies often race to put an employee in a chair, prioritizing filling the position over finding the right person for the job. This can lead to hasty, rushed hiring decisions that result in long-term headaches.""When we were a young startup, we typically looked at the pool of respondents and hired the best person,"" says Ross Kimbarovsky, Founder and CEO of crowdSPRING and Startup Foundry. ""After making a few hiring mistakes, we now hire only when a candidate is the right fit for us.""The bottom line: Hiring is not about headcount—it's about making your hire count.Don't procrastinate on the prepManagers often go through hiring process steps with the attitude that they'll know the right candidate when they meet them. This lack of pre-game preparation before the interview process can cause a bottleneck in hiring and slow everything down.


""Hiring managers go wrong by not putting time in up-front to really consider what they're looking for in a replacement or a new hire,"" says Barbara Mitchell, co-author of The Big Book of HR. ""If work is done before the hiring begins, it will go quicker.""Don't have time to interview dozens of applicants? CandidateView is an online platform that allows you to use AI to pre-interview people on video. Candidates' answers are recorded and can be reviewed by hiring managers before deciding whether or not they want to schedule in-person interviews.Don't hire the most experienced candidateExperience is important, but it's not everything. Too often, hiring managers look to fill positions with the most qualified candidates, overlooking that they may be a bad fit for the company culture.When interviewing people for a job, try to gauge if this person will align with the company's values. Will they feel comfortable in their role, and will you feel comfortable working alongside them?


A strong company culture leads to productive outcomes, but a cultural mismatch can negatively influence your entire team, resulting in reduced productivity, diminished morale, and an unsatisfactory customer experience.Related: How to Take the Stress Out of the Hiring ProcessDon't only focus on technical skillsHiring someone proficient at getting the job done quickly and efficiently can be tempting. Those so-called ""hard skills"" are essential for performance as they determine a candidate's ability to execute specific tasks.But they're only half the story.


A mastery of soft skills is also crucial. These are the non-technical skills that make a person a pleasure to work with. We're talking about interpersonal skills such as good communication, the ability to work well with others, a positive attitude, and cultural sensitivity. Basically, everything we learned in kindergarten.Don't ignore red flagsDid the candidate show up for their interview late and unprepared? Did they speak disrespectfully about their former employer or have a long track record of short stints at previous jobs? These are warning signs that hiring managers ignore at their peril.In their attempt to be fair and give someone the benefit of the doubt, they sometimes don't want to see the potential train wreck that's careening right in our direction. They're also under a lot of pressure to fill jobs quickly with a limited talent pool, causing them to make interview mistakes.The key is to trust your instincts rather than ignore them.

15,Time to Hire or Time to Fire? How to Rank Employees to Identify Low and High Performers,"Jan 18, 2024",Murali Nethi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-rank-employees-to-identify-low-performers/467873,"
While every person who joins an organization aims to contribute productively, the reality is that individual performance levels vary significantly. As a manager, one of the key challenges is to distinguish between low and high performers so that underperformers can be retrained or let go if needed while top talent is identified, rewarded and retained.One common approach companies use is ranking or rating employees against each other to get a sense of relative performance levels. However, ranking is a delicate exercise that must be done carefully and judiciously to be effective and fair. Here are a few pointers from my experience on how ranking can help identify low and high performers while minimizing potential pitfalls.Related: 9 Ways to Retain Your Top-Performing Employees



Why ranking is importantFirst and foremost, ranking employees allows you to understand who is truly excelling in their roles and who may need additional support or training. It helps you distinguish between average performance and outstanding performance. Additionally, ranking can highlight employees falling short of expectations and not meeting defined goals or key performance indicators (KPIs).Knowing your high and low performers is key for a few important reasons:


Compensation and rewards: You'll want to reward your high performers appropriately through bonuses, promotions, career opportunities and salary increases. Conversely, low performers may warrant reduced or stagnant compensation.Work allocation: High performers are ideal candidates for new, complex projects and leadership roles. You'll want to challenge them. Low performers are better suited to more routine tasks that don't require as much independence.Career development: For high performers, you can help craft development plans that position them for even greater responsibilities. Low performers may need remedial training or be out of their role.Performance management: Ranking gives you data to properly manage ongoing performance through check-ins, feedback and setting expectations for improvement.So, while ranking can feel uncomfortable, it provides objective data to make critical people decisions fairly and thoughtfully. Done right, it benefits both high and low performers through tailored development.Related: 4 Steps to Manage Your Employees and Help Them WinHow to rank thoughtfullyThere is certainly no perfect science to ranking employees. However, here are a few best practices to employ a thoughtful, multidimensional approach:Look beyond numbers: Don't rely solely on quantitative metrics like sales figures, number of projects completed, etc. Consider qualitative factors as well, such as leadership, collaborative skills, work ethic, initiative, judgment and problem-solving abilities.Use multiple lenses: Gather feedback from various sources — your direct reports, peers, customers, etc. Also, consider self-evaluations. A diversity of perspectives provides a well-rounded picture of performance.Monitor over time, not one moment: Ranking should reflect sustained performance over weeks or months, not one spike or dip. Look for consistency and growth trajectories.Account for role differences: Not all jobs have identical responsibilities so compare ""apples to apples"" as much as possible. Weigh roles appropriately based on complexity, impact and expectations.Discuss rankings openly: Explain your methodology and rationale transparently so employees understand how decisions were made. Clarify it's not punitive but aims to maximize strengths.Make room for nuance: Realize not all top and bottom performers are cut and dry. Leave flexibility for unusual circumstances, recent improvements, high potentials and more discretion.Revisit regularly: Periodic reviews help ensure rankings stay dynamic and responsive to changing performance levels. Continuous assessment fosters ongoing development and accountability.This way managers can have thoughtful, meaningful discussions that maximize employee growth and company success overall. Regular checking and adjustment also maintain fairness and accuracy over time.


Pitfalls to avoidOf course, there are also some potential downsides to be mindful of:Beware of bias: Our inherent biases around gender, age, race, or other attributes can subtly influence perspectives if not checked. Ensure rankings derive from professional criteria alone.Avoid perfect/imperfect mindsets: Most employees ebb and flow. See rankings as ranges not fixed labels, leaving room for improvement or workload adjustments that change ratings.Use with compassion: While discussions must be straightforward, maintain empathy, dignity and respect throughout the process. Frame it as development, not judgment.Share judiciously: Protect confidential information appropriately. Rankings need not be fully transparent company-wide to drive effective conversations.Standardize definitions: Clearly define what differentiates a ""good"" vs. ""great"" rating so that rankings are applied and understood consistently.When rankings consider multiple lenses, change over time, account for role nuances, avoid biases and use empathetic language — they can offer constructive guidance. But they also warrant sensitivity to avoid demoralization so the focus stays on growth.The goal of any employee evaluation system should be to develop, challenge and care for all individuals while fueling company success. When done thoughtfully using data from various critical perspectives, rankings can provide functional differentiation that motivates high performers and offers low performers clearer paths for improvement.

16,Employee Search: Interview Techniques to Hire the Best,"Jan 17, 2024",Entrepreneur Deals,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/employee-search-interview-techniques-to-hire-the-best/467802,"
Assembling a team of talented individuals is a cornerstone of long-term business success. How well a company grows and innovates depends on the people it brings on board. That means employee search and the hiring process is critical for entrepreneurs. During interviews, entrepreneurs review resumes and talk to potential candidates to check if their skills are compatible with the company's ethos and culture.Here are some interview techniques that entrepreneurs can use to ensure they're not just filling seats but strategically choosing dedicated employees who will add to their ventures' growth and success.Utilize technology for efficiency.Leveraging technology can significantly streamline employee search and the hiring process. Platforms like ZipRecruiter offer automated candidate matching, applicant tracking, and job posting optimization features. These tools help entrepreneurs save time and resources, allowing them to focus on the critical aspects of interviewing and selecting the best candidates for their teams.



Behavioral interviewing.Behavioral interviewing can be a powerful method to unearth a candidate's true capabilities. Instead of relying solely on a list of qualifications, behavioral interviews delve into a candidate's past experiences, offering a panoramic view of how they navigated challenges and collaborated with others.By asking questions like, ""Can you share an example of a challenging project you worked on and how you overcame obstacles?"" entrepreneurs can gain valuable insights into a candidate's problem-solving abilities, communication skills, and adaptability.


Role-specific scenarios.Tailoring the interview questions to the specific role can be instrumental in gauging a candidate's suitability. Presenting real-world scenarios related to the job and asking candidates how they would approach them can provide a glimpse into their problem-solving skills and their ability to think on their feet.This technique is particularly useful for assessing how well candidates can apply their skills to the challenges they may encounter in the role.Cultural fit assessment.Beyond skills and qualifications, finding candidates who align with the company's culture is crucial for long-term success. Ask questions that probe into a candidate's values, work preferences and collaboration style.Assessing cultural fit during the interview process helps entrepreneurs build a cohesive and harmonious team, fostering a positive and productive work environment.


Multiple interview rounds.Conducting multiple interviews with different team members can help evaluate a candidate's suitability.ZipRecruiter's applicant tracking system streamlines the management of candidate information, making it easier to track and evaluate applicants throughout employee search and the hiring process. This allows entrepreneurs to focus on strategic aspects of the interview process, ultimately leading to better hiring decisions.Skill assessments.Incorporating skill assessments or practical exercises into the interview process can provide tangible evidence of a candidate's abilities. Whether it's a coding test for a software developer or a presentation for a sales role, these assessments allow entrepreneurs to gauge a candidate's proficiency in a real-world context.Ask for references.Don't underestimate the value of checking references. Speaking with a candidate's previous employers or colleagues can provide valuable insights into their work ethic, collaboration skills and overall performance. This step helps entrepreneurs verify the information provided by the candidate and gain a more holistic understanding of their professional background.


Leveraging the right tools, like ZipRecruiter, and following these simple interviewing strategies will improve your employee search and help you hire the best fit for your company.

Innovative ideas flow more freely, people feel free to fail and improve quickly, and customers are happier. Positivity is contagious. When the morale is good, the product is better, and when the product is better, morale is better, too.



Establishing a world-class team that generates good things doesn't happen overnight. You can't hire this kind of team; you build it. Here are three principles we've used over nearly two decades to build teams that do amazing things.Related: 7 Ways to Build a High-Performing Team


1. Celebrate failure and learn to give feedbackWhen you embrace failure, you learn and course-correct more quickly. Failure is a sign you're doing something right. You're testing, learning, flexing your creative muscles and moving on efficiently after hitting a brick wall.You must build a team open to feedback to make the most of your failures for the company's good. Feedback is the mode by which we make positive changes out of failure.The challenge? Feedback makes most people cringe. We associate it with criticism as opposed to growth. To create a culture that sees feedback as an opportunity for growth, leaders need to model the way they want team members to:A. Receive feedbackB. Give feedbackWhen it comes to receiving, leaders should welcome employees to comment on how they should improve processes, culture and performance to improve the business. We love employee surveys at Wistia. They're effective and easy to conduct. We've found benefits in sending out simple Google forms to get a real-time pulse check from team members.When it comes to giving, the most impactful way we can create a culture that embraces feedback is by paying close attention to how we give it. People respond best to immediate, specific feedback and from people they believe care about them.A team that uses feedback as a valuable tool sets better expectations, aligns goals, squashes inefficiencies and strengthens collaboration across the organization.

Be an open bookClear communication may seem like an obvious necessity on high-performing teams, but it's something that's often taken for granted. Unclear communication can quickly tank a team's efforts. A team that has mastered precise communication, on the other hand, can achieve incredible outcomes quickly.We follow an ""open book"" mentality at Wistia. On all-hands calls, we share candid information about the state of the company – inclusive of the good and the bad – so everyone has the big picture. When everyone shares the same vision, they understand the desired destination and the obstacles we face, and they're empowered to solve customer problems creatively.Normalizing difficult conversations sets the tone for transparent communication on a team. Honesty begets transparency. When you avoid ""negative"" updates or conversations, you hinder progress when you could be solving hard problems faster.

Seek the curiousWhen hiring those who will join a high-performing team, a solid resume is a nice-to-have, but curiosity is a must.When you're curious, you're the kind of person who will ask ""why"" until you find a solution and a way forward. The curious-minded navigate change faster. They find solutions to problems more quickly. They always look for opportunities in a crisis with an eye on the competition and a mission to add the most value to customers.This intrinsic drive to challenge the status quo is one of the most valuable traits you can have to stay ahead of the game in today's fast-moving market.


Keep an eye out for talent who asks questions to better understand why something is working or not working. We often include a project as part of our interview process to understand how someone approaches a problem. We look for:What questions do they ask?How do they identify information gaps?How flexible are they in working toward a solution?This project-based interview gives insight into a candidate's curiosity and approach to work.The building blocks of building a world-class team begin at the hiring process but are created and cultivated over time. Committing to building a high-performing team requires patience, discipline, self-reflection and willingness to communicate hard things. Putting in that kind of work and time is a tall order for any leader, but it's the most invaluable investment you can make for your business if you're in it for the long haul.

18,The One Interviewing Technique Guaranteed to Get You the Truth,"Jan 10, 2024",Lena Sisco,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-one-interviewing-technique-guaranteed-to-get-you-the/467713,"
We interview people every day of our lives to get information that will help us make wise decisions. Whether you are a doctor or patient, salesperson or buyer, screening a new hire, or you are the new hire, we ask questions to get answers to make safer choices and to help others do the same.As a former Department of Defense certified military interrogator, I questioned detainees to obtain intelligence information to thwart terror attacks. If I couldn't get that information, people would be in great danger; the stakes were high. To ensure I got truthful, detailed information, I developed an effective strategic interviewing method, which I have perfected over the years. It is now known as the SISCO Method of interviewing, and it includes six core competencies that I believe will transform anyone into an expert interviewer.However, one technique you can learn and start using today will significantly increase your chances of getting truthful information in any conversation. That technique is your ability to ask effective questions.



Related: Use This Mind Trick to Get Someone to Tell You the TruthEffective questioning techniquesAsking effective questions may seem a bit obvious, but I have discovered that most people think they ask good questions when they actually don't. Most people aren't even aware of the words they use in their questions. And sometimes, their questions aren't questions at all; they become comments. When you use these effective questioning techniques, you will get the information you seek.


First, follow this simple rule: Put the words who, what, where, when, why or how at the beginning of each question. This way, your question becomes an interrogative or open-ended question and will encourage a narrative response. If your question does not begin with one of those interrogatives, it will be close-ended — a yes/no question — and you may only get a yes or no answer.To ensure you get a detailed answer, ask a detailed interrogative question. All you have to remember is to ask for what you want! For example, if you want to know what I think about your product in relation to your competitor's product, you wouldn't ask me, ""What do you think about our product?"" Because if you do, you just provided me a way to avoid telling you how I think your product measures up — or does not — to your competitor's. Instead, you would ask me, ""How do you think our product measures up to our competitor's?""Ineffective questioning techniquesI have a saying: If you ask a vague question, you get a vague answer. Vague questions make it easy for a person to lie by omitting truthful information. This is the easiest form of lying. You don't want to make it easy for someone to lie to you.The worst question to ask someone is a leading question. Attorneys are notorious for asking these types of questions because they are leading a witness to an answer they want to hear. Leading questions can trap people into saying something untrue because of how they are worded. Trust me, I have first-hand experience with this when a defense attorney cross-examined me during a military tribunal. As a trained interrogator, I knew the questions were a trap, so I told the judge I would only answer interrogative questions! That was a show. In the end, I won.


Lastly, avoid the common mistake of asking two questions simultaneously. It isn't easy for a person to answer two questions at once. And if that person has something to hide, they may only answer the less-incriminating question and avoid the other one in hopes you do not follow up and ask the question they didn't answer again.Related: Use This Secret Military Trick to Tell if Someone Is LyingDon't tell, ASK!This last technique is vital, and it can have grave consequences. I've witnessed many interviewers make this mistake. Those interviewers who lack confidence in their questioning skills tend to tell people the answer instead of asking for it. Here is an example of what I mean from an interview with Casey Anthony in March 2017.Reporter: ""To your understanding, how did she die?"" (referring to her daughter, Caylee)Casey: ""I don't know.""Reporter: ""You don't know? Something about drowning, possibly?""Casey: ""Everyone else has their theories. I don't know.""Reporter: ""So your parents had her.""Casey: ""My dad did.""Reporter: ""Next thing you know, she's missing? Right? How did it play?""Casey: ""I did what I was told. I don't remember too much of what happened.""This is a classic example of how ineffective questioning gets you nowhere. The reporter told Casey the answers; he didn't ask her for them. He asked a leading question, and in the end, he didn't obtain any detailed information.


If you want the truth, ask straightforward, specific interrogative questions. Ineffective questions can give people a way out of answering. Be patient and calm, and allow people time to answer. You will be amazed at how much information you can get when you practice this technique.Related: How to Ask the Right Question in the Right Way

Once you've narrowed down your list of candidates, conduct interviews to get to know the candidates better. You should also schedule a follow-up interview if necessary.Check references and previous work.Before making a job offer, be sure to check references from previous employers, colleagues or managers to get a sense of the candidate's work style and qualifications. You can also ask for samples of their previous work or projects to evaluate their abilities. Some employers even ask candidates to create presentations or complete a pre-employment assessment to evaluate how they work.



Offer competitive compensation and benefits.To attract top talent, offering a competitive compensation and benefits package is critical.

21,5 Secrets to Building Your Super Team of Remote Freelancers — and How to Retain Them,"Jan 3, 2024",Shavaun Christian,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-secrets-to-building-your-super-team-of-remote-freelancers/466237,"
Recent labor market trends show that 78% of companies use remote freelancers, and 59% plan to use more remote freelancers within the next six months.Uncertainty in the economy, shifts in workforce models, culture and perception and employees reprioritizing work-life arrangements all contribute to the reliance on (and the continued rise of) the ""high-skills gig economy,"" as Harvard calls it.While hiring a remote freelancer may seem like just one job post away, there's a science and skill to attracting and retaining the right freelance talent for your business. Engaging a freelancer is far from just a one-off transaction.



Here are five secrets to hiring a remote freelancer as a long-term win-win for your business and your future super team of remote talent.Related: How Businesses Can Adapt to a Growing Freelance Movement


1. Know where to lookCompanies of all sizes are increasing their reliance on freelancers to boost productivity, increase innovation and improve speed to market — just a few of the advantages reported by nearly 700 senior business leaders in the U.S.In the same study, almost 90% of business leaders reported that digital talent platforms and freelance marketplaces are essential to building their blended workforce — a combination of full-time employees and freelancers to create an ""on-demand"" workforce.Gone are the days when freelance marketplaces were just the go-to for a $5 logo.The ecosystem of digital talent platforms has quadrupled within the past decade, and freelance marketplaces have evolved to meet the demands of Fortune 500 customers, like Amazon and Unilever, and small businesses alike, who now use digital talent platforms as viable scouting tools for their short-term and long-term business needs.


More remarkably, you don't need to be a publicly traded company to access a global talent pool. Regardless of the size of your business, you can look for freelancers across specialized marketplaces for premium talent, digital freelancing marketplaces or crowdsourcing platforms.While digital talent platforms create ease and expansion of search for freelance talent, referrals, word of mouth and actively scouting online professional networks are also effective and relevant means to building your super team.2. Ask the right questionsAt our agency, we hire freelancers to augment our teams for select creative projects. We've found that internal and external alignment is the root of any fruitful freelance engagement.Get clear on your needs and expectations when hiring remote freelancers. You can build your freelance team around your needs when you know exactly what you need.


Internal questions to consider:What specific skills would add more value to our client or project?How long will we actively need this freelancer?Which freelancers on our roster can we re-engage, and what have they more recently worked on?External questions to consider (what to ask prospective freelance candidates):Do you have the capacity to take on new projects? Any conflicts of interest?Do you have relevant case studies that reflect our specific skill requirements?Are you available during our projected duration of the assignment?What time zone(s) are you available to work in?Related: 5 Data-Backed Benefits of Working With Freelancers to Grow Your Business3. Have an onboarding plan or processOnce you've recruited the right freelancers for your business, maintain a good rapport and continue to build trust.


Onboarding goes beyond the formality of signed contracts. Remember, the start of a short-term project is the beginning of a long-term relationship that can serve your business needs as much as the freelancers'.Some freelancers share that your business reputation, transparency and trust are among the priceless non-negotiables that freelance talent may consider when choosing to work (and keep working) for you.Further, demonstrating process, planning and structure within your organization ensures your freelance talent receives clear direction, understands their assignment and operates seamlessly within your existing operational flow — all of which can make your life (and theirs) easier.Some ideas to consider for seamless onboarding include:


Set up a kick-off or onboarding callShare brand guidelines with creative freelancersDiscuss internal language, file structure or other day-to-day logisticsEstablish preferred methods of communication and key points of contactSet expectations around progress, key milestones or check-ins4. Maintain an ongoing relationshipOne enterprise-level digital talent platform shared that ""it takes five times the resources and effort to find a new freelancer every time you have a new project, compared with establishing strong ongoing working relationships.""While you don't have to commit to a future time frame or project, keeping the line of communication open with freelance talent can save you five times the time and effort the next time your business has a need.Make your freelancers feel valued and leave the door open for future opportunities.Related: Employee or Freelancer: Which One Do I Need?


5. Expect limited availability and high demandReports show that 56% of freelancers are working 30 hours or less per week, with 80% of the freelancers surveyed either satisfied or very satisfied with their freelancing lifestyle — which is generally location-agnostic, flexible and allows for a regionally diverse client base, as 32% of freelancers have expanded their client base to new countries.These factors mean your star freelancer might only sometimes be available when you need them, but the best dream teams have more than one key player, plus a solid bench.Build your super team (with backups).Long-term impacts of short-term hiresHiring freelancers is vital to staying competitive and surviving in a hyper-competitive market.


Businesses have come to appreciate the value of the agility of the freelance market, and, as expedited by the pandemic, companies now have greater tolerance and experience with trust and legal and compliance procedures that make hiring highly skilled remote freelancers more the norm.But to maximize the benefits of engaging freelancers, be ready to build relationships, integrate freelancers into the DNA of your company and workflow and empower your current employees to be part of the process and see that a freelancer is an extension of your shared mission.

22,"Here's Why Businesses Should Stop Trying to Hire for ""Cultural Fit""","Dec 15, 2023",David Eaton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-businesses-should-stop-trying-to-hire-for-cultural-fit/466064,"
Organizations that pride themselves on the strength of their cultures often seek to reinforce workplace norms by looking for ""cultural fit"" among potential new hires — candidates who, in the minds of leaders, reflect and will uphold their organizations' best attributes. Unfortunately, this hiring practice has the often unintended effect of maintaining overwhelmingly homogeneous, monocultural teams. This works directly against initiatives to advance diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB) to the detriment of innovation, organizational reputation and talent retention, especially among younger generations.Fortunately, leaders can begin rectifying this practice by internalizing, modeling, and ultimately operationalizing mindset changes that look beyond ""fit"" to embrace diverse backgrounds, perspectives, communication styles and even expressions of emotions. In doing so, they'll make their cultures even stronger, adding and elevating the contributions of those who might experience the world differently, not just because of race or gender, but also socio-economic background, country of origin, sexual orientation, birth order, generation, personality traits and numerous other factors.Related: Forget Cultural Fit and Look for Cultural Impact



Understanding the drivers behind cultural homogeneityThe motivation to hire based on cultural fit is as understandable as it is misguided. Leaders who value their current teams might want to emulate the success they've achieved to date and lean into the short-term comfort that, for the majority group, often accompanies conformity. They also understand on some level that de-prioritizing fit can lead to workplace tensions that — while often healthy, constructive and completely manageable — do necessitate time- and resource-consuming investments on the part of organizations and their top leaders.Unfortunately, the short-term benefit of this homogeneity ultimately gives way to significant long-term disadvantages. In today's increasingly globalized, multi-generational, multi-cultural world, the sameness that pervades workplace monocultures puts them at a significant business disadvantage, while also signaling organizational disregard for corporate social responsibility. Such organizations ultimately see weaker bottom-line results, higher turnover and reputational damage compared with more innovative, profitable and respected diverse-by-design competing organizations.


This points to the benefits of taking immediate steps to examine and potentially modify how organizations consider, value and interact with team members and prospective employees.Instead of ""cultural fit,"" seek out cultural contributorsUnderstanding that organizations are charged with assessing job candidates based on a wide range of attributes, some of which are challenging to qualify, it can be helpful for talent acquisition teams to actively replace the concept of ""cultural fit"" with something specific, though more constructive. Such departments might benefit from the idea of seeking out ""cultural contributors,"" meaning individuals whose perspectives would add to and advance, versus conform to, workplace cultures.The language here is important as the word ""contributors"" signals that the new viewpoints being introduced by increasingly diverse teams are welcome and positive. Of course, this thinking is best reinforced with clear, consistent, ongoing communications and concrete actions across enterprises to ensure it goes beyond mere lip service and leads to meaningful, positive change. As always, employees look to the examples set by top leaders for confirmation of their organizations' lived values, signifying the importance of buy-in and participation among members of the C-suite.Related: Diverse Teams Drive Innovation in Ways Homogeneous Teams Just Can't


Additional steps to fostering heterogeneous culturesRecognizing the risks associated with homogeneous workplaces, a growing number of employers are taking additional steps to make their cultures less conforming. For example, many organizations are focusing strongly on fostering greater awareness and acceptance of individual differences within their recruitment/talent acquisition functions. This reflects the understanding that prospective employees are interviewing organizations all while the organizations are interviewing individuals. Candidates who perceive that employers don't make space for team members' true, authentic selves will increasingly decline to join such companies.On a broader level, many organizations are thinking beyond hiring — investing in enhanced diversity training across departmental areas. The best of these trainings go beyond the largely criticized, ineffective versions of the past, encompassing expertly moderated, interactive group discussions and assessments and measurements of their value to participating individuals and the organization. They also emphasize inclusive leadership, which fosters environments in which all team members can contribute and organizations can benefit from their diverse perspectives and experiences.The most savvy workplaces have made the strategic decision to intentionally infuse enterprises with new cultural competencies that help meet big-picture objectives and drive organizational value. Engaging advisory firms, they embrace a multi-pronged approach including: a discovery phase to determine the organization's current cultural state; a co-created identification of what constitutes a better state; a design and execution with regard to how to pull this new state through all the roles, processes and systems of the organization; and an examination of how well it worked.Big picture, organizations that intentionally form diverse-by-design teams and support them with an inclusive workplace culture drive innovative thinking and long-term success. Achieving this requires companies to look beyond cultural fit, expand their recruiting pools and welcome those who will challenge the status quo.

23,6 Signs You Need an Executive Assistant,"Dec 6, 2023",David Nilssen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/6-signs-you-need-an-executive-assistant/466054,"
If you don't have a virtual or executive assistant, you probably are one.As the boss, you know focusing on high-impact initiatives that drive greater value is crucial. You probably use a suite of productivity tools to help complete administrative tasks. And with well-optimized tools, you can get a lot done.But here's the irony: Your day-to-day productivity habits can keep you from getting to the things that are the highest and best use of your time. You might feel productive without completing what counts.



When quickly moving from task to task, what matters most goes out of focus without noticing. Being busy doesn't equate to being productive. I see entrepreneurs make this mistake all the time.Many signs tell you you're veering into danger, and here are some of the most common I've seen. If you nod yes to any of the following, you might need an executive or virtual assistant.


Related: I Found an Executive Assistant Who Changed My Life — Here's How To Find Yours1. Your inbox is overflowingYou fire off emails all day but never see the bottom of your inbox. As a result, your to-do list gets longer, not shorter, every day, too. Even with organizational tools flagging the ones you want to respond to, essential emails regularly slip through the cracks. And if you're being honest, many action items on your to-do list are overlooked or ignored.2. You struggle with schedulingAre you double-booking yourself? Is work spilling into your personal time? Those are some of the biggest red flags your calendar needs attention. And if you travel, you spend time booking flights, hotels, transfers, meetings and itineraries. You may not consider these tasks a big deal, but look closely, and you'll see how if one thing changes — something always changes — you're stuck dealing with a cascade effect of more booking adjustments.3. Your key partners or business relationships aren't feeling the loveYou aren't maintaining professional relationships if you're bogged down with day-to-day tasks. And if your colleagues aren't top of mind for you, it's unlikely you're top of mind for them. What is this dynamic costing you? When people hear of work your company would be an excellent fit for, they don't think to tell you, so the opportunity goes elsewhere.


4. You're a de facto project managerSo, the new project was your brilliant idea. You're 100% invested in it. But when you sign on to manage it, you're outside of your zone of genius many hours of the week. And if the project is months long, the compound effect of misplaced focus can be hard to overcome.Related: 4 Steps to Prepare to Grow Your Business With Virtual Assistants5. You're becoming a marketing assistantAs the primary face and voice of the company, you care about your messaging. Creating slide decks and social media posts and maintaining a running list of website updates isn't a big deal. Why bother delegating public-facing work when the stakes are high and communicating what to communicate is nuanced and tricky? Because you become the primary marketing assistant many hours a week to keep up with the demand.6. Your expense management is a drainCheck out the state of your accounts receivables and payables. Are late invoices and missed bill payments becoming a repetitive problem? That's a stressful situation turned standard operating procedure. The strain will show in all aspects of your business. I also see many executives habitually put off expense tracking. Many people never submit expense reports, which blows me away!


Executive or virtual assistants perform much more diverse functions than most people realize. Many do far more than just free up time for the CEO. Skilled assistants can significantly increase your capacity and allow anyone with a high volume of repeatable or administrative work to invest their time better.Besides staying on top of email, calendar, travel and expense reports, assistants often manage social media calendars, source job candidates, create onboarding materials, generate financial reports, and handle invoicing, accounts receivable and bookkeeping. Their diverse functions improve not just executive output but also that of the marketing, HR and finance teams.Now, a word of caution: Hiring an executive assistant with years of experience, the competencies you need and a work style that matches yours takes time and discipline. Once you find someone, you'll need to onboard them properly, even if they are perfect.Related: 17 Questions to Ask When Interviewing a Potential Virtual Assistant


If you wait until you're desperate to bring one on, it's easy to shortcut the attention onboarding requires because you're simply ""too busy"" to do it right. Although the right assistant could dynamically change the way you work (for the good!), if there's no way you can make time or if your work is highly technical, a virtual or executive assistant could be an expense you don't need to accrue.Still, if any of the six warning signs are familiar, consider leaping and hiring. And unless you can solve the capacity problem cheaply by reducing your workload or working longer hours — it's not a sustainable solution for most people — I suggest you don't let money be a reason not to hire. As one of my clients says, ""I have an executive assistant to ensure I am invested in those things that are the highest, best use of my time.""If you're all in as the boss, do yourself a favor. Make sure what you do daily is near and dear to your heart. Invest in an executive assistant, and you'll find out that the more effectively you work, the more you can concentrate on the aspects of your business — and life! — that count.

24,"If You Want People to Follow You, Stop Being a Boss — 8 Steps to Truly Effective Leadership","Dec 5, 2023",Scott Deming,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/boss-or-leader-8-principles-to-truly-effective-leadership/465754,"
Throughout my career, I've seen the stark differences between mere bosses and true leaders. These experiences have shaped my leadership approach and fueled my drive to help others become outstanding leaders. In today's ever-changing business world, understanding this distinction is critical. It's more than semantics; it's about inspiring belief in your vision and mission. Drawing from over forty years of experience as a business owner and through extensive leadership presentations and writings, I've delved into what separates leaders from bosses.Boss vs. Leader: Understanding the differenceThe terms 'boss' and 'leader' are often used interchangeably, but they represent vastly different approaches to organizational management. A boss typically focuses on processes, compliance and maintaining the status quo.In contrast, a leader inspires change, fosters a culture of innovation and encourages team growth. This contrast is not just in actions but also in mindset; while a boss thinks about tasks and authority, a leader focuses on people, potential and possibilities.



The leadership gap: A Gallup insightA pivotal 2015 Gallup Poll uncovered a striking truth in the workplace: half of the surveyed employees had left jobs at some point to escape poor management. This finding was a wake-up call, illuminating a critical gap in leadership where inspiration and empowerment should be the norm. The reasons employees leave bosses are multifaceted but often boil down to a few key factors.Firstly, a lack of recognition and appreciation is a common complaint against bosses. Employees feel undervalued when their hard work and achievements go unnoticed. Poor communication by bosses creates a disconnect, leading to confusion and frustration. In contrast, effective leaders excel in acknowledging achievements and communicating clearly and supportively.


Micromanagement, a hallmark of boss-like behavior, stifles creativity and demonstrates a lack of trust, while effective leaders empower their employees, fostering a sense of autonomy and confidence. Similarly, the absence of guidance or support from bosses can leave employees feeling abandoned, whereas leaders actively engage in their team's development and provide consistent support.A boss's negative attitude or lack of empathy can create a toxic work environment. This contrasts sharply with effective leaders, who display empathy and constructiveness, boosting morale and job satisfaction. Furthermore, bosses often fail to provide growth opportunities, leading employees to seek roles with better prospects. Effective leaders, on the other hand, prioritize and nurture their team's growth and development. Leaders who recognize and address these issues can bridge the gap, creating a work environment where employees feel valued, supported and inspired.Related: 5 Reasons Why Leaders Fail 


Case studies in leadershipConsider the dynamic leadership of Rosalind Brewer at Walgreens Boots Alliance. Taking the helm as CEO in 2021, Brewer was pivotal in navigating the company through the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Her focus on digital innovation, customer-centric services and expanding healthcare services illustrates a leadership style that is responsive, forward-thinking and transformative. Brewer's approach underscores the importance of agility and empathy in leadership, especially in times of crisis.Under Brewer's leadership, Walgreens expanded its digital footprint and played a critical role in vaccine distribution, demonstrating how effective leadership can have a profound impact on public health and safety. This case study exemplifies how a leader's vision and decisiveness can drive an organization to new heights, even in the face of global challenges.Similarly, Satya Nadella's leadership transformation at Microsoft has been widely recognized. Shifting the company's focus from purely product-centric to people-centric, Nadella has fostered a culture of learning, innovation, and empathy, which has been instrumental in driving Microsoft's resurgence and success in the tech industry.Having outlined the differences between a boss and a leader, it's time to delve into the eight steps of effective leadership. These foundational principles are designed to inspire, empower and invigorate your team, fueling a passionate pursuit of shared goals.


1. CommunicationEffective leaders recognize the power of communication — it is the tool that bridges gaps, aligns objectives, and fosters a culture of mutual respect and understanding. Communication in leadership is not about issuing orders; it's about opening channels for feedback, encouraging dialogue, and ensuring that every team member feels heard and valued. This two-way communication builds trust, an essential component in any successful team, and creates an environment where ideas can flourish and problems are solved collaboratively.2. Positive reinforcementThe approach to mistakes and failures differentiates a leader from a boss. Where a boss might see a mistake as a failure to be criticized, a leader views it as an opportunity for growth. Positive reinforcement involves recognizing the effort, providing constructive feedback, and encouraging a mindset of continuous learning. This approach not only helps in skill development but also instills a sense of confidence and loyalty within the team, fostering a workplace culture where innovation is encouraged, and risks are viewed as steps towards growth.3. Empowering, not micromanagingEmpowerment is a key trait of effective leadership. It involves trusting the team's capabilities and allowing autonomy in their roles. This empowerment fosters a sense of ownership and responsibility among team members, leading to greater job satisfaction and innovation. In contrast, micromanagement can stifle creativity, lower morale and hinder productivity. Leaders who empower rather than micromanage find their teams are more motivated, creative, and ultimately more effective in achieving organizational goals.Related: How to Strike a Balance Between Micromanaging and Under-Managing


4. Accountability: The leader's creedAccountability is the hallmark of true leadership. Leaders who take responsibility for their actions, regardless of the outcome, earn the respect and trust of their team. This accountability extends to both successes and failures. By owning their decisions and learning from mistakes, leaders demonstrate integrity and a commitment to continuous improvement, setting a powerful example for their teams.5. Creating value through leadershipIn the realm of effective leadership, the focus extends beyond mere metrics and performance indicators to the realm of value creation. This shift involves nurturing the potential of team members, fostering an environment of growth and inspiration, and aligning organizational goals with the personal and professional development of employees. Leaders who focus on creating value understand that the success of an organization is intricately linked to the well-being and growth of its people.Related: Are You a Leader Loyal to Your Values? Here's How to Align Your Leadership Style With Your Values6. Listening is more than hearingActive listening is a crucial skill for effective leaders. It goes beyond simply hearing words; it involves understanding the underlying messages, concerns and ideas of team members. Leaders who listen actively demonstrate respect for their team's opinions and foster a culture of trust and inclusivity. This practice encourages open communication, promotes diverse viewpoints, and leads to more informed and collaborative decision-making.


7. Fairness and equalityLeadership also involves maintaining fairness and equality within the team. This means avoiding favoritism, recognizing and rewarding hard work and innovation, and ensuring that all team members have equal opportunities for growth and development. Leaders who practice fairness create a positive and cohesive team environment where employees feel valued and motivated.Related: How to Identify and Nurture the Leadership Potential of Your Employees8. Cultivating future leadersOne of the most important roles of a leader is to mentor and develop future leaders. This involves guiding employees in their current roles and inspiring them to take on leadership positions themselves. By sharing knowledge, offering guidance, and providing opportunities for growth, leaders can ensure a legacy of strong, effective leadership within the organization.What really defines a leader isn't how well they can give orders, but how they lift others up, spark inspiration and innovation, and guide their team towards greater heights. True leaders cultivate growth, draw out the best in people, and steer everyone toward shared victories. In this fast-paced and ever-changing business world, the need for sincere and impactful leadership is more important than ever.

26,From Passive to Resilient — These 7 Strategies Will Empower Your Team to Thrive Through Change,"Nov 29, 2023",Murali Nethi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/7-ways-to-empower-your-team-to-thrive-through-change/465267,"
Change is hard. Yet change is also necessary for organizations to adapt, evolve and stay relevant in today's dynamic world. However, change that is not managed effectively often leads to employee resistance. This resistance can sabotage even the best-intended transformations.To successfully implement organizational change, leaders must utilize sound change management strategies. Change management is guiding an organization through transitioning from its current state to its desired future state. It involves preparing employees for changes, equipping them to adopt changes, and sustaining momentum to ensure they stick.Let's explore some key change management strategies that can help organizations navigate transformations smoothly and minimize resistance from employees.Related: Change Is a Team Sport — So Every Player Needs to Own It. Here's How to Get Everyone Involved.1. Communicate the need for changeOne of the biggest reasons change initiatives fail is a lack of open and frequent communication. Employees want - and need - to understand why change is happening, what will be changing, and how it will impact them. They also want their concerns to be heard. As such, over-communicating is crucial during times of transition.



Schedule regular updates to provide clarity and reassurance. Be transparent about both the challenges as well as opportunities change presents. Answer questions promptly and clearly. Communicate using multiple channels - email, one-on-ones, town halls, Yammer, etc. And encourage two-way dialogue so you can address issues as they arise. Consistent communication will help reduce uncertainty and build trust that you have employees' best interests in mind.Related: How to Harness the Power of Change in Entrepreneurship2. Involve employees in the processPeople are much more willing to accept change when they feel they have a role in shaping it. Whenever possible, involve employees in envisioning and planning for change. Solicit feedback on proposed changes through surveys. Create cross-functional task forces to tackle issues and generate new ideas. You can also run pilot programs to test solutions before full implementation.You can develop more creative and practical solutions by including employee perspectives and expertise. You'll also gain buy-in since staff had a hand in the process. Just provide regular updates on how their input was incorporated or why certain suggestions couldn't be adopted.


Related: How To Create a Work Culture Where Everyone Has A Voice3. Provide support and trainingChange requires adaptability that doesn't come naturally or easily for many. Supporting employees through the transition professionally and personally will go a long way toward smoother change adoption.Offer dynamic, robust training and development opportunities to build new skills. Provide coaching or mentoring programs. Create flexible, temporary roles for those struggling so talent isn't lost. Make EAP (employee assistance programs) accessible for those needing additional support. Check in frequently through one-on-ones to address concerns promptly. Recognize efforts openly with appreciation to boost morale.Caring, holistic support demonstrates that you value staff and want them to thrive - not just cope - through change. It fosters resilience and makes people more open to what may initially feel threatening or undesirable.


4. Leverage early adoptersWhile change can be difficult for the majority, there will always be a subset of 'early adopters' who readily embrace new ideas. Identify and engage this influential group from the get-go to help advocate for and model change behaviors.Ask early adopters to actively participate in task forces or lead training sessions. Highlight their achievements and successes to showcase incentives for adopting change. Encourage them to serve as mentors and support systems for others struggling more. Provide a forum like Yammer where they can discuss benefits and troubleshoot together.Tap into early adopters' contagious enthusiasm and expertise to ease others into changes at their own pace. Their buy-in gives social proof that change can be a good thing well worth adopting.5. Align incentives and accountabilityFor change initiatives to be sustainable long-term, they need clear ties to organizational goals that people are measured and incentivized against. Connect change milestones to individual performance reviews and compensation metrics or evolve role responsibilities to drive new priorities.


Be sure goals are specific, measurable, and have reasonable timelines. Try tracking progress publicly to signal strategic focus and importance. Highlight role models who embody the evolving culture through reward and recognition programs. Address poorly aligned behaviors promptly with guidance and coaching before escalating to discipline.6. Be patient and celebrate successesCultural change takes intentional effort sustained over months or even years. Expect some missteps and pushback as people grapple with adjusting to new paradigms and letting go of habits they're used to. Accept that change won't happen everywhere uniformly or on the same timeline for all.Rather than punish what's not going perfectly right away, focus on praising even small accomplishments and steps in the desired direction. Frequently mark milestones achieved and share qualitative or quantitative results transparently across teams. Recognize that people want to feel successful and appreciated, not just chastised for falling short.Gradual, sustained progress sustained by celebration builds momentum and affirmatively shapes new norms, which is the ultimate goal of any organizational change initiative.


7. Lead from the frontAbove all, leaders must authentically role model change themselves. People will watch to see if new behaviors are genuinely endorsed from the top or just nice ideas imposed on others. Live an organization's evolving values in your own actions, decisions and communications and continually develop skills the change demands.Related: A True Leader Doesn't Just Talk the Talk — They Walk the Walk. Here's How to Lead from the Front.The conclusionUltimately, transformational change depends on leaders wholeheartedly embracing evolution both professionally and personally. Walking the talk consistently signals strategic importance and brings others along on the journey. With the right strategies and steadfast leadership, organizational change can empower continuous improvement.If your retail organization wants to update your point-of-sale (POS) system to meet the needs of today's customers better and drive future growth, consider implementing Hana Retail as your solution.

27,How Neurodiverse Talent Can Boost Your Business and the Broader Community,"Nov 27, 2023",Keith Wargo,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-neurodiverse-talent-can-boost-your-business-and-the/465144,"
My autistic son AJ's first job was at a grocery store. We learned interacting with customers was a challenge, so it wasn't a great fit for him. He then tried his hand at caddying, but the level of attention and stamina needed proved difficult. He also tried warehouse jobs but the environment proved to be overwhelming for him with loud noises and the hectic pace.At every corner of the job hunt, AJ also ran into issues of misconceptions and stereotypes, often leading to biases, communication barriers in the workplace like deciphering social cues, rigid workplace structures that left little room for accommodation and flexibility, and face-to-face interviews over task-based assignments, reflecting traditional hiring protocols rather than a more inclusive approach.But we kept hope, and soon after, AJ landed a job at a hospital with a program tailored for young adults with autism. They assessed his strengths, and we learned a lot about his skills, which turned out to be basic computer tasks and data entry, and not manual labor and interacting with patients. 



Throughout this journey, and through my son's eyes, I've gained an intimate understanding of the challenges and triumphs that come with living with a developmental disability — in search of fulfilling and dignified employment. But my story as a parent, and AJ's story as an autistic job seeker, are not unique. Related: What Is the Economic Impact of Hiring Autistic, Neurodivergent and Disabled Talent? Here's What You Should Know.


The benefits of hiring neurodiverse talentBecause of outdated stigmas and beliefs, only one in five people with disabilities, including those with autism, are employed, despite many having the skillset and desire to work. Hiring neurodiverse people benefits them, the companies they work for and the overall economy. A study by Accenture, American Association of People with Disabilities and Disability:IN reported that companies that actively seek to employ people with disabilities outperform businesses that do not. Their revenues, net income and profit margins were all higher. At the national level, their analyses revealed that U.S. GDP could get a boost of up to US $25 billion if more people with disabilities joined the labor force.If you look closer at the data, fostering an inclusive, neurodiverse workforce can also decrease support costs, lower employee turnover and increase customer satisfaction. The Department of Labor, for instance, found that employers who embraced disability saw a 90% increase in employee retention. More broadly, benefits can include increased creativity and innovation in the workplace, financial independence, which grows consumer spending, a breakdown of stereotypes, and reduced social stigma and discrimination. In other words, inclusion is not only the smart thing to do but the right thing to do.


At Autism Speaks, our autistic employees thrive across various departments, including marketing, communications, services & supports and science. Their unique insights have enriched our company culture, promoting collaboration and empathy. Additionally, we've gained insight into the challenges the autism community faces in employment, from hiring obstacles to retention issues.Related: How Leaders Can Support and Embrace The Untapped Potential of Neurodiverse TalentHow to build a more inclusive workforceWhat have we learned along the way? Here are three key lessons we encourage companies to adopt to build a more inclusive workforce:1. Shake up the recruitment process: Autism affects communication, making traditional hiring practices challenging for neurodivergent individuals. From job searches, résumé crafting and interview scheduling to challenges with organization and time management, these steps can be overwhelming. Given their unique expression, neurodivergent candidates often find these norms stressful compared to their neurotypical counterparts. By recognizing these barriers, employers can implement alternative interviews and allow autistic candidates to showcase their work instead of verbally describing it.


2. Leverage training and embrace diversity: Beyond recruitment, a supportive environment for autistic individuals requires employers taking the lead on integrating inclusive training programs. Whether online or in-person, training — like our Autism Speaks Workplace Inclusion Now program — can guide employers on how best to make the recruitment process more accessible, encourage inclusion and diversity, foster acceptance and empower autistic employees. Training on self-advocacy and navigating challenges at work can also empower autistic staff. Given that many autistic adults belong to multiple marginalized groups, these trainings are crucial for workplace inclusion and well-being.3. Adopt flexible work environments: Offering flexible work hours, personalized workspace adjustments, and when feasible, remote work options can make a significant difference in the comfort and productivity of neurodiverse employees.Flexible work hours allow autistic employees to work during times when they feel most productive, accommodating for differences in sleep patterns, peak cognitive periods or the need to avoid crowded commutes that might be stressful. Remote work options enable those who thrive in a familiar, controlled environment to do so, reducing anxiety that can come with office settings and allowing for a customized sensory workspace.Personalized adjustments, such as customizable lighting, noise-cancelling headphones or specific software that assists with organization, empower autistic employees to perform at their best by minimizing potential stressors. Collectively, these adjustments not only enhance comfort and productivity but also send a strong message of acceptance and respect for neurodiversity in the workplace.


Related: 5 Steps to Building a Supportive and Inclusive Workplace for Neurodiverse EmployeesToday, my son AJ works virtually at Ventures ATL, a nonprofit whose mission is to provide opportunities for meaningful and sustainable employment to qualified adults with autism or other developmental differences. He finds pride and purpose in his role, even without the typical office environment. Securing this job has allowed AJ to move into his own place earlier this year. The pride and relief of witnessing his step into independence were tinged with a parent's unique anxiety. Yet, as we parted, AJ's confident gaze spoke volumes about his readiness for what lies ahead. His personal and professional journey symbolizes the potential within the neurodiverse community, urging us to champion understanding and inclusion and to redefine how we nurture talent in our workplaces.

29,5 Harsh Realities About Starting a Business Today — And What to Do About Them,"Nov 22, 2023",Mike Kappel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/tactical-solutions-to-5-frequent-business-obstacles/463911,"
Starting and growing a business is tougher today than ever before. You have to hire, manage and process payroll and are likely in charge of keeping the books and staying updated on tax laws. You might also have to deal with (and bounce back from) supply chain issues and the occasional emergency amid ample economic uncertainty. Operating an enterprise, therefore, is not for the faint of heart. Whether you are a principal in an existing one or are thinking of taking the leap, it's wise to consider the most pressing challenges you'll be up against.1. Hiring and managingFinding employees — and ensuring that they're the right ones — is, of course, vital. The average hiring process lasts three to six weeks, and if you don't have a dedicated HR professional (or team) doing this work, it'll be necessary to put other responsibilities on hold to do so.

30,This Simple Hand-Written Chart Will Help You Make the Best Hires,"Nov 17, 2023",Scott Greenberg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/boost-your-hiring-success-with-this-simple-tool/465376,"
As with other areas of running your franchise, hiring requires a great deal of self-discipline. Emotions can cloud your judgment, causing you to overlook good people and hire the wrong people. For effective hiring, you need objectivity and clarity of mind. That can't happen until you look inward and recognize your biases. Labor laws protect workers from mistreatment and help level the playing field by prohibiting bias based on what a person ""is."" That's good for employers as well. It forces them to look beyond stereotypes and consider quality candidates their prejudices might have ruled out. The world is better with less prejudice. It's morally wrong and bad for business. But everyone brings their unconscious preferences into hiring, even with the best intentions. It's easy to take mental shortcuts that lead to inaccurate conclusions.Psychologists have identified many biases that cause people to rush to judgment. For example, there's the halo effect, where a person clings to one quality they like in someone and disregards everything else. The opposite would be the horn effect, being unable to let go of that one thing you don't like. Focusing too much on the things you have in common with someone is an example of affinity bias. Confirmation bias causes us to seek out others who share the same perspectives. Beauty bias speaks for itself. I made a lot of mistakes those first few years, but I also got lucky and acquired some winners. Reflecting on these hires over time, both good and bad, helped me refine our hiring practices. By knowing what to look for and exercising more self-control, it became easier to identify the right people and weed out the wrong people.Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now and take this quiz to find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.



Likable Candidates vs. Qualified CandidatesThere are four possible outcomes from employee recruiting:You hire the right person.You don't hire the right person.You hire the wrong person.You don't hire the wrong person.Your goal is to hire the right people and not hire the wrong people. But most employers don't have a good process for this. They just meet applicants and hire the ones who feel right. ""I go with my gut,"" they often say. If your gut consistently identifies the right people, then keep going — you're doing better than the rest of us. And even if you have good instincts, it's hard to pass them on to your managers.Likeability is what we look for socially. For a job applicant, we need the most qualified candidate and the best cultural fit. That could include someone who's likable, but that's not enough to go on. Unchecked, our emotions and subjectivity can lead to bad hiring decisions. To minimize this risk, we need to create objective, replicable hiring systems. I recommend using what's called a hiring matrix.


Related: I've Interviewed and Hired Thousands of People. Here's What to Keep in Mind Before Offering the Job.Using a Hiring MatrixA hiring matrix will allow you to numerically score a candidate against a list of traits you believe are most important for the job you're trying to fill. The candidate with the highest cumulative score is the one most qualified for the job. The first step is to identify the essential characteristics for each position.I like to look at my best current and past employees and list the traits they share. Different jobs will require different characteristics. Employees who interact with customers need different qualities than ones who work in the back, for example. For each position you have to fill, what are the most important qualities you need in a person doing that work?Related: Is It Really That Hard to Find Good Employees?Once you have your list, decide if any of these qualities are considerably more important than the others. For example, maybe you've noticed your best salespeople are extremely driven. For you, ""drive"" may be twice as important as other traits, such as ""experience."" This list of traits is the criteria by which you or your managers will evaluate job candidates. For each trait, you'll assign candidates a score. A simple one to five scoring system works for me, but you may want to go to ten. For any traits you've decided are the most important, double the score.After the interviews, you can add up the scores and see who has the highest number. Clearly there's still plenty of subjectivity in the process. But at least now you and your managers are focusing on specific traits rather than just deciding if you like the person. If multiple people are evaluating the candidates, you can combine all your scores and use that total to decide whom to hire. (Empathy is by far the most important, so you'll double the score for that one.) Your hiring matrix will look like the example below:


Related: Tips for Overcoming Early HR HurdlesAnother step you could take is to create a standard list of questions that shed light on each of these traits. For example, to check for compassion, you might ask, ""How can you tell when someone needs help?"" or, ""Tell me the steps you go through to provide comfort."" For responsibility, you might ask, ""Under what circumstances have people depended on you?"" You can research the web for other questions associated with just about any trait you can think of. Experiment and see what works best. The farther you can get away from, ""Tell me a little bit about yourself,"" the greater the chance you'll get the information you need.Change the process however you like, but keep it simple. The overall goal is to move away from likability and broad subjective impressions and focus on what really matters. Spend time on your staffing. Hire slowly and carefully. Your employees are the stewards and ambassadors of your business. You're putting your wealth in their hands, so hold out until you can find truly great people. Then prepare for the most important work you'll do in business — keeping them great.

31,This Is the Key Factor for Hiring a Cohesive Team,"Nov 17, 2023",Scott Greenberg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/this-is-the-key-factor-for-hiring-a-cohesive-franchise-team/465364,"
Before I became a franchise coach and speaker, I owned multiple Edible Arrangements franchises. I will admit here that it took a few years of trial and error to dial in my hiring and management skills. I went through a lot of employees, tried many management techniques, and took a lot of Advil, but eventually, I turned a corner. I got better at hiring, learned how to motivate employees and engage them in the business, and got them working as a team. Morale increased, along with retention.I used to complain about my employees, but now I was giving thanks for them. They would win awards, earn stellar online reviews, look out for the business, solve problems, and have each other's backs. They'd enable me to stay home or travel to a speech. They'd save me time, reduce my stress, and make me money. By the time I sold the business, most of my team had been with me for years. I'm still in touch with most of them. I've come to believe that never before has the workforce offered such a great pool of candidates. In the right environment, today's young people will work hard and produce, remain loyal, collaborate, and innovate. All this while still checking their cell phones.Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now and take this quiz to find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.Team Building vs. Team CohesionAnybody can assemble a group of talented people and call them a team. But that's like buying flour, sugar, and butter and calling them a cake. It's not enough to have the right ingredients. What matters is how they combine. Wealthy franchisees don't just fill positions. One person at a time, they carefully construct a supergroup of employees who excel individually and work together to support one another. They cultivate cohesive teams.



Cohesive teams do more than fulfill their responsibilities—they work to become a stronger and better working unit. They're in it as much for each other as for themselves. Their shared purpose is at the center of their bond. Think of a great sports team growing closer over their mutual desire to be champions, or an aspiring rock band connecting over a shared dream of hitting it big. They're emotionally invested in their work, not just out of personal interest, but because that's how they experience their connection to each other. Nothing makes people happier than making meaningful connections to others. If you can give your employees a feeling of belonging, they'll care a lot more about their work. That's good for them and good for business.Team cohesion among hourly workers isn't some idealistic fantasy. It happens all the time. You can facilitate those bonds among your own team, but only if you hire the right people and are deliberate about building your company culture.Related: Become a Franchise Owner in 5 Easy Steps


Defining Your CultureEvery business has a culture — some by design, most by default. Within every group, there is a shared set of beliefs — sometimes unspoken — and a set of behaviors that determine how things are done and how it feels to do them. Wealthy franchisees have a deliberate focus on the culture of their business. They use that word a lot, too:""We spend a lot of time working on our culture.""""They need to share the same values as our culture.""""I only hire people who fit with our culture.""I hear comments like these constantly from wealthy franchisees. They understand that how employees feel working together directly impacts the quality of the work they do together. The relationships within a business are as vital as the systems in that business.Much of how business is done isn't about work, but about social interaction. How do people greet and support each other? Are they competitive or are they collaborative? Do they work as a team or do they break into cliques? Do they speak lovingly or critically about customers? The answers to these questions will remain in your business longer than the employees who created them. Team members come and go, but culture remains. If you don't purposely establish the behavioral norms of your business, they evolve on their own.Related: The Secret to a Successful Franchise? A 'Community'-Based BusinessAptitude and AttitudeThe success formula for franchisees is Circumstances + Operations + Humanity = Results. And that also applies to employees. These are the things we look at when evaluating them. Employee circumstances are obvious things like age, availability, or physical ability (if the job requires it). There's not much gray area when it comes to their circumstances. We should be able to check for these (legally and appropriately) before the interview.The in-person meeting is about operations and humanity. The operational piece is their aptitude: Do they have the abilities and skills they need to learn and perform the required work? The humanity piece is their attitude. Do they have the right willingness and energy level? Do they have sufficient social competence? Can they work with a team, or, if the job requires it, can they excel on their own? 


Attitude, however — the human factor — should be great from the start. That doesn't necessarily mean they must be outgoing and energetic. It just means they should demonstrate the soft skills needed to thrive in your culture. Most workplace problems are rooted in attitude, so keep that in mind when staffing. Wealthy franchisees hire for attitude and train for aptitude.

32,I Found an Executive Assistant Who Changed My Life — Here's How To Find Yours,"Nov 3, 2023",Cheri Beranek,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-find-an-executive-assistant-that-will-change-your/464375,"
When I hired my executive assistant (EA), Kristina, I was far too late. Far, far too late — I had been president of a growing company in a fast-paced industry for 25 years before I finally took the plunge. If I could go back, I would have hired an EA 25 years earlier.I was going through a divorce when I started Clearfield, and the work in worry-world became so absolute in my mind that I could no longer see the forest through the trees. I hit a breaking point. Maybe if I had an EA then, they would have recognized that.Fortunately, I had support from the CFO and COO, who had my back and picked up the pieces I dropped while navigating that personal crisis. I'm thankful we have a culture in which no one ever says, ""That's not my job."" But if I look at it critically now, I see how much more effective it would have been for us if I had hired an executive assistant early on: My partners could have worked on more strategic tasks or enhanced their own personal development. I could have, too.



Once I finally hired the right EA, she changed my life. Here's how to find one to change yours:Related: How Entrepreneurs Can Leverage an Executive Assistant For Success and Peace of Mind


Involve others to help find your matchFinding the right EA is kind of like getting married. We look for someone with the same values and the same sense of what clutter is so we can trust that individual to anticipate our world after we've been together a little while. In marriage, however, we get to date and find out first if we might be compatible. In the business world, we have to jump into that EA marriage and try it out to know whether or not it will ultimately work. In my case, I had a couple of false starts.A couple of times, I thought we found the right person. One was so much like me, but the HR manager pointed out, ""You two would fight like cats and dogs."" Just like friends and family can give us relationship advice before getting married, a team of others who know what we would want from an EA will help us find the right match.Instead of making a quick hiring decision based on surface-level capabilities, we took the time to vet someone through several layers of people who knew me well. Rather than going through our recruiter, the Vice President of HR took on the initiative personally — he knew me and the physical capabilities and personality traits I would want beyond the job description. Not only did I interview each individual, but so did the HR team and my entire executive staff. Sometimes, they knew me better than I knew myself. With their help in the EA dating process, I landed on the right individual who would improve my life.Related: The 3-Step Process to Hiring Your First Assistant


Have tenacious patienceOne of our new company phrases is ""tenacious patience,"" reflecting the waiting happening in our industry right now as we gear up for a federally-funded deployment of nationwide broadband. It has also applied to my process of hiring an EA. With tenacious patience, the right individual will come along.This starts with putting effort into a detailed job description. A proper vetting process is only worth the time if we attract the right type of candidates, so start with a clear description of what the job will entail. One of the hurdles I faced in hiring an EA was never believing it would amount to a full-time job. Now, with only 80 percent of my EA's time, I realize how much more of it I could use, but at the time, we went into hiring with the idea the role would support two other executives. I wrote out the specific objectives we hoped the role would accomplish, itemizing how the EA would spend time with everyone and clarifying responsibilities. I then passed that description through a broader network of people within the company to review and edit into a final copy.Once we had the right candidates, we put them through a round of screening interviews, followed by final interviews with me and my team. We had nearly reached the end of the process when someone on my staff recommended another individual. So, we went through the full screening and final interviews again. Then, I found an individual I thought was the right person for the job, and we held another round of interviews, but this time, my staff said no. Not until the third round did we find the right individual, but everyone agreed Kristina was the one — the system worked with enough time and tenacious patience to get through it.Related: Four ways to effectively use an executive assistant


Anyone can take advantage of the benefitsIf we take a strategic and critical look into our work lives, we could all find areas where — when uncluttered with busy work — we could be more effective in our positions of supervision, management, and strategy. Thanks to technology, virtual executive assistants can offer lower-cost solutions to minimize some of that clutter and free up brain space for more productive leadership. Some leaders might think hiring an EA means having to give up their busy work, but with an EA to strategically manage my time, I have found they eliminate the busy work so no one has to do it. Instead, I get to do more of the work I love with less of the worry.

33,How to Manage These 6 Different Workplace Personality Types,"Nov 1, 2023",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-manage-these-6-different-workplace-personalities/459634,"
I've been on a 15-year journey of going from ""bad boss"" (more like ""terrible"" boss) to ""good boss"" (okay, I'll settle for ""better"" boss). Ideas, vision and content are my thing, not so much how to expertly manage all the different kinds of people who have worked for me over the years.Nowadays, my company is stable, my clients are happy and my team is amazing. But that wasn't always the case. There was a time when I embraced the philosophy of ""equal management for all."" When that didn't produce the desired results, I realized I had to pivot to a more individualized approach to managing and motivating my people.I started noticing who responds best to what and which personality types reach their full potential under which types of leadership. Here are a few pages from my notes on cultivating and nurturing the best team possible.



Speaking to your staff members in their own languageIt's a given that everyone is unique and that no one fits precisely into a particular mold (who'd want that, anyway?). Nevertheless, there are some basic categories, generally speaking, with which your team members' personalities will naturally align. Individuality at work is actually much preferred to uniformity, but you also can't have each member running their own race, by their own rules.To leverage each person's strengths to the advantage of both your company and your clients, consider these tips on taming certain personality traits that might be restraining talents or hindering performance.


Related: 10 Ways to Make Your Employees 10x More Productive#1: The detail-oriented perfectionistThough not everyone appreciates ""the stickler,"" I, for one, do. Yes, they can get lost in the forest for the trees (sometimes even the leaves), but you're sure to have someone on staff who sees only the big picture (on my staff, that's me!), and the perfectionist serves as the yin to that yang, adding their microvision to the organization's macrovision. This person's ""love language"" is clear direction:Provide them with as much detail as possible when you assign them tasks.When they invariably pose questions, answer them quickly and thoroughly, then follow up by asking if they have all the information they need to proceed.Opt for a phone call here over an email, in which you're sure to leave something out, simply because your brain doesn't work like theirs.Related: Being in a Bad Mood Could Make You Better At Your Job, According to a New Study#2: The defensive type who doesn't take feedback wellNo doubt you'll encounter someone who is great at their job but not so great when you need to provide input on how to do that job. Often, defensiveness stems from insecurity born long ago, and while you can't make this person more comfortable receiving constructive criticism, you can gently guide them toward less defensiveness by putting them at ease with certain tactics:


Whenever possible, communicate personally with this person — a Zoom chat or a phone call; texts and emails can be misinterpreted and exacerbate issues.Make this person feel secure (the antidote to insecurity). Let them know, often and openly, how safe their place on your team is and how valuable their contributions are.Always employ the ""sandwich method"": words of praise, necessary feedback, more praise.#3: The wannabe coach instead of field playerIt can be a blessing to have someone on your team who wants to be the leader instead of being led. But your job is already taken. So, how do you handle someone who wants to take charge when you're the boss in charge?Recognize this personality's need to lead something and give them something to lead: a department, a niche of the business, a particular client list.Allow this person their domain, show trust in their competency and let them direct what they prove themself good at directing.Even while you're granting them space to flex their leadership muscles, though, have regular check-ins to manage expectations and job parameters. Loosen and tighten the reins a bit as you deem fit to grant them freedom to oversee without inviting them to overstep.Related: You're the Reason Your Sales Reps Quit. Here's What to Do About It.#4: The overly confident typePeople who lack self-confidence respond well to a lot of hand-holding and assurance to help them find their inner strength. People who have an overabundance of confidence are often masking self-doubts and perceived deficiencies behind a veil of bravado. What's common to both types? They both need extra support to get more in tune with a healthy balance of self-regard. When dealing with a ""know-it-all"" whose confidence in their skills might exceed those skills somewhat:Red-line their work as needed — no long, drawn-out criticisms and explanations or lecturing that would just be met with resistance. Simply show in black-and-white the tweaks that would elevate their output with the goal of them noticing their own areas for improvement.Communicate with this person via email to keep discussions more objective and focused.Don't give an arrogant attitude less support because it seems so self-sufficient; give this person more to demonstrate where and how direction is needed.#5: The low-motivation employeeYou might ask, ""Why would I hire someone who isn't self-motivated?"" The answer lies in their impressive skill set or proven track record, and the operative word here is ""self."" When someone isn't self-motivated, that doesn't mean they can't make a stellar contribution; it just means you have to step in as the motivating force. Some employees just need their boss to push them — they expect the supervision and react favorably to the encouragement.


Send many reminders: upcoming projects, pending deadlines and expected benchmarks. They may not look at the clock naturally, but your notifications will prompt them to.Guide them to find what lights their fire (music? balancing budgets? travel?), and then incorporate those identified passions into their job function to light a fire under them.Make sure they're aware that you support their work-life balance. Often, with the right leader behind them permitting them to be who they are, the employee will discover their own well of motivation.#6: The challenged organizerWe all can't be good at everything, right? You'll likely have a staffer who's long on creativity and resourcefulness but short on time management and prioritization. When it comes to the more disorganized personality, add order to their workflow in a variety of ways:Require them to use your company's project management software to automate and track job progress.Use the ""buddy system"" when applicable, teaming them up with someone stronger where they're weaker to model desired performance and promote accountability.Talk to them candidly about the lack of organization you've observed, then ask them outright what you can do and what tools you can provide to support their process for job completion.Sure, there are a lot more types of people you'll work with and a lot more techniques for helping them achieve their personal best. But if you take the time to learn what drives them and what fuel they need to drive most efficiently, your management style can help get them out of their own way and on the surefire path to their highest potential.

35,How to Create a Strategic Hiring Plan,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-create-a-strategic-hiring-plan/459473,"
One of the beauties of being an entrepreneur, as opposed to a solo practitioner or freelancer, is that you can leverage the activities and skills of all the people you employ. This is one of the secrets to building a personal fortune. And it's one you can use even if you didn't happen to be born with a silver spoon in your mouth or an oil well in your backyard.The decision of how many people you want to manage is entirely up to you. It depends on the time commitment you cannot make to do other tasks or the need to perform skills that aren't your strengths. Part of hiring other people is to have them handle aspects of the business that you cannot or should not be doing. After all, we have different personalities, interests, and passions.There are very few one-person businesses unless you are including independent contractors. Businesses are run by teams of people, from two or three to thousands, and team members excel in many areas. You also need to factor in how much you expect to grow. Some entrepreneurs want to retain a small, easy-to-manage business, while others want to build an empire.Organization Chart""For many businesses, personnel is the largest expense, so it's important to think through the forecast and make adjustments to the timing of planned hiring based on your revenue projections, profitability, and the cash you have available to meet payroll obligations,"" says Noah Parsons, COO at Palo Alto Software. ""You'll also want to think about how your business is organized and what the management structure will look like. You can use tools such as an organizational chart to help figure out your personnel plan and then add that to your business plan.



An organizational chart, or org chart, graphically sorts your company into its major functional departments—finance, administration, marketing, production, etc. It's the quickest, clearest way to say who is in charge of what and who reports to whomHiring ConsiderationsTo help you in your strategic staffing projections, consider these factors:What are your key business objectives? (Hint: These may be things such as increasing sales or reducing costs. The idea is to make sure that your hiring decisions fit your strategy. If, for example, geographically expanding your retail store chain is a primary objective, a staffing plan will have to include managers for each new location.)What skills will your employees need?What new skills will current employees need to possess? (Hint: You may find you are better off with fewer workers who are more highly trained or have different skill sets.)Which of these skills are central to your business—your core competencies? (Hint: You may want to outsource peripheral functions. Accounting, legal matters, and human resources are frequently outsourced by companies whose main business is elsewhere and who find it doesn't make sense to spend the effort to attract and retain skilled employees in these areas.)List the jobs and job descriptions of the people it will take to provide these skills. (Hint: The idea here is to identify the employees whose job titles may mask their actual function in the organization so you can figure out how many people, and what type of people you really need to include.)Determine how many people you will be hiring and what your budget will be for these positions. Will there be any job sharing? (Hint: Make sure your salaries are commensurate with the going rates in your region. If you can pay more, you can attract a higher level of employees. If you pay less, try to find nonmonetary benefits that you can offer, such as telecommuting, which saves employees time and money on getting to and from work each day.)Now, you should be able to accurately predict how many and what kind of people you need to achieve your long-term objectives.Adding and Retaining Key Employees If you want your business to grow, you'll want to have key employees who share your vision and goals. Sometimes, you will find an established individual, like a highly acclimated chef for your restaurant or an art director with years of experience for your company. You may not always know what the future holds when you bring someone on board, but you believe they have what it takes to become a key employee. These are individuals that you can envision moving up the path of ascension. Either way, you should make it clear in your business plan which key positions you want to fill and how you plan to find the people to fill those roles.


Of course, the economy will factor into your decision on whom to hire and how much you can afford to pay them. In a struggling economy, more highly skilled employees will be seeking work, but you may be unable to risk high salaries. In such instances, you may opt for trial periods before committing to full-time salaries. You may also look for independent contractors for key positions. Remember, it's much easier to find skilled people in various aspects of business than it is to learn everything yourself. When the economy is going well, however, you will have to up the ante to bring on key employees because there is more competition. Then there is your plan to hold onto key employees, which is important to include in your business plan.An organizational chart graphically sorts your company into its major functional departments—finance, administration, marketing, production, etc. It's the quickest, clearest way to say who is in charge of what and who reports to whom.What Employees WantThe things that make employees want to come to work for you and stay vary. For employees, choosing whom to work for is a highly personal decision. That's why it's crucial to understand the individual needs of your key employees so that you can give them exactly what they want. If you offer only a higher salary to an employee whose most important concern is that she works at a job offering flexible hours so she can care for an elderly parent, then you probably won't retain that employee.Here are some common concerns that drive employment decisions:Benefits Paid holidays and sick leave, health insurance, and retirement plans such as 401(k)s are among the benefits listed as most desirable by employees.Compensation Salary, bonuses, stock options, profit sharing, and auto mileage allowances are among the most important compensation issues to employees.Other perks On-site childcare, flexible schedules, telecommuting, paid memberships to business groups, and health perks such as yoga classes or free medical screenings are also important to employees


This list is by no means comprehensive. Employee needs are as complex as humanity. One person may stay because she likes the view out her window on a high floor; somebody in an identical office may leave because heights make him nervous. One of the most important needs, especially for highly motivated employees, is maintaining a constant atmosphere of learning, challenge, and advancement. If you can find a way to let your employees grow as your company does and feel a sense of ownership and inclusion, they're likely to be more conscientious and motivated.

36,Applying to Work at Major Companies on LinkedIn Can Feel Like a Shot in the Dark. Here's Where You Have the Best Chance — and the Worst.,"Oct 26, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/the-most-and-least-competitive-major-companies-for/464372,"
If you've ever wanted to work for one of your favorite companies — whether it be a tech giant like Apple or a fashion service like Stitch Fix — you might have navigated to its job posting on LinkedIn, seen that hundreds of applications were submitted within hours and wondered if you even had a shot.Not surprisingly, some of the biggest names in American business do tend to be the most competitive, but others aren't exactly flooded with applicants. In fact, despite a gradually cooling job market in the U.S., economists maintain that employees are in a great position to negotiate and job hop, CNBC reported earlier this year.Related: After 526 Rejected Job Applications, I Broke Through. So Can You.



So, what are your chances as an applicant at a household name company, really? What are the most — and least — competitive companies for job seekers? A new study from Resume.io set out to answer that question by analyzing data from LinkedIn.Based on the average number of daily job applicants to job postings, Resume.io determined the 20 companies where getting hired might be particularly difficult and the 20 where it might not be so hard after all.

37,Employers Are Complaining They Can't Find Qualified Talent — Turns Out They Might Be the Problem.,"Oct 25, 2023",Gleb Tsipursky,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/cant-find-qualified-talent-heres-the-truth-behind-why/463651,"
Employers across industries bemoan the difficulty of finding qualified talent. With Baby Boomers retiring in droves and a smaller Gen Z cohort entering the workforce, many companies face real skills shortages. Yet, at the same time, legions of capable workers, especially caregivers, find themselves shut out of employment altogether due to inflexible employer attitudes. The solution? Forward-looking companies willing to be flexible and reimagine traditional career paths stand to gain access to a deep well of hidden talent.Related: Back In The Office? Why Your Company's One-Size-Fits-All Approach Is Destined to Fail.Employers are failing an underutilized talent poolThe numbers tell a clear story. Women have borne the brunt of caregiving duties in most societies, and they continue to do so. Per a new paper based on research conducted jointly by the Harvard Business School and global consulting firm Accenture, while women make up roughly half of the full-time U.S. civilian workforce, they comprise a sizable 72% majority of part-time workers. Looking closer, an overwhelming 91% of part-time workers caring for children under 18 years old are women.



With the costs of high-quality childcare skyrocketing year after year, many parents, particularly mothers, find themselves unable to justify full-time employment. At the same time, populations are rapidly aging in numerous advanced economies. More and more of these ""sandwich generation"" workers must care for aging parents in addition to their own children. These pressing caregiving obligations frequently force highly qualified, experienced professionals to accept part-time jobs when they would prefer full-time work.The researchers from HBS and Accenture discovered that nearly 30% of part-time employees work reduced hours specifically due to caregiving duties. Moreover, over 40% of part-time workers surveyed indicated that they would work more hours if their personal circumstances allowed it.


The data decisively indicates that vast numbers of capable, eager-to-work professionals, most of them women, find themselves underemployed in part-time roles or out of work entirely because of inflexible employer norms. With the right workplace policies emphasizing flexibility, this underutilized talent pool could contribute so much more.Other evidence supports this study. For example, according to a white paper by health and wellness product retailer Carewell, that surveyed 1,000 working caregivers, on average, spent 21 hours a week providing care, so the equivalent of a half-time job. Nearly 70% wished for more flexible hours or remote work opportunities to allow them the freedom to give better care to loved ones. To gain such flexibility, 40% would take a reduction in their pay. Moreover, 64% said caregivers need remote jobs.A peer-reviewed essay in the Journal of Applied Gerontology provides further evidence. Focusing on older working adults (55 to 70) who were either caregivers or not. It finds that older adult employed caregivers were more likely to use flexible options — flexible work hours, flexible schedules and time off — compared to non-caregivers, even after controlling for other variables, such as demographics.Flawed hiring practices are dismissing qualified candidatesIn recent years, companies have increasingly systematized and centralized their talent recruitment methods. Large teams of corporate recruiters rely heavily on applicant tracking software and algorithms to screen potential hires.


These technologies filter out candidates based on blunt digital parameters and arbitrary determinations of ""culture fit."" Applicants who don't precisely match the job description or expected credentials face almost certain rejection.Too often, employers cling stubbornly to restrictive preconceptions regarding what roles should entail, both in terms of required abilities and time and location commitments. They automatically dismiss qualified candidates whose backgrounds don't align with these ossified role conventions.For example, a company looking to hire a full-time accountant might immediately reject the application of an experienced part-time bookkeeper and mother of two, even if she possesses all the required accounting skills and more. This candidate's proven talents get dismissed simply because she doesn't fit the employer's backward-looking notions of what a proper accountant ""ought to be.""Because of these flawed hiring practices, huge numbers of seasoned professionals get unfairly left out of consideration, even as openings go unfilled for extended periods. Business leaders everywhere bemoan talent shortages, yet their own deficient recruitment strategies actively manufacture these phantom gaps.


Instead of writing off applicants based on inaccurate preconceptions, employers should focus on identifying candidates with the most relevant capabilities. They should recognize that the traditional 9-5 office model no longer suits the diversity of talented people eager for meaningful work. The path forward lies in pragmatic flexibility, not rigid orthodoxy.Related: Employers Need Workers. Now They're Realizing The Untapped Talent of These People.The forward pathProgressive companies and managers need to acknowledge that the traditional 9 to 5 office schedule no longer makes sense as the default template for most roles. Savvy leaders increasingly recognize that adaptability and open-mindedness represent the keys to accessing overlooked talent pools. They understand that worthwhile candidates come from a wide variety of backgrounds that don't necessarily align with outdated corporate conventions.First and foremost, tapping into underutilized talent means providing flexibility regarding when and where work gets accomplished. Modern technology enables remote collaboration, and output matters far more than physical presence in cramped office cubicles. That's what I tell the 5-10 leaders who contact me every week to explore flexible work models for their organizations.


Indeed, the winner of the most recent Nobel award for economics, Claudia Goldin, argued in a recent interview that what she called ""greedy jobs"" — high-paying, high-pressure roles that demand workers be available at unusual times outside of their contracted hours typically occupied by men — are increasingly available to women due to remote and hybrid work. In turn, return-to-office policies may undo some of that progress.Employers seeking hidden talent should develop robust training programs to help part-time workers transition into full-time roles. Compensation and advancement potential should depend solely on contributions and capabilities, not on arbitrary distinctions between ""part-time"" and ""full-time.""Some innovative companies have found success by cross-training employees across multiple departments. This enhances workers' skillsets while empowering them to cover for one another as needed. Nimbleness is essential in a volatile world where personal circumstances can shift suddenly.Most importantly, business leaders must take a hard look at their own prejudices. Is a given role truly full-time? Could a strategically minded part-timer handle key aspects of that marketing job, especially from home?


Asking these probing questions will help erode the baseless biases that prevent managers from recognizing great talent that falls outside of their preconceptions.Overcoming skepticismSome traditionalist business leaders may view these proposals as unrealistic or threatening to corporate norms. However, thoughtfully expanding career flexibility promises benefits for both workers and companies amid the complex realities of modern life.Skeptics argue that part-time workers lack commitment or that flexibility erodes accountability. In truth, part-timers appreciated for their contributions often reciprocate with loyalty. Output and consistency matter more than physical presence when evaluating performance.Critics also contend that reconfiguring roles undermines efficiency. But thoughtfully leveraging part-timers' specialized skills boosts productivity. Furthermore, the costs of unfilled openings due to misguided selectivity exceed any hypothetical inefficiencies.


While adapting workplace practices takes concerted effort, the long-term gains for talent recruitment and retention outweigh the growing pains. Savvy companies will get ahead of the curve.Rather than reacting fearfully, decision-makers should view flexibility as an opportunity. A diversity of personalized roles attracts top talent. Retaining professionals with caregiving duties builds valuable experience.With empathy and communication, customized roles minimize friction. The future favors those who rethink work to empower people's full participation.Unleash human potentialThe coming years represent an enormous opportunity for visionary leaders willing to redefine outdated workplace paradigms. Vast untapped talent awaits employers able to see beyond antiquated ideas about career progression.


The real obstacle is not an actual shortage of skilled workers but rather a lack of creativity among managers constrained by legacy hiring practices. To build thriving businesses, companies must design work models that enable employees to fully apply their skills while balancing meaningful lives.By focusing on capabilities rather than credentials and judging applicants based on their potential contributions instead of misguided stereotypes, employers will open the floodgates to overlooked talent reservoirs. They stand to benefit tremendously from seasoned professionals who want nothing more than the chance to apply their hard-won experience.Fundamentally reimagining the nature of work won't just unlock hidden talent pools. It will catalyze the full spectrum of human potential across society. Workers will gain flexibility and fulfillment. Companies will overcome hiring challenges and boost productivity. In short, a win-win scenario for all.The future is now for business leaders ready to discard outdated conventions and write bold new rules for the modern workplace. The time has come to unleash human potential by empowering people to contribute their best through work designed for the realities of today.

38,Want to Attract Diverse Talent? You Need to Work on Your Employer Brand — Here's Why.,"Oct 20, 2023",Nika White,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/want-to-attract-diverse-talent-you-need-to-work-on-your/459203,"
Now more than ever, this question of what a business' values, perspective, and stance are on certain social issues is under the microscope of diverse applicants. According to Monster.com, 86% of applicants actively engaged in a job search care about an employer's reputation with regard to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). The same survey found that 62% of applicants would turn down a job offer if their employer did not support DEI.In this hiring climate, where hundreds of thousands of jobs have been added to the economy in 2023 alone, employees are looking for their perfect match and feel certain they can afford to wait until they find it. Without communicating DEI as a key value of your business on online platforms, you could be turning off high-value applicants who could join your team.So, how can businesses like yours stand out in the vast sea of ""now hiring"" signs and attract the best of the best diverse talent? The answer is clear: Develop an employer brand.



What is an employer brand?Employer branding is a marketing and communication strategy that builds an emotional connection between the potential employee and the employer by demonstrating a positive image and reputation in its marketing.Employer branding involves the rhetoric that's written on the company's website, the posts it touts on LinkedIn, and the word-of-mouth reputation that represents its staff makeup, values, and commitments.


When a diverse applicant sees your newly posted job description and is curious about your business, they likely go to your LinkedIn profile or website to see if yours is the kind of organization they'd like to be a part of. One of the ways companies can present themselves in the most positive light to these applicants is by discussing their values and initiatives around DEI.However, there are several missteps companies make when engaging in employer branding that could turn diverse employees off in seconds.Related: How Employer Branding Can Help Your Company Be Perceived As A Great Place To WorkHow employee branding could be turning off diverse candidatesFrom the brand's policies to its website messaging, these five mistakes may cause diverse candidates to dismiss your job posting before they even apply.


1. Your business doesn't have a DEI statement on job applicationsIf you don't have a DEI statement at the end of your job applications, you're sending the wrong message to diverse candidates. This statement can be simple and should say something to the effect of ""We're an equal opportunity employer and are committed to providing equal employment opportunities for all applicants and employees, regardless of race, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, marital status or veteran status.""As basic as this statement may sound, it acts to lower the perceived barriers to entry for some diverse applicants. It's the first step in DEI-centric employee branding that serves as a handshake to diverse candidates. It communicates that ""all are welcome"" and that one's identity doesn't qualify or disqualify someone from being here. It's a small step that can lead to more diverse applicants applying for your open role.2. Your business doesn't offer ERGs, BRGs, or wellness groupsAn employee resource group (ERG), business resource group (BRG), or wellness group is an important component of promoting a sense of belonging in a company. Diverse applicants are looking for businesses that offer affinity groups, especially if the staff makeup has a sizable group of individuals who share a similar identity.It doesn't always have to be about race, gender, or other common identities. Groups can also be formed around shared values like faith, health, sports and more. The goal is to demonstrate that your business is making a good-faith effort towards promoting community and belonging, and these are important components of a desirable workplace, especially for diverse applicants. Having a page on your business's website or social media showcasing special groups that employees can join can help your business stand out and appear more welcoming to diverse applicants.


Related: How to Utilize Employee Resource Groups for a More Diverse3. Your business doesn't offer a flexible work environmentIt's 2023, and more applicants are looking for flexible workspaces, whether they're a parent or someone looking for more work-life balance (or work-life blend, as I call it), companies who brand themselves as flexible or accommodating workspaces are more attractive to potential employees than those who enforce rigid work schedules and mandatory in-office days.Since the world was taken by storm by the Covid-19 pandemic, more diverse applicants, including people of color, those with disabilities, and gender minorities, began looking for ""safer"" spaces to work. Minorities have always had to face microaggressions and adapt to the dominant culture in the workplace. However, having more flexibility around their office environment and schedule has helped those individuals find a work-life blend and has eased the burden of daily microaggressions and code-switching in the workplace.Related: How Code-Switching Hurts People of Color in the Workplace


4. Your business doesn't offer outside-of-work activitiesWe all like to have fun and enjoy quality time with others. Companies that brand themselves as ""fun"" workspaces or ones that offer outside-of-work activities like company outings, retreats or sports activities can attract more diverse applicants and likely retain them longer. Although not every employee should have to participate in these activities, it's nice to have the option for diverse candidates who are seeking community in the workplace.These activities aren't just for show; they allow employees to bond and cultivate a true sense of belonging and community. Belonging is a critical element of a diverse workplace and should be promoted. Most companies do the bare minimum in offering outside-of-work activities. The consequence is that it can lead many minorities to feel isolated or disconnected from their coworkers–and this certainly does not attract or retain diverse talent.5. Build an employer brand that attracts — not repels — diversityYour business could have some of the best benefits packages and offerings available, but if you're not actively discussing them, writing about them on your website and on social media, and sharing them in company emails, your employee brand isn't going to benefit.Don't neglect to speak about issues potential employees care about, like maternity and paternity benefits, flexible hours, and remote working, as well as diverse representation at all levels of the organization.


These components of an employee brand can make or break your business's competitiveness in the hiring market. Be the brand that stands out and attracts the best of the best by honing your employer brand and letting diverse employees come to you.

39,Retailers Are Scaling Back Seasonal Hiring — But One Tech Giant Is Bucking the Trend,"Oct 16, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/seasonal-hiring-is-slowing-down-at-retailersbut-not/463735,"
While the holiday season historically yields an increase in shopping — and subsequent staff needed to accommodate — this year may look different for prospective seasonal workers.Big-name retailers, such as Macy's and Dick's Sporting Goods, are cutting back on their seasonal hiring initiatives, scaling back their workforce after two years of increased foot traffic following the pandemic, The New York Times reported.Macy's plans to hire 38,000 workers, 3,000 fewer than its 2022 target — and far fewer than 2021 when Macy's aimed to hire 76,000 people during the holiday season, both in permanent roles and seasonal jobs, according to the Times. Dick's Sporting Goods intends to hire up to 8,600 seasonal workers, a slight increase from the 8,000 in 2019, but down from the 9,000 hired last year and the 10,000 in 2021.



A report from career coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas last month found that retailers are forecasted to hire 410,000 seasonal workers this coming holiday season, marking a 15-year low, Yahoo Finance reported in September. Some economists interpret these hiring trends as signs of the labor market cooling down from its pandemic-fueled boom two years ago.Related: Want to Be a UPS Delivery Driver? The 'Hottest' Job in the Country Only Has 17 Positions Open.


""The seasonal hiring market looks a whole lot more like 2019 than those pandemic bounce-back years,"" Nick Bunker, director of North American economic research for Indeed, told the Times. ""I really do think this is emblematic broadly of what we're seeing in the U.S. labor market, where demand for workers overall is fairly strong but down from where it was in the last year and a half.""Meanwhile, searches for seasonal jobs have increased by 19 percent compared to last year, per data from Indeed, while the number of available positions has decreased by 6 percent, per The Times. Companies that assist businesses in finding temporary workers note that major retailers have been slower to announce their hiring plans this year, and fewer job postings are marked as ""urgent"" on Indeed.However, one company is the exception to the scale-back hiring trend. Amazon announced last month that it would be hiring 250,000 seasonal employees, a 67% increase from hiring initiatives over the past two years.The company is also adding signing bonuses of up to $3,000 for certain hires.Related: Amazon Is Hiring 250,000 Workers Ahead of the Holidays, With Some Making Up to $28 an Hour.

40,Motivation is the Secret to a Successful Team — Are Your Employees Motivated? 4 Tips for Empowering New Hires,"Oct 4, 2023",Greg Waisman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/are-your-employees-motivated-4-tips-for-empowering-new/459414,"
Workers burning out from stress and quitting their jobs is a prevalent problem for companies worldwide. A workplace study conducted in 2023 revealed that 44% of surveyed employees suffer from a lot of stress issues, resulting in either quitting altogether or staying and doing the absolute minimum while losing most of their motivation.For companies to retain and bolster their talents, leadership must engage with their workers and encourage them, pushing them towards greater accomplishments.Being a business founder myself, I am responsible for employee communication, onboarding new people, and maintaining team cohesion at my company. In this article, I would like to draw on past experiences and share some principles that I believe to be paramount to empowering your team toward success.



1. Onboarding is the starting point where your employee should see transparencyNew employees are the lifeblood of any company, which is why it is crucial to conduct the hiring process with due care. Effective onboarding programs go beyond just providing basic orientation and paperwork completion. You must cultivate a welcoming environment that instills confidence and that new workers can connect.This also means being 100% transparent about your company's goals and corporate culture and familiarising newcomers with your values, policies, and procedures. In doing so, you allow employees to clearly understand what your company is all about and whether they wish to be a part of what it does.


For example, my company has an established practice of giving new candidates introductory meetups with our founders. We call it ""company pitching"". Once a group of potential hires is formed, one of the founders meets with them to discuss the company and its ideas. This is a great form of interaction, as it encourages discussion, allows us to showcase our best selling points to new people, and motivates them to contribute from the get-go.Another important thing is to have regular meetings and monthly briefing sessions during which your team can discuss all relevant updates. This is crucial to ensure everyone is on the same page about where your company is going.Related: 6 Communication Tips to Strengthen Your Company's Culture2. Maintain communication between employees and company leadershipAnother big thing to pay attention to is keeping open channels of communication between regular workers and company management. This is a fundamental step in fostering a sense of belonging to an organization.


When employees feel that they can reach out to the management just as easily as a fellow regular worker and be heard, they feel more valued as individuals. People love honesty, and having ways to share things that are important to them openly goes a long way in bringing teams closer.This sense of closeness, in turn, means that people often better understand the bigger picture and can better align their individual efforts with the company's goals. They are also more willing to speak up and share ideas during meetings when they feel their thoughts would be genuinely considered.Here's another personal example: at my workplace, we do not have separate rooms or cubicles that separate employees from the management. We all work from an open and shared space, allowing team members to easily come up to each other and speak about anything on their minds. In addition to the collaborative workspace, all our team members and founders have the same working equipment, hotels and flight class. We think it's important for everyone to be on equal ground.All of this helps foster trust and the mentality of unity, shortening the metaphorical distance between team members. And being responsible for the company's ideology, me and my fellow founders strive to follow these principles even more so than most of our employees.


Related: 3 Communication Strategies for Entrepreneurs Wanting To Improve Their Teams3. Showcase the value of what your employees are doingOne more useful tip to drive your workers is to clearly show them that the work they do for the company has value and that they stand to gain plenty of benefits themselves.What can an employee get besides the usual salary and experience from their company? Some businesses choose to introduce the practice of on-the-job training, providing educational opportunities that stand to benefit both the company at large and individual workers.4. Set challenges and create a competitive spiritPeople are often motivated by a challenge more than by receiving a salary, simple as it is. If you want to push your team to greater heights, create a competitive spirit in your company while fostering collaboration.


This might sound a bit contradictory, but hear me out. What I mean is that instead of pitting your employees against each other, you'd be better served to cultivate competitiveness against some other company operating in the same market. This would give them a unified goal to work towards.Start by clearly articulating the strengths and unique selling points of your team. Emphasize how these traits differentiate your company from competitors and build confidence among your workers. Set up milestones that would signify that you've surpassed the other company in some way.These milestones will foster an environment that encourages continuous self-improvement and learning among the team while clearing them will result in celebrating mutual successes and gaining motivational boosts.Read More: Why Empathy is Crucial to Your Success in the Business World


People are the cornerstone of your organization: make sure they know itTo sum up, if you want to keep your employees motivated and prevent your workforce from quitting, the most important thing you can do is make them feel valued. And the best way to do so is to foster a culture that combines individual excellence and collaborative success. Make your team believe that working at your company allows them to be part of something valuable. Doing so will bring people closer and push your company to new heights.

41,This is the Number One Mistake to Avoid After Hiring Your First Employee. Are You Guilty of It?,"Sep 22, 2023",Alykhan Jetha,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/understanding-the-number-one-mistake-to-avoid-after-hiring/459097,"
As a small business owner, you've been the driving force behind every aspect of your venture. But as your business gains momentum, the time inevitably arrives to expand your team and hire your first employee.It's a universal experience I see many entrepreneurs going through in their early stages.Making that first hire and building a team for the first time is a major milestone. Aside from taking some time to celebrate it, it's a crucial moment worth being intentional about. Hiring the ""best candidate for the job"" won't necessarily cut it; the responsibility goes far beyond selecting the right person.



There are so many articles on how to source and identify the ""right"" talent — but there are fewer resources on how to ensure that the ""right employee"" contributes in the ways you need them to in the first months of their tenure as employee number one.In this article, I'll shed some light on the post-hiring phase with a specific focus on the biggest red flag founders should steer clear of during this phase.Related: 4 Reasons Why Your Small Business Needs a CRMThe biggest red flag: A lack of proper systems to measure employee performanceSmall business owners often overlook the importance of having robust systems and procedures for assessing employee performance and ensuring accountability.Trust me when I say that it's a big deal. I've seen it firsthand. Not having clear accountability can hurt your company and its culture. Here's how:Divergent ideas: Many business owners believe in hiring people who are smarter than them. This is a great idea, especially regarding subject matter experts. However, all these efforts would go in vain if the new hire is left shooting in the dark. Studies show that about 85% of leaders don't define their team's focus, and employees lack clarity about their goals or KPIs. Without checkpoints, their own ideas might take over, drifting away from your goals. This divergence creates problems that are hard to realign.Substantial waste of resources (opportunity cost): Not having established systems to measure performance comes at a high cost, including wasted time, resources, and missed growth opportunities.Unaccomplished goals: A whopping 93% of employees aren't clear on their organization's objectives. This mismatch leads to unaccomplished goals and frustration among employees and leaders.Related: 5 Tips for Effectively Onboarding and Training New Hires


Solution: Build a robust performance-tracking mechanismThe good news is that, as entrepreneurs, we can tackle head-on the potential ramifications caused by a lack of proper systems. While I may not have the ""secret recipe,"" I've learned a few things along the way. Avoiding the pitfall requires a multi-step approach:Well-defined responsibilities: Clearly outline tasks and roles for each person. This ensures everyone knows what they're responsible for.Clearly laid out objectives: Set crystal-clear objectives for your new hire. Establishing tangible goals tied to specific success metrics can make the path forward much clearer for the new employees as they know what is expected and how success will be measured.Drafting the strategy: Once you have established clear objectives, allow the employee to work on a strategy to accomplish these goals. Together, review and refine the plan to address any potential gaps and establish measurable milestones for regular check-ins to track progress.Regular check-ins: Implement a check-in rhythm that makes feedback a part of everyday life. According to Gallup, 47% of workers receive infrequent feedback from managers. The regular check-in mechanism acts as ""glue"" for accountability by tracking progress, addressing issues, and keeping everyone's efforts aligned with primary strategic goals. Adjusting your mindset to one driven by giving feedback rather than just doing (or fixing) something yourself is a muscle we have to train. Thankfully, there are many tools to help you streamline your regular check-in process and make it as easy as possible. Perhaps I'm biased, but Daylite has been an effective tool for our managers to use. The Projects dashboard helps give our managers, whether they're managing a team of 1 or 10, a high-level overview and update about the tasks and projects in a single glance, setting the stage for check-ins.Create integration moments: Spend time with them - and make it fun. It could be a simple thing such as coffee together in the morning (virtual or physical). Use that 10-15 minutes to get ""synced up"" and align on priorities for the day while getting to know each other on a deeper level. Alternatively, consider a practice that many legendary business people have done in the past: break bread together (i.e., have lunch or dinner together). A meal without distractions creates time together and solidifies integration. At the start of building Marketcircle, we had dinner together (it was out of my house at the time).Related: 7 Keys to Achieving a Balanced Recruitment StrategyStart early, win bigI've heard so many business owners say, ""I wish I started delegating earlier in the lifespan of my business.""Successful delegation, so that you can clear your plate as the business owner and focus on scaling the company, starts with establishing proper systems and structure with the very first employee you bring on board and extends as a practice to every employee you bring on after that.


Early implementation of these practices helps small business owners prevent detrimental habits (which definitely die hard) from forming. Good habits take time, but starting strong sets you up for success in the long term. Your future business will thank you for it.With all these in mind, you're on track to build a winning team and make your business thrive.

Amazon is gearing up to recruit a whopping 250,000 workers ahead of the upcoming holiday shopping season, the company announced in a blog post on Tuesday.The new hires will encompass full-time, part-time and seasonal employees, offering competitive hourly rates ranging from $17 to $28, depending on location. Some of the roles include packing, sorting, and shipping customer orders, among others.Amazon's initiative comes amid anticipation of the lowest holiday hiring surge since 2008, as estimated by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, per Bloomberg.



In its bid to attract and retain employees, the company is also raising the average pay for logistics staff to approximately $20.50 per hour. Furthermore, Amazon has sweetened the deal by introducing bonuses ranging from $1,000 to $3,000 for certain hires.""Whether someone is looking for a short-term way to make extra money, or is hoping to take their first step toward a fulfilling and rewarding career at Amazon, there's a role available for them,"" John Felton, senior vice president of Worldwide Operations at Amazon, said in the post. ""A fulfillment or transportation employee who starts with us today will see a 13% increase in pay over the next three years — likely more, including our annual wage investments — and that's on top of offerings like prepaid college tuition with Career Choice and healthcare benefits from day one.""

To stay competitive and meet growth goals, a business needs an effective marketing program, of course, but the ways we reach and connect with prospective clients and customers have radically changed over the last few years. Today's marketing needs are exponentially more nuanced and complex than yesterday's focus on simply creating attention-grabbing logos and other branding elements.Of course, aesthetics are still important. However, if you're looking for a true game-changing strategy, it's never been more vital to select a results-focused marketer — someone who understands that success is about creating observable, measurable outcomes that move an organization to meet revenue, sales and other goals.Finding the right person means searching for a few key qualities.

44,5 Things to Look for When Hiring a Patent Portfolio Manager,"Sep 12, 2023",Thomas Franklin,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-things-to-look-for-when-hiring-a-patent-portfolio-manager/458353,"
Hiring a patent portfolio manager is a milestone that will enhance your enterprise's patent program. Managing the patent process efficiently becomes more difficult at scale without dedicated staffing. Without proper planning, your inventors' hard-won innovations risk being under-protected by your enterprise.Hiring an incompetent patent portfolio manager may result in valuable ideas remaining unpatented, a decrease in innovator engagement, unjustified patent prosecution costs and an inadequate return on your IP investments.Unearthing patents from your innovators requires a patent portfolio manager with technical expertise, standout interpersonal skills and undeterred persistence. Simultaneously, strengthening your patent portfolio against competitors demands significant patent-related experience. And generating maximum returns on IP investments demands sound business acumen.



An adept patent portfolio manager should possess a diverse skill set aligned with your enterprise's objectives. Evaluating candidates on these five key competencies can help you select the right one:Technical expertiseLegal experienceEye for detailInterpersonal skillsBusiness acumenRead on as we delve deeper into these core attributes.Related: An Entrepreneur's Guide to Inventing1. Technical expertiseInventors typically have a lot on their plate. Their primary focus is on innovation and product development with little time for the administrative tasks needed to keep the patent program running. Amid their busy schedules, they might overlook reporting their innovations for patenting.Sometimes, they might even dismiss an invention as too obvious, deciding not to report it at all. Consequently, you may miss out on potentially patentable ideas.


A portfolio manager who is familiar with your enterprise's technology can have conversations with the inventors, guiding them on which ideas should be protected. Ideally, a seasoned employee or someone acquainted with your enterprise's technological focus would be suitable. They need not understand all the innovation, but they should have enough background knowledge to identify and capture the best ideas.2. Legal experienceAddressing complex queries about the likelihood of getting a patent, complete life-cycle cost estimates and strategic filing decisions across multiple jurisdictions can be challenging without legal experience.Moreover, interacting with outside patent counsel in the absence of knowledge of patent terminology can lead to ineffective communication. Ineffective communication between a patent portfolio manager and outside counsel can lead to misunderstandings about strategic patent goals, potential delays in the patent prosecution process, increased costs and unsuccessful patent filings. These complications can, in turn, jeopardize the enterprise's intellectual property strategy to protect its market.A patent portfolio manager with legal experience, potentially from a law firm or corporate role, can effectively communicate with counsel, answer intricate questions and guide the implementation of cost-effective patent filing strategies across multiple jurisdictions.


3. Eye for detailManaging large patent portfolios with hundreds of matters across different countries can be overwhelming due to extensive tracking, communication and administrative work.Moreover, patent rights for an invention are given country by country. It's perplexing to efficiently navigate the complexities of obtaining patent rights across different countries.  Coordinating with legal counsel in each jurisdiction, managing numerous email correspondences, answering specific questions, reaching out to the right individuals and getting signatures demands an eye for detail.A detail-oriented patent portfolio manager can handle large patent portfolios effectively. With a strong understanding of your enterprise processes and excellent organizational skills, they ensure timely responses. They also excel at obtaining necessary approvals and signatures while maintaining a well-organized administration.Related: The Basics of Protecting Your Intellectual Property, Explained


4. Interpersonal skillsInventors must intensely focus on their product innovation with little time to engage in extensive paperwork. Distractions and delays in submitting invention disclosures can starve your patent pipeline. This results in a rushed patenting process, seeking patent protection just before product launch.Besides, it's not unusual for enterprise members, legal counsel or foreign associates to be awaiting answers or information. The intensity of delivering a product leaves little time to focus on the big picture.Given the multitude of outstanding queries and patent-related tasks in an enterprise, this role requires strong interpersonal skills and diligence. Mining patents requires constant sleuthing to find what the inventors are doing. The patent manager must build solid relationships with inventors and establish clear communication channels for efficient reporting of potential inventions, ensuring all stakeholders receive timely information.5. Business acumenEnterprises often face challenges in aligning their patent strategies with wider business goals.


It's daunting to gauge the commercial potential of patents, navigate patent licensing negotiations and make strategic litigation decisions, all while ensuring cost-effectiveness. Alignment of the patent program with strategic goals requires focus and an even keel.Thus, unlocking the true market potential of your patent portfolio demands that the patent portfolio manager possesses strong business acumen.Related: Create the Strongest Patent Possible With These 5 TipsA capable patent portfolio manager can prove to be more cost-effective and yield better results in comparison to being dependent on an organic process internally or even on outside legal counsel for various tasks like mining patents, strengthening patent portfolios and generating higher returns on IP investments.


The perfect candidate for the patent portfolio manager position should demonstrate a combination of technical proficiency, legal background, attention to detail, strong interpersonal skills and business acumen.Recruiting one can be a challenging task, but often the best candidates are right under your nose. They might be among the external counsel you already work with, exhibiting proficiency in tasks you need to get done at competitive costs. It could even be found within the enterprise with a prolific inventor having an interest in a bigger role in the legal department. These professionals could transition into a full-time role within your enterprise.Drawing from over 25 years of experience in patent prosecution, I can vouch that hiring a competent patent portfolio manager, as outlined in this post, can contribute positively to your enterprise's success in conquering your patent landscape. You can further empower your patent portfolio manager by adopting the right patent management software.

45,This Is the Biggest Customer Service Mistake You're Making — And How To Fix It Fast,"Sep 12, 2023",Micah Solomon,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/this-is-the-biggest-customer-service-mistake-youre-making/457376,"
If you want to move from middle-of-the-road, ho-hum customer service to the kind of exceptional customer service exemplified by great customer service-oriented brands like Ritz-Carlton, you're only going to get there if you get serious about employee empowerment. There's simply no way around this.Once you've assembled your team, provided them with customized and high-quality customer service training, and immersed them in both the essence of your company's philosophy and essential nuts-and-bolts customer service standards, giving them the autonomy to execute their roles effectively is crucial.When the leash is pulled too tight, employees feel stifled and hindered in their ability to deliver their best work. Instead, encourage them to apply their unique style and strengths to bring the benefits of exceptional customer service to your customers.



Related: Don't Mistake a Frequent Customer With a Loyal CustomerEmpowerment: A driving force behind exceptional customer serviceAllowing employees properly trained in customer service to strive for excellence in their own way not only boosts their confidence but also allows them to take ownership of their role, leading to increased job satisfaction. In essence, allow your employees the space to breathe, grow, and shine. Trust them to use their judgment to make decisions that align with your company's values and customer service goals. This approach can lead to a vibrant and effective customer service culture where employees feel valued, customers feel cared for, and your business thrives.


Exceptional customer service is an art that requires not just adherence to established protocols but also the freedom for talented and well-trained employees to interpret and implement those standards in a way that best serves the customer.These employees, empowered and trusted by the organization, act as interpreters of your company's customer service ethos. They decode the abstract concept of ""exceptional customer service"" and bring it to life through their actions, interactions, and decisions.Because every customer and situation is unique, empowered employees must flexibly apply customer service principles rather than rigidly adhering to a one-size-fits-all approach. This ability to tailor their service based on each customer's specific needs and expectations is what defines exceptional customer service.By fostering an environment that encourages such interpretation and personalization, companies can ensure that their customer service is efficient, consistent, personal, empathetic, and genuinely exceptional.


And if they lack empowerment — power, really — they'll remain hobbled, no matter how good their intentions.When a leader encourages pro-customer efforts, most everything else will fall in place, with employees eagerly contributing their elective efforts time and again. Conversely, if a company's leadership doesn't provide such encouragement and leeway — if it rules with excessive rigidity — these unyielding ways will, over time, blight your organization in the eyes of its customers. An employee cannot fully contribute to an organization and the service of its customers without being empowered.Need more proof that empowerment is essential for superior customer service? Consider these points:A supervisor or manager can't be present at every moment to guide customer interactions.Likewise, a checklist or ""thou shalt/shalt not"" list of commandments (i.e., ""best practices"") can't come anywhere close to covering all possible eventualities. Even if it could, it wouldn't be able to do so with the same kind of nuance as a human being who is face-to-face or on the telephone with a customer. In other words, an empowered employee is the only force that can be agile—that can adjust in real-time (or better than real-time, if they're being anticipatory) to what a customer needs or hopes for in the moment.Empowerment is essential for bringing a purpose-driven culture to life. Without empowerment, you're giving mixed messages: on the one hand, instructing your employees to pursue a pro-customer purpose, but on the other, not giving them the power to do so.Empowerment is a remarkable human development tool. How can an employee ever know—and how can the leader of that employee ever know—what that employee is capable of until they're given the leeway to demonstrate their potential?Related: How to Turn Micromanagement Into Empowerment and Unlock True Employee Satisfaction


It's an employee's job to be empoweredSince the term ""empowerment"" became the buzziest of buzzwords, some companies seem to think empowerment—or at least lip service that features the word—is something they can sprinkle atop an otherwise hollow culture and magically get results in a pixie dust–like fashion. But empowerment needs to be something a company's leadership believes in, embraces, practices, and does everything it can to embed within the company culture.If you believe in employee empowerment, one of the keys to conveying this is to make it clear that it is not an add-on, a nice-to-have-sometimes kind of thing. Instead, empowerment is every employee's job.By extension, every employee must use their empowerment, day in and day out, which turns it into a powerful force.Letting go of the reins and handing them off to employees is indisputably hard. But there's no way around it. Empowering employees is essential if you want to achieve iconic, bottom-line-building customer service — and it will profoundly contribute to employee morale, retention, and recruitment.

46,Transitioning from Solopreneurship to Building and Leading a High-Impact Team — A Step-by-Step Guide,"Sep 11, 2023",Chris Kille,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-successfully-transition-from-solopreneur-to-team/458546,"
Strap in, ambitious solopreneurs, because we're about to elevate your game from one-man wonder to a synergistic powerhouse. You've hustled hard, pulled all-nighters and turned your nascent idea into a full-blown operation. Kudos! But here's the real talk: You've hit that proverbial ceiling, and it's time to break through.We're transitioning you from solopreneurship to a dynamite team, and we're doing it like pros. No fluff, no filler — just actionable, expert-level insights that you can implement right now. Ready to multiply your impact and skyrocket your enterprise? Let's dive in.Related: 4 Key Indicators It's Time for You to Hire Your First Employees and Stop Doing Everything Alone



Step 1: Acknowledge the inflection pointLet's not sugarcoat it — there comes a moment in your solopreneurial journey when you're straddling the fence between self-sufficiency and needing an extra pair of hands. You've got more business than you can handle, and sleep has become an estranged friend. This, my friend, is your inflection point, and it's the universe screaming at you: ""Hey, it's time to scale!""So, how do you know you've reached this milestone? You're drowning in tasks, your calendar looks like a game of Tetris, and let's be real, you're not Elon Musk — you can't single-handedly launch rockets and run multiple companies. So, don't. Instead, focus on strategizing your next move, which is assembling your dream team.


Step 2: Strategic role identificationBefore you spam LinkedIn with job postings, pause. Take a deep dive into your operational workflow. Identify the bottlenecks only a specialized skill set can alleviate. Look, not every Tom, Dick or Harriet with a CV can drive your vision forward.Create a list of roles critical to your business. But don't just create any roles. I'm talking about roles so strategic that filling them will multiply your efficiency, not just add to it. Think — a Tech Lead who can spearhead your product development or a Digital Marketing Wizard who knows SEO like the back of their hand.Step 3: Financial forecasting and budget allocationUnless you've discovered a tree that grows money, you need to allocate your finances meticulously. Bootstrapping is not going to cut it when you're onboarding a team. Sit down with your financial statements, and let's do some adulting.How much revenue are you generating? What are your projected earnings? Calculate the ROI for each new hire. Will they bring in more business? Enhance productivity to a point where you can accept more clients? If the math doesn't add up, you're not ready. If it does, proceed with purpose.


Step 4: The hiring processHold onto your hat because the hiring process is a rollercoaster ride. You're essentially dating professionally, and you can't afford to match with the wrong person. Utilize specialized job boards, network ferociously, and even consider headhunters if you're looking for rare skills.During the interviews, go beyond the technicalities. Assess cultural fit, soft skills and their vision alignment with your enterprise. You're not building a team of robots; you're constructing a powerhouse of innovative minds.Step 5: Onboarding and culture developmentCongratulations, you've got your team! But hold those horses; we're not popping champagne yet. An effective onboarding process is not a nicety; it's a necessity. Spend quality time educating your team about your business processes, culture and expectations.Remember, culture is not built overnight but through consistent actions and shared values. Be the leader who doesn't just tell people what to do but shows them how it's done. Create an environment of open dialogue, continuous learning and mutual respect.


Related: Transitioning From Solopreneur to a Team LeaderStep 6: Performance metrics and KPIsIn business, what gets measured gets managed. Implement Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that align with your business objectives. You can't gauge the effectiveness of your team without solid data. I'm talking hardcore analytics, feedback loops and quarterly reviews.Your team should not just know what their roles are; they should be crystal clear about how their performance will be evaluated. Remove subjectivity and replace it with measurable outcomes. Anything less is managerial malpractice.Step 7: Conflict resolution and team dynamicsHuman beings are wonderfully complex creatures. No matter how meticulous you've been in the hiring process, conflicts are as inevitable as taxes. But guess what? They're not necessarily a bad thing. Conflicts can lead to constructive discussions, challenge stagnant perspectives and birth innovative solutions.


The key is to not let conflicts fester. Address them head-on. Create a culture where employees feel comfortable voicing their concerns. Remember, as the leader, you set the tone for conflict resolution. Use structured frameworks to mediate disagreements, such as an interest-based relational (IBR) approach or principled negotiation. These are not mere buzzwords; they're the bread and butter of effective team management.Step 8: Continuous learning and skill upgradationWe live in a digital age where the landscape changes faster than you can say ""disruptive innovation."" Continuous learning isn't a nice-to-have; it's a must-have. You and your team need to be in a state of perpetual skill enhancement. I'm talking webinars, online courses, certification programs — the whole nine yards.Set aside a budget for professional development. Encourage your team to identify skill gaps and find ways to bridge them. Is your digital marketer falling behind on the latest SEO trends? Time for a course. Is your tech lead scratching their head over a new coding language? A coding boot camp might be the answer. Make it known that growth isn't just a company objective; it's a personal mandate for each team member.Step 9: Scale, evaluate and iterateYour team is in place, and the ball is rolling. This is not the time to kick back and relax; it's the time to scale, evaluate and iterate. Keep an eye on your performance metrics, and never let complacency creep in.


Evaluate your team's work, assess your own role as a leader, and make necessary pivots. Perhaps you need to refine your marketing strategy, or maybe your product development needs a more agile framework. Be prepared to make real-time adjustments.

48,10 Pros (and Cons) of Hiring International Employees in 2023,"Sep 5, 2023",Anna Johansson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/10-pros-and-cons-of-hiring-international-employees-in-2023/451756,"
Thanks to the abundance of connective technology, hiring and working with people in remote locations, including employees in other countries, is easier than ever. Hiring international employees can be advantageous for your business, helping you save money while simultaneously broadening your talent pool.But is this truly worthwhile in 2023? Let's take a look.Related: The Rise of Self-Employed in the Global Workforce and What Business Owners Need to Know



The benefits of hiring international employeesHiring international employees comes with an array of advantages, including:A wider talent pool. One of the most appealing benefits of hiring people in other countries is getting access to a wider talent pool. There are nearly 400 million people in the United States, but that doesn't mean much if you have several important job openings and no applicants eager to fill them. Broadening your search internationally could be exactly what you need to find more people and fill those vacancies.Relatively easy traveling logistics. Thanks in part to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) and ESTA, international travel to the U.S. is easier than ever. Instead of making complicated arrangements and relying on tedious paperwork, your employees may be able to make arrangements to visit the United States for short business trips by filling out electronic applications that only take a few minutes.Remote collaboration potential. Only a few decades ago, working with people in other countries was practically impossible for most businesses. But in 2023, we have access to better collaboration tools than ever. Cloud collaboration platforms, powerful video chat apps and intuitive project management systems make it much easier for employees to engage with each other in real-time, regardless of their geographic location.A road to labor savings. Here in the U.S., we're used to people having a median salary of around $50,000. And if you want a maverick with tons of experience, you'll pay a lot more than that. But labor simply isn't this expensive elsewhere in the world. Hiring talent where the cost of living is lower means employers benefit from lower labor costs.Cultural touchpoints for expansion. If you're interested in expanding your business to new markets overseas, hiring employees in those countries could give you cultural touchpoints. These hires can help you better understand your target countries and develop strategies for efficient, successful expansion.Diversity and problem-solving capabilities. There's also an advantage to having a diverse staff of people working together. Studies have found that diverse teams are better at decision-making and problem-solving because they tend to focus more on facts.Related: The Benefits and Risks of Launching New Products in New Markets


The downsides of hiring international employeesThere are some important downsides to acknowledge, however.Registration and compliance. From a legal perspective, hiring and maintaining employees internationally can be a bit messy. You may be subject to laws and regulations imposed by foreign nations, which can increase compliance costs and cause legal headaches. At the very least, you should hire a lawyer to help you navigate these complexities, which can ebb away at the labor cost savings you'd otherwise enjoy.Wage increases and employer demand. Hiring people in certain countries used to be absurdly inexpensive, but wages are beginning to increase on an international scale. This is great from an international economic perspective, as the quality of life is increasing for billions of people. However, because more employers are seeking international employees and employment demand is rising, employees are demanding higher wages and more benefits.Communication barriers. English is the most popular language in the world, with 1.3 billion speakers in 2023. You shouldn't have trouble finding employees who can speak English competently, but there may still be some communication barriers if these speakers are inexperienced or if they aren't able to grasp the nuances of native speakers. Translation services and intermediaries may be able to help, but this is still a barrier you'll need to account for.Cultural differences. Finally, keep in mind that cultural differences can make an impact on your business. Employees in other countries may have different philosophies about work. They may prefer working in a totally different time zone. They may have different holidays. They may approach conflict resolution in totally different ways. It's a good idea to immerse yourself in their culture so you can understand where they're coming from if you want a healthy working relationship.Should your business hire international employees in 2023? In some ways, the prospect is more attractive than ever, with fewer communication and travel barriers and more options in terms of both available countries and talented workers. But the decision isn't exactly straightforward. Make sure you fully understand the laws and regulations associated with hiring foreign employees in your destination country and weigh all the pros and cons before moving forward.

49,9 Employee Traits to Look for When Hiring in 2023,"Sep 1, 2023",Shawn Cole,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/9-traits-to-watch-for-when-hiring-in-2023/457563,"
Every business owes its success not just to its leaders but also to the employees who carry out the day-to-day operations. But how do you find the right employees for your business?You can develop a more effective hiring strategy by prioritizing certain traits. Focus on building relationships with the best candidates who show the following qualities.1. PersonableEven in an age of email and chatbots, strong interpersonal skills matter for client-facing roles. And all employees, even remote workers, need to get along with their team members.



Look for applicants who demonstrate strong people skills: smiling, shaking your hand firmly, maintaining eye contact and mirroring body language are just a few. This trait isn't about hiring an extrovert over an introvert; instead, it's about finding a candidate capable of interacting in a likable, relatable manner.Related: 10 Strategies for Hiring and Retaining New Employees


2. Goal-OrientedAsking job applicants about their five-year plans may sound cliché, but it's an easy way to gauge their level of personal ambition. An applicant with a clear plan for the future will tend to be goal-oriented, which extends to how they carry out their day-to-day duties.You might also understand a candidate's aspirations by looking at the awards and achievements listed on their résumé. Previous accomplishments point to an ambitious, goal-driven attitude that will likely carry into the future.You can also nurture this trait by providing opportunities for professional development and advancement, which maximizes the talents of your new hire.3. Problem-solvingBusiness is all about overcoming challenges. The most valuable employees can think through these challenges and develop workable, efficient solutions.


You know that problem-solving abilities are essential for those in technical fields — but you should also cultivate these skills in everyone who works for your company.How do you find out whether a candidate is a problem-solver? Asking questions about when the candidate had to think outside the box to solve a workplace problem is a good start. Sometimes, the candidate's references can point out clear examples of when the candidate addressed challenging problems head-on.Related: What to Consider When Hiring Employees4. Technically proficientIf you're hiring for a specialized role, you'll want to ensure that you hire candidates who have the experience and expertise you need.


For instance, bookkeepers and accounts receivable specialists should be familiar with basic accounting software. You might also prefer candidates who know the same software platforms that your company depends on.For hybrid or remote positions, your candidate must have experience using video conferencing or project management applications to better coordinate with you and other team members.5. ConfidentFortune favors the bold — especially in the world of business. You want to assemble a team of decisive thinkers. Employees who delay decisions because they second-guess themselves or overanalyze the situation, will do more to prevent innovation than promote it.Instead, seek out job applicants who can clearly articulate their strengths and back them up with real-world examples from their previous positions. While interview jitters are understandable, an applicant who avoids eye contact or struggles to articulate might lack the confidence you're looking for in your organization.

TeachableTechnical proficiency is important, but every industry is evolving rapidly. Few traits are as valuable as the willingness to learn. While the ideal candidate should be confident about their existing skill set, an ability to adapt to new technologies or business models is often far more valuable.Ask candidates about new skills they've picked up or acquired from previous employers. Better yet, ask your applicants what skills they want to develop while working for your company. Their answers will reveal a lot about their ability to learn new skills as well as their eagerness to apply these skills in a new setting.7. TrustworthyPersonal integrity is about more than just following the rules. An employee who demonstrates consistent honesty and integrity will contribute to a transparent company culture. You also need employees you can depend on during every business cycle phase.


The best way to assess the trustworthiness of a job applicant is by contacting their references — particularly previous employers. Ideally, you want to learn that your applicant has a strong attendance record and that their previous employers could rely on their participation and support.Related: The Best Employees Have These '31 Flavors'8. CollaborativeBusiness is a team sport, so you need to hire candidates who play well with others. Even if the position requires much solo work, you'll still want to know that your employees can function well as a team when called upon.This trait often surfaces during the interview process. When you ask an applicant to list past accomplishments, listen for clues indicating that they collaborated with other team members.


If you can't tell from this list alone, ask probing questions about how the candidate has worked with coworkers. You can even ask about how they've handled past conflicts to learn how well they've navigated office relationships.Related: Quiet Quitting Preceded Another Insidious Workplace Issue That's Unfolding Right Now, Survey Reveals9. LoyalEmployee turnover is a major threat to any company. The time and money you spend replacing an employee can be put to better use in growing your core business. The best employees commit to your company for multiple years, allowing you to build a lasting relationship and maximize their skills.Be wary of workers whose resumes indicate a lot of job-hopping. That's especially true if their past work experience has been in fields similar to yours. Don't dismiss these candidates entirely — sometimes, finding a company culture that fits takes a while. But make sure to investigate the reasons for so much past instability.


Identifying candidates with the most sought-after traits will improve your chances of assembling an effective team. It will also make screening your job applicants easier, streamlining the hiring process.For critical positions, executive search firms can assist you with screening and hiring top-quality candidates. But to ensure that you staff your business with the right people at every level, look for these key traits of successful employees.

50,How to Prioritize Mental Health in Yourself and Your Workplace,"Aug 28, 2023",Jason Zickerman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-prioritize-mental-health-in-the-workplace/457279,"
How much do you consider mental health in your overall well-being? Many business owners sacrifice their own emotional stability and personal satisfaction for what they believe to be the greater good of the organizations they run. Or they are too lost in all the noise of operating and growing a company even to consider self-care. But there is no rulebook out there that states business owners can't have a thriving business and a healthy mind. It is all about positive psychology.Positive psychology is the scientific study of human flourishing. It focuses on factors like hope, happiness and optimism. Positive psychology is a proactive approach to mental health, not unlike wellness, which is to physical health. We often see a doctor when we feel sick or experience the onset of a disease, which is a reactive approach to physical health.A more proactive approach is to adopt the kind of healthy lifestyle choices that reduce our chances of getting sick in the first place. The same thing applies to mental health. We might see a therapist if we are in the throes of a mental health crisis, but it would surely be preferable to take a proactive approach to avoid a psychological emergency in the first place.



Dr. Martin Seligman is an American psychologist and leading researcher widely considered the ""father of positive psychology."" Seligman coined the term PERMA, an acronym that represents what he asserts are the five essential elements of mental health: Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning and Accomplishment. The concept of PERMA is intriguing, specifically as it relates to the business owner's emotional journey and mental health.Applying the concepts of PERMA to ourselves as business leaders is a great step in the right direction. Then, fostering opportunities to advance the PERMA ideology throughout your organization can dramatically enhance your company culture. I mean, who doesn't want a team of emotionally healthy, mentally prosperous and happy people working for them?


Let's consider the facets of PERMA and how business owners can apply them to foster positive psychology throughout their organizations.Related: 5 Reasons We Should Make Our Health a Priority Over Our BusinessP — Positive emotionsNot to be confused with happiness, positive emotions include personal feelings of love, joy and hope, among others. Seligman posits that our thoughts and actions improve when we cultivate and integrate positive emotions into our lives.First, focus on creating a culture of gratitude to help infuse positive emotions in your business. Recognize and celebrate achievements. Encourage your team to find joy in the work they do and in their interactions with others.


Related: How Positivity Makes You Healthy and SuccessfulE — EngagementEngagement is our ability to achieve a desirable state of flow in which we ditch our self-consciousness and allow ourselves to be absorbed in something we enjoy. It is about being substantively present in the moment rather than focusing on the mental baggage of the past or anxiety for the future.In your leadership role, provide employees growth and career development opportunities that encourage mastery, such as mentorship programs or advanced skills workshops. Implement ways to instill active involvement, autonomy and personal decision-making in the roles of every employee.R - RelationshipsWe all know that deep, meaningful relationships with others are vital to our well-being. Seligman says that humans are inherently social creatures who thrive on feeling valued and supported by others. These social interactions may also stave off cognitive decline and physical health issues.


As a business owner, be an active listener, reinforcing the importance of strong interpersonal relationships throughout your organization. Create opportunities for team bonding and collaboration.Related: How to Build a Positive Relationship With Your Boss and ColleaguesM - MeaningHaving meaning in our lives adds purpose and value to our actions. It is that connection with something bigger than ourselves. A sense of meaning might come from the business one runs, the causes one supports or one's spiritual beliefs. Meaning increases personal satisfaction in our daily lives.Ensure your company mission and vision are meaningful to your team. Create in-house opportunities for employees to contribute to the causes they care about. Let your people know how important they are to the success of your business.


Related: 3 Ways to Help Employees Combat Burnout and Create More BalanceA - AccomplishmentBeing successful at the things we do can dramatically enhance our mental well-being. Accomplishment refers to the final product and the orchestration, mastery and self-motivation that propels a person to achieve great things.To support a culture of accomplishment in your business, set clear and attainable SMART goals for employees, departments and the organization. Celebrate big achievements, as well as little wins along the way. Understand that setbacks are often catalysts for growth, so provide constructive feedback when employees fall short of expectations.Proactively incorporating positive psychology and infusing the tenets of PERMA throughout your business can lead to a healthier, happier and more meaningful existence for you and your entire team.

Due to acute staffing shortages, San Francisco Deputy Sheriff Barry Bloom has worked an average of 95 hours per week since 2016, often exceeding 100 hours per week in recent fiscal years, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. While Bloom earned $123,790 in base pay in 2022, his total income reached $530,935 with overtime.Since 2016, Bloom, a public safety monitor at San Francisco City Hall, has accrued $2.2 million in overtime pay, making him the highest overtime earner among city employees.The San Francisco sheriff department is short 176 sworn full-time positions, 41 non-sworn positions, and 24 cadets, officials told The Chronicle. In response, the sheriff's office is ""aggressively hiring"" to fill the staffing shortage that has been persisting since the onset of the pandemic.



Bloom's colleagues have also earned substantial overtime pay due to persistent staff shortages in the sheriff's office. While all employees are required to work at least two overtime shifts per week, some go beyond that, earning up to four times their base salaries.After, Bloom, the second and third highest earners in his department have also raked in millions over the past seven years, with deputy sheriff Kristian DeJesus making $1.9 million since 2016, and senior deputy sheriff Michael Borovina Jr. making $1.8 million.


Still, there are consequences to officers being overworked, per the Sheriffs' Association.Related: Volunteer Firefighters Are Getting Older and Enrollment Is Shrinking, Posing a Risk to Americans""We have periods where deputy sheriffs get tired of all the forced overtime, and they look for jobs elsewhere because it's just too much,"" Ken Lomba, president of the San Francisco Deputy Sheriffs' Association, told The Chronicle.""We're just one emergency away from a lawsuit,"" he added.Meanwhile, it's not just the Bay Area that's grappling with shrinking headcounts.Police departments across the country have been struggling with severe staffing shortages, scrambling to fill roles from patrol officers to 911 operators, CNN reported in July 2022, noting that agencies in cities like Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas are short hundreds of officers.According to the Police Executive Research Forum, the number of officer resignations was 47% in 2022 as compared to pre-pandemic levels of 2019. Furthermore, the number of sworn officers on staff was 0.9% lower in January than the same period in 2022, and down 4.8% compared to January 2020.

52,10 'Old School' Employee Expectations That Will Die Out With Gen Z,"Aug 24, 2023",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/10-things-companies-need-to-retain-gen-z-employees/456990,"
Gen Z will shape the future of work. Why? We will witness the largest and most diverse generation in human history.By 2025, Gen Z will account for 27% of the workforce in OECD countries and one-third of Earth's population. Gen Z, whose members were born between 1997 and 2002, grew up with technology and social solid values that shape their workplace demands. So it's unsurprising that Gen Z's entry into the workforce triggers changes in social contracts between employers and employees.Despite this, many employers still hold outdated employee expectations. These expectations, however, result in employee dissatisfaction, low productivity, and high turnover.

54,The Pros and Cons of Hiring Family Members in a Small Business,"Aug 14, 2023",Nellie Akalp,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-pros-and-cons-of-hiring-family-members-in-a-small/455420,"
Even though we already had four children, when my husband Phil and I started CorpNet, our goal was not to create a dynastic family firm. Yet here we are, 14 years later, with two kids on the payroll.That's not unusual; there are over 5.5 million family-owned businesses in America. Like most small businesses, family-owned companies struggle to find skilled employees. To meet this challenge, small business owners should ignore conventional wisdom and explore all avenues of finding good workers. One way to find the employees you need is to do what we did — hire family members, whether your own or relatives of your current staff.While this may be perceived as nepotism, hiring family members has several strategic advantages.Related: 5 Tips to Successfully Manage 'Friends and Family' HiresThe pros1. Shared vision and values



Family members often share similar values, work ethics and long-term goals. In PwC's 2023 U.S. Family Business Survey, 90% of respondents of all generations say, ""Growth is important because it enables them to invest in their company's future.""Your kids likely share your values and goals. But look beyond that. Let's say you have a high-performing employee that fits your company's culture — they may have a sibling or a spouse with the same traits. Hiring them (of course, you should vet them as you would any new hire) can save you the time and money of searching for a new employee and the concern that your new hire won't fit your company culture.When employees (related or not) share values, it's often easier to work toward achieving common goals since they're invested in each other's success.2. Trust


For small businesses to succeed, your team must trust one another. Family members have a pre-existing foundation of trust, and that attitude can spread to other employees, creating a strong team bond.Trust among your staff enhances communication, collaboration, goal-setting and decision-making. And 91% of business executives surveyed in PwC's 2023 Trust Survey say maintaining trust improves the bottom line.3. LoyaltyEmployees want to work for companies where they know their opinions are respected. When your hire a relative of a current employee, they feel valued that you trusted their recommendation, deepening their loyalty.


Family members likely enjoy working together, which further cements their loyalty to your business.4. Efficient communicationFamily members typically communicate more easily and effectively due to their familiarity and shared experiences. This streamlined communication minimizes miscommunications and misunderstandings.5. Lower recruitment costs


Recruitment can be costly and time-consuming — especially today when many businesses compete for the same employees. Small business owners can reduce recruitment expenses, such as paying for job listings, recruiters or employment agencies, by hiring their kids or employees' relatives.Also, since your children and the relatives of current employees are already familiar with your business, the onboarding process is shorter, reducing training time and costs.Related: The No. 1 Reason You Should Hire a Family MemberThe consOf course, hiring family members can have some potential drawbacks. Here's what to look out for:1. Appearance of nepotismWhether you're hiring members of employees' families or yours, other employees may resent these new hires, assuming they're not qualified for the job. Transparency is essential. Tell your staff about the familial relationship and why you think the new worker will make a great team member.2. Preferential treatmentIt is critical that the new hire does not get preferential treatment. Family members should avoid inside jokes, telling secrets and any other behavior that would cause resentment.


Job responsibilities, wages and paid time off for similar positions should be the same. Even a hint of special treatment will increase resentment in the rest of the staff.3. Emotional baggageFamily members may bring emotional baggage and existing conflicts into the workplace, creating tension and making it difficult to work together. Those tensions can permeate throughout your company, negatively impacting growth.Regular communication is key to resolving family conflicts. The 2023 North America Family Business Report from Brightstar Capital Partners and Campden Wealth reveals that 49% of respondents experienced family conflict on the job, which for 41% resulted in a communications breakdown, impacting the entire company.


Before family members join your company, you or your HR manager should set boundaries between the related employees (including you and your family). Explain what behaviors are not acceptable in the office. Consider adding a section about this to your employee handbooks.Related: The Do's and Don'ts of Involving Family in Your BusinessTips for hiring family membersWhen hiring relatives, you need to:Be clear about your expectations. Set clear expectations for the new hires so they understand their roles and responsibilities. When hiring family, it's key to temper your expectations. Don't expect them to be perfect or to think exactly as you do, and be patient. Give them time to adjust to their new roles. Also, if applicable, explain your expectations to the employee who suggested you hire their relative. If things don't work out, you don't want to lose your other employee as well.Be fair and impartial. All employees should be treated equally. Favoritism is never acceptable.Hire the best person for the job. Never feel obligated to hire relatives (your own or an employee's) simply because they're family. Make sure they're qualified for the job.Before making a final decision, weighing the benefits of hiring family members against the potential drawbacks is critical.


At my company, we have hired relatives of our employees and found that they work hard, quickly fit into our company culture and help us focus on growth and success. And while my kids work at CorpNet now, I don't have unrealistic expectations. We're not grooming them to take over. My children have aspirations and want to start their own businesses.

""Rage applying"" is, well, all the rage right now: Employees who are dissatisfied with their current position for some reason — perhaps they were passed over for a promotion or denied a raise, for example — fire off a slew of job applications in search of a better fit.The strategy seems especially popular among young generations, who coined the term on social media; viral TikToks feature Gen Z and millennial creators who successfully rage applied their ways to better opportunities and higher salaries.@successbysanjna I didn't get promotef at my Big4 job! #rageapply #career #big4 #kpmg #audit #banking ♬ She Share Story (for Vlog) - 山口夕依

56,3 Things Small Business Can Do to Compete with Big Business for Talent,"Aug 11, 2023",Cynthia Kay,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-ways-small-businesses-can-compete-with-big-business-for/456698,"
You see it everywhere. ""Now Hiring,"" ""Benefits from Day One,"" or ""Join our Team.""Everyone is searching for employees, and if you are a startup or small business trying to hire them, the statistics are scary. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 9.8 million open jobs in the US. Even with people entering the workplace by the thousands, there are still not enough workers. Large businesses with massive recruitment efforts and great benefits find it difficult to recruit talent.So, you might wonder if a smaller entity can compete. Yes. I have lured talent from bigger organizations such as retailers, media networks and global manufacturers. How? By showing that small business provides faster opportunities for growth and work-life balance.



Here are three things that small businesses can do to attract talent.Related: How Entrepreneurs Can Find Great Talent Despite a Labor Shortage


1. Provide greater flexibilityMost small businesses are not overly corporate. Policies and procedures are simpler and do not need to be one-size-fits-all. As you recruit, telling potential employees that you are open to options is a huge plus. Can an employee work from home one or two days a week? Can you provide flexibility in work hours? Can an employee request time off without endless approvals?Pay is important. But numerous workplace studies show that flexibility is ""very important"" to job seekers. The goal is to get work done and be responsive to customers. At a small business, where and how that happens can be accomplished in many ways. When it comes to work-life balance, the pandemic forever changed what employees want from employers. The bottom line is this: people want to know that you care about their well-being and provide flexibility. Share that when trying to attract talent.Related: How to Attract and Retain Employees in the New Age of Work2. Offer varietyThere is greater structure in larger companies, and individuals have very specific roles and tasks. Without that structure, there would be chaos. In a smaller firm, it is all hands on deck because there are fewer people to shoulder the work. An employee may walk into something new every day. They may have a variety of tasks instead of being slotted into doing one job over and over again. This appeals to those who want to do interesting work that changes day by day. Let's face it; no one wants to be bored at work.


At my company, employees love that they can work on various projects for various customers instead of being assigned to one job or customer account. They do not have to wait in line to get great assignments. We move people around so that they can use their gifts and talents. Part of the week, an employee may be on location working with customers and back in the office the rest of the week.People like to do what they are good at and have opportunities to try new things. We offer newer employees the opportunity to shadow others so they get the full picture of what we do. We look for fun and creative projects that challenge our skills. If an employee is interested in a particular non-profit and wants to use our media production resources to produce a media project, we support them. It builds their skills and helps us give back to the community. Of course, you can't accommodate every request, but working on these projects at slower times can build culture.Related: Corporate Charity Is What Inspires Greater Employee Engagement3. Give employees a voiceIt is no surprise that what motivates younger workers is different than their older counterparts. What do they want? They want to be part of the process. They want to participate and make decisions. They want a voice and be consulted about issues or changes related to their job. They need, and usually want, to find new and diverse ways of doing things. Workers like the idea that they can bring something to the organization and implement it without going through endless gatekeepers.


In my organization, employees play an important role in the hiring process. The team generally meets the applicants and interviews them before I do. Why? They must be able to collaborate with them, so they should have the opportunity to weigh in. As a bonus for the company, they become invested in the success of new hires. Team members are also asked to particpate in equipment buying decisions and help develop new products and services. Create these opportunities and then highlight them with potential employees.Related: The Secrets -- 4 of Them -- to Gaining Employees' TrustThe right fit for a small businessThere is one important thing to note when it comes to recruiting. To fill a position, it is easy to try and force a fit with your organization. Over the years, I have discovered that the right employee for a small business is quite different than one that wants to work for a large company. These individuals are enticed by working for a recognizable name or brand. They love impressive titles, structure and benefits. These individuals should work for a large firm. They probably will not do well in a smaller company with fewer hands to do the work, and the landscape is vastly different.The ideal employee for a smaller firm like mine must be a self-starter. That is because we are ""lean"" by design. They must be entrepreneurial. An individual that is a good fit for a smaller entity does not wait for someone else to step up and figure it out. They love a challenge.


Finding individuals who are right for your small business is not easy. However, small businesses have much to offer and can compete with the big guys. In fact, we are a great alternative for younger workers and those tired of corporate life. We just have to provide greater flexibility, more variety in the work and the opportunity to have a voice.

58,How to Dress for an Interview: Do's and Don'ts to Impress,"Aug 7, 2023",Entrepreneur Staff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-dress-for-an-interview-dos-and-donts-to-impress/456296,"
Navigating the world of job interviews can be a daunting task, especially when considering the different expectations for each work environment.One crucial aspect that often slips through the cracks is the significance of your outfit choice. From formal corporate settings to more relaxed casual environments, your attire speaks volumes about your preparedness and suitability for the role.In this guide, we'll shed light on the critical role of professional attire in crafting a compelling first impression and offer helpful advice to help you dress for success in your next interview, no matter the setting.



Related: How To Prepare For A Job Interview | EntrepreneurWhy is dressing appropriately for a job interview Important?The importance of a first impression cannot be understated. Research suggests that impressions are formed in a matter of seconds and are challenging to alter once made. This truth applies significantly to job interviews, where you have a limited time to make a compelling case for your candidacy.


One critical element in creating a positive impression is your attire. The clothes you choose for an interview can speak volumes about your professionalism, attention to detail and understanding of the company culture. When interviewees are well-dressed, it shows they take the opportunity seriously and can align with the company's dress code.On the other hand, inappropriate attire could lead to negative assumptions about your suitability for the job.Dressing well should be viewed as an integral part of your interview preparation. Much like rehearsing interview questions or researching the company's background, taking time to plan your attire shows your commitment and can boost your confidence. Remember, the goal is not just to dress well, but to dress appropriately for the specific company and type of interview you are attending.Related: Job Interview Preparation Checklist | Entrepreneur


How do you determine the appropriate interview attire?So, how can you determine what to wear to an interview? The first step is research. Start by exploring the company's website and social media channels. These can provide insights into the company culture and dress code. Pay attention to photographs of staff and company events, looking for clues about how employees dress.Another approach is to reach out directly to the recruiter or hiring manager. It's perfectly acceptable to ask about the company's dress code if it's not explicitly stated online. Their guidance can help you choose an outfit that aligns with their expectations.Understanding common dress codes can also be useful. For instance, ""business professional"" typically refers to traditional corporate attire, including suits and dress shoes. ""Business casual"" strikes a balance between professional and relaxed, with items like blazers, button-down shirts and loafers. A ""casual"" dress code is the most relaxed and might include polo shirts and clean khakis.Related: Business Professional Attire for Interviews | Entrepreneur


What constitutes a professional interview outfit for men?For a business professional interview, men should opt for a suit in a neutral color such as navy blue, a crisp dress shirt, dress pants and dress shoes. This attire exudes professionalism and aligns with traditional business environments.When dressing for a business casual interview, men can choose khakis or chinos, a button-down shirt, a blazer or cardigan and loafers.

59,How to Build an Economy-Proof Team,"Aug 4, 2023",Jordan Glazier,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-find-the-employees-that-make-an-economy-proof-team/454554,"
Regardless of the economic environment, having an outstanding team is the key ingredient for any successful business.This concept is especially important in a setting where the capital markets and M&A environment might be less active. You cannot build a successful enterprise with a long-term acquisition strategy by another firm. You need a business that can stand on its own feet. And for a business to succeed, especially in economically challenging times, building an independent, self-sufficient team that can grow and thrive and effectively use company resources is a critical consideration.From my past experience building three different companies in challenging environments, I outline some guiding principles for entrepreneurs to keep in mind when deciding the type of employees they want to join their team, whether in today's challenging economy or, frankly, during any economic cycle. These practices include keeping a lean mindset and using characteristic-based criteria when recruiting new talent.



There is an inherent tension between building and investing ahead of the curve to develop a massive business vs. keeping belts tightened, whether due to fiscal responsibility or a tough economy. There is also a big difference between a company built to last as opposed to one built to flip. Successful businesses are built to last.Related: 3 Prudent Hiring Practices to Acquire the Best Talent


Talent acquisition best practicesTo be successful in the first place, companies should employ a standard for talent acquisition that pays off in the long run. Proper staffing starts with our hiring practices. Some of the hiring practices that have enabled us to run ""lean and mean"" while creating a foundation for success in the process include the following principles:We hire slowly; we hire carefully. We are proud to be lean and effective. Rather than taking pride in a large employee roster, we take pride in building a high-performance, high-output, ""small-but-mighty"" team.We tend to hire in small waves. We gain enough foresight to anticipate our future staffing needs beyond the horizon. And with that, we add new team members with enough time for them to get their sea legs.Before deciding to hire, we ensure we optimize processes and not just throw bodies at inefficient operations. Any business has to make sure that their current team has the right tools to do their jobs efficiently.While most typical hiring practices focus on experience and skill sets, we place equal weight on the personal characteristics, work ethic and inherent attributes a candidate has. Altogether, we believe candidates meeting our core characteristics will contribute the most and lead to a high-functioning team.Related: Having Trouble Hiring? Your Best Resource Could Be Right Under Your Nose.Hiring the right people for the right jobTeam building means putting together a valuable group of people with specific skills and a common purpose. But we recommend going beyond simply evaluating skills. We look at candidates' personal characteristics, such as how responsive they are to change and how they approach challenges and ambiguity. We are a startup, after all!From all the factors we've considered, we've distilled the four core characteristics that form the basis of our hiring filters and ongoing performance management principles.


These factors are as important to us as functional expertise. We look for:Flexibility. We are adaptive and responsive. We thrive in changing environments. We are not afraid of ambiguity. We are open-minded and receptive to feedback. We embrace a growth mindset that inspires us to evolve and learn.Initiative. We are self-starters and autonomous. We take ownership and responsibility for our work and can be relied on to get the job done. We are thorough, prepared, and put a high priority on quality output. We recognize we won't always be perfect, but it would not be for lack of trying. When we see challenges, our instinct is to find solutions. We embody perseverance, grit and resilience.Creative. We take an inspired and forward-thinking approach to our work. We love to think and work outside the box. We are innately driven to find unique and innovative approaches. We bring vision and passion to our role and the team.Collaborative. We are one team. We celebrate each other's successes. We don't lay blame when there are failures but instead work together towards a solution. We value effective and proactive communication. We look out for one another, bring out the best in each other and genuinely enjoy working together.Whether it's a tough economy or a particularly lengthy or complex business cycle, the key ingredient for success is an exceptional team. Flexibility, initiative, creativity and collaboration form the core of our hiring principles. Keeping this in mind, I recommend every business build out its own specific guidelines about the ideal values they would seek out in the team as part of the hiring process.Never underestimate the power of a remarkable team. By investing the time to develop hiring guidelines that specifically reflect your company's values and then carefully finding the unique individuals who match those values, you'll lay the foundation for an exceptional workforce, with the exact people you want in the trenches with you.

60,Why You Need to Stop Hiring Yourself and Hire for Your Weaknesses Instead,"Aug 3, 2023",Clate Mask,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-you-shouldnt-hire-top-talent-and-focus-on-hiring-your/456185,"
In my decades of entrepreneurship, I've seen other business owners repeatedly make a troubling mistake: finding and hiring folks who are just like them. Admittedly, I've made the same mistake — and learned how problematic it can be.Here's a look at why every entrepreneur must avoid falling into this trap and what you can do differently when it's time to grow your team.Hire for your weaknessesNobody wants to spend time thinking about where they fall short or the issues brewing in their business. But you have to face the music to create the right team. If you don't, you risk hiring people who share your same blindspots. This is a natural human tendency, as we all subconsciously gravitate toward people who think like us, talk like us and are like us. It makes us comfortable. But comfort can breed complacency and then stagnancy. It also means your business may struggle because you're hiring people with similar views and talents rather than diversifying your team's skill set.



Let's say you're a visionary and excel at galvanizing groups of people toward achieving shared goals. These are admirable and necessary qualities for a business leader. But, if you don't also have someone who is equally strong in operations and finance, all of your great plans and people skills won't be enough to maintain your business's growth. Hiring for your weaknesses instead ensures your team and its collective skills are comprehensive and well-rounded.Here's an important note: Hiring for your weaknesses means more than finding a charismatic salesperson if you're a shy introvert. Broaden the scope. Yes, look for hires with different strengths than you do, but layer on other aspects too. The people who complement you and your contributions the most will be those with different personalities, passions, perspectives and backgrounds. Go for breadth and depth, not just surface differentiators.


Related: Hire Smart: How to Tell a Startup Superstar From a Weak LinkDevelop your self-awareness muscleOf course, entrepreneurs might struggle to identify their weaknesses. How can they hire for them if they're not sure what they are? While some founders are quick to admit that they're not as strong, others have been wearing all the hats for so long that they mistakenly believe they're good at all of it. This might sound negative, but it isn't usually rooted in ego. Instead, these types of owners often feel they have to white-knuckle every part of the business out of necessity or a desire for control.Here's the reality if you're a human and a business owner: You're strongest in a few areas and weaker in others. If you don't agree with that statement, it's time to strengthen your self-awareness muscles. Here are a few questions to ask yourself if you're not sure what domains should remain yours — and which ones shouldn't — in the business. When do I feel the most excitement? What tasks do I dread the most? In what areas have I or the business performed poorly? In what areas have I or the business excelled?Answering these simple questions should give you some clear answers about where you shine versus where you should invite others to shine. If you're still unsure, pose the question to your peers, trusted advisors, or family and friends. When people know you well, they'll know your strengths and should be all too happy to share their thoughts with you.


Hire for culture fit firstFinally, think about your purpose, values and mission. Do you have these defined? If so, great. If not, take the time to create them thoughtfully. When hiring anybody, you should be hiring for culture fit first, skills and other factors second.So, what does this look like in the hiring process? Well, what makes your culture unique? Do you value people who speak their minds and are quick to boldly debate or push back if they disagree with the direction you're headed? Or do you prefer team members who like to keep their heads down and follow a plan they've been given? Ask questions in every interview to get a sense of personality and style, so you can see whether someone jives with certain aspects of your culture.Hiring for a culture fit also means hiring to your purpose, values and mission. Do you have these defined? If not, take the time to create them thoughtfully. When interviewing a candidate, ask questions to see if their values align with yours.For example, our purpose at Keap is to liberate and empower entrepreneurs to strengthen families, communities and economies. Most of the people we hire have a passion for or tie to entrepreneurship in some way. We draw out these stories in our interviews, eager to hear that someone watched their dad grow his small business throughout their childhood or is proud of their best friend for launching her own company. This tells us that this future employee shares the team's passion for helping our customers' businesses thrive.


By working on your self-awareness and hiring for your weaknesses, while simultaneously hiring for culture fit, you'll end up with a robust team that moves your business forward and works like a dream together.

62,Are You Guilty of Poor Onboarding? The Consequences Are Worse Than You Think.,"Aug 2, 2023",Gleb Tsipursky,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/are-you-guilty-of-poor-onboarding-the-consequences-are/456551,"
Starting a new job is like diving into a swimming pool. A refreshing and invigorating dive can make for a memorable experience, while a belly flop can leave you in pain and feeling embarrassed. The onboarding process is the dive, and just like a dive, when done poorly, it can leave lasting consequences on new hires, especially remote and hybrid workers. A recent survey by Paychex reveals the effects of poor onboarding on new employees and their inclination to stick around.First impressions matter: The onboarding experiencePicture this: You're attending a party, and the host greets you with a warm welcome, introduces you to the guests, and offers you a drink. You'd feel comfortable and well-received, right? Onboarding should be like that — a seamless, positive and engaging experience. But the reality is different for many employees.Only 52% of new hires feel satisfied with their onboarding experience, with 32% finding it confusing and 22% disorganized. Remote workers fare worse, with 36% of them finding the process baffling. It's like trying to assemble an IKEA furniture without the instructions.



Interestingly, 54% of finance industry employees are most likely to be satisfied with their onboarding experience, compared to only 31% of employees in the business industry. Generationally, Gen Zers are the happiest (62%) while Gen Xers lag behind (43%). This generational gap is a crucial factor for HR departments to consider while designing their onboarding processes.Related: 3 Steps for Onboarding Remote and In-Person Employees That Make Your Hybrid Team More Collaborative


Onboarding gone wrong: The falloutA poor onboarding experience is like an ill-fitting shoe; it leaves employees feeling uncomfortable and dejected. The most significant impact is that 52% of new hires feel undertrained, with small company employees (66%) and remote workers (63%) suffering the most. It's like trying to win a marathon with flip-flops.The generational factor also plays a role, with 58% of Gen X feeling undertrained compared to 45% of millennials. Addressing these gaps is vital for companies to retain their workforce and maintain productivity.Pushing new hires out the doorAn undertrained and disoriented new hire is like a fish out of water — they'll flop around, gasping for air, and looking for an escape. In this case, escape means quitting. A staggering 50% of newly hired employees plan to leave their job soon, skyrocketing to 80% for those feeling undertrained due to poor onboarding. On the flip side, only 7% of well-trained employees plan to leave soon.Size does matter, as small-company employees are more likely to quit (59%) compared to those in large companies (38%). Surprisingly, despite feeling satisfied with their onboarding, Gen Zers are the most likely to plan a swift exit (58%). It seems that onboarding is a crucial make-or-break experience for new hires, particularly for older generations.


Re-onboarding is like giving your employees a second chance at a first impression. By taking all employees through the onboarding process again, you can re-engage and revitalize your team. The results are impressive: employees become more focused (47%), energized (42%), productive (34%), and efficient (33%). Plus, re-onboarding increases employee retention by a whopping 43%.Case studies of poor onboardingI've seen a number of case studies of poor onboarding harming companies. For example, a middle-market SaaS firm experienced high turnover rates among its remote and hybrid employees due to a poorly executed onboarding process. New hires were not provided with clear guidelines, expectations or adequate training. As a result, employees felt undertrained and undervalued, leading to a lack of engagement and commitment to the organization. Within six months, the company saw a 60% turnover rate among remote and hybrid employees, leading to significant recruitment and training costs.A large marketing agency encountered growth challenges due to its poor onboarding process for remote and hybrid workers. New employees were not equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in their roles, leading to subpar work quality and missed deadlines. The company's reputation suffered as clients became dissatisfied with the level of service provided. The agency struggled to attract new clients and retain existing ones, which hindered its growth and expansion plans.A mid-sized financial services firm faced compliance issues due to poor onboarding of its remote and hybrid employees. The onboarding process did not adequately cover essential policies, procedures, and legal requirements, leading to errors and oversights by the new hires. The firm was eventually penalized by regulatory bodies for non-compliance, causing financial strain and damage to their professional reputation.


In each of these case studies, the organizations faced significant challenges due to poor onboarding of remote and hybrid workers. Proper onboarding is crucial to ensure employee satisfaction, productivity, and company success in today's increasingly remote and hybrid work environments.The psychological pitfalls of onboardingIn addition to the logistical challenges of onboarding new remote and hybrid hires, cognitive biases can also play a significant role in shaping the experience. These biases can cloud judgment, hinder decision-making, and create misconceptions about new employees' performance and potential. Let's explore two specific cognitive biases and their impact on the onboarding process: the halo effect and optimism bias.The halo effect occurs when an individual's positive qualities or achievements in one area influence our perception of them in other areas. In the context of onboarding, a new hire with an impressive resume or a glowing recommendation might be seen as more competent and capable than they actually are. This can lead to unrealistic expectations and a lack of appropriate training and support during the onboarding process.For example, a remote employee who is an expert in their field may be assumed to excel in all aspects of their job, including time management and communication skills. However, they may struggle with the unique challenges of remote work, such as staying organized and maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Failing to recognize these potential shortcomings due to the halo effect can lead to insufficient support and training, ultimately affecting the new hire's performance and job satisfaction.


To combat the halo effect, it's essential to provide equal training and support to all new hires, regardless of their past achievements or qualifications. This ensures that each employee receives the necessary resources to succeed in their role, setting them up for long-term success.Optimism bias is the tendency to overestimate the likelihood of positive outcomes and underestimate the probability of negative ones. In the onboarding process, this bias can manifest in several ways, such as underestimating the time and resources required for effective onboarding or assuming that new employees will easily adapt to their new work environment without much support.For instance, a manager might be overly optimistic about a hybrid employee's ability to balance their time between the office and remote work. This misplaced confidence can result in inadequate training and support, causing the employee to struggle with time management, communication and collaboration.To counter optimism bias, it's crucial to approach the onboarding process with a realistic mindset, recognizing the potential challenges that new hires might face, especially in remote and hybrid work settings. By proactively addressing these issues and providing appropriate training and resources, you can create a more supportive and successful onboarding experience for your new employees.

By refining the onboarding process, you can boost employee retention, morale and productivity. Customizable onboarding software and tailored approaches can help create a smoother experience for all employees, especially remote and hybrid workers who require extra attention. By focusing on the unique needs of employees in different industries, generations, and company sizes, you can ensure that everyone has the support and resources they need to succeed.Here are some tips to enhance your onboarding process:1. Prepare a comprehensive onboarding planA well-structured onboarding plan is like a roadmap, guiding new hires through their initial days and setting them up for success. Outline the goals, key milestones and timelines for new employees, ensuring that they have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities.


2. Assign buddies or mentorsPairing new hires with experienced colleagues can provide invaluable support and guidance during the onboarding process. This mentorship can help them quickly navigate the company culture and address any concerns they may have, fostering a sense of belonging and camaraderie.3. Offer continuous training and supportOnboarding isn't a one-time event, but an ongoing process. Regularly provide new hires with opportunities for growth, skill development and support, ensuring they feel well-equipped to tackle their roles. This can be particularly crucial for remote and hybrid employees who may need additional resources to succeed in a virtual work environment.4. Encourage open communicationEstablish a culture of open communication, encouraging new hires to ask questions, share their thoughts and seek help when needed. This can help employees feel more comfortable in their roles and promote a sense of trust and transparency within the team.5. Gather feedback and iterateAs with any process, there's always room for improvement. Gather feedback from new hires on their onboarding experience and use this insight to fine-tune your process. By continually iterating and adapting, you can ensure that your onboarding experience remains fresh, relevant, and effective.

63,5 Media Strategies Every Entrepreneur Needs to Know,"Aug 2, 2023",Kelsey Kloss,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-minute-media-training-5-essentials-every-entrepreneur/456109,"
When it comes to speaking with the press, don't make ""winging it"" your strategy. Even if you know your subject matter inside and out — or you're known for your ability to speak eloquently — preparation is key for entrepreneurs or high-level executives.In my experience, the more media experience someone has, the more they practice. I've seen regular TODAY show guests running through talking points repeatedly in the green room, and seasoned sources for The New York Times consult their press team for pointers.Preparing doesn't mean you're not a natural with the press. In fact, it's quite the opposite: It shows that you understand journalists are looking for key things to provide their audience with value — and that you're willing to cater to that.



Only have five minutes? Here's media training in a nutshell.1. Prepare concise messaging ahead of timeWhen it comes to interviews, more is not more. Journalists only have so much space or air time to get to the core of your story — and they appreciate sources who can be clear, concise and impactful with fewer words.


Think about your messaging beforehand: What is the clearest, quickest way to get to the point? Clear messaging avoids jargon or complicated industry-specific terms. Give the journalist the concise version of your messaging first (this should typically take no more than 10-15 seconds), then follow up with details if they ask for more.Journalists already have questions prepared for you, so avoid monologuing. Many sources have used their entire interview time on the first question, which can be frustrating for the reporter — and less serviceable for the audience.If you can answer a journalist's questions directly and clearly, you'll increase your chances of being featured again.Related: 5 Things Journalists Wish You Knew About Getting Press Coverage for Your Company


2. Do phone interviews rightMake sure you're available and in a quiet place when the phone rings. Journalists know sources are busy and sometimes need to take interviews on the go, but it's much more difficult for them to accurately transcribe your quotes if you're speaking on a busy sidewalk versus an office. A quiet space helps to ensure accuracy.Speak slowly and clearly. The journalist is either transcribing your interview in real-time or recording the conversation to transcribe later, so speaking slowly will make it easier for them to pull your quotes.If you're being interviewed by phone for a radio show, you may find it tempting to have detailed notes in front of you. However, this can make your responses feel stiff and scripted, which doesn't translate well for radio. It can also leave you scrambling for your notes on a given topic when asked about it, leading to unnatural pauses in your dialogue.Instead, jot down a few bullet points with your main talking points — they shouldn't exceed one index card! — and keep it in front of you as a gentle reminder, if needed.


3. Cater to the cameraWhen it comes to broadcast, a straight face looks like a frown on camera, so smile if it fits the tone. Also, raise the pitch of your voice ever so slightly to avoid vocal fry, which is more noticeable and distracting on camera.As with a phone interview, speak slowly. This will help you sound more confident and will also relax you. If you tend to forget to breathe during higher-stress situations like live broadcasts, practice your talking points with designated breaks for catching a breath. By doing so, you'll naturally slow down and sound more at ease on camera.Feel free to use your hands when speaking, but be mindful not to overuse gestures that may be distracting. Avoid holding your hands in front of your body, which can make you look timid. Finally, never turn away from the camera, even when you're speaking to the host.Related: Three Mistakes To Avoid When You're On Camera


4. Know which topics are off-limitsDo what you can ahead of the interview to alert the journalist of any off-limit topics. Chances are, they'll be just as eager to avoid an awkward situation as you are — especially if you're interviewing for lifestyle content rather than hard-hitting news.However, if they're pressing for information on a certain off-limit topic, a few phrases you can prepare ahead of time are:""I'm not able to answer that question until I have more information. But here's what I can tell you…""""I understand that's a concern, but I believe the true root of the issue is this, and here's why…""""That's not my area of expertise, as much as I'd love to help you. However, from my own experience, here's what I can share…""And while you can say ""off the record,"" and a journalist should not publicize that information, it's generally best to avoid off-the-record remarks unless they're truly important for the story's context. It's too easy for the lines between ""on the record"" and ""off the record"" to accidentally get blurred during an interview.Related: Answering Difficult Questions: The How-To


5. Practice improvisation for live momentsWithout a doubt, a situation or question will come up that you didn't prepare for. Perhaps you're giving a baking demo, and the egg doesn't crack quite right. Or maybe you stumble over your words and say something unintelligible.Beyond doing the best you can to prepare for any situation, also be prepared to laugh at yourself (or simply address the blunder quickly) and move on right away. Your audience will only stumble over that moment as much as you do — and air time is precious.In today's world, authenticity is valued more than perfection. Your viewers aren't looking for a flawless, scripted segment. They're looking for another person to learn from, relate to, and connect with. That's what will form a genuine connection and loyal following for your brand.

64,No Backseat Driving: How Leading by Example Sets the Pace for Success in Your Business,"Aug 2, 2023",Brendan P. Keegan & Zak Brown,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-leading-by-example-sets-the-pace-for-success-in-your/456223,"
The greatest leaders are those who lead by example: Roger Penske, founder, chairman and CEO of Penske Automotive Group, has garnered an immense amount of respect by prioritizing regular visits to his dealerships and spending time with his mechanics, discussing how things are going over a cup of coffee.Similarly, Ron Dennis, founder of the McLaren Technology Group, played an instrumental role in elevating McLaren's position as a formidable F1 contender. However, that achievement wouldn't have been possible without his active involvement in the minute details of the organization. Dennis was known for conducting a tour of the McLaren race cars before every race to ensure the design and details met every expectation.Leading by example is just as critical in today's business environment as it was for Penske, Dennis and others who created lasting legacies. It fosters trust and unity through organizations and helps prepare the next generation of talented people to get into the driver's seat. If you want to accelerate your success, taking a hands-on approach and doing what you want others to do can get your pedal to the floor.



Your values are meant to go beyond youTo lead by example means being a values-driven leader — that is, you let what you believe in shape the actions you demonstrate in front of people. What's important to you as an individual? An organization? Both layers come into play and should line up with each other.Why should you ensure others see, know and understand your values? Because eventually, someone else is going to have to take the wheel. Unless you instill your values in somebody else, there won't be anybody to keep driving the race you started.


Suppose one of your values is courage. You take reasonable risks yourself. But then, when someone tries something, and it's unsuccessful, you chew them out, demote them or dish out some other form of discipline. That sends the message that you don't really want others to be courageous and deters them from going out on a limb. Your value of courage won't spread through the business, and your potential legacy will be lost.Related: If You Want to Be a Good Leader, Understand The Link Between Business Values and LeadershipSometimes you drive, and sometimes you hand over the keysIn any strong organization, people learn from the leader, who sets the stage for innovation. But the leader also recognizes they're not always the smartest person in the room. They learn from their people, partners or other experts.But you can't listen and talk at the same time. So part of leading by example is knowing when to drive and when to hand over the keys. Your instinct for discerning when you can entrust responsibility to someone else and when you need to step in and course correct will improve over time. Be prepared not to interfere, and trust the new drivers you coach to do what they've seen from you.


Instilling your values as part of this two-way interaction requires you to be relatable, approachable and authentic. Most people can't maintain the masks they try to wear, so just be yourself. Some leaders thrive off of communicating with their employees, so when they receive a kind email thanking them for something, they may choose to send a lengthy response in return. But if your leadership style doesn't include such an approach, that's also OK. It's more important to be consistent with your brand; even a short response note will be enough to let the employee know you see and appreciate their comments. Little gestures that are a genuine reflection of who you are will still add up.Related: How To Show Humility as a Leader Without Apologizing for Your SuccessYou're human, and so are we allEvery leader occasionally misses the mark as they try to lead by example. One of the most common blunders is setting expectations that aren't supported by the organization's systems (like hiring and promotion), such as telling people you want them to innovate but never talking about innovation in performance reviews, thereby failing to measure and reward it. This approach might get you short-term gains, but you won't have long-term sustainable wins.The hurdles don't stop there. Leaders can set the bar too high and not be empathetic enough to understand what others around them can really manage. They may fail to follow through on their word. Additionally, much of leading by example is preparation — the more thoughtful and well-briefed you are, and the more you know how you want to portray yourself, the easier it is to send a consistent message without getting thrown off track. But sometimes, ego or fear also prompts leaders to fake it when they don't know something or aren't prepared.


Fortunately, nobody expects you to be perfect. Emotional intelligence is a journey, and at the end of the day, we're all people. So cut yourself a little slack. When you make a mistake, your best bet is to own it and say, ""I wasn't my best. I'm going to try to do better."" People respect when someone comes clean about what went wrong and holds themselves accountable.There's a real risk to not being willing to lead by example: If people see a gap between what you say you believe and what you do, your team won't trust you. If people can't trust you, they won't respect you. Respect is hard to win back once you lose it. And if you don't have it, good luck driving the organization through the finish line because people aren't going to respond to whatever calls to action you give.Related: 4 Reasons Emotionally Intelligent Leaders Impact the Bottom LineThe only way you'll win is if you're out on the trackLeading by example leans on the basic idea that what's good for the goose is good for the gander. If you don't model your values in what you do, people will assume they can do what you do — or rather, what you don't. So if you say one thing but aren't acting on it, don't be surprised if they don't act on it, either.


But by the same token, when you lead by example well, it's inspiring. People believe in themselves simply because you do. When that type of confidence creates synergy in an organization, nothing can stop you.So take the chance. Make some mistakes, but get out in front. It's better than not being in the race at all.

65,10 Ways to Create a Startup Dream Team,"Jul 28, 2023",Murali Nethi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/10-strategies-to-hiring-your-dream-team/455912,"
The founding team lays the foundation for culture, processes and norms that will shape a company for years to come. With limited resources and high uncertainty in the early days, startups must maximize the collective intelligence, energy and motivation of their people. This requires forming a team of the right ""culture-fits"" who share the same vision and values and then fostering an environment of flexibility, autonomy, feedback and continuous learning.As an early employee or founder of a startup, forming the initial team falls on your shoulders. The people you hire in the first few months will significantly impact your company's trajectory. So how do you recruit and develop the team that will propel your vision forward? Here are the top 10 things I believe you must consider.Related: How Your Company Culture Can Be a Force Multiplier (For the Good and the Bad)



1. Hire people who share the same vision and valuesThe most important factor for team cohesion is whether team members share the same vision and values for what the startup is trying to achieve. Discuss the company vision, goals and culture in detail during the hiring process. Bring candidates into discussions with the founding team to gauge their opinions and fit. Hiring the right culture fit is more important than hiring the best skills at the early stage.Related: How to Hire Someone Aligned With the Company's Mission


2. Focus on high effort and willingness to learnMore than specific skill sets, look for candidates who demonstrate a high level of effort, willingness to learn and ability to adapt and grow. Early-stage startups require employees to learn new skills, pivot direction and handle multiple roles. Prioritize candidates who demonstrate a growth mindset, self-motivation,and initiative. You can teach skills but not attitudes.3. Build a flexibility-first organizational structureRather than rigid roles and job descriptions, develop a flexible organizational structure where employees can wear multiple hats and take on new responsibilities as needed. Encourage team members to step up and volunteer when help is needed. Focus on outcomes over fixed tasks and micromanagement. Allow autonomy and trust people to get the job done.Related: Workplace Flexibility Can Impact How You Attract, Hire, And Retain Talent4. Form cross-functional, collaborative teamsBreak down silos between different functions like engineering, design, marketing, etc. Bring team members from diverse backgrounds together into collaborative project teams. Cross-functional teams foster communication, spark innovation and create a culture of sharing knowledge and helping one another. Look for candidates who demonstrate good collaboration and communication skills.


5. Hire people smarter than yourselfThe best startup teams hire people who are smarter and more capable than the founders. Even if a candidate challenges your ideas, that can be good. Hire team members who can provide a different and valuable perspective, even if it means your initial vision needs to evolve. Your job as a leader is to synthesize the best ideas, not have all the answers from the start.Related: How to Find, Hire (and Fire!) Rockstar Employees6. Don't be afraid of attitude, passion and egoWhile attitude and ego can cause issues in larger companies, they can be an asset in early-stage startups if channeled properly. Look for candidates who demonstrate passion and a competitive spirit. An element of healthy ego and ambition can provide the fire and motivation needed in the early stages. Just ensure you have the leadership skills to navigate any potential conflicts constructively.7. Build a feedback-first cultureEstablish processes and norms where team members freely share feedback with one another to improve and grow together as a unit. Schedule weekly one-on-ones and retrospectives where individuals can voice their opinions openly. A feedback-first culture allows everyone to bring their best ideas to the table and quickly course correct when needed. Transparency and psychological safety are key.


8. Create a productive work environmentProvide the tools, resources and workspace that allow employees to do their best work. This may mean flexible hours, coffee bars, game rooms, top-notch hardware and software, or whatever helps people stay productive and motivated. The details will differ for each team, so actively solicit feedback and experiment to find what works. A 'hustle culture' itself is not productive — create an environment where people thrive.Related: Why Hustle Culture Might Be Toxic to Your Business9. Invest in meaningful teambuildingSchedule regular team outings, events and activities that allow employees to bond beyond work. Get to know each other on a personal level and build strong interpersonal relationships and trust. Team building should not feel forced - start small and organize events that team members genuinely enjoy. Seeing the human side of coworkers fosters empathy, collaboration and psychological safety.10. Lead by example and show vulnerability as a founderAs a founder or early employee, set the tone from the top by rolling up your sleeves, taking on the toughest tasks, admitting mistakes and showing genuine appreciation and care for team members. Be vulnerable and honest about challenges and uncertainties. Leading by example and creating a transparent, humble culture will inspire others to give their best. Be careful not to take more credit than you deserve.


As SnapBlooms continues to grow, we are mindful that our people and culture will ultimately determine our success or failure. And we foster an environment of transparency, feedback and experimentation to learn and adapt as an organization quickly. Our hope is that by following these principles, we can build an effective team culture that empowers us to revolutionize the floral industry.The right people are your most valuable resource as a founder. So invest heavily in recruiting, developing and keeping your early team members happy. The efforts you make now will pay enormous dividends as your startup scales and your initial team members become the culture carriers that onboard future hires!

I hire bartenders.It's not because I enjoy an occasional cocktail. It's because companies, like the drinks, are often better if they're shaken up. Bringing in someone with different experience and a solid work ethic — like a bartender — will agitate a business in a healthy way that, in the long run, delivers greater engagement, innovation, and competitiveness. When you unusually do business, you'll find that talent and greatness can essentially be found anywhere. The first step is knowing where to look.Related: 6 Steps for Hiring the Right People to Build Effective Teams



A first-hand lesson from the kitchenWhen I was working as a busboy at 15, I was thrown into a trial by fire by my boss:""Do you know how to cook?""""I mean, I've seen the cooks do it.""""Good. We have nobody to cook tonight, so you and I are in the kitchen.""That night started my hands-on education about how hard everybody in the service industry works. Today, some tasks are easier thanks to tools like point-of-sale systems and better organization. But service workers still work hard. They're still used to listening to the story of that one person who just got divorced while getting yelled at by 50 other people. They're still handling the stress of drunk or belligerent people, not getting home to their families until 2 or 3 a.m. and other problems like customers not paying their bills.I like to hire people that are hard workers, energetic about their job, compassionate and understanding. Having seen service people at work, bartenders fit that bill. I know that if they can deal with everything that's thrown at them daily, they certainly can deal with working for me, where the worst thing that can happen is having to answer a call at 11:00 o'clock at night because I'm stuck in a Detroit airport needing a flight home.


How does this play out in real life? Take the case of the bartender from a restaurant I went to almost every day. She talked about her marketing experience and background as a veteran, and I could see she was a highly organized and driven individual. When a customer was a jerk to her, she put them in their place, and I thought, that's the kind of person I want protecting me from people trying to call and break down my door. So, I teased her for almost a year about how I was going to hire her.When my previous assistant moved to another city, my bartender friend took the job. She jumped in and didn't ask questions. She got HR certified, passing an incredibly difficult test the first time she took it. Now, she runs my entire HR department and is closing on her first house, all because of a conversation that started two years ago as I watched her run back and forth during dinner.Real people, real gainsA lot of businesses get complacent. They're used to handling processes a certain way and are afraid to bring in new perspectives. They don't think to reach across the line. So I wasn't surprised about how people reacted when I brought in a bartender. They thought I was insane to let someone with zero experience in the industry be the gatekeeper for all seven of our companies.But now they've seen the work ethic. They've changed how they post job listings: Instead of saying they want a salesperson to have marketing experience in human resource tech, they'll put up a post that says they're looking for a creative person who can bring new ideas from outside the HR tech world. They encourage everybody to apply because they understand they could find diamonds in the rough and that, when they see that talent, the added diversity of background and experiences builds a competitive edge that's advantageous for company growth.


Many talented people haven't been given the same chances and opportunities as others. Maybe they couldn't afford to go to school or married and had young children. But they're creative. They're smart. They're hard workers. When you think outside the box, take someone out of a tough situation and redirect their career path, they're challenged in high-pressure environments they actually enjoy. The workers get benefits — real benefits like health insurance, not fake ones. They get to see their kids before they go to bed. They're home in time for dinner. So it creates a reasonable sense of appreciation and loyalty.Related: Which Is More Important, Work Ethic or Talent?Staying on course while doing something differentHiring is an example of when breaking the rules can be a fantastic idea. But not every out-of-the-box idea is worth pursuing. I get a lot of ideas from my team, but I also have hundreds of people who count on me to push the organization, achieve our goals and go to the place I told them we would. So, I have to continually remind them that if a concept doesn't align with the company vision, the current state of the business, and where we're headed, it will be an absolute no.Businesses might not always start out as defined as leaders need them to be, and there are a lot of turns and stop signs on the journey to find their path. Some leaders see how long it takes. They see it's hard. They think that they may change things if they take a sharp right turn. But most of the time, that's where people fail because the turn they make isn't researched.


So, believe in the vision. Get the right people. Then let them go do it.Related: How to Be More Creative in Your BusinessDon't just step out of the box — destroy itI'm not going to encourage leaders to fire their employees and hire bartenders, and bartenders aren't going to change the velocity or vision of the organization. But what hiring bartenders does is bring in a unique perspective and hardworking attitude. Having others see how bartenders behave creates a different kind of buzz, motivation and respect that can propel a business to success.So, however diverse experience gets through the door, be willing to step on the box. Crush it and rip the paper off. Having something new to build on might just provide the boost needed to take your business to the next level.

67,How Your Company Culture Can Be a Force Multiplier (For the Good and the Bad),"Jul 25, 2023",Steve Arizpe,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-your-company-culture-can-be-a-force-multiplier/455705,"
While company culture has been heralded as a catalyst to business success, notably more so in the last five years, viewing it as a force multiplier to be reckoned with — good or bad — can mean the difference between success and failure. Although the term force multiplier originated in military science to explain how a combination of certain factors can help accomplish greater feats than would occur without them, this concept can be applied to many areas of life, especially in the business world.Savvy leaders who understand the multiplying effect of company culture on every aspect of business operations typically promote a robust business model based on a people-focused approach that supports a high-performing workforce.As more and more leaders use company culture to amplify efforts/output, it is important to understand the factors in equations that equal the final products. Listed below are three areas to consider.



Related: Want Elite Performance? Adopt These 5 Practices Of Top Tactical Units1. Define the equationWhen using a mathematical analogy to address a business approach incorporating a force multiplier, it is important to define the equation: Factor x Multiplier = Final Product. When company culture is used as a multiplier, every aspect of a business is significantly impacted by the culture and can become better or worse; stronger or weaker; more efficient or less efficient; and productive or unproductive, depending on the type of culture.


As the term implies, multipliers enable factors to quickly exceed their original level with profound outcomes in a positive or negative direction. Culture can propel companies to new levels or bring them to a grinding halt. Culture is a strong force to be reckoned with because it has power and influence that can make or break a company.Related: Why Creating a Culture of Feedback is Vital to Business Survival2. Set the stageFor culture to positively influence a company, it should be a culture by design instead of default. A great culture based on a strong mission and company values serves as a solid foundation for a company and sets the stage for all business functions to grow and flourish. Companies that take a strategic approach to creating a culture that people want to be a part of and grow within are better positioned for long-term success because they can rely on their culture as a force multiplier.Components of a great culture address employee needs and wants — financial, health/wellness, professional/social and community — with outstanding benefits/compensation packages, generous PTO and flexible schedules, training/development programs, community involvement activities and more.


When employers address the needs and want of a workforce with outstanding benefits/perks, they are not only displaying their support for employees, but they are also creating a destination workplace based on a culture that is second to none.Related: Building An Exceptional Workplace Culture: What Are The Determining Factors?3. Understand the final products and benefitsSavvy leaders realize that people are a company's most valuable asset, and without people – employees and customers – there is no business. Therefore, when culture serves as a positive force multiplier that revolves around people, the final products/benefits in the equations should result in substantial people-focused improvements that build upon each other, impact the bottom line and lead to ongoing business success. Key areas include:Recruiting and hiring x Culture = More qualified candidates. When company culture is used to boost recruiting and hiring efforts, every phase of the process should reflect the mission and values of a company, including job descriptions, postings, interviews, team introductions and ongoing post-hire communications, which exposes candidates and new hires to the culture before joining a company.


When the culture is consistently reinforced, companies can attract qualified candidates/new hires with similar values and beliefs who can make a difference. It also makes the hiring process more efficient and less costly, affecting the bottom line.Onboarding and Training x Culture = Increased Employee Retention. Onboarding and training programs that integrate company culture into their processes help new hires acclimate and ramp up faster. Programs should include detailed explanations of how roles contribute to a team and the company, an overview of processes and procedures and an assigned team mentor for guidance, questions and assistance with day-to-day technology. When new employees are warmly welcomed and supported, they feel more connected to a company, resulting in happy, productive workers who are less likely to leave, increasing employee retention.Performance management x culture = Improved employee engagement and performance.  Companies with a robust performance management program typically boast a culture that promotes professional development, including reskilling and upskilling programs, career planning/paths, mentorship opportunities and tuition reimbursement for continuing education and industry certifications. When employers are committed to the professional development of workers, they continue to learn and grow within a company, leading to discretionary efforts, improved engagement and increased performance.Customer service x culture = Increased customer experience and retention. When leaders encourage employees to extend the company culture through proactive customer interactions by forming relationships and treating them as one of the family, it is an excellent way for customers to gain better insight into who they are doing business with, which can lead to an unparalleled customer experience and increased retention. Further, loyal customers may purchase additional products/services and lead to valuable referrals, which help increase company revenues.


The power of multiplication cannot be overstated, especially in business operations when culture is used as a force multiplier to achieve greater people-focused results that lead to tenured employees who perform at high levels for sustained business success.

Many examples of strengths can help you stand out in an interview.For instance, your people skills, including empathy and active listening, are particularly important in today's collaborative work environment. These traits can facilitate better communication and more effective problem-solving, fostering a positive work culture.


Moreover, traits like adaptability, resilience, critical thinking and creativity are all examples of strengths that demonstrate your potential as an effective and flexible team player.Here are some tips for identifying your strengths.Assess your soft skillsYou can start by assessing your soft skills.

How do you present your strengths without bragging?Presenting your strengths without sounding boastful is a delicate balance that requires practice. The STAR method — Situation, Task, Action, Result — is a commonly used technique to structure your responses. It enables you to share specific examples of how you've used your strengths in real-world situations.For instance, if your communication skills are a strength, you could describe a situation where you used these skills to resolve a conflict between team members, ensuring smooth project management. Discuss the task at hand, the actions you took and the result of your efforts.In addition, your online professional presence can be an extension of your self-presentation. Tools like LinkedIn and other social media platforms allow you to demonstrate your strengths subtly. Your writing skills will play a pivotal role in demonstrating these strengths, as a well-articulated project summary can subtly communicate your competencies and achievements.Endorsements from colleagues or a well-crafted project summary can showcase your strengths like teamwork, leadership or problem-solving abilities without any overt bragging. This approach can create a powerful impression even before the actual job interview.

Align your response with the job description, highlighting the skills and experiences that make you a strong candidate. For instance, if you're applying for a project management role, you might discuss your ability to effectively meet deadlines and lead teams.


""What is your greatest strength?""This question allows you to talk about a specific strength in detail. Prepare beforehand with sample answers and templates, ensuring that you demonstrate how your strengths apply to the role. If your greatest strength is problem-solving, describe a situation where this strength helped you overcome a challenge.""How do your strengths align with the job description?""This question requires you to link your strengths to specific requirements in the job description. If the role requires strong time management skills, share examples of your ability to handle multiple tasks within strict timelines.Related: 50 Most Common Interview Questions | EntrepreneurHow to identify your weaknesses for a job interviewIdentifying weaknesses requires honest self-criticism. It's about recognizing areas where you can improve while also showcasing your commitment to personal growth.


For example, are you a perfectionist? This trait, while leading to high-quality work, can sometimes result in spending too much time on specific tasks, thus affecting your ability to meet deadlines. Another common weakness is procrastination. Recognizing and taking steps to improve this issue shows your ability to take initiative and strive for a stronger work ethic.It's also beneficial to conduct a strategic job search, where you identify roles that could help mitigate your weaknesses. For example, if your biggest weakness is handling high-pressure sales, you might focus your job search on roles in account management or client relations. In these roles, building long-term relationships and problem-solving is more crucial than immediate sales results.Related: Getting Stronger Is All About Strengthening Your Weaknesses | EntrepreneurHow can you frame your weaknesses positively during a job interview?Discussing weaknesses in a job interview is all about turning negatives into positives. For example, if you're a perfectionist, this trait also shows that you're detail-oriented and committed to producing high-quality work. While perfectionism might sometimes slow you down, it also means that you're less likely to make errors, an important aspect in roles where attention to detail is crucial.


When discussing steps to improve your weaknesses, share specific strategies or tools you've used.For instance, if you lack confidence, you could present it as an opportunity for ongoing growth. You might say, ""I used to lack confidence in leading team meetings. However, I see this as an opportunity for continuous learning. I have actively sought feedback, attended workshops and volunteered to lead small team discussions to overcome this.""This approach shows a commitment to professional development, despite a weakness. Remember, the goal is not to present a flawless image but to show that you're self-aware, proactive and committed to personal and professional growth.Related: Job Seekers: Questions to Ask in an Interview | Entrepreneur


What are common interview questions about weaknesses?Job interview questions are designed to learn as much about the job seekers as possible. While that will often entail questions to identify their list of strengths, it will also include questions to determine their weaknesses as well.Here are a few common examples:""What is your greatest weakness?""When answering this question, honesty is key. Instead of claiming that you don't have any weaknesses, acknowledge an area where you could improve. However, be sure to frame it in a way that shows your self-awareness and commitment to personal growth.For instance, you could discuss how you've been improving a particular skill set or taking steps to mitigate a certain weakness. The idea here is not to expose your flaws but to demonstrate that you can self-reflect and proactively improve.


""Can you describe a time when your work was criticized? How did you handle it?""This question gives you an opportunity to discuss your approach to constructive criticism and feedback. You could share an example from a previous role where you received criticism and describe how you handled it constructively to improve your performance or skills.It's important to convey that you view criticism as a learning opportunity and a tool for professional growth rather than as a personal affront.""Do you struggle with meeting deadlines?""In response to this question, you might talk about your time management skills, even if they're a work in progress. If you've had issues with deadlines in the past, you could explain how you've learned from those experiences and what steps you've taken to improve.Perhaps you started using a time management app, began delegating more tasks or developed a more efficient scheduling system. You'll demonstrate your problem-solving skills and commitment to improving by discussing your proactive measures to improve.Related: 15 Interview Questions You Should Be Prepared to Answer | Glassdoor BlogAce your next interviewDiscussing your strengths and weaknesses in a job interview can feel challenging, but remember, honesty, self-reflection and providing example answers go a long way.

Less is more when it comes to crafting the perfect resume, according to this industry expert.Nolan Church, a former Google recruiter and current CEO of talent marketplace Continuum, says his biggest resume faux pax is too many words and not a lot of context.""The No. 1 thing I don't want to see on a resume is probably text bricks,"" he said in an interview with CNBC Make It, adding that if he sees ""endless streams of text"" on an applicant's credentials, ""there's zero chance you're going to move forward.""

71,3 Online Hiring Mistakes Every Entrepreneur Should Avoid,"Jul 18, 2023",Entrepreneur Deals,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-online-hiring-mistakes-every-entrepreneur-should-avoid/456017,"
Online hiring has become the norm for businesses that are looking for top talent. The convenience and accessibility of online hiring platforms like ZipRecruiter have revolutionized the recruitment process. However, like any strategy, online hiring comes with its own set of challenges.By avoiding three common mistakes, entrepreneurs can streamline their hiring process and increase the likelihood of finding the right candidates.1. Not properly defining the position and qualifications. An effective job description is essential for finding a pool of relevant applicants. By clearly defining the position, including the responsibilities, qualifications, and compensation, you can attract candidates who are more likely to be a good fit for the role.



A well-defined job description also helps set clear expectations for both the employer and potential candidates, reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings during the hiring process. It allows hiring managers to efficiently screen and evaluate applicants based on the outlined qualifications, saving time and resources in the long run.2. Relying too much on automation.Entrepreneurs can often make the mistake of relying solely on automated screening processes when hiring online. While these tools can filter out unsuitable candidates based on specific criteria, they need more human touch to assess a candidate's true potential. Skills and qualifications are important, but soft skills and cultural fit matter, too.


To avoid this mistake, use online hiring platforms like ZipRecruiter. This popular job site strikes a balance between automation and personalization, providing robust screening tools while allowing direct interaction with candidates. This comprehensive evaluation process leads to better-informed hiring decisions.3. Not reviewing applications carefully.With so many resumes to review, scanning them and quickly moving on to the next one can be tempting. You must review each resume and application for specific qualifications that match the job description.ZipRecruiter, for example, can streamline resume reviews with its user-friendly tools and advanced filtering options. It helps employers efficiently evaluate resumes by leveraging its powerful AI matching algorithm to match employers with relevant candidates and encourages them to apply.Once you find the right fit, your business should provide the necessary tools and support for a new hire, such as setting up clear guidelines, good communication channels, and access to the right software. Avoiding online hiring mistakes and setting new hires up to succeed can help grow your staff into the team of A-players you've always dreamed about.

72,4 Telltale Signs Your Business Has Deep-Rooted Issues That Need Addressed,"Jul 17, 2023",Clate Mask,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-telltale-signs-that-your-business-needs-to-undergo-a/455141,"
Sometimes, business owners get lucky and can simultaneously please their customers, partners, employees, investors and board members. But other times? You might find this balancing act impossible. This often occurs when there's a can't-win situation at stake. For example, maybe you and your board agree your product needs a price increase while your customers and partners are rigidly against it.The reality is that, in any given scenario, you're going to struggle to make all stakeholders happy. But what if you're consistently coming up short for them? This is a clear sign of an underlying systemic issue that needs to be addressed. Here are a few of the most common culprits to help you determine if the discord you're experiencing is rooted in something more.Related: Work-Life Balance is Possible — And It's Not as Hard to Achieve as You Think



1. Unhappy employeesSome business leaders say that happy customers make happy shareholders. While this is true, it's missing something important. One of the best ways to get happy customers is to ensure your employees are happy. So, the better equation is this: happy employees make happy customers, who then make happy shareholders. It all starts with your team members.There's one important caveat here, though. Managers are not responsible for the satisfaction of their direct reports. Instead, they're responsible for creating the right environment where employees can thrive. This is what a winning culture is made of, and it's arguably the most crucial domino in the lineup that leads to shareholder satisfaction.


Along these lines, business owners can also explore ways to align employee and investor interests. For example, giving team members stock options helps them feel like they aren't separate from shareholders. Another way to achieve this is through profit sharing and bonus programs related to the bottom line. That one tends to make employees and investors both very happy.Related: Keep Everyone Happy by Making Your Office Extrovert-Friendly2. Inadequate communication and processesEven if you've solved the equation above, you risk alienating one stakeholder group while satiating another. Accept that you can't make all parties happy, and devise a plan for handling conflict. If you're butting heads with your board, for example, try working backward.Maybe the majority of your board is insistent that your team members should return to the office full-time, while you believe giving more flexible options might keep employees happier and more productive. Think back to how you and the board arrived at such opposing ends of the argument. Is it because they're concerned that employees will slack off at home and stop producing the work output they're expected to? If so, consider their feelings in earnest. Sometimes, thorough communication with no agendas or defensiveness can deflate tension and help two clashing groups devise a solution.


If you realize that the communication between you during this decision-making process has been lacking, further investigate that. Do you need better communication channels? More frequent opportunities to meet? Getting to the root of the breakdown might not help the immediate situation, but it could help prevent a future one.Related: 7 Leadership Communication Blunders That Could Make or Break Your Company3. Not hiring for your purpose, values and missionJust as your employee satisfaction is crucial to the success of your business, so is having people around you who believe in your purpose, values and mission. Everyone you hire should know what these are and have a personal, defined reason for buying into them.In my own company, our purpose is to liberate and empower entrepreneurs to strengthen families, communities and economies. During our hiring process, we ask candidates to think about this purpose and why it matters to them. Maybe they're all in on our purpose because their parents were entrepreneurs, and they admire them for it. Or maybe they're eager to get the economy back on solid ground and passionately believe that small business owners will get it there.


What you're doing has to matter to each employee, or you'll see a host of problems crop up once they're on board. Hiring to your purpose, values and mission will set you up for a strong culture and much more natural alignment between stakeholders.4. Failing to establish and execute your brand promiseWhat's your brand promise? If you're unsure, think about what success looks like for your customers. How do you help them achieve it? This has to be the driving force of your business. If it isn't your unequivocal North Star, it's very easy to get lost or confused about where you're heading. It's also easy to lose sight of your strategy and fail to execute it properly, leading to poor product market fit.No matter what happens in the boardroom or on your next investor call, you must maniacally focus on your brand promise. This is the best way to balance the satisfaction of all your stakeholders.Business owners and leaders are already stretched thin by all their responsibilities without having to keep everyone from employees to customers, investors and board members happy. But remember that the second part is your job, too. So while you can't always prevent conflict or frustration among your stakeholders, you can do a lot to create a driven, focused environment that breeds respect and success. It's a tall order, but if anyone can do it, entrepreneurs can.

73,Expose ChatGPT Resumes and Uncover Real Talent Using These 5 Effective Strategies,"Jul 14, 2023",Kash Hasworth,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/expose-chatgpt-resumes-and-uncover-real-talent-using-these/448146,"
The rise of artificial intelligence has undoubtedly revolutionized various aspects of our lives, and the recruitment process is no exception. With ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art AI language model, job seekers can now create impeccable resumes with minimal effort. It's like the fairy godmother of the job-seeking world, magically transforming resumes into Cinderella-like creations. While this may save time and energy for candidates, it creates a challenge for hiring managers and leaders who must cut through the noise to identify the true Cinderellas before the clock strikes midnight, and all you're left with are a bunch of artificial pumpkins. This article offers five effective ways for leaders to navigate AI-written resumes and uncover the real stars during interviews.1. Focus on behavioral questionsOne of the most effective methods to evaluate a candidate's real potential is by asking behavioral questions during the interview. These questions provide insight into a candidate's past experiences, decision-making strategies, and general thought processes, allowing you to gauge how they may perform in your organization. While AI-generated resumes may present a flawless image, asking questions that require candidates to share specific examples can help you see beyond the polished façade.Related: 5 Creative Interview Questions to Ask Job Applicants



2. Test candidates' skills with real-world scenariosA well-crafted resume may showcase a candidate's skills on paper, but it doesn't always translate to their real-world capabilities. Implementing practical assessments, such as role plays, case studies, or hands-on exercises, can effectively separate the wheat from the chaff. Evaluating how candidates perform in situations that mirror the challenges they would face in the role will help you distinguish the true performers from those who merely shine on paper.3. Get creative with problem-solving exercisesTo cut through the noise of AI-written resumes, challenge your candidates with unique problem-solving exercises. This approach goes beyond evaluating technical skills and focuses on assessing creativity, critical thinking and adaptability. By presenting candidates with unexpected scenarios, you can observe how they think on their feet and navigate complex situations, much like a jungle explorer navigating through a dense forest of AI-enhanced resumes to find the hidden treasure of authentic talent.

Ask for work samples and referencesRequesting work samples and references is a time-tested method to verify a candidate's genuine capabilities. While AI-generated resumes may present an impressive array of accomplishments, work samples offer tangible evidence of a candidate's past performance. References from previous employers or colleagues can also provide valuable insights into a candidate's work ethic, collaboration style, and potential fit within your organization.5. Pay attention to nonverbal cues and emotional intelligenceLastly, remember that interviews are not just about assessing a candidate's technical prowess; they also provide an opportunity to evaluate their emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills. Pay attention to nonverbal cues, such as body language, tone of voice, and eye contact, as they can offer clues about a candidate's sincerity, confidence, and overall fit for your team. By focusing on these aspects, you can uncover the real talent that may be hidden behind a polished, AI-crafted resume.Related: 7 Interview Questions That Determine Emotional Intelligence


AI-written resumes have certainly added an extra layer of complexity to the recruitment process. Without a proper process and an element of intuition, you could end up with a fancy recipe writer that doesn't possess the skills or capacity necessary to withstand or contribute to the heat of the kitchen. However, by incorporating these five strategies into your interviews, you can confidently cut through the noise and discover the true performers that will drive your organization forward. Happy talent hunting.

74,7 Lessons CEOs and Hiring Managers Learned from Exit Interviews,"Jul 12, 2023",Elisette Carlson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/7-lessons-to-learn-from-exit-interviews/454953,"
During the Great Resignation, companies of all sizes are struggling with employee turnover, which reached a record high in 2022. While employees leave a job for personal reasons or reasons unrelated to the job, many leave for factors specifically related to the job, that could have been resolved before their departure.In Gallup's State of the Global Workplace Report, surveyed employees were asked, ""If you could make one change at your current employer to make it a great place to work, what would it be?"" Overall, 85% of responses related to three categories: engagement or culture (41%), pay (28%) and well-being (15%). In Joblist's 2023 Q1 Market Report, 67% of those employed said they plan to quit their job in 2023 due to bad management or a toxic workplace.As a Partner at Boyden, a leading global executive search firm, my team and I speak to CHROs and hiring managers daily. We learn many employees (and, in many cases, strong candidates) leave their positions as their needs were simply not addressed. Alongside helping companies implement strategies for attracting and retaining top talent through our leadership consulting, we have gleaned critical insight from these last conversations with CEOs & HR.



While the specific learnings will vary depending on the company and circumstances, below are seven themes and lessons that hiring managers have ""gained"" from exit interviews:1. Prioritize accomplishments over working hoursParticularly since 2020, flexible working hours have undergone significant change and become more prevalent across industries. From remote to hybrid models, the varied working hours empower employees to maintain a healthier work-life integration as they juggle parenthood, personal responsibilities and their own health and wellness.


Many hiring managers focus on time spent in the office over results achieved. The lesson here is quality over quantity. Focus on the goals and the efficiency of the employee over working hours. Individuals can be productive under pressure and timelines and if they are able to deliver the results, reward them on this. Those employees will be happier, feel appreciated and continue to deliver the wins.Related: 14 Strategies For How To Retain Top Talent and Build Championship Teams2. Relationships and empathy can lead to better resultsStrong relationships build trust, and if employees feel trust amongst their teams and leaders, they are more likely to care about the quality of their work, their connection with their colleagues and stay in the positions that they are in. Directly correlated to trust is empathy. There's a difference between expressing empathy and actually having empathy. Employees want to be heard and understood, and they can tell the difference between a manager expressing the message the company wants to deliver and a manager expressing their care for an individual.


3. Transparency with communicationLeaders can share more information with their teams. While there are several aspects of management that particular employees do not need to be briefed on, it's important to ensure that employees feel informed, educated, included and not left in the dark. There is a balance, and CEOs should prioritize time for company meetings to ensure that their teams can know the latest happenings and be given an opportunity to ask questions. Regular feedback sessions and open-door policies will foster a positive work environment.Related: 7 Reasons Why Critical Decisions Require In Person Connection4. Provide opportunities for growthShatter the glass ceilings and offer training and development to your teams so they may continue to enhance their knowledge and skills in their areas of work. From entry-level to leadership, there are infinite opportunities to learn; if these are overlooked, employees can lose motivation if they feel stagnated or not encouraged.Chief People Officer at Stagwell, Stephanie Howley acknowledged this gap and implemented a career practice and experiences program called EPIC (Education and Practice in an Inclusive and Collaborative Environment), which provides a framework for employees to act like entrepreneurs of their careers, with access to learning and career experiences based on their interests across disciplines and geographies.


Howley explained, ""We believe this unique employee value proposition attracts and retains the best talent in the marketing services industry because we're not promoting corporate functionaries; we're growing entrepreneur-minded professionals.""5. Create a safe spaceWhile transparency, communication and workplace equality are must-haves, workplace equity helps transform organizations to be more inclusive and resilient, resulting in stronger opportunities for employees to thrive. Prioritize your DEI programs and ensure that the company has a welcoming and safe work environment.Be intentional with how you build your workplace culture. Many people leave their jobs because they feel discriminated against or bullied due to their age, ethnic background, gender or appearance. Establish a workplace for open discussion and where teams understand each other's strengths and weaknesses. Celebrate team wins and schedule opportunities for employee opinions to be heard and valued.Related: Psychological Safety in the Workplace is More Than Being Nice


6. Prioritize wellbeingIt's as simple as acknowledging the individual's needs regarding work-life balance, a challenge they have been going through or some support for wellness. If the company can offer support, such as a flexible PTO day, flexible working hours or health and wellness programs across fitness, nutrition, mindfulness and recreation, this can lead to happier and more productive employees.Airbnb has prioritized well-being for years, from their onsite fitness facilities to fertility assistance to their well-known ""open kitchen"" where lunch is prepared daily by a chef, a bell is rung, and employees gather together for a social lunchtime.7. Review and rethink the onboarding processPeople feel more confident and at ease when they understand their role, know how to do it and know who they can turn to for questions or support. Review your onboarding process and determine where it is outdated or has room for improvement. Imposter syndrome is common among people joining a new company or team.Whether it's a lack of initial onboard training, kick-off monitoring programs or detailed documents, new employees want to feel informed and included and have confidence in their new role from the beginning. It's not novel that employees want purpose over pizza and ping pong, so prioritize this from the start to establish a positive tone.


While exit interviews can offer valuable lessons and insights, you can get ahead of the actual ""exit"" by conducting ""stay interviews,"" which I believe to be more proactive and productive. The most important factors to conducting a successful stay interview are to listen, let the other person lead the interview and not use this as a time to reprimand, defend or make excuses. The purpose of this interview is to discover and learn. Keep these interviews simply by focusing on the three questions below:What do you love about working here, and what should we keep doing?What do you not like about working here, and what should we stop doing?What needs to change, and what should we start to do?Although exit interviews will most focus on areas for improvement, they will also highlight success stories and positive experiences. By actively listening to feedback and taking action based on insights gained, hiring managers and CEOs can create more positive and productive workplace environments to attract and retain talent in the future.

76,5 Reasons Why Your Brand Needs a Chief Growth Officer,"Jun 29, 2023",Jamie Calon,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-reasons-your-brand-needs-a-chief-growth-officer/454061,"
You may have noticed an increase in progressive brands employing new types of ""C"" suite executive positions, such as CNOs (Chief Networking Officers) and CSOs (Chief Strategy Officers). I want to discuss the CGO (Chief Growth Officer), why it's important to understand their duties and why structures are changing.So, what is a CGO? It is one of the most important new positions in a progressive organization. More than just a CMO, the CGO bridges traditional operational silos, acting as a catalyst for internal alignment between departments, allowing for cross-functional collaboration and eradicating barriers to growth. The role is rapidly growing in popularity, and it's only a matter of time before it becomes an essential position for businesses of all sizes.Hopefully, if you've arrived here, you've already read my article, ""5 Tactical Tips to Grow Your Brand."" The CGO is the person who brandishes the 'Marketing Whip', guiding the brand's consumer engagement wherever they are in the GTM (go-to-market) cycle. They blend their broad expertise in marketing, sales, finance and product development with relevant data to refine strategies across all functional groups. A CGO needs to analyze customer experience, demand and trends in order to maximize brand loyalty and retention. Finding innovative ways to glean insights, execute action from operational data and communicate the brand's vision at scale is imperative to their success.



Related: How to Grow Your Business by 500%I am a firm believer that having a single set of hyper-focused, educated eyes to track large endeavors from start to finish is vital. Founders like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos share the similarity of being adamantly involved in all aspects of their companies from the get-go. Founders who have a comprehensive understanding of their brand, functional groups and operations are able to greenlight actions and adjust projects on the fly in any department according to the brand's needs. This allows companies to become very nimble, very quickly.


A great example of this would be Amazon's 6-pager. Have you ever wondered how Amazon can possibly focus on so many businesses at once? It's because Jeff Bezos innovated a way to bring groups up to speed quickly, in great detail and at scale, allowing for instant critical decision-making from key players.Having someone in the CGO position melts away obstacles, consolidates company focus and ensures that the brand's product, campaigns and messaging do not become diluted by process or committees at any stage of the go-to-market (GTM) process. At the moment, the bulk of large brands have founders who have either passed away, moved on, or are not capable of spanning all the functional group disciplines. This is where modern brands opt for a CGO.This position is a natural, inevitable progression of the corporate structure, but why now? The short answer is: modern speed to market. The era of free, endlessly available digital content has created a monumental shift in how companies approach their GTM. Not only do they need to embrace the challenges of the ever-accelerating digital evolution, but they also need to change the way they launch their products and adapt to the lightning-fast pace of today's brick-and-mortar (B&M) market.Understanding and engaging with today's hyper-educated, segmented consumers is far more complex than it was 20 years ago, with more brands and more products in the market to compete with. Brands need to adjust the way they cultivate social impact in the never-ending fight to retain relevancy and market share. Traditional methods used to scale an organization are no longer sustainable, especially for large brands in the B&M, digital and B2C markets.


In today's era, organizations need a more agile and holistic approach to execute decisions quickly and effectively while meeting the changing needs of the consumer. By transcending siloed departments, the CGO aims to eliminate bottlenecks, optimize resources, consolidate agendas, streamline priorities, implement efficient processes, establish veilless operations and instill transparent communication. With departments aligned and strategies in motion, it allows the entire organization to embrace a laser-like focus on the end goal: strategic growth.To summarize, here are my top five reasons (amongst many) why modern brands need to adjust their business structure and hire a CGO:Related: Innovation? It Needs to Be Woven Into Every Aspect of Your Company's Culture1. Communication and barriersTo keep up with competitors and the ever-accelerating digital market, organizations need to align internal departments to allow for faster and more efficient cross-functional collaboration. In order to do this, they need someone to dissolve the long-standing structural silos, eradicate internal barriers and implement crystal-clear communication between teams (a CGO).


2. HyperfocusWith a bird's-eye view of operations, finance, sales and marketing, the CGO can streamline departmental pipelines and have teams working towards a single, hyper-focused shared goal.3. Speed to marketThe digital era is here, meaning processes are sharper and faster, with endless options. For old-fashioned brands, modern speed to market can feel like someone just hit the fast-forward button. Brick-and-mortar brands have no choice but to adapt to the modern, digital pace or risk dying out.4. Consumer engagementEngaging with today's consumer isn't as simple as it used to be. Brands need to analyze customer experience, demand and trends, driving cross-functional engagement strategies accordingly. A CGO can make this happen.5. Brand stewardshipThe appearance and messaging of your brand and products are exceptionally important, but it's incredibly easy for design and messaging to get watered-down as they filter through processes, multiple departments and staff members. Brands these days need stewardship, ensuring continuity and on-point branding throughout the entire GTM process.


Look out! Marketing is set to become a much broader discipline that influences every aspect of a business, including sales, operations, IT, finance, business development and customer support. CGOs are here to facilitate this and determine new pathways for evolution.Related: Adapt Your C-Suite for the Digital Era In 3 Steps

77,How to Turn an Upset Customer Into Your Company's Best Advocate,"Jun 28, 2023",Micah Solomon,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-deal-with-an-upset-or-angry-customer/453874,"
Here's the bad news: an angry customer is breathing down your neck or tearing you up over the phone, shooting daggers at you via e-mail. Worst case, they're threatening you with the words every business owner dreads, ""I'll never use you again, and I'm telling everyone I know not to use you as well.""So, is there any good news as well about this scenario? Surprisingly, there is! The heavily tested psychological principle called the ""service recovery paradox"" has demonstrated that a customer who is initially unhappy, whom you later make things right for, is more likely to become a lifetime loyalist and advocate before your company.That's right: one of those desirable customers who not only do business with you but are interested in telling all their friends about you in a good way!



Why would this be? Well, now the customer knows that you're more than a fair-weather friend, and they can count on you even when things have gone sideways. The two of you have now gone through a shared, challenging experience together: you've got your hearts pumping simultaneously, and you're both feeling the relief of getting to the other side.Related: Why Customer Service Is Your Get Out Of Jail Free Card For Business Success


How do you successfully satisfy an unhappy customer?Now that you know the potential upside of turning around a customer, here are the four elements involved in service recovery success.Start selecting future employees based on personality strengths that make them well-suited to this work (to the extent this is possible, considering your organizational constraints).Regardless of the psychological makeup of your existing employees, begin to offer customer service training in ""situational empathy,"" the ability to put oneself in another person's (in this case, a customer's) shoes.Adopt and embrace a service recovery framework. Decide on, train on and rehearse a specific service recovery framework. Which particular framework you choose (a few are circulating out there, some of them company specific) isn't as important as your commitment to adopt it companywide, train on it and rehearse it before the next upset customer comes into view with all the negative energy that that situation can engender.If you don't already have a service recovery framework, let me offer you mine.The service recovery framework I recommend to my clients is called ""the MAMA method,"" and it's my own, although it owes a lot to the pioneering work of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company in service recovery.Related: Stellar Customer Service Starts with the Hiring Process


The MAMA Method of service recoveryMake time to listen.Acknowledge and, if appropriate, apologize.(have a) Meeting of Minds.Act! And follow up.Here it is in more detail:M: Make time to listenImmediately stop whatever you're doing.Don't interrupt the customer with questions or explanations.Only then, strive to learn more about the situation by probing for what the customer is specifically upset about.A: Acknowledge and, if appropriate, apologize. Acknowledge the situation and, if you sense the customer feels it is called for, apologize sincerely. (Note: Every customer is different! Not all customers want an apology, and some are made uncomfortable by one. This is something you'll learn to sense as you practice.)M: (have a) Meeting of minds. This is the step where you strive to marry what the customer wants and what you realistically can accomplish for them, considering your organizational constraints and realities.


A: Act! And follow up. Get busy taking care of the issue as promised in the prior ""Meeting of Minds"" stage. If you end up delegating any part of the service resolution, follow up with those you've handed it off to ensure it was handled appropriately and completely. For organizational growth, also document what went wrong so that patterns of failure and their causes can be addressed systemically later.An important alert and disclaimer: This service recovery sequence and approach are not intended to guide you if you're confronted by an individual who is armed or threatening violence. Handling that situation is a different discipline, typically called ""de-escalation training""; it is not what I'm covering here and is not within my professional expertise.Why have I chosen ""MAMA"" as a name and mnemonic? The overarching idea of the MAMA method is that you should treat unhappy customers as a caring mother — or father! — would treat a child with a trivial injury rather than how a ""just the facts, ma'am"" litigator might.A caring parent would acknowledge the child's feelings rather than try to minimize them; this, as parents know, is the fastest route to getting their kid to dry their tears and go back out to play. If, in contrast, they dismiss the child's feelings, the crying will escalate, as the child needs to prove to the parent that they're injured.


With customers, you're not here to prove that they haven't been injured or are wrong. Rather, you're here to comfort and listen to them tell their story without interruption. Being sure that you do that, you will hear your customer open up and tell you what they are looking for as a resolution, thus giving you a chance to modify that in light of what can be realistically accomplished considering your organizational resources and realities.

78,"Hiring Managers Are Looking for ChatGPT Experience — And Some Are Willing to Pay Up to $800,000 For It","Jun 26, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/chatgpt-experience-can-mean-a-much-higher-salary-report/454811,"
ChatGPT, the AI prompt-driven chatbot created by OpenAI last year, instantly garnered worldwide attention. The chatbot's ability to generate immediate content can help workers with anything from writing rental listings to computer code.The tool has also garnered criticism, especially with concerns over privacy, ethics (notably in law), and how AI could replace human jobs. When it comes to the latter, the answer is complicated. In May, the World Economic Forum estimated that nearly 14 million jobs — or 2% of current employment — could disappear by 2027 due to increased adoption of AI technology.Later that same month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Congress that AI will replace jobs but can also create ""much better"" ones.Related: IBM Says 7,800 Jobs (or Nearly 30% of Its Workforce) Could Be Replaced By AIAccording to a recent report by ResumeBuilder, which surveyed 1,187 business leaders in the U.S., 92% are currently hiring — 91% of which are looking for workers with ChatGPT experience.



They're also willing to pay.Per the report, one in four survey respondents said the starting salary for AI ""prompt engineers"" will exceed $200,000, and 17% said it will exceed $300,000.""With this expertise not yet widely available in the hiring market, those candidates with ChatGPT and AI skills will be highly sought after from progressive companies,"" said Chief Career Advisor at ResumeBuilder, Stacie Haller, in the report. ""As this tech is still so new, there is a race to bring on employees with this skill in order for the company to stay cutting edge, and it looks like companies are willing to pay to do so.""And the race to recruit workers with AI skills has also prompted urgency: 30% of business leaders looking for ChatGPT skills said they are hiring ""urgently"" for the positions, 11% of which said it is ""very urgent.""


What Does Working with ChatGPT Mean, Exactly?A roundup by Business Insider found that the positions calling for ChatGPT skills range from titles like ""machine learning engineer"" and ""AI data operations specialist"" to more conventional roles like product managers and copywriters, except the posting mentions skills with the AI chatbot gives candidates a ""competitive edge.""Many of the job postings examined paid six figures, including two for the remote job search engine, Crossover, which listed positions (now closed) for a senior director of product management and chief product officer — both of which mentioned ChatGPT experience in the listing. Each starting salary is $800,000.

79,Want Excellence? Embrace Strong Personalities,"Jun 22, 2023",Jon B. Becker,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-good-leaders-embrace-strong-personalities/454063,"
Years ago, I had a strong disagreement with a staff member. He was a long-time employee who sat several steps below me in the org chart. He was prone to strong opinions and passionate feelings, but he was also an extremely high performer in the organization and someone I was personally very fond of.While he was usually correct in his opinions, he sometimes lacked a strategic view of the issues and did not always accept when he was wrong. This ""spirited discussion"" resulted from one of those ""nonacceptances"" which happened in a public place and was overheard by many other staff members. The conversation was confrontational, and it clearly made some of those around us a little uncomfortable.Afterward, several staff members approached me and wondered if this moment of public insubordination meant I would fire him. When I told them that there would be no disciplinary action but that he and I would discuss it later to find common ground, they looked confused. Why would I, as the CEO, let a staff member argue with me and not immediately fire them? The answer is simple: It is easier to temper passion than to inspire it. If you want excellence, you need people with strong personalities!



Related: 6 Steps for Hiring the Right People to Build Effective TeamsOrganizations are just a grouping of people and things. Organizational success is the collective sum of individual successes. As a leader, it is our job to harness 100% of every team member's possible talent. We must focus on building each team member individually into the best they can be, which requires that they feel safe to express their views, are comfortable speaking truth to power, and are supported to exceed the limits of their skills from time to time. This does not happen when we stifle people's opinions or break their spirits by forcing compliance. Instead, it comes from individual responsibility, commitment to the shared mission and taking risks.


Simply put, in a business context, passion is an essential ingredient for greatness. It may be the essential ingredient. Yet, passion is almost impossible to inspire; it needs to rise organically from deep inside people who are committed to their mission. Passionate people often obsess over little details; they are constantly looking for a better way; they are frequently frustrated by others and are usually a pain in their leaders' butts. They are also the star performers of the business and the centers of creation and excellence for the organization.Unfortunately, many leaders see these traits as signs of a difficult personality and become frustrated. They find these people difficult to control, argumentative and sometimes even disrespectful or insubordinate. Sadly, in many business environments, these people are marginalized, disciplined or even fired. Passion is quashed in favor of obedience. Leadership encourages conformity through words and deeds with an eye on producing an obedient, homogeneous ""team"" where everyone plays nice and does what they are told. This is a bit like throwing away all the sharp knives in your kitchen to avoid hurting yourself or others. While you will be safer, you will also end up with a drawer full of spoons!Exceptional people are creative, inventive and bright. They are different from the norm. They are extraordinary. Often, they are exceptional because of their passion for what they do and their willingness to challenge authority. As a result, they usually stick out in a sea of mediocrity and are sometimes unwilling to follow the herd. This obviously can make them a bit of a handful. It is important to realize, however, that this reluctance to do what everyone else does makes them great. They have no allegiance to tradition or authority for their own sake. They will make you and your team better!Related: How To Keep Employees Feeling Passionate About Their Work


This does not mean it is okay to be rude, insubordinate or destructive to the organization's morale. On the contrary, a good work environment and discipline matter greatly. It is great to argue your points and to challenge the thinking of others. But, that said, it is not okay to be mean, rude or disrespectful in the process.This is a very fine line to walk and can be challenging to interpret. As a result, leaders must give their team the benefit of the doubt and adopt a ""teach, don't beat"" mindset. We need to encourage our passionate people. But, at the same time, we need to help them express their ideas and make their challenges in a way that will provoke thought, not anger.Exceptional organizations are the result of extraordinary people. It is essential as leaders, we spend time nurturing the passion people have for their work. We must encourage them to think outside the box, not to become discouraged by failure, and encourage them to take risks.We need to pick them up and dust them off when they fall. Most of all, we need to understand that the fire that drives them will sometimes make them a challenge to lead, and they will occasionally cross the line and need to be corrected. But we need to make sure that we don't break their spirit. Their strong personality will make them, and the organization, excellent!

81,Underdog Startups Threaten Hiring Dominance of Big Tech After Adopting This Irresistible Work Policy,"Jun 20, 2023",Gleb Tsipursky,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/underdog-startups-threaten-hiring-dominance-of-big-tech/454277,"
Tech companies under 500 employees — and thus the most innovative and forward-looking — are leading the charge when it comes to flexible work. According to the recent Flex Index report, a whopping 88% of small tech companies offer employees full flexibility in where they work. At the same time, 65% of giant tech companies with over 25,000 employees have transitioned to a ""structured hybrid"" model with specific in-office work requirements. There is a growing divide between big tech and small tech when it comes to flexible work options, and it doesn't bode well for the future of large tech firms.Related: How Flexible Work Will Give Your Business the Biggest AdvantageA flexibility divideWhile behemoths like Apple, Google, and Meta are walking back remote work in favor of two to three days per week in the office, smaller tech startups are embracing virtual-first policies that give employees full control over where they work. This poses a threat to the dominance of big tech companies, which have traditionally had the upper hand in attracting top talent due to their vast resources and brand power.



For many ambitious tech workers seeking autonomy and work-life balance, small startups with flexible policies may prove irresistible. The future is unclear, but for now, the flexibility divide between big tech and small tech is poised to reshape how Silicon Valley attracts and retains top talent. This trend will likely only accelerate as remote-first generations join the workforce, demanding flexibility as a top priority in their job search.While legacy tech giants rose to prominence with an office-centric mentality, the new wave of innovation may depend on startups fully embracing virtual work. Remote employees tend to have higher job satisfaction and lower burnout rates, allowing startups to tap into a more diverse global talent pool. Yet scaling flexibility is easier said than done, and big tech's structured return to office risks diminishing some of the benefits of remote work for innovation and inclusion.


Big tech's shift to structured hybrid models with two to three assigned in-office days reflects a philosophy that in-person interaction fosters collaboration, apprenticeships and team cohesion. However, this stance fails to recognize the value of virtual communication and its role in boosting autonomy, diversity and work-life balance for many employees. By limiting employee choice in work location, big tech also risks losing top talent to startups with more flexible policies.While facetime may benefit some teams and tasks, compelling employees to commute and collaborate in person risks reduced productivity and job satisfaction for many knowledge workers. As tools like video conferencing, virtual whiteboards, and team messaging grow more advanced, the need for physical offices to foster collaboration and innovation is diminishing. The office may have a role to play, but not at the cost of flexibility and choice.Rather than require blanket return-to-office policies, forward-thinking companies should evaluate collaboration needs on a team-by-team basis and implement flex programs with employee input. They must recognize that a one-size-fits-all solution will not work, and that flexibility and cohesion can absolutely co-exist with the right investments in virtual collaboration infrastructure and management training.The future of work depends on companies scaling flexibility and investing in the technology and culture to support virtual teams. While the flexibility divide currently favors small tech, any company able to overcome the challenges of managing remote work at scale may gain a competitive advantage.


For now, small tech startups embracing virtual-first flexibility have an opportunity to attract top talent and pioneer new models of innovation suited to a remote world. But big tech would be wrong to dismiss flexibility as a ""startup phase"" alone. With a supportive culture and the right collaboration solutions in place, companies of any size can scale flexibility and tap into benefits like reduced costs, access to global talent, and higher employee productivity and wellbeing.The possibility is there for forward-thinking companies in any industry to make flexibility a competitive advantage — if they are willing to invest in the management and technology to do so. While the future remains uncertain, one outcome is clear: Choice and autonomy matter deeply to knowledge workers, and companies able to provide flexibility at scale will be best positioned to succeed in the post-pandemic world.The future of flexible techThe critical question is whether small tech startups can scale flexibility. Currently, 67% of tech companies with under 100 employees are fully remote, compared to 26% of tech companies with 250 to 500, and just 8% of tech companies with over 500 employees.While flexibility may be easier to implement at a small startup, will these companies harden their stance on work locations as they mature? I've helped tech companies ranging from late-stage startups with 50 to 100 employees to behemoths with over 30,000 staff figure out their flexible work models, and I have to say that the larger they get, the more challenges they face with making remote work truly effective. That's because the challenges of managing remote teams and collaborating across distances may increase with company size. Larger companies typically have more complex organizational structures, multiple offices and a wider range of roles with diverse collaboration needs. They may also face greater scrutiny and bureaucracy, making quick shifts to virtual work more difficult.


However, for companies able to surmount these challenges, the rewards of flexibility could be significant. With strong communication tools, management training and an outcomes-based mindset, flexibility may continue to enhance innovation and attract top talent even after startups scale. The companies able to achieve this stand to gain substantial cost savings, access to global talent and higher productivity and employee wellbeing.Ambitious yet employee-centric tech startups would be wise to implement flexible programs thoughtfully and brace for challenges, but not assume that scaling means limiting choice. By proactively addressing common obstacles around collaboration and oversight, tech leaders can create flexible programs ready to scale. With investments in infrastructure, policy, and culture, the result could be a win-win for both startup and employee.The companies that thrive will be those recognizing flexibility not as a temporary phenomenon but rather as a permanent shift in how and where knowledge work happens. They will implement remote collaboration and management solutions with scale in mind, provide guidelines and training for productive virtual work, and evaluate employee performance based on outcomes and impact rather than hours logged or roles. They will treat flexibility as vital for innovation, not as an employee perk alone.The future of work is still being written. But if small tech companies can figure out how to scale flexibility, they may gain a key competitive advantage over big tech. The opportunity is there for forward-thinking startups to pioneer new models of remote collaboration as they grow – without compromising on autonomy, work-life balance or productivity. For now, the flexibility divide favors small tech – but the future could belong to those companies that find ways to push the boundaries of virtual work regardless of their size.


While legacy tech companies struggle with providing flexibility at scale, a new generation of startups has a chance to make remote work a competitive advantage if they invest in solutions and culture to overcome common challenges, like:Communication silos: With poor communication infrastructure and policies in place, remote teams can become disconnected and isolated. Startups must implement collaboration tools, encourage informal interactions and provide guidance on best practices for productive virtual collaboration.Management challenges: Managing remote employees requires a high degree of trust, as well as training for managers unused to overseeing virtual teams. Startups must evaluate management practices, provide resources for leading remote teams and hire managers able to motivate and engage employees from a distance.Lack of cohesion: Some express concern that remote work reduces opportunities for relationship-building and mentoring. Startups can address this by organizing virtual social events, setting up mentorship programs, and leveraging technology that enables more personal connections between coworkers.Security and compliance risks: With remote work, ensuring data protection, privacy and policy compliance may require additional effort. Startups need to apply best practices for remote cybersecurity, provide employee education around safe virtual work environments, and implement monitoring systems enabling visibility into how sensitive resources and data are accessed.Related:ConclusionThe future of innovation depends on pioneers — and in a post-pandemic world, the pioneers of virtual work may be tech startups that scale flexibility. With the right investments and culture in place, small tech companies have an opportunity to make flexible work a competitive advantage and tap benefits beyond cost savings alone.

82,Why Software Developers Are Flocking to Smaller Businesses Over Big Tech,"Jun 20, 2023",Yancey Spruill,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/why-software-developers-are-choosing-small-businesses-over/453324,"
Over the past few years, there has been a growing recognition of the vital role that small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and startups play in driving both innovation and economic growth. In the midst of the pandemic downturn, many new businesses were started, and the majority of them are online or digital in nature. So, as more and more businesses shifted to or started their operations online, the demand for skilled developers has only increased, making software developers ever more critical to the success of SMBs and startups around the world.Despite the shortage of talent in the industry, there has been a growing trend toward software developers joining SMBs and startups rather than the big tech logos that have traditionally been the most coveted. According to recent reports, the global demand for developers is outstripping supply, with the technology sector being particularly hard-hit. More and more companies are looking to build out their digital infrastructure and stay competitive in an increasingly online world, resulting in fierce competition among companies to attract top talent.Related: Being a Small Business Can Be a Big Recruiting Advantage



Ditching the logosWhile logo recognition may appeal to some, more and more software developers are choosing to join SMBs and startups over behemoths. One of the main drivers is the chance for developers to work on a wider range of projects and with a wider range of technologies, providing a more diverse and engaging experience than the narrow focus they may be tasked with at big tech companies. As small businesses increasingly invest in their digital infrastructure and operations, they have created a wealth of opportunities for developers looking to work with cutting-edge technologies and be a part of an exciting world of innovation and emerging applications and solutions.Smaller businesses and startups also tend to offer greater flexibility and work-life balance, with many companies embracing remote work and flexible schedules to draw and retain talent. This flexibility can be a significant factor in attracting developers who prioritize a healthy work-life balance and greater autonomy in their work. Last year, DigitalOcean research showed that finding remote work was a top consideration for leaving existing jobs or taking new ones among developers.


Another key factor driving the trend towards SMBs is the chance for individual developers to have a greater impact on the business. In a smaller, leaner organization, developers often have a more direct line of communication with key stakeholders, allowing them to understand the business context of their work and make a tangible impact on the success and future of the business.Related: Recruiting on a Budget? Here Are 7 Ways You Can Beat the Big Companies to Top TalentThe future needs of and for developersLooking to the future, the demand for software developers in SMBs and startups is expected to increase. In DigitalOcean's latest Currents report, which analyzes trends among digital small businesses, 51% of businesses who say they plan on hiring in the next year say they will be hiring for software development roles.To stay competitive in attracting and retaining top talent, SMBs must take proactive steps. This includes offering competitive salaries and comprehensive benefits packages to attract skilled developers. Additionally, embracing flexible work arrangements and fostering an engaging and rewarding work environment can make a significant difference.


But it's not just perks and benefits that SMBs should be paying attention to. Developers want to be on the cutting edge of technology as well. Therefore, smaller digital businesses should also pay close attention to broader changes on the horizon that are likely going to impact them in the future.For example, the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning is set to revolutionize many industries, creating new opportunities for innovative businesses and developers alike. Small businesses should be aware of these opportunities, as well as potential threats they may cause, so as not to be caught off guard in the future.And on top of future tech, SMBs should be paying attention to their everyday infrastructure. Developers particularly crave simplicity, documentation and ease — that's why SMBs should pay close attention to their cloud and tech providers early on in the process to ensure an easy, scalable process in the future.In this rapidly changing and difficult economic landscape, it is clear that software developers will continue to play a critical role in the success of digital SMBs and startups. But by embracing new technologies and creating engaging and rewarding work environments, SMBs can and are already competitively positioning themselves to draw the talent they need to scale and grow.

83,Why Meeting Culture is Draining your Employee's Strength and Productivity,"Jun 20, 2023",Gergo Vari,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-meeting-culture-is-sapping-your-employees-strength/453485,"
Many of us treat our work calendars like a game of Tetris, cleanly lining up one meeting block upon the next with no space in between. Every minute counts, right? And ""busy"" tends to feel oh-so-productive.But while it's hard enough to break out of habits that feel how we think they should, it's even harder to break free from a company culture that has bought into the meeting vortex fallacy. Here's a look at why allowing your company culture to give your teams' brains time to digest after each meeting is crucial.Why back-to-back meetings are the straw that will break the camel's backWhen you couple the fast-paced world of startups — or the face-saving world of corporate environments — with the one-click convenience of calendar booking apps, our day-to-day can quickly end up packed without employees having a say. That leaves them gasping for air. What's more, when a growing share of meetings are happening online, time itself takes on a virtual quality as it becomes synonymous with the tools we use to manage it – and we wind up with ""virtually"" no time to do our actual job.



Without offering any resistance to these forces, it almost seems inevitable for companies to experience meeting bloat — often with the best intentions. Unfortunately, these same intentions are detrimental to productivity. It's time to challenge the status quo and offer our brains the breathing room they need.Much like a short period of rest between sets is built into every workout to optimize performance, transitioning from one meeting to the next requires a few minutes of recovery. Leaving out much-needed breaks takes a toll on our well-being. Just like our bodies, our brains need time to process and recharge. When we rush from one meeting to another, our stress levels compound, affecting our mental and physical health.


Related: Got Too Many Meetings? Here's How to Cut BackYou won't necessarily notice at the moment. On the contrary, grabbing a third cup of coffee and riding the stress wave to meeting number four may provide that rush that makes us feel like we're getting things done. Instead, this continuous attention shifting and the non-stop demand of high alertness strain our brain's capacity to adapt and perform optimally.The reason? Stress. Stress triggers the release of cortisol, the infamous stress hormone. Increased cortisol levels impede our ability to think clearly and compromise our immune system, making us more susceptible to illness. The overstimulation caused by unrelenting work schedules pushes us into a danger zone where problem-solving abilities are weakened, fatigue sets in and burnout becomes a haunting reality.Related: Telework Burnout and Zoom Fatigue: Much More Complicated Than They Appear


When meeting cultures are on auto-pilotIt's not just about high alertness and permanent hustle and bustle. The content of the meetings themselves matters too. Unproductive meetings are a significant source of stress, often leaving employees feeling drained and overwhelmed. These meetings, lacking agendas, moderators or clear goals, resemble aimless voyages through murky waters. The lack of structure and purpose eats away energy levels and harms productivity.Without a clear agenda, meetings begin to meander, with participants becoming more interested in their phones than their colleagues. The result is wasted time, missed opportunities for clarity and direction and a downward spiral of employee morale. Unsurprisingly, employees tend to leave such meetings feeling frustrated and unfulfilled. What, then, is the cure for presentations that are overstuffed with text and too long? It's simple: bite-size segments that show an overview of progress are infinitely more engaging.Furthermore, meetings quickly descend into chaos when there's no designated moderator or facilitator. Multiple team members with differing opinions and agendas pull a meeting in a dozen directions. Equally, numerous minutes of silence just waiting for the meeting to pass can turn meetings into a watched pot — and we all know that those never boil. A skilled moderator can steer discussions, keep participants on track and ensure everyone's perspectives are heard.The absence of clear goals in meetings creates ambiguity and confusion. Participants are left wondering why they were invited and what they are expected to contribute. This lack of purpose drains motivation and dampens creativity, leaving attendees feeling like they're going through the motions rather than making meaningful progress. It also makes them feel like they have to make up for lost time. And this, in turn, contributes to squeezing more meetings back into what is left on the calendar. It's a vicious cycle.


Related: Too Many Meetings Suffocate Productivity and MoraleLeaders need to leave their company's comfort zoneIf your work environment resembles a never-ending meeting marathon, and if too many of those meetings sound like people are just thinking out loud, it's time to evaluate these signs of an unproductive and overbooked workplace. The false notion that being busy means being productive is deeply flawed. It's time to shift our perspective and understand that productivity stems from efficiency, motivation, and a well-rested mind.Leaders play a crucial role in reshaping meeting culture within their organizations. By prioritizing their own well-being and assessing the impact of unrelenting schedules, they can set a new standard for healthier work environments. Leaders must have the courage to lead creatively, beyond the ""busy"" playbook — and not by showcasing their brutal schedules.Finally, leaders need to demonstrate the importance of boundaries and respecting everybody's time, prioritizing time for focused and deep work. Every meeting is a potential distraction, after all. Leading by example should mean empowering teams to schedule breaks between meetings — and to allow employees to politely decline meetings where they are not essential. By fostering a culture that values quality over quantity, leaders can create an environment where interests are put before positions and intention is valued over complicity.

It's too easy to get sucked into the prevalent meeting culture of back-to-back schedules and arid agendas. It may feel busy. And it may feel safe to avoid trying something new. But it will never amount to treating time with the respect it deserves — which is the real key to getting things done!Indeed, when you're stuck in a work environment where ""productive"" looks a little too much like ""busy"" and where ""booked out"" is considered ""efficient,"" it's time to make a change. Set your default meeting time to 25 minutes, leaving a 5-minute buffer between calls. Block times in your calendar. Say no to unnecessary invites. Ask for agendas upfront. Save meetings for the less energized afternoons. There is a long list of things you can do without much effort to help shield against the inertia of the downward meeting spiral.However, to instill a productive and healthy meeting culture across the organization, leaders must take responsibility for evaluating and prioritizing the well-being of their employees. By challenging the status quo and taking steps to improve meetings, such as setting clear agendas, appointing moderators, and defining goals and time constraints, they can foster a healthier and more efficient work environment.

85,Why Embracing Human Design Will Transform Your Workplace for Success,"Jun 16, 2023",Kaloyan Gospodinov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-embracing-human-design-will-transform-your-employees/452855,"
In today's fast-paced and ever-evolving world, the traditional approaches to work and management are being reevaluated. Employers are recognizing the need to foster a work environment that values individual strengths, enhances collaboration and supports the overall well-being of their employees. This is where the human design methodology comes into play.Human design offers a fresh perspective on how we understand ourselves and others, providing insights that can revolutionize the workplace and unlock the true potential of teams. In this article, we explore how human design can bring about positive change in the workplace, leading to increased productivity, employee satisfaction and overall success.Human design is a holistic system that combines astrology, the I Ching, the Kabbalah, the Hindu-Brahmin chakra system and quantum physics to provide a comprehensive understanding of human nature. It offers a unique blueprint of an individual's energy type, strategy, authority and profile. By understanding these aspects, individuals can gain valuable insights into their strengths, decision-making processes and communication styles.



Related: Human Design Is Your Key To Better MarketingEnhanced self-awarenessHuman Design acts as a tool for introspection. When individuals understand their energy types (Manifestor, Generator, Manifesting Generator, Projector or Reflector), they can better navigate their professional and personal lives using their inherent strengths and strategies. For instance, Generators may find they work best when they can respond to situations, while Manifestors may excel at initiating projects.


This self-awareness helps to reduce work-related stress and enhance job satisfaction by aligning career paths with personal energies. Additionally, by identifying potential areas of weakness, individuals can foster a growth mindset and cultivate supportive relationships to balance these areas, thus contributing to a more collaborative and understanding work environment.Related: The Do's and Don'ts of Using Your Human Design Type in Your MarketingEffective team dynamicsIn a diverse team, leveraging the unique attributes of each member can create a harmonious and efficient work environment. When leaders understand the human design profiles of their team members, they can assign roles that cater to each person's strengths and decision-making style.For instance, a Manifesting Generator might excel in a multitasking role, while a Projector might offer valuable insights for guiding the team's direction. This can improve morale, reduce conflicts and maximize team performance. Recognition of each member's unique contribution fosters a culture of appreciation and respect where everyone feels valued and acknowledged.


Optimal decision makingEach of us has an inherent way of making decisions, a 'Strategy and Authority' in Human Design terms, whether it's an instinctual response (gut feeling), emotional clarity over time or an inner knowing. By recognizing these decision-making styles, organizations can encourage employees to trust their unique processes, leading to more authentic and confident choices. This approach not only enhances the quality of decisions but also reduces conflicts, as individuals understand and respect the different decision-making processes of their colleagues.Related: Human Design for Business: 3 Instant Ways To Magnetize Your Brand VoiceWork-life balance and well-beingThe Human Design system underscores the importance of rest, rejuvenation and a balanced lifestyle. By understanding their energy dynamics, employees can navigate their workloads effectively, preventing burnout and enhancing productivity. For instance, some people might need more downtime than others, or some might work best in short, intense bursts. Employers who understand this can adapt their policies to cater to these needs, offering flexible schedules, regular breaks or a supportive environment for relaxation and recharge — such a holistic approach results in happier, more engaged employees, which inevitably boosts organizational success.Personal growth and developmentHuman Design offers valuable insights into unique challenges and growth opportunities, fostering a culture of continuous learning and development. This can help employees identify areas for improvement and hone their skills accordingly or even reveal hidden talents or potential. For instance, if an employee discovers through their Human Design that they have a strong capacity for understanding complex systems, they might pursue further education or training in this area. In such a growth-oriented environment, employers can support their employees through mentorship programs, skill development opportunities and spaces for self-reflection, fostering a sense of purpose and fulfillment at work.


Inclusion and diversityHuman Design also lays the foundation for an inclusive and diverse workplace besides optimizing individual performance. By acknowledging the variety of energy types, decision-making processes and communication styles organizations can foster an atmosphere of acceptance for diverse backgrounds and perspectives.This inclusivity translates into enriched creativity, innovation and problem-solving, as employees feel encouraged to bring their authentic selves to work. Moreover, in an era where companies are held accountable for their cultural values, incorporating Human Design principles showcases an organization's commitment to diversity and inclusion, bolstering its reputation among stakeholders and potential talent.Related: Diversity and Inclusion are Driving Force of Future of BusinessesIn conclusion, implementing Human Design in the workplace is a holistic approach that benefits the individual and contributes significantly to the organization's collective success. Human Design catalyzes an empowered and harmonious workplace, from fostering enhanced self-awareness to creating dynamic teams, ensuring optimal decision-making, promoting work-life balance, supporting personal growth and embracing diversity and inclusion. The interplay of these elements can lead to higher productivity, improved morale and a culture where individual and organizational goals can thrive. As the modern work landscape continues to evolve, organizations must explore innovative methodologies like Human Design to harness the full potential of their human resources. By aligning personal energies with professional endeavors, organizations can create a sustainable and fulfilling environment where everyone can flourish.

88,Do Your Employees Feel Recognized? 10 Powerful Ways To Set Up Employee Recognition Programs,"Jun 8, 2023",Murali Nethi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/10-powerful-ways-to-recognize-your-employees/452582,"
If you're a manager or HR professional, you know that keeping employees engaged and motivated is extremely important to the success of your organization. One powerful way to do this is through employee recognition programs. Strategic employee recognition programs can help create a positive work environment and promote a culture of appreciation and excellence.Simply put, employee recognition programs reward and acknowledge employees for their contributions and achievements. This can take many forms, from traditional bonuses and raises to non-monetary rewards like extra time off or public recognition. The key is tailoring the recognition to the individual and their accomplishments.So, how can you create an employee recognition program that is both strategic and effective? Here are some tips to consider:



1. Set clear and measurable goalsOne of the keys to a successful employee recognition program is setting clear and measurable goals. What do you hope to achieve with your program? Are you looking to increase employee engagement? Improve performance? Reduce turnover? Whatever your goals, it's essential to define them upfront and track your progress along the way.2. Align recognition with company culture and valuesEffective employee recognition programs are aligned with company culture and values. In other words, the recognition should reflect the behaviors and achievements that are most important to your organization. This will help reinforce your company's values and build a strong culture of appreciation and recognition.


3. Ensure fairness and transparency in the programFairness and transparency are essential components of any successful employee recognition program. Employees need to know that the program is objective and everyone has an equal opportunity to be recognized. Transparency also helps build trust and credibility with employees, which is critical for long-term success.Related: How to Recognize Burnout in Your Employees4. Provide timely and specific feedbackTimely and specific feedback is another important best practice for employee recognition programs. Employees must know what they're being recognized for and why it matters. Providing feedback promptly also helps reinforce positive behaviors and encourages employees to continue performing at a high level.5. Offer a variety of recognition optionsOffering various recognition options can help ensure that everyone feels valued and appreciated. Some employees prefer public recognition, while others prefer a more private approach. By offering different options, you can accommodate different preferences and help ensure everyone feels included.


Related: The 4 Pillars of Employee Appreciation6. Encourage peer-to-peer recognitionPeer-to-peer recognition is a meaningful way to build a culture of appreciation and recognition. Encourage employees to recognize and appreciate each other's contributions through a peer-to-peer recognition program. This can take various forms, such as a shout-out board, a virtual recognition platform or even a weekly newsletter. This can help foster a sense of teamwork and collaboration while also boosting morale and engagement.Related: 10 Simple Ways to Build a Collaborative, Successful Work Environment7. Use technology to streamline and enhance the programTechnology can be a powerful tool for streamlining and enhancing employee recognition programs. Online platforms and mobile apps can make recognizing and rewarding employees easier, tracking progress, and analyzing data. They can also make the program more accessible and engaging for employees.


8. Tailor rewards to individual needs and interestsInstead of offering generic rewards or gift cards, consider tailoring rewards to each employee's preferences and goals. For example, you could offer a book on a topic they're interested in, a fitness class pass, or a donation to their favorite charity. This shows that you value their individuality and care about their well-being beyond work.Related: 4 Ways Employee Incentives Can Drive Engagement and Retention9. Recognize unique talents and skills to motivate and develop employeesInstead of focusing solely on performance metrics, recognize employees' skills and talents that contribute to the team's success. For example, you could offer a ""problem-solving champion"" award, a ""creative thinker"" award, or a ""team player"" award. This highlights the unique value each employee brings to the team and encourages continuous learning and growth.10. Autonomy and flexibility as a form of recognitionSometimes the most valuable form of recognition is flexibility and autonomy. Allowing employees to work on projects they're passionate about, pursue their interests, or work from home can show that you trust and respect their abilities. This can improve their work-life balance and lead to increased productivity and loyalty.


A successful program is built on the foundation of honesty and transparency. One of the key takeaways is the importance of seeking concrete information and avoiding guessing. It's crucial to clearly understand what motivates employees and design recognition programs that align with those motivations.At the heart of any successful employee recognition program is the ability to accurately track and measure performance metrics. That's where Hana Retail comes in. Hana Retail is a powerful retail POS system that offers a wide range of features designed to help you manage your business more efficiently.

89,How AI is Helping Us Break Free From The 9-to-5 Grind,"Jun 7, 2023",Asim Rais Siddiqui,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-ai-is-breaking-the-9-to-5-mold/452728,"
As someone who is a huge tech enthusiast, I have been privileged to witness the continuous evolution of technology throughout my career. From groundbreaking innovations like the iPhone to cutting-edge advancements like 5G, the pace at which our world changes never ceases to amaze me. However, amidst this ever-changing landscape, one particular technology has captured my attention and sparked my curiosity: generative artificial intelligence (AI).Generative AI, at its core, is a remarkable fusion of human ingenuity and machine learning. Its capacity to go beyond our preconceived limits and generate, imagine and produce is truly awe-inspiring. As someone who has always been captivated by the transformative potential of AI in various industries, encountering generative AI took my fascination to an entirely new level.When I first witnessed the capabilities of generative AI, I was left in awe. It's almost as if the AI possesses its own inherent creative instincts, blurring the boundaries between the realms of human imagination and machine intelligence. While the notion of machines creating art, music, or writing that can rival human creativity might appear daunting to some, with fears of the automation apocalypse rampant, I think otherwise.



In the 2023 edition of its annual Future of Jobs Report, the World Economic Forum reports that out of the 803 businesses that it surveyed from around the world, 25% believe that the integration of AI tech will lead to job losses, while 50% believe that it will create job growth. AI can only replace humans if you think it will and stop progressing and upskilling alongside it.The potential for AI to push the boundaries of what we thought was possible is truly inspiring, and that can be illustrated in the way that it can reimagine the 9-to-5 workday.


Related: Why Are So Many Companies Afraid of Generative AI?Reimagining the 9-to-5 workdayThe traditional 9-to-5 work schedule has long been the standard in the corporate world, but with the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), the concept of ""clocking in"" and ""clocking out"" is undergoing a profound transformation. AI technologies are revolutionizing work, allowing flexibility, personalized schedules and reimagining the traditional workday.Every position within every organization holds the potential for reinvention. Accenture conducted a manual assessment of 200 language-related tasks to gauge the impact of generative AI. The aim was to identify which tasks were more likely to be automated or augmented through AI. The results showed that generative AI is projected to influence approximately 40% of individuals' working hours.In this article, we will explore how AI is reshaping the 9-to-5 paradigm and empowering individuals to ""flex out"" of rigid work schedulesRelated: How ChatGPT and Generative AI Can Transform the Way You Run Your BusinessEmbracing flexibilityWithin any given role, generative AI will help automate certain tasks while others will be assisted, freeing up individuals to focus on more meaningful endeavors. Rather than being bound by inflexible schedules, workers now have the chance to embrace flexible work setups that cater to their personal preferences and productivity patterns. Companies can optimize workflows, automate repetitive tasks and streamline processes, increasing employee flexibility.Additionally, there will be tasks that remain unaffected by the technology. The advent of generative AI will also usher in many new responsibilities for human workers, such as ensuring the responsible and accurate utilization of new AI-powered systems. This contributes to creating new job roles like AI system managers, AI ethics experts and prompt engineers.The rise of remote workAI has also played a crucial role in facilitating the surge of remote work, granting individuals the freedom to work from any corner of the globe. The advancements in communication and collaboration technologies, combined with AI-driven virtual meeting platforms, have simplified the process of remote collaboration for professionals.


The flexibility offered by AI-powered remote work helps eliminate the need for lengthy commutes, reduces overhead costs for companies, and expands opportunities for individuals in remote locations. Moreover, AI-enabled remote work allows organizations to tap into a global talent pool, accessing a diverse range of skill sets and perspectives that can fuel innovation and foster growth.Related: How The AI Revolution Is Liberating Workers from the OfficeRedefining work-life balanceThe conventional 9-to-5 work model frequently falls short when it comes to striking a healthy work-life balance. AI is helping reshape this paradigm, granting individuals the liberty to manage their time in a manner that aligns with their personal obligations and outside responsibilities. Nobel Prize-winning economist Christopher Pissarides believes that AI can enable humans to work just four days a week.With the aid of AI, flexible work schedules empower individuals to allocate dedicated time to personal endeavors like quality family moments, pursuing hobbies, or prioritizing self-care activities. By nurturing a more harmonious work-life balance, AI isn't just bolstering employee satisfaction and well-being but also improving productivity and overall job performance.


A flexible and personalized approach to the 9-to-5 workdayWith the continuous advancement of AI, the inflexible 9-to-5 work model is gradually being replaced by a more adaptable and personalized approach. Professionals now have the chance to break free from the confines of the traditional workday structure.Embracing this transformation facilitated by AI can result in heightened productivity, increased job satisfaction, and a more balanced and fulfilling work-life equilibrium. As we progress, it becomes crucial for individuals and organizations to harness the potential of AI to reshape work hours and unlock the full capabilities of the modern workforce.Related: It's Time to Prepare for the Algorithmic Workforce

90,Which Hiring Strategy Is Right for Your Startup? My Experience Says This One,"Jun 6, 2023",Andrew Amann,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/which-hiring-strategy-is-right-for-your-startup-my/452300,"
Startup businesses face a unique environment when it comes to adding the talent it needs during their earliest stages of operations. Of course, hiring a few full-time employees seems wise, but if a nascent business grows too quickly, salary spend might outstrip its initial funding sources. Too many staffing-related expenses remain a leading cause of startup failure especially when considering the difficulties encountered in hiring technology professionals.Related to that last point, even with rumors of a recession and the wide publicity of various tech layoffs, the current IT job market still greatly favors candidates. This situation makes any staffing process fraught with risk. Spending vital capital on a hiring effort that results in little success is something nascent businesses need to avoid.As such, any startup must consider leveraging the staff augmentation approach for at least some of its early hiring needs. Adopting this strategy provides a supply of talent at a fraction of the cost compared to onboarding full-time employees. It gives an emerging business the critical brainpower and budget flexibility it needs to improve its chances of success. So let's take a closer look at both approaches to see what makes sense for your startup.

However, depending on the reach of your advertising, you might be faced with hundreds of candidates that need to be analyzed. This situation becomes a drain on resources for startups lacking a full HR department.


Simply having to parse through a massive number of résumés requires a significant amount of effort from a startup's management team. Productivity for entrepreneurs is critical, and this is time better spent vetting business ideas or developing the requirements for the new business's first minimum-viable product. Once again, adopting this traditional staffing approach might not even result in any successful hires, wasting the time and resources of a business that needs to limit its capital spending. In a startup's earliest stages, only consider using it for a few key hires and ensure you work with a strategic HR team to hire team members who believe in your company's values, which a Gallup poll finds is important for 1 in every 4 employees.Staff augmentation gives startups more flexibilityStrategic flexibility within startups is a core advantage impacting exploratory innovation, but by the same token, startups also need flexibility to ensure they have the right level of resources at the right time to escalate development, drive growth and advance at key times. When using a staff augmentation strategy, a startup typically adds talent on a temporary basis to meet a specific need. This might be someone with certain tech experience, like AI and machine learning, that your new business wants to complete a project. It also provides a way to try out a candidate on your team before potentially offering them a permanent position.It ultimately helps the startup scale up its operations in a responsible and manageable manner, especially compared to engaging in risky staffing processes that result in few meaningful hires. This approach remains more conservative and wise when considering the revenue-limited status of most new businesses. Of course, using contract professionals also saves money when compared to the full salaries and benefits packages of a permanent hire.Typically, a startup works with a managed staffing services provider or a startup studio operating as an agency builder for access to contract professionals on a staff augmentation basis. Building a partnership with a talent provider ensures they understand your business's specific needs and office culture. It ultimately ensures a good fit between a startup and its temporary workers.


Related: How to Boost Revenue Per Employee By Leveraging This Effective StrategyOther benefits of staff augmentation for startupsOf course, startups gain a myriad of other benefits by adopting a staff augmentation approach for their talent needs. For example, many new businesses lack mature processes or even the concept of a productive team. When partnering with an agency builder as a source for staff augmentation professionals, you have the option to onboard an entire project team. This approach adds extra synergies related to collaboration, ensuring an efficient project highlighted by focused teamwork.Additionally, staff augmentation lets your startup quickly close a critical skills gap on an important project. If the startup's core business idea involves a mobile app with real-time data analytics powered by machine learning, onboard an entire team with tangible skills and experience, developing, training and deploying ML models. It keeps your project on target and also lets your permanent employees gain valuable experience working with top-shelf software engineers with significant AI experience.Trying to find a similar team-based talent influx when engaged in a traditional hiring process remains effectively impossible. Your startup might make a permanent hire or two, but these new employees still need to learn how to work effectively as a team.


In the end, staff augmentation for startups provides the flexibility they need to thrive during their early operations. They save money while still benefiting from the top-shelf technology talent many new businesses struggle to hire. Startups now boast the seamless scalability to grow in a measured manner — neither too quickly nor too slow. It's the right approach for any new business looking for the greatest chance at success.

92,The Delicate Dance Every HR Person Must Master,"Jun 1, 2023",Victoria Maitland,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-delicate-dance-of-balancing-empathy-and-professionalism/452209,"
Employees hold people in human resources to unique standards but with a weight as heavy as those they hold for a CEO. As HR professionals, we have to hold both the company and the employee at the same time. We need to know which side we must be on and at what time, depending on the situation and how to push back on one side or the other, or both simultaneously. This is the delicate dance HR professionals need to learn to be successful. By practicing the right steps, we can attempt to master it.Related: How HR Professionals Can Effectively Balance the Needs of the Employees and the BusinessBalancing empathy and professionalismIn HR, communication is everything. Without it, people start to fill in the gaps with their own narratives — ""They only care about the bottom line."" An organization without healthy and transparent communication is the prime environment for gossip to thrive, especially in sensitive situations like mergers and acquisitions. Everyone has horror stories, which feed into rumors of job cuts or loss of benefits because ""I know someone who went through the same thing.""



But communication is very nuanced, and HR professionals must appreciate that nuance to communicate and explain with a balance of empathy and professionalism. We often must communicate strategically, giving different audiences the information they need at the right times for the most effective delivery. Otherwise, we may be backed into an uncomfortable corner or say the wrong thing.Know your audience, read the room and bring empathy to every conversation, especially when communicating hard decisions. Behind closed doors with the decision-makers, I might express my feelings about the unfair situation differently. I can be honest, express empathy around the situation and even explain what went wrong to build trust in my advocacy for employees, but I need to balance that with respect for the leadership team at all times, even if they were the cause.


Related: The Core Belief That Drives My HR CareerHow the choreography moves to musicAfter acquiring a company in the UK, we merged the business first, leaving those in the back office to run in parallel until we could complete the process. We had promised everyone could join our benefits plan by the second quarter, and the remaining employees were excited as the date drew near. Unfortunately, we got delayed. Financial, controllership, IT and other system integrations in Brazil caused a backlog, pushing that date to the third quarter.HR had no purview over resolving these issues, and the delay was completely out of our control, but to this group of people, we were going back on everything we had promised.As the one responsible for communicating the decision, I told them the truth: We underestimated the work it would take to get everyone up and running in our systems. In part, this was because the organization had too many manual processes that, I admitted to them, we knew we needed to fix, and I apologized that they got caught up in that.


I struggled to deliver that message — it was not an easy choice. Others might have swept it under the carpet or, worse, given them no explanation. Instead, by delivering the information in a real and transparent way, I showed them a little of the ""behind the curtain"" difficulties of running a global business so they could empathize with the hard realities that happened in that process when different geographies own different parts of the process. As hard as the pill was for them to swallow, they appreciated that I was honest, empathetic to their situation, and willing to apologize.Related: How To Create a Work Culture Where Everyone Has A VoicePractice the steps and danceToeing the line of the company's interests while being an approachable leader that employees go to for support takes social and emotional intelligence and a basic understanding of human psychology and communication.Here are three steps to practice balancing empathy and professionalism to put the ""human"" back in ""human resources"":


Be honest. The HR dance requires communicating with integrity from a place of honesty. We are all human. We don't always have all the answers or control in making decisions, and it's OK to admit that. I have left HR conversations dissatisfied with the answers because they felt canned; dishonest. I want people to come away feeling that they got an honest answer, even if the response is not what they wanted. They may not like it, but they can respect it, knowing they were seen and heard as a person.Trying goes a long way. Even when we know we have little influence over the outcome, if we do our best in a given situation and communicate honestly, saying, ""Let me try,"" can go a long way. I always offer to try when employees come to me asking for more resources or help to manage too much on their plate. With the simple effort of saying, ""I've got you, I see you, I'll try,"" even if I try and come back with no news or bad news, they see HR as their advocate, feel heard and validated, and will respect that I tried.There's a lot of power in an apology. Even in the face of hard decisions and bad news that HR has no power to change, it is amazing how much an apology can make people feel better. When I say, ""I understand this is unfair, and I'm sorry on behalf of the organization it's happening to you. I wish it could be different,"" people hear this as a genuine apology, even without personally taking any blame for other people's decisions. I acknowledge the organization taking responsibility so employees can at least feel respected despite the outcome.Related: Next Time You Apologize, Say More Than 'I'm Sorry.'The more you use these steps with the people on your team, the more they learn to trust they can approach you for help or with feedback, which provides valuable information that we in HR need to do our jobs better. Go into every situation already having thought out how to explain it, offer people a way to ask questions, and be as available and honest as possible. This is how you gain the respect and trust needed to maintain a healthy and loyal team and, ultimately, an organization that trusts HR vs. being gaslighted by them.

94,Open vs. Anonymous Employee Feedback — Which is Better?,"May 29, 2023",Max Azarov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/open-vs-anonymous-feedback-how-to-effectively-collect/452278,"
While the need for continuous feedback has been a cornerstone of organizational performance for many years, recent transformative trends around remote working have made feedback culture more important than ever for company cohesion and success.But in the quest for valuable and honest feedback, does open feedback deliver better outcomes than anonymous channels?The benefits of feedback cultureRegularly sharing honest and constructive feedback respectfully can create a growth mindset in the workplace as it encourages employees to learn, develop new skills, grow and seek new challenges.



Providing feedback in this way can help promote better communication between managers and employees, boosting employee engagement and positively impacting overall employee satisfaction, retention and productivity.As such, regular feedback can build a solid and cohesive team and is a vital component in creating a strengths-based company culture, according to workplace consulting and global research group Gallup.


Furthermore, when companies implement feedback culture correctly, it encourages continuous improvement and innovation. Importantly for fully remote or hybrid organizations, the benefits of an entrenched feedback culture extend beyond performance and productivity, as it also allows companies to focus on factors related to employee well-being.For these reasons, creating an environment where employees feel safe to give and share feedback on their perspectives on their and co-workers' performances, workloads and well-being will differentiate a company from its competitors.Related: How to Give Employee Feedback Effectively (and Why It Matters)Encouraging valuable feedbackThe key to successfully implementing a feedback culture is creating opportunities for employees to give and receive constructive feedback regularly. In this regard, companies must train employees on how to do so and lead by example through regular and transparent communication.


Another key consideration is developing effective feedback mechanisms, with open or anonymous feedback an important consideration. The main difference between these two feedback channels is the level of transparency and accountability involved in the process.I have always felt that anonymous feedback is toxic to company culture. In my mind, anonymous feedback conveys a message that the company normalizes living in fear and accepts that employees lack the courage and conviction to own their points of view.But as a business leader, my most significant concern relates to the idea that anonymous feedback means staff does not trust each other enough to offer and receive feedback constructively.Related: Are You Asking for Employee Feedback? If Not, Good Luck With Retention.


Open feedback fosters trustPromoting open feedback lends itself to better engagement as employees can share their views in face-to-face conversations, through email, or via formalized internal feedback platforms. And sharing feedback in an open forum allows managers and business leaders to follow up with the person who provided the insights to clarify matters, ask additional questions and continue the conversation.Additional potential benefits of open feedback include:Allows leadership to give and receive constructive criticism and positive reinforcement.Helps identify areas for improvement and growth opportunities for individual employees and the organization as a whole.Encourages a culture of continuous improvement.Builds trust and fosters better communication within the workplace.One employee of mine shared that speaking openly and honestly is the best form of self-expression when sharing feelings and perceptions. The key to providing effective open feedback is honesty, offering facts to support views, using logic and proactively sharing ideas on improving rather than sharing ""empty criticism,"" which is useless.In this type of environment, where people respect the feelings of others, theoretically the need for anonymity would naturally dissipate.Related: Is Employee Feedback Missing at Your Company? Here's Why and How to Fix It.Different strokes for different folksHowever, other employees of mine have pointed out that people differ in their ability to share information and receive feedback openly, especially if it is sensitive or in a group setting.Where extroverted employees may feel comfortable sharing their views freely in an open forum, someone who is more reserved and introverted may struggle to express their opinion or provide or receive criticism in a group setting.Another response pointed out that people may not be able to share points of discomfort openly because they do not want to compromise their position. In this context, labeling anonymous feedback as cowardly may undermine someone who is merely worried about their future.


Open feedback can also lead to tension and conflict among employees and managers if it is not delivered constructively and respectfully and may create a culture of over-criticism and negativity if feedback is not balanced with positive reinforcement. Moreover, an open-only approach may erode the value of the feedback received, as people might feel less inclined to provide insights.A place for anonymous feedbackWhen implemented and managed correctly, anonymous feedback can provide valuable insights and promote constructive communication, as this feedback channel allows staff to share honest opinions and feedback without fear of recrimination or repercussions or offending colleagues or superiors.In this way, allowing anonymous feedback may help to create a more balanced and comprehensive view of employee satisfaction and company performance.However, an anonymous-only approach can lead to a lack of accountability, fostering a culture of negativity and complaining. It can make it difficult to follow up or address specific concerns.


What anonymous feedback channels should not do is promote a workplace where employees feel that they can recklessly criticize one another without consideration or give rude, offensive or hateful feedback.A hybrid feedback modelUltimately, both options have benefits and drawbacks, and both can work to create a thriving feedback culture because they cater to different employee preferences. As such, the best approach may vary depending on the situation and the culture of the organization.

95,How to Leverage Employee and Business Resource Groups to Create a More Diverse and Inclusive Workplace,"May 26, 2023",Nish Parikh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-utilize-employee-resource-groups-for-a-more-diverse/452057,"
Employee resource groups (ERGs) and business resource groups (BRGs) are gaining in popularity in corporate America as companies seek ways to build, sustain and grow a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce. ERGs and BRGs can be valuable assets in improving diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) hiring outcomes.Based on my experience working with several ERGs and BRGs over the years, I have compiled five ways companies can better engage these groups to achieve their DEI goals. I have added a relevant case study to each recommendation in order to further substantiate my observations and provide a practical approach to understanding and executing feasible solutions.Related: How to Utilize Employee Resource Groups and Cultivate Meaningful Impact in Your Workplace



1. Provide resources and supportOne effective way to engage ERGs and BRGs is to provide them with the necessary resources and support. This could include funding, training and access to company leaders and decision-makers. By investing in these groups, companies can help them achieve their goals while achieving better overall DEI hiring outcomes.Case study: Intel


Intel has about 40 ERGs and seven leadership councils that brought together more than 25,000 employees in 2021. Intel's ERGs are structured around race, national origin, sexual orientation and gender identity, parenthood, disabilities, education, faith and other common affinities. The organization encourages employees to join ERGs beyond their personal affinities to build relationships with a wider community. In addition, Intel has an Employee Inclusion Survey to gain a deeper understanding of how different employee populations experience inclusion at Intel, recognize opportunities for improvement and better understand the root causes of any systemic issues and how to address them. These initiatives demonstrate Intel's commitment to providing resources and support for its employees.2. Foster collaborationAnother way to engage ERGs and BRGs is to encourage collaboration between these groups and other company stakeholders such as HR, recruiters, hiring managers and employee development programs. This can help ensure that DEI goals are integrated into all aspects of the company's operations and policies.Case study: JPMorgan ChaseJPMorgan Chase's Advancing Black Pathways initiative is a collaborative effort to address systemic racism and provide economic empowerment for Black Americans. The program leverages the company's resources and partnerships to provide education, career development and access to capital for Black individuals and business owners. Advancing Black Pathways partners with other organizations to connect Black Americans with internships, jobs, mentorship programs and entrepreneurship opportunities. JPMorgan Chase also provides financial education and counseling to help individuals and families become financially stable. The initiative advances collaboration between JPMorgan Chase and its partner organizations to build a more equitable and inclusive society.


3. Encourage feedbackCompanies should encourage ERGs and BRGs to provide feedback on hiring processes and DEI initiatives. This feedback can help identify areas for improvement and guide future efforts.Case study: SalesforceSalesforce has a well-established ERG program called Trailhead that aims to provide a supportive and inclusive work environment. One example of this program is Salesforce's ""Ohana Groups,"" which are focused on building connections, offering mentoring opportunities and promoting diversity and inclusion among employees and allies. These groups are open to all employees and have a variety of focuses, such as gender, ethnicity, age and sexual orientation.Salesforce's ERGs play a vital role in the company's efforts to encourage feedback and improve employee engagement. These groups provide a forum for employees to share their experiences and ideas, give and receive feedback and participate in initiatives that promote DEI.


Related: 7 Ways Leaders Can Level Up Their DEI Workplace Strategy4. Engage employees and celebrate achievementsCompanies should invest in employee engagement and celebrate the achievements of ERGs and BRGs. This can include highlighting success stories, sharing best practices and providing opportunities for ERG and BRG members to highlight their work.Case study: IBMIBM's BRGs are employee-led groups focused on advancing diversity and inclusion in the workplace while also celebrating successes small and big. They are designed to create a sense of community among employees, provide opportunities for growth and drive business results by leveraging diverse perspectives and ideas. The BRGs at IBM are open to all employees, and members have the opportunity to participate in a variety of activities and initiatives, including community outreach, career development programs and networking events. They have been recognized for their impact on employee engagement, success stories and business outcomes, and the company continues to invest in their development.


5. Build communitiesExtraordinary things happen when companies provide support to ERGs in creating communities that are built around the shared values and interests of equity and inclusivity. These communities offer a safe space for employees to share their voices, experiences and perspectives. By providing a platform for employees to come together and collaborate, ERGs and BRGs play a crucial role in fostering a sense of belonging and strengthening the company culture.Case study: MicrosoftMicrosoft's ERGs provide a platform for employees with shared values and interests to collaborate, build communities and drive business impact. They are open to all employees and include a diverse range of affinities and intersectionalities, including women, African Americans/Blacks, Latinx, LGBTQ+, veterans, parents and more.Microsoft's ERGs focus on building and growing communities by providing members with opportunities for personal and professional growth, community outreach and connection with other employees across the company. ERG members can participate in events, mentorship programs and leadership opportunities that help them grow their skills and expand their networks. Through community outreach initiatives, ERG members can give back to their local communities and make a positive impact on society beyond their workplace.


ERGs at Microsoft have made significant contributions to the company's culture and business success. For example, Microsoft's Black and African American ERG, Blacks at Microsoft (BAM), played a critical role in increasing the representation of Black employees at the company and in driving cultural awareness and education. Similarly, the company's Women at Microsoft (WAM) ERG has been instrumental in driving diversity and inclusion efforts across the company.Related: 3 Proven Ways to Hire (and Keep) Diverse TalentIn conclusion, ERGs and BRGs can play a critical role in advancing DEI hiring outcomes and creating a more inclusive and equitable work environment. Companies can better engage these groups by providing resources and support, fostering collaboration, encouraging feedback, engaging employees, celebrating achievements and building communities. The case studies highlighted in this post demonstrate practical approaches to leveraging ERGs and BRGs to achieve DEI hiring goals and create a more diverse and inclusive workforce. By investing in these groups and their members, companies can build a stronger culture of inclusion and drive positive, sustainable and scalable business results.

96,Hiring This Type of Employee Can Protect Your Business From a Volatile Market,"May 25, 2023",Daniel Altman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/try-employing-this-type-of-employee-for-your-business/450630,"
Fine-tuning the use of labor is one of the constant challenges for businesses. Hire too many people and you may be paying workers to sit idle. Bring in too few and you'll be leaving revenue on the table as you have to forgo opportunities. To avoid downtime and unused resources, you have to get things just right, all the time.The problem is becoming more acute, too. Even if we put aside the uncertainty of the economic cycle and shocks like the Covid-19 pandemic, the seasonality of demand is increasing. In the years before the pandemic began, the volatility of consumer spending on services had reached levels unseen since the early 2000s. You'd have to go back almost as far to find the same volatility for spending on goods, which bounces around much more.Whether it's the spring events season for services or the summer ramp-up to prepare for fall spending on goods, changes in payrolls can be more dramatic than ever. To deal with these ups and downs, it helps to take a page out of investing books: diversify your portfolio. By using a variety of different sources of labor, you can insulate your business from volatility and reduce risks like downtime, burnout and more.



Related: Why Freelancers are the Key to Achieving Talent Scalability On DemandA broader range of optionsHuman resources managers and executives have more tools than ever to deal with fluctuations in demand. Not too long ago, their main choices were just full-time or part-time workers, and employment was always for a fixed number of hours. These days there are many more choices in the market.


Permanent full-time and part-time jobs still exist, of course. But there are also job shares, whereby two or more people share and cooperate in the same position. People can work remotely or on hybrid schedules where their jobs allow. Freelancers can offer extra leverage. Now there are flexible workers who can engage with companies in myriad ways: for a single shift at a time, on a roster of rotating workers or via long-term assignments.All of these workers bring different attributes to the table: the knowledge and skills they have coming in, the additional training they require, the hours they are willing to work, the pay they expect to receive, the benefits to which they are entitled and the budget lines to which they belong. Together, these differences can fit together to make a diversified portfolio of labor options.When permanent workers need time or get burned out from working extra hours, flexible workers can pitch in. When flexible workers need training, permanent workers are there to guide them. In periods of peak demand, flexible workers can go on long-term assignments. When demand is more sporadic, they can come in when needed to support a team that's not yet ready for more permanent hiring.Moreover, some workers may not want every kind of job — a flexible worker may not want a permanent position and vice versa. So if you want access to the entire labor pool, with all of its diverse talents, then you have to offer a variety of options for working together. And by leveraging flexible options, you can ""try before you buy"" by auditioning workers one shift at a time. With a diversified payroll, hiring isn't just a zero-or-one decision anymore.


Related: Get More From Temps, Your Company's Most Undervalued AssetThinking like an investorOf course, adopting this approach takes some planning. The bulk of your payroll will always reflect the overall growth of your business. These are your steadiest employees who will be with you for the long term, so you'll often want to gain their loyalty by offering them permanent positions.Another component of your payroll will help you to control volatility along the way. These are the workers who will show up when others don't, or whose hours can easily change in line with demand. Because shifts for flexible work fill so quickly these days, using flexible workers in your payroll is like adding ""just-in-time"" labor to a just-in-time supply chain. On our platform, the average time-to-fill is less than 12 hours across almost all roles.You can add other types of workers to your portfolio, too. You might use a specialized temp agency to bring in experts for short stints, perhaps for launching a new product line or leading a team of recently hired workers. You might hire experienced senior staff who don't want to work full-time as part of a job share. You can also turn one type of worker into another, like hiring an outstanding flexible worker for a full-time position.


It's worth noting that a team with more kinds of workers can be a little more complex to manage. Fortunately, there are new software packages with AI-driven algorithms that can draw up schedules for a variety of workers according to their preferences and businesses' needs, and flexible work platforms will often take care of the recruiting, accounting and payment functions. Just as for investors, the tools are out there — and the winners will be the ones who use them.

97,Why Companies Are Prioritizing Employees Without College Degrees,"May 24, 2023",Zamir Shukho,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-companies-are-hiring-and-prioritizing-employees-without/452150,"
A recent survey conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) revealed that almost one-third of American employers now consider non-degree candidates for job openings, with 37% of employers reporting that they are more likely to do so than five years ago.For the last several years, we have seen that developed soft skills are becoming the leading requirement in different companies, especially in terms of working with other people, e.g., being a proper team player, a good leader, being able to communicate properly and align with company values and diversity issues.Soft skills are often difficult to quantify, which is why many employers have traditionally focused on things like degrees and certifications to screen candidates. However, in many cases, a candidate's ability to work well with others, think critically and adapt to new situations is more important than their specific educational background.



In fact, some of the most successful people in business and industry are self-taught, having learned their skills through hands-on experience and a willingness to take on new challenges. Mark Zuckerberg, one of the most recognized names in tech, built Facebook into the world's largest social network. Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in 2004, during his sophomore year, to work on Facebook full-time and remains its CEO to this day. David Karp created Tumblr (which at its peak gained more than 500 million monthly users) despite never even graduating high school. Daniel Ek, co-founder of Spotify after abandoning his degree in engineering at the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden after just eight weeks. The list goes on and on. The billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, dropped out of Harvard to focus on building his company.Related: How to Find, Hire (and Fire!) Rockstar Employees


High levels of soft skills are now defining a good employee. Even if a person has a great degree or might have vertical expertise in the field but lacks soft skills, some companies might prefer a better team player over a fancy university diploma. That brings harmony and drives team success rather than individual success.When hiring people, I personally don't even look at the degree. When I conduct an interview, I ask a lot about different situations this person has been in at work, different conflict situations, communication processes with peers or their direct reports, and the rest of the team. I try to figure out how the communication will be done upwards at the same level or downwards. For me, a formal degree is not as important as people's experience, and positive references are given to their soft skills, work ethics, and communication.Related: 5 Soft Skills Every Employee Needs TodayThe shift in hiring practicesA number of factors is driving this shift:


The rising cost of college.An increased emphasis on workplace skills over degree credentials.the growing popularity of alternative educational models such as online certificates.In addition, some employers are starting to recognize that non-degree candidates can bring unique perspectives and experiences to the table that traditional college graduates may not possess. Google, Apple, IBM, Bank of America and other big companies adopted this approach in 2018.As employers move away from relying solely on academic qualifications, they now have more opportunities to identify and hire high-quality individuals who can contribute meaningfully to their organization. However, this trend also means that employers must be prepared to evaluate applicants based on a broader range of criteria than they may have in the past. In addition to traditional measures such as prior experience, academic achievements, and references, employers should consider evaluating candidates based on their skill set and personal qualities such as self-discipline and problem-solving abilities.At the same time, employers must ensure that they are not discriminating against potential employees who do not possess a traditional academic background. This includes assessing candidates based on their potential rather than focusing solely on past accomplishments or experiences. By taking a more holistic approach to evaluating applicants and considering the full range of skills and qualities they possess, employers can ensure that they are attracting a diverse set of candidates who have the potential to add value to their organization.A recent survey by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) revealed that 57% of employers plan to hire more such candidates in the future. This is indicative of a growing trend in organizations around the world.

Especially when it comes to startups or venture-backed companies that require innovative and creative approaches, formal education can be an obstacle in thinking or creating a new product/business model. We see that some innovative companies intend to hire people without a formal education or college degree because that allows them to be more creative and think ""outside of the box,"" which results in more added value.By the way, fields such as IT, Manufacturing, Customer Service, Business Administration, Accounting and Finance are examples of areas that don't necessarily require a degree but may prefer candidates with relevant experience or qualifications.High levels of soft skills are now defining a good employee. Even if a person has a great degree or might have vertical expertise in the field but lacks soft skills, some companies might prefer a better team player over a fancy university diploma. That brings harmony and drives team success rather than individual success.


By recognizing the importance of soft skills and focusing on the qualities that truly matter, employers can build more diverse and effective teams that are better equipped to tackle the challenges of today's rapidly-changing business landscape.

99,How You Can Build Your Dream Team By Hiring When Everyone Else Is Firing,"May 16, 2023",Roy Dekel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-you-should-be-hiring-when-everyone-else-is-firing/450957,"
Now, I know this might sound like a crazy idea. After all, why would anyone want to hire when the entire world is downsizing and laying off employees left and right? But hear me out.The truth is, layoffs are happening because these large companies have become bloated and inefficient.They have so many employees that they can't even keep track of who's doing what. And when times get tough, they start slashing jobs left and right without any regard for the talent that they're losing.



Related: A Downturn Can Actually Be a Good Time to Cultivate Talent. Here's Why.Why is everyone firing?The economic impact of the multiple crises we've experienced over the past few years alone has led to companies experiencing a decline in revenue and profits, causing them to restructure their businesses to survive. This restructuring often results in layoffs and downsizing to cut costs and stay afloat.


Some companies also had to shift to remote work arrangements, and the need to implement safety protocols has also contributed to the layoffs. Companies that were unable to adapt to the new normal had to make tough decisions, including downsizing and restructuring, to remain competitive.With the rise of automation and artificial intelligence, companies are looking to streamline their operations, which means reducing the number of employees. As a result, employees who have skills that can be easily automated are often the first to be let go.Some companies are also undergoing mergers and acquisitions, which can lead to redundancies and layoffs. When two companies merge, there is often an overlap in roles and responsibilities, which can result in the elimination of positions.But as an entrepreneur, you have the opportunity to do things differently. By building your business efficiently, you can pick up talent at a fraction of the cost and build your dream team in a way that these large companies could only dream of.


What are the benefits of hiring during an economic downturn?First and foremost, hiring while others are firing allows you to access top talent that may not have been available in a more competitive job market.Many highly skilled workers who have been laid off may be looking for new opportunities and may be more willing to work for a smaller, growing company that can offer them more flexibility and growth potential.In addition, hiring during a period of widespread layoffs can give your business a competitive advantage. As larger companies downsize their operations and scale back on services, smaller businesses that are still growing can step in to fill the gaps in the market. This can help your business gain market share and increase your customer base.Another benefit of hiring during a period of layoffs is that you may be able to negotiate better terms with potential employees.


To clarify, when discussing negotiating better terms with potential employees, it is not necessarily about undervaluing their talent. Rather, it is simply acknowledging the reality of the current economy and job market.With more people looking for work, you may be able to offer lower salaries or fewer benefits and still attract top talent. This can help you keep your labor costs under control and invest more in other areas of your business.Related: Companies Need To Be Better at Hiring, Not Firing. 7 Tips To Pick And Retain The Best Talent During Uncertain Economic Times.Building your dream team on a budgetWhen hiring during tough times, it's also still very important to be strategic.


Instead of simply filling gaps in your existing staff, take the time to think about what positions you need to add to take your business to the next level. This is the perfect opportunity to build out your dream team, with a focus on hiring people who can help you grow and thrive.While it's true that hiring during tough times can be an opportunity to pick up top talent at a fraction of the cost, it's still important to be mindful of your budget. If it goes down to it, you can consider hiring on a commission-only basis or offering equity in your company as a way to attract top talent while keeping costs low.Building a great team is one of the most important things you can do for your business. And since this great team is built during hard times when work dedication is slowly fading, they will help you achieve your goals in ways you couldn't have done alone.And when the economy bounces back, you'll be in a position to reap the rewards of having a highly skilled and motivated team in place.Related: How to Be An Accountable Leader During an Age of LayoffsWhile it may seem counterintuitive to hire when everyone else is firing, doing so can be a smart move for entrepreneurs who want to make duplicates of themselves in the company.With the right strategy, you can pick up top talent at a fraction of the cost and build your business in a more efficient and effective way.So, don't let the current economic climate scare you away from hiring — use it as an opportunity to build your dream team and take your business to new heights!

100,'Think Carefully': Musk Issues Stark Warning About New Hires to Tesla Employees,"May 16, 2023",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/musk-tells-tesla-employees-that-he-must-approve-all-new/452268,"
Elon Musk has been known to lay down the hammer when it comes to his Tesla employees, whether it's requiring them to come into the office and encouraging them to leave if they do not comply or sending mass emails about productivity.Now, another leaked memo shows that Musk, who is CEO of Tesla, must directly approve of all potential employees before they can be formally offered a job at the electric car company.Related: Neon Lights, Fireworks and $90 Merch: Elon Musk Throws Massive 'Cyber Rodeo' Party at Tesla Factory Opening



""Think carefully before sending me a request,"" Musk penned to employees in an email viewed by Electrek. ""No one can join Tesla, even as a contractor, until you receive my email approval.""Musk also requested that the VPs of each department send him their requests for hiring weekly so that he can ""gain a better understanding"" of the hiring process at the company.


The new process will of course make the hiring process slower and more deliberate, with one anonymous employee telling CNBC that many Tesla workers inferred that the email meant a ""soft"" hiring freeze was imminent.Tesla saw several rounds of layoffs in 2022, which was a rough year for the electric car company as it saw its stock value plummet when Musk sold off large portions of his own shares to fund his acquisition of Twitter.Related: Elon Musk Brutally Tells Tesla Executives They Must Return to Offices 'Or Depart Tesla'However, after opening new gigafactories in Austin, Texas and Berlin, the company hired an estimated 28,565 new employees between 2021 and 2022.


Musk will now have plenty of time to dedicate to Tesla as he relieves himself of CEO duties at Twitter, announcing last week that former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino will be taking on the role.Tesla reported a year-over-year net income loss of 24% in Q1 2023, which the company attributed to an ""underutilization of new factories"" and higher costs for raw materials, among other things.Tesla's annual shareholder meeting is expected to begin at 4 p.m. EST on Tuesday at Tesla's gigafactory in Austin.The company was down over 31.6% year over year as of Tuesday morning.

101,5 Ways Startups Can Leverage Tech Layoffs to Attract Top Talent,"May 12, 2023",Kalon Gutierrez,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-ways-startups-can-leverage-tech-layoffs-to-attract-top/450938,"
The initial wave of tech layoffs captured global headlines with a sense of shock and awe, and according to Nerdwallet, in 2022, more technology workers were laid off than in 2020 and 2021 combined. While big tech itself has laid off unprecedented numbers in a very short span and continues to navigate various economic headwinds, the broader tech industry continues its focus on innovation and strategic growth.These signals do not mean that the overall employment economy is bad nor are reflective of the broader talent market. According to Zip Recruiter, 37% of those laid off in the tech industry found a new job within one month, and 79% found a new job within three months, which underscores the many opportunities available. Additionally, quit rates remain the highest in over 20 years and unemployment stands at a steady 3.4%-3.7%, an incredibly low range. These tech employees are also looking into other industries – CNBC notes that many other sectors such as health care, education and government are experiencing a never-before-seen level of interest from top tech talent. Small and mid-cap tech companies are similarly experiencing newfound popularity.Related: Why Companies Must Leverage Outsourced Development Teams to Weather Economic Downturns and Layoffs



Top employees who found themselves suddenly unemployed can still remain in the driver's seat. The talent wars may be less drastic than a year ago, but they do still exist. This creates a tremendous opportunity for early-stage growth companies to reflect on recent events and look inwards at their culture to ensure they are best positioned to attract some of this talent. The ability of startups to hire and retain these resources could be a key determinant of future success. Yet, it's not a done deal.Early-stage companies are unlike most other businesses in the market in that they have the flexibility to quickly pivot and innovate their culture. To attract and retain this newly available (and incredibly smart) talent looking for opportunities, startups must implement a set of key practices and procedures that will enable them to stand out from the pack.


Here are five strategies they can consider to position themselves for lasting human capital success:1. Embrace hybrid and remote work environmentsOffer hybrid and remote work flexibility options. Not only will this provide a broader geographical base to hire from, but it will actually encourage diversity in the workplace. As Aki Cho points out in her article ""The Reason Bosses are Freaked out by Remote Work,"" hybrid and remote work environments will cater to a workforce that is more ethnically and gender diverse.2. Create a collaborative and flexible co-working spaceEarly-stage companies need to break down the walls that siloed offices were once surrounded by. The office needs to become a place that employees want to visit versus have to visit. Startups can rethink the purpose of the office, designing with collaborative structures and making the décor inspirational and welcoming. In addition, there is an opportunity to extend open hours, allowing for early birds and night owls alike to have a place to operate during the time frame that they are naturally wired to perform best.Related: Your Tech Employees Are Your Most Potent Reputational Tool as Your Firm Recruits


3. Offer liberal equity packages and clearly define vesting schedulesMost employees at big tech companies own a very small piece of a very large pie. By joining a startup, they now have the opportunity to own a meaningful part of their company's success. Offer generous equity packages, encouraging employees not only to join feeling like co-founders but also to find a longer-term commitment to success. Clearly articulate your company's vesting schedule and communicate the value through frequent valuation exercises. Extend top-ups when goals are met and the company meets clearly defined and well-communicated metrics.4. Create and communicate vision, mission and values that stand for something differentEarly-stage companies have an opportunity to stand out from the big tech pack. Create a vision, mission and values set that represents clarity, aspiration and inclusivity. Develop a clear communications plan and incorporate it into employee hiring, onboarding and retention materials. Stories of laid-off employees attest to their feeling anonymous, overlooked and undervalued. A clear communications plan will serve as the first step to proving it will be different this time around.5. Be purposeful in hiring Many tech companies experienced massive growth during the pandemic. According to CNN Business, some grew by as much as 100%, just in the 2019 – 2022 time frame alone. As these same companies are now reducing their workforces in record numbers, those terminated are concluding that their hires were based on reactive growth, not properly thought through. Many feel as though they didn't matter. Early-stage companies can tell a different story by clearly defining the roles they are hiring for, implementing a reasonable company-wide hiring plan and holding themselves accountable for longer-term retention of those they bring on board.As the tech layoff trend continues, next-generation leaders are realizing that this time around it's more than transactional. Affected employees are reflecting on their experiences and reframing their definitions of a meaningful career. It can be argued that startups are best positioned to address this newfound north star; they are nimble, collaborative and able to present the most ownership-oriented reward structure. With intentional planning, focus and ongoing championship, early-stage leaders can leverage this unique hiring opportunity to build best-in-class teams that set the foundation for lasting success.

102,You Made a Bad Hire — Now What? Here Are 3 Self-Reflective Practices Leaders Should Take to Overcome and Grow.,"May 11, 2023",Lauren Hirsch Williams,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/you-made-a-bad-hire-now-what-practice-self-reflection/451846,"
We've all been there. You hire people, partner with people, or trust someone with the precious gift that is your business venture. And they let you down. After you've invested your time, money, and, perhaps more importantly, your emotions into the relationship, what do you do when it all turns south and you can't take it anymore?Asking for help for most entrepreneurs can cause anxiety. Bringing in an ""outsider?"" Eek! We tend to be an independent lot who can juggle and manage a myriad of tasks at once. Hiring someone to ease our workload isn't always a road easily traveled.So, let's look at what you should do when that ugly speedbump of a bad hire pops up, and you have no option but to face it head-on. After all, ignoring it and hoping it would fix itself hasn't worked these past few weeks, has it?



In most cases, this type of situation comes from hiring someone specializing in an area you don't have expertise in, such as copywriting or technical backend integrations. You reach out to a handful of people asking for references. You dive into some calls, and more often than not, you hire a person you interview because you get along with them so well (and let's face it, it's tough to find the perfect person anymore).Related: How to Let Go of Control and Hire an Expert


They say the right things. They're full of energy and enthusiasm for your work, and you breathe a sigh of relief because the burden of responsibility has finally been lifted. You like this person and have high expectations.You amble along as you share information while having great conversations and laughter. You can't wait for them to take over part of the workload and get things done as you envisioned.You have standards.You have preferences.You have a vision.You set a path to reach your goals.Their fee (or salary) is paid upfront and immediately (because you generally hate when people don't do that), and the expectations timer kicks into action.And then it happens. You face the reality that they don't get it. You still really like the person, but they don't seem able to deliver what you expected — or what they seemed capable of in the first place. The first instance you let slide. ""It's a learning curve,"" right?


Perhaps it was a miscommunication. Maybe you weren't as focused on giving enough pertinent information for them to do the job. Or maybe, just maybe, they weren't capable from the start. And that is heartbreakingly disappointing.It was hard enough to ask for help in the first place. But now, you don't have the results you expected, and, on top of that, you're out a boatload of your hard-earned money, you need to find someone else, and pay them even more of your hard-earned money to clean this mess up.Your first knee-jerk reaction is emailing that person to release frustration and irritation. Because come on, you're annoyed and hurt if you're honest. You've invested personally and professionally in that person, and they let you down. Or did you let yourself down? That might be more disappointing!So, what can you do with this current situation to save your mental health spiral of negativity, intense remorse at throwing away good money, and reflective finger-pointing and blame?


Here are three steps I take to overcome a disappointing hire:1. Take responsibilityYour first step is to take accountability for your side of the equation. This is the hardest pill to swallow because it's the size of a submarine. But swallow you must. You're the one who chose to work with the person in the first place. I know you want to blame someone else, but you can't do that without also taking some of the blame.I call this the ""Red Flag Counter"" philosophy. We all generally dismiss more red flags than we ought to. We like someone, so we let the first handful of gut-instinct red flags go without paying attention.Then comes the non-gut instinct red flags. These are when behavior or actions are like neon signs flashing in your face. The work just isn't done well. Period. You had expectations that weren't met. That's a literal red flag.


It's time to stop letting so many of them pass by before halting the process and recalibrating.But we like this person so much that we're distracted by their mutual love of your favorite TV show. Or perhaps the mere thought of starting over with the hiring process is exhausting and undesirable. Who has time?By the time three or more red flags have been stuffed into a back closet, your irritation factor is only waiting on the sidelines to explode and at that point, remedial recovery may be too late.Related: The Real Impact Of A Bad Hire For Your Business


2. Take a breathTake several of them. You need oxygen because this scenario isn't an easy one to digest. But rest assured that there are ways to take away something positive from this seemingly hopeless and frustrating situation.It would help to remind yourself that this isn't the end of the world. Stop for a few moments and remind yourself that if you can calm your body down with deep breathing, your emotions will also calm. A clear and focused mind is the best way to handle any disappointing situation. Our emotions tend to distract and muddy the waters making logic and common sense dissipate.So, take a breath and accept that this is a picture you allowed to be painted. The other person may be at fault for not delivering, but you also had a hand in it. As an entrepreneur, we must be realistic about our role in any situation. With that awareness and perspective, you gain the skills to grow. Once calmed, you can move on to the next step.3. Try to salvage the relationshipPeople are more important than a project. You'll have ongoing projects or tasks, but finding people you like gets harder and harder to come by as you get older.


I'm not saying you need to invite them to dinner every Friday night but find a way to calm down and make sure you know — and they know — that you still respect them as a fellow human being. It's not easy. Especially if you paid them and they didn't deliver.I may not have chosen this as a step in the process, but there's been so much open hate and divisiveness in the world that we don't need more. Another interesting point of view is how small the business world tends to get the longer you're in it.It's astonishing how paths can cross again later in time. My partner reconnects with people from decades ago and often strikes up a new working relationship or joint venture. The more you can salvage a relationship in the heat of a disruption, the more you'll have an open door as your business grows. Just because something didn't work out this time around doesn't mean it won't come back to work at a later date. After all, there was a reason you connected and hired this person in the first place.It is time to let the basic foundation of human decency step back into the spotlight. And how better to start than with ourselves? After all, you got yourself into the mess and can get yourself out.


Related: 6 Tips for Hiring the Right People4. Time for acceptance and learningIf you paid for a service, your money is gone. No one stole it from you or forced you to pay for it. There's always a moment when you need to look that decision in the face and accept that you made it and it can't be changed. You can't reinvent history, so why not learn from it? You decided to bring that person in, and you paid them.Your time is gone (whether you paid or not). You can't get that time back no matter how many time-travel, sci-fi films or TV series you watch.You're now sitting with your disappointment and need to get some value from it. The most significant value you'll get is learning a lifelong lesson not to make the same mistake again.


It would be best to attempt rectifying things and communicate that you think something went wrong. You should offer ideas on how to collectively work together so your expectations are better met — making sure theirs are also met.But in the end, it didn't work. Many things in life don't. The disappointment of not getting what you wanted may sting. Ok, maybe the sensation is more like a severe burn! But it too shall pass, and your best bet is to let it go and move on (quickly) as you're fully equipped with new knowledge and insight on how to prevent it from happening again.Grow with the processThink deeply, assess the process, and see all things with clarity. Accept your role in the situation. Focus on profoundly understanding what went wrong and why (or how), and grow more powerful from a lesson painfully learned. Remember to hold your head high with the pride of putting another person's humanity into the solution.Side note: If you hired someone to do a job and they flat out didn't deliver (versus them providing something different from what you expected or wanted), ask for a refund or partial refund. That's fair, also.


The best bet is to write out a detailed job description in advance. Send it to the applicant or your new hire and have them sign it. Have them initial each line item. That way, you have something you both can revisit if delivery is lacking.As the saying goes — get on the same page. Getting on the same page upfront clears the way for great success flags, not red ones of a problem or white ones of surrender. Go get 'em!

103,High Performers Are 400% More Productive Than Average Employees. Keeping Them Takes More Than Money.,"May 11, 2023",Ryan Wong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-ways-to-incentivize-top-talent-beyond-just-a-paycheck/449931,"
Retaining top talent should be a priority in any economy, particularly in this downturn. One recent study found that high performers were 400% more productive than average employees. And the competition for top talent has never been more fierce: Nearly 90% of executives and managers in a recent McKinsey Global Survey said their organization already faces a skills gap or expects one to develop by 2024.That's why progressive employers are increasingly focusing on retention strategies, even in a downturn — identifying who their true ""water carriers"" are and taking proactive steps to keep them engaged for the long haul. Not surprisingly, a common denominator to smart retention strategies is data. With the wealth of people data now available — from engagement levels to performance and even influence and network — it's possible to identify and incentivize high-value team members with a striking level of precision.For employers seeking to retain their best and brightest, these three critical levers can make all the difference.Related: How to Make More Money, Retain the Best Employees and Grow Your Business — All at the Same TimeDon't underestimate the power of purposeA central way to retain high-performing employees is to use your company's mission and values to guide operations and strategic decisions. Now, more than ever, this can be a differentiator.



Half the workers surveyed in a recent Gartner survey said the pandemic changed their expectations of their employer. Fifty-six percent said they wanted to contribute more to society, and nearly two-thirds were rethinking the place that work should have in their lives.A workforce aligned with a clear company mission — one that is lived, not just written on a dusty vision statement — is more loyal and engaged. Nor do ""mission"" and ""values"" need to mean saving the world. Operating from a place of honesty, authenticity, and trust can be just as powerful.Our research shows a strong correlation between trust and retention. For example, nearly half of the employees who trust their employers say they see themselves staying in their current roles for five years or longer, compared to only 29% of those with little trust. Building trust in a downturn means being transparent about challenges. High-performers know when the truth is being sugar-coated. You are likelier to rally employees around a common cause and build a fighting spirit by being open and authentic.Here, too, data can help. Internal survey tools can show shifts in employee sentiment, while advanced analytics platforms can reveal subtle changes in things like email frequency and meeting attendance that show true buy-in.


Related: How to Attract and Retain Top TalentPrioritize experience (not perks)Numbers don't lie. Companies with higher employee engagement have 65% lower than average turnover. They also have greater profitability, higher productivity, better customer ratings and lower absenteeism and theft.So a second important way to keep valuable employees is to pay attention to employee experience on a deep and meaningful level. Cultivating good experiences isn't about gym memberships or free bagel Fridays; rather, it needs to be baked into every level of operations.A classic example is professional development. In too many companies, this is misunderstood to mean an occasional conference or continuing education program. But true professional development is a continuous process that requires meaningful, day-to-day engagement with a committed manager.


A big part of that is providing team members with opportunities for lateral growth. These lattice-style promotions strengthen the organization, seeding interdepartmental best practices and providing employees with new growth opportunities. In fact, our research shows that a desire to learn skills is a significant driver of employee turnover, with 32% of respondents in a recent survey saying learning opportunities influenced their decision to leave.Leveraging people data can yield dividends here, as well. With the right platforms, companies can map skills, competencies and capabilities across entire organizations, identifying growth opportunities for promising employees that extend far beyond the traditional ""ladder"" to the top. A recruiter who spends time in a sales role will be more well-rounded and ultimately more successful in either capacity. The company will benefit from its multifaceted perspective.Related: What Attracts and Retains Employees? It Might Not Be a Paycheck.Salary size matters, but so does transparencyCompensation is usually the first tool that comes up in discussions of workforce retention. In fact, it's often the entire conversation. But for employees, compensation may well be the weakest form of persuasion, especially if you're offering competitive wages to start.


Certainly, unusually low salaries can make employees feel undervalued. But money only goes so far as an incentive. Consider that one-third of job switchers during the Great Resignation took pay cuts to gain a better work-life balance.Our research has shown that transparency in pay and promotion is equally important to employees. Once considered a taboo topic, pay transparency is now the law in at least seven U.S. states, with more to follow. People data can be invaluable when identifying a role's ""right"" salary. Wise leaders use data to benchmark salaries against industry standards to ensure competitive salary bands. In short, there's no reason the appropriate salary should be a guessing game for companies today.Of course, leaders can't prevent good people from leaving if their hearts are set in another direction. Let them leave on good terms, with your respect and encouragement. Employers have a vested interest in giving employees gracious exits. Our research shows that boomerang employees made up nearly one-third of external hires from January 2019 through April 2022.But by using people data and paying attention to the three pillars of employee engagement — mission, experience and compensation — leaders can minimize employee turnover by creating a productive, fulfilling work environment. It's a worthwhile investment to help keep and develop high-value people in bad and good times.

I'm going to tell you a quick but embarrassing story. And, I'm telling it because I know it will save you a lot of time and frustration. So, here we go.One time I was creating a proposal for a client. Pretty basic right? Here's where it got complicated. The client wanted it delivered as a PDF, and all the pages had to be vertical, except for one. They wanted one of the pages with a bunch of data on it to be in a horizontal format.Here's the problem. I had no clue how to make that happen! I spent 30 minutes trying to figure it out myself. Another 30 minutes trying to Google the solution, then another 30 or so looking at YouTube videos.



After 90 minutes I still couldn't figure it out. So here's what I finally did. I went to Fiverr, typed in ""format pdf"" and found someone who could do the job for me. $10 dollars and 10 minutes later, I had a completed proposal for my client.And while I was glad to have it done I was frustrated at the fact that I spent close to two hours on something that took someone else 10 minutes, and only cost me $10.

That's when I realized how important it was to stay in your zone of genius, and outsource everything else.And, you probably realize this as well, but here's where many people get stuck. You may not feel comfortable going on a platform and asking some unknown person for help.And, I don't blame you. You don't know anything about them or the quality of their work. But on the flipside, if you don't start leveraging remote experts, you'll continue to spend hours on tasks that are a waste of your time, energy and talent.


Fortunately, Fiverr has solved this problem for you with their premium offering called Fiverr Business, a platform caters specifically to medium to larger sized businesses with larger teams and bigger budgets.And here's one of my favorite parts, it includes premium features like a vetted talent pool, so you're getting the best of the best freelancers.How can you start leveraging remote experts to improve your business, and what's the best way to get started?I chatted with a few entrepreneurs who also leverage Fiverr Business so they can share their experiences with you during the most recent episode of the Launch Your Business Podcast.


You'll learn:The pre work you should do before you even start looking to add a team memberA practical and time-saving way to hand off tasksThe revenue outcomes associated with freeing up your time by hiring expert workersI've shared some of my favorite takeaways from the episode below.When should you look for outside help?Sunny Williams, co-founder of TinyDocs, a company that makes animated shorts explaining health issues in terms accessible to kids, says he knew he needed help shortly after launching.""Being a social impact business and having a pretty big vision … I had to kind of do an audit and realize, what are the skill sets and talents that I needed around me in order to execute on our vision of creating a healthier world for our children. I don't have the most creative background. I'm pretty limited in my talents and, and creativity."" After a friend suggested that Sunny look into Fiverr, he realized he had what he calls, ""portal to all the talents and creativity and skill sets that I needed to start executing on this vision and building this really robust business.""


For other entrepreneurs like Ari Turner, founder of skincare company Look Good, Live Well, bringing in new team members may not feel like a natural first step. She admits that she waited too long to hire help for her business.""The company that I built was actually a response to reaching burnout in a past career,"" Ari says. ""Several years later when I was in the thick of working on Look Good, Live Well, I found myself face-to-face with burnout again. I'm like, wait a minute. I left the stressed out job. I'm doing what I love. How are we here?""If you're feeling this way, here's one way to start getting time back. Keep track of every task you perform that could be done by someone or something else. Then, resolve to outsourcing or automating these tasks.How to prepare for hiring a remote workerAfter Ari realized she needed to bring on help to relieve the burden of doing it all, she sat down for what she calls a come to Jesus meeting – with herself. Before she went searching for the perfect virtual assistant, she wanted to be honest with herself about her working style, communication preferences, strengths and weaknesses.


""I'm the CEO of my company right now, but I am definitely a very forward-thinking individual and I need to be managed,"" Ari said. ""I'm definitely a visionary when it comes to work, and so even from the lens of hiring a virtual assistant, I didn't just want a VA, I wanted someone that could also help manage projects that we had going on.""With a clear concept of what she needed, Ari was able to confidently move forward with bringing on her first team member. But as you'll notice, she wasn't just looking for an order taker and you shouldn't either. Instead, hire subject matter experts who can also serve as thought partners.The business outcomes from leveraging Fiverr BusinessAri said that there are more benefits to hiring someone to work on your business on your behalf than just revenue – of course scaling is part of the equation, but there's also quality of life to consider as an entrepreneur.You can be more present as a parent, friend, or spouse if part of your mind is freed up from extraneous tasks. With a larger team, you have even more minds and hours at your disposal, all of which can free up your time to work on things that fall within your Zone of Genius.


With TinyDocs, Sunny credits his creative team with their exciting growth over the last couple of years. As a team, they've created work that's been recognized by international film festivals and have quickly grown their presence on social media.Sunny says that you might be thinking you can figure it out on your own, but working with other people gives you the opportunity to see a different (sometimes better) way of doing things and enables both of you to work in your area of expertise.In my experience (which includes the pdf fiasco) you'll also avoid common mistakes and move much faster!Next steps:If you're ready to scale your business with vetted experts, here's my suggestion:Listen to the full episode belowJot down at least one project that you'd like to outsourceFind a vetted expert to complete your project on Fiverr Business

105,5 Soft Skills Every Employee Needs Today,"May 5, 2023",Cheri Beranek,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-5-soft-skills-of-every-good-employee/450518,"
In 2020, college graduates entering the workforce embarked into completely unexplored territory. We all did. A global health emergency challenged the nation to uproot the old ways of doing business to keep business alive, and we're still reeling from the aftershocks. In the process, we took what we created and moved on to something new.This next phase of work includes some degree of flexibility and a surge in digital communication, resulting in new challenges to building the strong company culture needed to keep and retain top employees. Now, record-level labor shortages are driving hiring managers to consider employees that demonstrate soft skills like communication and curiosity for opportunities in positions of leadership. According to the 2022 Job Market Outlook from ZipRecruiter, soft skills impact the hiring decisions for 93% of employers.Here are the top five soft skills employees need to get ahead today.



1. CommunicationWith watercooler moments now a relic of the past, leaders have realized how much being together in an office facilitated communication. In May 2022, 6.1 million job postings on ZipRecruiter listed ""communication skills"" as a requirement, and 45% of LinkedIn Premium job posts mentioned them as having significant importance. In the modern, more dispersed workplace, building culture and engaging employees has become harder than ever, and people skilled in maintaining fluid, open and honest communication are in high demand.Open and transparent communication between leadership and across teams promotes greater sharing of team knowledge. People learn to trust they have all the necessary tools, resources, and support to act with greater confidence and less fear, uncertainty, or doubt. When leaders model healthy communication, team members feel more comfortable approaching them for help and feedback. Employees with good communication skills are more engaged and feel empowered to make faster and more effective decisions.Related: Soft Skills are Critical Skills


2. Problem-solvingIn its next phase, the modern work environment has come with the need to identify and address problems at greater speed to stay competitive, both in the products or services we offer and within our organization. At the same time, increased digital interactions have made problems much less visible. The more people on a team proactively searching for issues through the unique perspective of their company role, the better the company's chances of finding more solutions.According to McKinsey research, companies began prioritizing soft skills in 2020, including leadership, critical thinking, and decision-making, all required to solve emerging problems in the face of greater uncertainty. Someone with problem-solving skills sees problems as opportunities for improvement. When leaders clearly communicate values and align their team, problem-solving team members act with more autonomy and speed, using these values and organizational objectives as a guide. Problem-solving employees are engaged employees who are more likely to stay on a team.3. CreativityThe shift to digital has made it easier for more competitors to enter a market, and the emergence of AI has made constant innovation a critical component of staying competitive. In 2020, the World Economic Forum predicted ""creativity, originality, and initiative"" would be among the top five in-demand skills by 2025. A 2023 Deloitte survey of executives found that brand respondents who were fully committed to encouraging creativity to flourish were likelier to lead high-growth companies.Creative people stay curious and ask questions from others to learn from their insights and experiences and build upon their own. They respond to uncertainty with curiosity and the desire to learn and understand the new situation so they can continue to find ways to improve. There are a million and one ways to do any job better, and creative people explore as many of those ways as possible. Before starting a project, they brainstorm potential problems and devise ways to handle them before they happen.

AdaptabilityEmployees and consumers have higher expectations for employers and their companies, and staying open and adaptable to those changing demands has become critical. People with creativity and communication skills are also more likely to be adaptable. Willing to stay open to regular feedback and examining their areas for improvement, adaptable people can turn on a dime in the face of a new dynamic. They seek out what they need to continue to produce their best efforts and speak up to request the needed tools or training to get them there.In a 2020 Harris Poll survey, 75% of companies said soft skills were more valuable than ever, and adaptability was among their top three. Adaptable leaders build relationships with each team member to gain insight into their strengths, shift responsibilities as needed, and use more of their team's full range of talent. They model adaptability by engaging team members with questions about how leadership can improve their ability to do their job and better serve clients. Then, they take action by creating solutions and implementing changes.5. EmpathyThe pandemic and its aftermath caused devastating effects on our mental well-being. According to data spanning from 2019 to 2021, 73% of Americans believed more empathy would improve society, and a 2021 EY consulting survey found that 90% of employed Americans feel empathetic leadership is critical for employee satisfaction; 79% believe it reduces employee churn. According to McKinsey survey respondents, the number of companies addressing interpersonal and empathy skills in 2021 had doubled since the previous year.


Empathetic people facilitate communication, social gatherings, and relationship building for long-term company gains. They listen to team members and get to know their lives and their family. When everyone knows one another deeper, they feel more confident sharing ideas, resulting in more teamwork and greater innovation. By understanding the feelings of their team members, empathetic people can be more responsive to their communication styles and draw out the most productive contributions.Related: Why Prioritizing Soft Skills in Hiring is Crucial to The Modern WorkplaceFor people with communication and problem-solving skills, creativity, adaptability, and empathy, the changing workplace landscape can be an advantage. Bolstering soft skills through training can help build your resume and secure a job with more responsibility, learning opportunities, and higher pay, building the foundation for a more successful career.

106,Business Owners Beware — Is Your Contractor Really an Employee? Here's Why a Misclassification Can Be Costly.,"May 3, 2023",Doreen (Clark) Pierce,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/employers-beware-is-your-contractor-really-an-employee/449892,"
The past few years have seen a complete shakeup for both organizations and workers alike. Though contractors have consistently been used to fill a temporary need, the recent transition from in-office to a remote workforce has made organizations rethink their hiring processes and, in turn, has spearheaded the era of the freelancer. Today, contractors are commonplace, they are filling roles across all levels of an organization, from startup to global. Not only are they thriving, but they are consciously making the choice to be independent — but the real question is are they being treated that way?It is clear that organizations can benefit from taking on freelancers, however, it is the organization's responsibility to have a clear understanding of the difference between an employee and a contractor, as the risk, if a misclassification should occur, can be steep. Simply calling a contractor a contractor is not enough. In this case, actions speak louder than words:Related: What You Need to Know Before Hiring Independent Contractors

107,7 Interview Questions to Build Positivity in the Workplace,"May 2, 2023",Josiah Grimes,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/7-interview-questions-to-build-a-positive-work-culture/450074,"
Creating a positive culture is more than putting a ping-pong table in the break room or free snacks.It's also about hiring positive, motivated employees who share your company's values and are committed to making a difference.It's always good to remember, while the look of your office shows how much you care, the people that are in that building make your company what it is.That is where the interview process and the questions come in:1. Who is your favorite person that you have ever worked with or for?You'll have a couple of answers: One person will say this person was their favorite because they were best friends, they can talk about anything and would always laugh. That shows me that this person's number one focus is not growth — meaning head down and getting to work.



An answer like, ""My first boss was so strict, and at first, I hated him. Two years in, I realized I learned so much and he helped me be so much better in my job and as a professional.""That person gets that if they sew in hard work they are going to reap success. If someone gives them critical feedback, it will help them grow.I want that person.Related: 3 Interview Questions To Help You Hire The Right People


2. Who is your least favorite?I don't care about the least favorite person, I care WHY. This shows me what kind of management style the candidate doesn't work well with.Say the reason was that they brought their boss this idea they worked on for weeks, and all their boss said was ""thank you,"" but they think they didn't respect their opinions.It is likely their boss respects their opinions, even on an average level.This shows they are probably wearing a lens that makes them think people generally disrespect their opinions. So, if I hire them, I have to fight with this person's ghosts and do extra to make them know I respected their idea.


3. Where do you get your moral code or compass from?The way people ground themselves is mercurial.When someone says they are their own moral compass, they have no concrete thing they ground themselves in and will get blown in the wind.You want the source to be really good — a parental figure, a historical figure, an institution, etc.This way you know they hold themselves to a standard and you don't have to manage their moralities.


4. If you get to the end of your life and look back at the time between now and then, what will make you say, ""I did it!""?I want to see if their desires line up with the company — their desires beyond personal goals, what they want to accomplish and where they see themselves in five years.It helps me know that we are aligned and a qualified organization for what they want to do and achieve.If it makes sense, then they will see your company as a bridge to help get to their goals.This is the most integrity-focused and integrous part of the vetting process, too, because you can also see if the company is a good fit for the individual.Related: 3 Ways to Establish a Positive Company Culture5. Name everything you can do with a brick.This is the best test — those with a higher IQ would, on average, be able to give 12 or more creative answers in five minutes. If they give less than six in five minutes, then it is indicative of lower fluid IQ and less creativity, and it also indicates that they will struggle to come up with solutions to complex, nuanced problems.This test does not tell everything about IQ or anything like that, but you do get an inkling.For example, a marketer will give more creative, longer, paragraph-style answers as opposed to an operator who would give a lot of answers, but brief two-word ones.


Someone with creative answers would not be able to follow set patterns, as opposed to the operator's logical answers.6. If you were going to give a training on __, what would the outline be?I prefer this question over asking questions like, ""How much experience do you have in ___?"" or ""How good are you at ___?""You don't want their opinion on their knowledge, and you don't want them to tell you what they're good at. You want them to display knowledge.By asking the candidate to teach you about the position they are applying for, you will be able to see how teachable they are, where they got their knowledge from and how much they know.


You want to also know if they know more than you. You never know what you might be able to learn.7. What is something that you have learned about __ that most people in the industry don't know?I want to know, again, where on their timeline of learning they are. There are three levels to this:The formative level: Where you accept what anybody tells you about anything.The medium level: ""Oh! I have learned something on my own, and I now have my own rules.""The final level: Where you are judging and where it can be dangerous to a degree. You take everything from the first two and apply it further.You are asking for them to demonstrate if they are at that third level and if they are at that level of fidelity in their knowledge.Related: 11 Crucial Interview Questions to Ensure a Culture FitTo promote a positive culture, you want to know how much your candidates care about the role and the company.


For example, a candidate coming to an interview in a suit, a notebook and their resume — even though the company is very casual — shows they care about you, the role and the company.It's more than giving water and comfy chairs. It's also about creating a work environment that fosters collaboration, innovation and growth. This starts with the people — people make the company, not the other way around.

108,Hiring Offshore Talent? Here Are the Top 10 Countries to Recruit From.,"Apr 27, 2023",Wei Hsu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/top-10-countries-for-hiring-offshore-talent/449688,"
In an increasingly interconnected global economy, the recruitment of top-tier talent is no longer constrained by geographical boundaries. Many of the world's largest corporations routinely leverage international labor markets to source both local and remote employees.A truly worldwide business can benefit from globalizing nearly every facet of its operations, including HR, sales, marketing and development. Whether seeking a robust local talent pool for a new international subsidiary or a remote team for a global office, hiring globally opens a world of options: a larger, more diverse labor pool, combined with the efficiencies of remote work.Professional employer organizations (PEOs) can prove valuable partners for overseas expansion, guiding companies every step of the way in bringing on the right talent to match growth needs, regardless of location.



And these days, that talent is coming nearly from every corner of the world. Based on conversations with our clients, there are three common crucial organizational functions that companies prioritize when sourcing globally.Related: Recruiters Are Struggling To Meet Unprecedented Demand. Can Tapping Global Talent Be the Answer?


Technology professionalsIn a time when your competitors are modernizing their tech stack and investing in talent to support growth, hiring strategically is paramount to success. Sure, you can tap into the local talent pool at home, but you might be overlooking some of the world's best techies elsewhere around the globe.For instance, according to a HackerRank competition, China was found to have the most talented programmers around the globe. Chinese developers routinely excel at programming and data structures challenges and are prime candidates for companies on the lookout for the best tech talent.Countries like Russia, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Japan and Taiwan also featured in the top 10 according to their performance across several HackerRank challenges. Besides the top performers, Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea can also be considered when scouting for top-tier international developers.In addition to these countries, businesses are also tapping into technical talent hubs like India and the Philippines which are widely recognized for their IT talent, English-speaking population and high percentage of STEM graduates.


Seasoned managersAnother function that's crucial to sound and bold leadership is middle and upper management. Both require capable, experienced people to lead the company's strategy and tactics.Project managers are also responsible for leading the technical team and ensuring projects get completed on time and within budget. According to a PMI Salary Survey, some of the highest median salaries for project managers are seen in Switzerland, Australia and the US, followed by countries like Germany, Netherlands, UAE, Qatar and the UK. Consequently, these are the countries offering the best of the best in terms of project management talent in the world.Countries you can consider for hiring project managers more economically include Colombia, the Philippines, Mexico, Taiwan and China. According to the PMI Salary Survey, you can hire project managers from around $29,000 to $35,000 per year from these locations.Related: 4 Tips for Hiring Employees No Matter Where They're Located


Human resources teamThe need for skilled and experienced HR professionals is snowballing, with employee well-being and engagement fast climbing the list of what employees value the most. If your business is expanding into an unfamiliar international market, this becomes even more essential as different cultures and workplace styles come into the picture.Even if you aren't expanding globally, retaining your employees will require a combination of HR expertise and innovative HR practices.As the ""Great Resignation"" continues across the U.S. and Europe, these regions might not be the most suitable for hiring HR professionals. You can instead source from China, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam. With the majority of the world suffering from a retention crisis, HR professionals have their work cut out for them.Hire globally and stay ahead of the competitionBusinesses need to move fast to recruit leading talent around the world if they hope to stay competitive. With people around the world contemplating quitting their jobs, the labor market is buzzing and constantly evolving. A potent mix of rock-solid technical talent, experienced project managers and superior HR professionals is essential to both growing business at home and expanding globally.


If you've begun your hiring journey, you might want to focus on expanding your search outside your home country. Take stock of countries producing candidates excelling in a particular skill set and how they can work with your business needs. Asia Pacific and Latin America are currently emerging as hotspots for some of the world's best technical and non-technical talent.Hiring global talent is an exciting but tricky proposition. A variety of challenges — lack of knowledge of the local labor market and outdated information on local laws and regulations — can delay your expansion plans. Partners like INS Global can help you develop a strategic approach, find the right candidates regardless of location, onboard them to your company and streamline the process for you, end-to-end.Related: 5 Things to Remember When Hiring International Employees
