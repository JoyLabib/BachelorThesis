0,How Close Is AI to Actually Stealing Your Dream Job?,"Apr 22, 2024",Ariel Shapira,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-close-is-ai-to-actually-stealing-my-job/472672,"
Consider you're a busy parent looking for ways to simplify your life. Putting your weekly schedule or grocery list into a generative AI chatbot like ChatGPT could be a saving grace, assisting in tasks like weekly meal planning or even helping your child with homework. This kind of automation via generative AI shows how it can be beneficial in streamlining a person's daily tasks and managing their affairs.But how dangerous is AI for the future of work?There has been a long-standing fear that machines will eventually replace human professions, alarming workers about the future of employment. Reports suggest that up to 300 million jobs could be replaced by AI, generating looming uncertainty over workforce dynamics and automation.



So, every working person's question is: Will AI take away my dream job? In short, the answer is likely yes, but it depends on what your dream job entails.However, it is worth highlighting the positive ways AI augments certain workforces. In high-stress or tedious positions, automation can enable workers to focus on more meaningful and high-value activities while relieving some job-related burdens.


While it's undeniable that AI will continue to reshape industries, there is substantial reason to believe it won't take over every job. Yes, AI does offer capabilities that lend a hand to productivity. However, its abilities have inherent limitations, especially falling short when replicating human intuition, empathy, and creativity.We also can't ignore that AI is limited to the information it's trained on. OpenAI touts ChatGPT's ability to pass numerous standardized tests, but did the model genuinely understand the tests, or was it just trained to reproduce the correct answers? AI machines are designed to ""think within the box,"" meaning that they can only function within the parameters of their given data, lacking a true creative or analytical nature that many professions require.Related: AI Is Taking Over These Freelancing Jobs the Most: ReportAI's thinking gapAI has been a game-changer for law by automating repetitive tasks, but integrating these technologies comes with challenges. The Law Society of British Columbia, for example, has warned lawyers about using AI automation to prepare legal documents, highlighting the potential ethical implications, biases, and glaring inaccuracies in materials produced by AI.


Likewise, the world of architecture is no stranger to technological advancements, with architects always looking for ways to harness innovation to improve their designs. But when AI tools can generate blueprints with relative ease, the fear of architects becoming redundant remains. While an AI model can create and analyze design options or predict how people can use a space, it cannot replace the vision and intuition an architect brings to their craft.Healthcare is another domain where complexities of human emotions and behaviors necessitate the expertise of trained professionals who offer empathy and deep understanding. AI can undoubtedly assist with administrative tasks like analyzing data or offering high-level insights, but it lacks the essential human qualities needed for effective counseling.AI enthusiasts in healthcare have long envisioned a future where doctors are aided by sophisticated algorithms, providing valuable suggestions to enhance patient care. However, despite a high level of optimism about physicians benefitting from AI, regulatory uncertainty and concerns about patient experience have slowed adoption. A recent study found that ChatGPT has a more than 80% diagnostic error rate when using AI in pediatric case diagnosis â€” an unacceptable figure that indicates no doctor could ever rely on its output now. But could the pieces of this puzzle come together to build physician and public confidence in AI?Related: Report: AI Will Take More Jobs Away from Women Than Men


Building trust with automationWhile successful AI implementation will likely positively impact patient outcomes, the consequences of errors would be severe. Even if a physician doesn't take a potentially harmful AI suggestion at face value, they will end up spending valuable time and resources rectifying the inaccuracies.AI's opaque decision-making processes also pose challenges for clinicians who cannot understand the rationale behind automated recommendations. This lack of transparency not only undermines trust in AI systems but complicates the process of integrating them into current healthcare infrastructures.That being said, some startups are working to make AI accountable in the field by rooting it in reality. Kahun, for instance, developed an evidence-based clinical reasoning engine for doctors that provides clinical decision support using explainable AI. It reasons like a physician and allows transparency in its output by providing evidence-based clinical insights cited in peer-reviewed medical literature alongside patient-specific information.Datapeople is another example of an AI-assisted tool designed to support professionals in the workforce. This program assists hiring teams in making recruitment decisions grounded in scientific principles and fairness.


Suppose professionals embraced the benefits of AI rather than fearing its encroachment on their jobs. In that case, they may be more inclined to integrate these tools into their practice, leading to potential improvements in the quality and efficiency of their work.Of course, not all jobs are safe from AI. But the truth is that many roles will always require human intervention, particularly those involving decision-making, emotional intelligence, and creativity. However, combining AI's strengths with human capabilities allows for an intertwined approach to problem-solving and innovation. By leveraging AI's efficiency with human intuition, we can continue to use automation to optimize tasks and address complex challenges more effectively.

4,6 Ways to Manage Your Email List Like a Pro,"Apr 15, 2024",Liviu Tanase,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/6-ways-to-manage-your-email-list-like-a-pro/470903,"
Savvy entrepreneurs recognize the enduring power of email marketing. With an ROI of up to $45 for every dollar spent, it helps businesses boost both customer loyalty and sales. But simply sending emails isn't enough. Companies seeing a high email ROI have one thing in common: a carefully crafted and maintained list.Because, while investing in email list growth is smart, to be sure, adding more contacts to a database is just the beginning. You also have to nurture, maintain and prune the community you've gathered.For outreaches to persuade and convert, they have to arrive where your subscribers can see them. Getting in the habit of managing your list is the first step to avoiding the spam folder and reliably landing in inboxes. Keeping yours healthy also influences your sender reputation, which is a score every email sender develops over time.



A few factors that affect your reputation:â€¢ Too many bounces: Inbox providers see this as an indicator of spam, as spammers tend to send to as many addresses as possible, even invalid ones. A bounce rate of 2% puts your emails at risk of going to spam.


â€¢ Spam complaints: Email providers take this type of user feedback seriously. If your content bothers people, it belongs in the junk folder. A complaint rate higher than 0.1% is risky.â€¢ Overall engagement rates: Poor open and click rates show that an audience has little interest, and can be reason enough for emails to start missing the inbox.Clearly then, managing your list the right way will help boost your reputation with email providers. Here's how to do that, and so see consistent ROI from newsletters and campaigns.Related: How to Grow an Email List You Can Monetize


1. Remove risky data religiouslyWith bounces counting so much toward sender reputation, you must ensure sends are going to valid addresses. On average, at least 23% of email lists become invalid/ineffective with each passing year, so removing such contacts is a must. A capable verification service will weed out invalid and risky addresses and also help you comply with basic deliverability rules.2. Eliminate invalid and/or fake dataVerifying your email list every quarter allows you to prune data that has decayed, and helps avoid gathering yet more of poor-quality. To keep fake and invalid sign-ups at bay, make sure each subscriber confirms that they want to receive from you (consider using double opt-in â€” requiring each person to click a subscription confirmation link). It's also good to protect sign-up forms with a real-time email verifier, which will reject misspelled and fake addresses and so prevent them from spoiling your database.Related: 4 Ways to Stop Your Emails From Going to Spam3. Say goodbye to unengaged prospectsIt's hard to part with subscribers you've worked so hard to earn, but if they don't open your emails for more than six months, they must go. Some companies are even more drastic about pruning unengaged contacts and do it every three months. Whatever your approach, analyze metrics regularly and filter out dormant subscribers at least twice a year. Unopened emails affect your reputation and email marketing ROI.


4. Keep spam reports lowPaying attention to spam reports has always been important, but ever since Google and Yahoo enforced new sending guidelines, maintaining a low complaint rate is an absolute must. Email providers know that even legitimate senders can get spam reports, but rethink your strategy if you get more than one complaint per 1,000 emails. Also, never again email a subscriber who has reported you.Related: How to avoid email spam complaints5. Organize subscribers into segmentsAre you sending the same message to an entire email list? That may work if you have a small business and only communicate general offers, but if your company is growing and you want to take your marketing to the next level, segment your list based on demographics and purchase behaviors. 57% percent of marketers attest that personalization helps them achieve better email engagement.6. Monitor and analyze metricsMeasuring your results regularly is a way of boosting any campaign's chance of success. Which emails perform best? Your subscribers' reactions will tell you. Aside from open rates, keep a close eye on click-through metrics to learn what offers and calls-to-action engage. Also, if any of your emails get a high unsubscribe rate, try to find the cause in order to better retain an audience. And, though often overlooked, reply rates likewise play a positive role in email deliverability.


In all approaches, make an effort to understand what type of content prompts people to write you back, and double down on that positivity!Related: 5 Simple Tweaks for Better Email Deliverability

Have you ever wondered how your favorite local spots seem to know exactly what you're craving or what book you'd love to read next? This isn't luck â€” it's the power of artificial intelligence (AI) at work. The digital era has ushered in a revolutionary shift, particularly for small businesses, enabling them to leverage AI for unparalleled personalization and engagement.Consider the local coffee shop that now knows to send a comforting note with a discount on your preferred latte during dreary Monday mornings or the family-owned bookstore that introduces you to your next favorite author, all based on your previous interactions. This level of personalization transcends traditional marketing, turning every customer interaction into an opportunity for connection.Related: Beware the Duplicity of OpenAI â€” 4 Strategies to Safeguard Your Brand in the Age of AI



Personalization with AIPersonalization is at the core of AI's transformative promise for small business marketing. It's about going beyond the one-size-fits-all approach, delivering experiences that resonate deeply with each customer. For instance, a boutique pet store might implement AI to remember not just purchase histories but significant dates for each pet, sending out personalized reminders and offers that perfectly coincide with these moments. This strategy transforms routine transactions into meaningful exchanges, fostering a sense of community among customers.By tapping into AI's potential, businesses not only survive in a competitive landscape but thrive, crafting experiences that convert customers into loyal advocates for the brand.


Building trust through transparency and the ethical use of AITrust is not just built on promises but on consistent, transparent actions. Small businesses leveraging AI have a unique opportunity to lead with transparency, setting a new standard in customer relations. Imagine a local health food store that uses AI to customize nutritional recommendations for its customers. By openly sharing how they use customer data to improve health outcomes and ensuring robust data protection measures, they deepen trust. This transparency transforms AI from a behind-the-scenes algorithm to a tangible benefit in customers' eyes.Many big brands, such as Amazon Fresh, have already made suggestions based on our previous shopping experiences. Small businesses, however, have the advantage of adopting new technologies quickly. The real opportunity for entrepreneurs comes from iterating technologies that improve their customers' experience â€” and they learn which are best by A/B testing quickly and efficiently.Related: How AI Can Help Small Businesses Do More in Less TimeLeveraging AI for enhanced customer engagementEngagement in the AI era transcends traditional marketing, turning every interaction into an opportunity for connection. A boutique gardening store, for example, uses AI to suggest plants and gardening tools based on the season and the customer's purchase history. Such personalized interactions do more than drive sales; they cultivate a community of gardening enthusiasts who feel seen and understood. Through AI, businesses can create a virtuous cycle of engagement, where each personalized recommendation strengthens the bond with their customers.


Customer experiences with AIInnovation through AI isn't just about automating processes; it's about redefining the customer experience. Small businesses can use AI to create interactive, immersive experiences that captivate customers. For instance, a small fashion retailer could use virtual try-on AI technology, allowing customers to see how clothes look on them through an app before making a purchase. This innovative use of AI enhances the shopping experience and bridges the gap between online and physical retail, offering personalized engagement that customers cherish.Related: How Small and Mid-Sized Businesses Can Leverage AI to Compete With Large CompaniesFostering a culture of continuous AI adoptionThe key to successful AI integration is fostering a culture open to continuous learning and adaptation. Small businesses thrive by staying nimble, and incorporating AI into their strategy should be an ongoing process, not a one-time effort. Encouraging a team mindset that values innovation and is not afraid to experiment with new AI applications can lead to discovering unique solutions that propel the business forward. Celebrating successes and learning from setbacks will create a resilient, AI-savvy organization.It's crucial to understand the impact AI has on the customer experience and the internal processes that power small businesses. Embracing AI technologies can streamline operations, from inventory management to customer service, freeing up valuable time for entrepreneurs to focus on strategic growth and innovation. This operational efficiency, paired with previously discussed enhanced customer engagement strategies, sets a solid foundation for small businesses to meet and exceed modern consumer expectations. In this era of rapid technological advancement, the integration of AI allows small businesses to remain competitive, agile and forward-thinking, ready to adapt to the ever-changing market landscape and consumer behavior patterns.


As the digital landscape evolves, so will the opportunities for small businesses to leverage AI. This promises an exciting future where technology and human creativity combine to create unparalleled customer experiences. The journey into AI-driven marketing is not without its challenges, but the rewards are boundless for those willing to embark on it.

20,This Data Security Consultant Explains Why Businesses Should Embrace Web3 â€” But Do It Cautiously,"Mar 6, 2024",Ralph Tkatchuk,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/businesses-should-embrace-web3-but-do-it-cautiously/469900,"
After much initial skepticism and doubt, Web3 has emerged as a real source of value, paving the way for a new generation of decentralized applications (dApps) built on blockchain. These dApps provide fantastic opportunities for forward-thinking companies to transform their business operations and enhance their efficiency.A 2023 survey of 600 enterprise decision-makers in the U.S., U.K. and China found that nearly 90% of them deploy blockchain technology in some capacity, with 87% saying they planned to invest in blockchain in the next year. This reflects businesses' fear of being left behind as blockchain developments accelerate globally. According to Deloitte, 73% of financial executives believe their organization will lose an opportunity for competitive advantage if they don't adopt blockchain and digital assets.Advocates of Web3 laud the decentralized web's greater resilience and security compared to its predecessor, as blockchain ensures that every transaction is public and verifiable, improving record-keeping and data integrity.



However, despite the promise of blockchain's greater security, the increasing adoption of Web3 technologies has not eradicated security risks, merely changed them: The 2023 Web3 Security Landscape report by Salus shows that cyberattacks on the Web3 industry resulted in losses in excess of $1.7 billion last year, highlighting the extensive range of threats within the decentralized world.Related: Confused About Web3? Steve Aoki Dissects His Business to Show How You Can Make Money.


New security challengesWeb3 avoids some of the security headaches of Web 2.0 but introduces several new ones, almost all unique to the industry.Some of the biggest attacks of the year included the $200 million attack on the cloud-based blockchain services provider Mixin Network; the $197 million attack on Euler Finance; the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group attack on both the Poloniex cryptocurrency exchange and Atomic Waller, stealing more than $126 million from the former and more than $100 million from the latter.The majority of Web2 attacks target users. Most threats faced by the Web3 industry, however, take advantage of code vulnerabilities of decentralized applications and protocols. Access control issues accounted for 39% of all Web3 attacks, whereas flash loan protocols, where flash loans are used to maximize the impact of another form of attack like the exploitation of smart contract bugs or the manipulation of cryptocurrency asset prices on an exchange, contributed to more than 16% of attacks.User-targeted attacks, as mentioned, are ""less popular"" in Web3. Phishing attacks, which use social engineering tricks to manipulate unsuspecting users into exposing data, spreading malware infections or giving access to restricted systems accounted for a mere 4% of all attacks.


Besides software vulnerabilities, retail investors continue to fall for exit scams and ""rugpulls:"" fraudulent crypto projects that convince the community to back them before fleeing with the funds they've raised.Mitigation is possibleReassuringly, there are concrete steps that businesses can take to reduce the likelihood of falling victim to each of these threats. With appropriate caution and due diligence, there is no reason to pass up the many potential benefits of Web3.Related: 5 Essential Tips for Starting a Successful Web 3.0 VentureEnhance authenticationIntroducing more robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, like decentralized identifiers (DIDs), access tokens or biometric and multi-factor authentication, will mitigate many security threats such as access control-based vulnerabilities and phishing attacks. Companies should make sure they always adhere to the principle of least privilege, a crucial step for remaining secure online across both Web2 and Web3.


Increase complexityAs in real life, cyber attackers like to get in and out quickly to avoid detection, so increasing the complexity of participation in Web3 projects will make attacks less likely. DeFi protocols offering flash loans can safeguard themselves against threats by introducing minimum borrowing amounts and time limits, as well as additional fees to raise the costs for attackers. In a similar vein, attacks on oracles can be reduced in a number of ways, such as by avoiding the use of markets with shallow liquidity for price predictions, and by increasing manipulation costs for attackers through the use of TWAP (time-weighted average price) mechanisms.Hardware wallets â€” the use of physical technology to store private cryptographic keys online until they are needed â€” can also help to avoid hacks. Short of physically stealing the hardware wallet itself, which resembles a USB drive, they are virtually impossible for cybercriminals to access.Implement checksAs with Web2, businesses should regularly update their access permissions to avoid chinks in their security armor. In addition, they should conduct thorough audits of all smart contract code, as this often falls prey to re-entry vulnerabilities. They should also adhere to the check-effect-interaction model.Perform due diligenceOrganizations can employ penetration testing to find and exploit their own vulnerabilities before attackers do. Extensive employee education is also crucial to enable individuals to identify and avoid phishing attacks and other threats.


Finally, make sure to research new projects and their teams carefully to ensure that they have a reliable track record, thus avoiding falling victim to rugpull scams. Prioritize projects that have undergone transparent security assessments by reputable auditors.Related: How to Own Your Online Narrative â€” Even When the Internet Owns YouEmbrace Web3, but do it cautiouslyThe high exposure to scams in Web3 is one of the major obstacles preventing mass adoption of decentralized technologies. However, though the amount of total losses in 2023 was very high, it was lower than the number for 2022. This suggests that the landscape's overall safety is improving, as more companies adopt the necessary precautionary measures.As Salus points out, $1.7 billion in losses is still an alarming number, and one that emphasizes the importance of improving security and educating users about the risks of Web3. The inherent vulnerabilities of the technology are distributed across multiple areas, demanding a multi-pronged approach to security, which can be enhanced by prioritizing those platforms and protocols that implement the strongest security measures.


My main takeaway from the report is that businesses need not shy away from embracing Web3 and all of the potential it offers. However, their adoption of the technology should be accompanied by extensive checks and research, and adherence to the same strict standards of security as they employ in their legacy technology systems.

21,Cyber Threats Are More Prevalent Than Ever â€” So Don't Leave Your Business Exposed. Here's How to Protect It.,"Mar 3, 2024",Randy Sadler,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-to-avoid-leaving-your-business-exposed-to-cyber-threats/469667,"
In the ever-evolving business landscape, a focus on risk management cannot be overstated. However, with the rapid pace of innovation, the rise of cyber threats, regulatory ambiguity and geopolitical complexities, the traditional one-size-fits-all approach to risk management is no longer sufficient. Today, businesses require a bespoke strategy that is tailored to their specific needs and challenges.Why protecting against risks is more complex than everThe modern business environment is characterized by rapid innovation and technological advancements. While these developments offer numerous opportunities for growth and expansion, they also bring a host of new risks. From data breaches to intellectual property theft, businesses are increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats posed by sophisticated and malicious actors.Furthermore, geopolitical tensions and political discord add another layer of complexity to the risk landscape. Supply chain disruptions caused by global conflicts can have far-reaching consequences for businesses, highlighting the interconnectedness of the global economy. Additionally, in a political year such as 2024, experts agree businesses face heightened risks due to uncertainty surrounding regulatory policies and government interventions.



Related: Cyber Attacks Are On the Rise â€” Here's How Your Business Can Continuously Prepare for ThreatsA bespoke approach to risk management is necessary â€” here's whyTraditional risk management frameworks often fail to adequately address the unique challenges faced by modern businesses. Utilizing standardized insurance policies or crisis response plans may provide a false sense of security, as these generic solutions do not consider the specific operational context and risk profile of each organization.


Let's use a private medical practice as an example. In today's regulatory environment, remaining compliant with heightened and evolving regulations is harder than ever â€” particularly with HIPPA compliance in today's challenging cybersecurity landscape. If a private medical practice is hit with a ransomware attack that impacts patient data, it's unlikely traditional insurance or business interruption insurance, that are typically tied to physical damage, would cover the fallout. Also, a ransomware attack sets off a chain of negative impacts such as reputation damage, operational disruption, fines and the cost of an investigation. This is where a traditional business insurance policy would fall short on protection and a more specialized policy is necessary to cover the losses.A bespoke approach to risk management recognizes that every business is unique and requires a customized strategy to effectively mitigate risks. This approach involves conducting a comprehensive risk assessment to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities specific to the organization. By understanding the individual risk landscape, businesses can better prioritize resources and implement targeted risk mitigation measures.Related: 5 Trending Captive-Insurance Considerations for 2022How to tailor your protectionRisk assessment: Start by conducting a thorough assessment of your organization's risk profile. Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities across all areas of operation, including cybersecurity, supply chain management, regulatory compliance and geopolitical factors.Review insurance policies: Once risks have been identified, review your existing insurance policies to ensure they provide adequate coverage. Identify any gaps or areas where coverage may be insufficient based on the results of your risk assessment. Consider specialized insurance products tailored to specific risks, such as cyber insurance or political risk insurance.Develop a customized plan: Based on the findings of your risk assessment, develop a customized risk management plan that addresses the unique challenges facing your organization. This plan should outline specific mitigation strategies and contingency measures to minimize the impact of potential risks. Collaborate with key stakeholders across the organization to ensure buy-in and alignment with strategic objectives.Implement crisis management protocols: In addition to proactive risk mitigation measures, develop a comprehensive crisis management plan to guide your organization's response in the event of a major risk event. This plan should outline clear roles and responsibilities, communication protocols and escalation procedures to facilitate a swift and effective response.Related: Do You Have the Right Insurance for Your Business? Here's How to Understand Your Options


Using the example of the private medical practice, if this business had followed the above steps, it could have recognized a ransomware attack as a key risk, implemented heightened security measures and training and procured insurance policies tailored to address this threat. It also could have had a plan in place to address the aftermath, should it happen. Through this approach, the private practice would not only prevent significant losses that could potentially bankrupt the business, but it could even prevent the attack from coming to fruition in the first place. In this sense, a customized approach to risk management serves as not just the act of navigating risks, but as a financial strategy to strengthen the business and enable it to thrive.SummaryIn today's dynamic business environment, a tailored approach to risk management is essential for effectively navigating the complexities of the modern risk landscape. By conducting a comprehensive risk assessment, reviewing insurance policies and developing customized mitigation strategies, businesses can better protect themselves against the myriad of threats they face.

22,Why Blockchain Technology Hasn't Dominated the Supply Chain... Yet,"Feb 19, 2024",Asim Rais Siddiqui,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-blockchain-hasnt-dominated-the-supply-chain-yet/469395,"
Blockchain technology has garnered constant debate ever since its inception, and the interest does not look like it will die out anytime soon. A piece of technology that holds the power to revolutionize existing systems, with experts back in 2017 predicting that the transformative powers of blockchain will be the perfect fit for supply chain management.However, as we look at the supply chain landscape over the past couple of years, the results are very different from what was anticipated, and the question lingers â€” why hasn't blockchain taken over the supply chain yet?Let's go over why this is the case.Related: Disrupting Supply Chain With BlockchainThe promise of blockchain in supply chainImagine a supply chain where every step is recorded in a ledger that can't be altered and is accessible to all authorized parties. With this kind of transparency, businesses can expect to see a great reduction in fraud, improved efficiency, and streamlined operations.



With 2.8% of the world's population already on blockchain, the technology holds great potential for revolutionizing supply chains. Blockchain is a favorite among experts due to some of its core attributes. These include:DecentralizationA major reason for blockchain's popularity is its decentralized nature, a breath of fresh air from traditional hierarchical structures. Since the launch of Bitcoin, the world has been moving towards decentralization, and it could mean big things for the supply chain realm.Let's think about a network where all participants, from suppliers to manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, share equal authority, and no single entity holds disproportionate power. This balance of power may help cultivate trust among stakeholders, as each party can keep track of all transactions.Related: Decentralization Can Be Your Friend


TransparencyThe transparency that comes with blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize supply-chain networks. It ensures that every authorized party has access to the same real-time data, eradicating any data asymmetry.This may especially be crucial in industries where accountability is important, like the pharmaceutical industry, where drugs can be life-saving or life-threatening. Knowing the authenticity of medication and keeping track of its expiration can help hold the right people accountable in case something goes wrong. Not to mention that it also increases customer confidence in the product.UnchangeabilityAccording to the KPMG Global Fraud Survey, more than half of the frauds committed were aided by the business' own technology, with 24% of the frauds having used these technologies to create false or misleading information in accounting records.One of the biggest advantages blockchain brings to supply chains is the inability to alter or erase any data that has been recorded on the network. This means that records of transactions, shipments and certifications are permanently etched into the digital ledger, which brings a new level of integrity to the supply chain.


SecurityWith supply chain cyberattacks in the United States affecting 1743 entities in 2022 alone, security breaches and data leaks have been rampant in supply chains for years and are only on the rise. The security mechanisms of blockchain offer a potential solution to this extremely troubling problem.Within a blockchain, transactions are secured using cryptography, and once validated, they are linked to the previous transaction, creating an unbroken chain. This makes altering old records an extremely difficult task. Apart from that, the business data will be spread across the network instead of being stored in a single location, making any centralized data breaches futile.Related: How to Mitigate Cybersecurity Risks Associated With Supply Chain Partners and VendorsChallenges faced by blockchain in supply chainWhile blockchain technology in the supply chain shows incredible promise, the path to seamless integration is treacherous and fraught with Herculean challenges. Let's look at some of the challenges you might encounter:


1. Unfamiliarity with the chain. Understanding and successfully implementing blockchain is not everyone's cup of tea, especially if you're a supply chain professional accustomed to traditional systems. Blockchain consists of several technical intricacies, like consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, and cryptographic hashing, which require time and patience to learn. The learning curve can also be steep and often requires specialized training and expertise.2. Scalability issues. The lack of scalability is one of the biggest hurdles facing blockchains today. This is mainly due to the blockchain's consensus mechanism, which requires all participants in the network to agree on which transactions are valid. So the bigger the supply chain, the more difficult it will be to scale it with blockchain because, as transactions increase, the network's performance can degrade, leading to delays and congestion.3. Regulations and legal hurdles. The regulations and legalities that come with integrating blockchain can be daunting to many. There are many intricacies when it comes to data privacy and cross-border transactions in particular. The lack of knowledge available regarding these makes many business owners hesitate for fear that something might go wrong and they might encounter a legal pitfall instead.4. Costs and resources. I believe the most obvious reason why blockchain isn't as common in supply chains as people believed it would be is the heavy investment required to integrate it. Implementing and maintaining blockchain requires building the infrastructure for the chain, hiring blockchain experts, and incurring operational costs as well. This alone is enough to deter any small businesses considering investing in integrating blockchain into their supply chains.


Related: Mass Adoption of Blockchain Technology by Entrepreneurs? Major Challenges Are Involved.The future of blockchain in supply chainAlthough these challenges are unnerving enough to scare away many keen entrepreneurs, some solutions are emerging to address them. These hybrid solutions involve integration with IoT devices, AI algorithms, and cloud platforms to reduce scalability and complexity concerns, making blockchain integration less complex and more desirable.

27,"Data Privacy Matters to Your Customers â€” Show Them It's a Priority For You, Too. Here's How.","Feb 13, 2024",Mike Szczesny,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/consumers-demand-more-data-protection-can-you-deliver/468944,"
Consumers are not holding back when defending their data privacy rights. The increasing demand for greater digital mindfulness and brand protection presents an opportunity for your business.The only way to reap benefits is by investing in measures to gain and maintain the public's trust. A 2023 Deloitte survey found that ""67% of smartphone users worry about data security and privacy on their phones, and 62% of smart home users worry about the same on their smart home devices â€” up 13 and 10 percentage points, respectively, from 2022.""These numbers indicate that most consumers are aware that their digital lives could be hacked and are actively anxious about the possibility.



Understanding this, your business can help reassure customers and earn their loyalty by treating all incoming data as valuable. This will enable you to position your company competitively and stay at the forefront of data privacy regulations. Here are a few data privacy best practices to consider.Related: Why Data Privacy Is the Key to Building Consumer Trust in Marketing


1. Establish internal data privacy governance rules and processesIn addition to understanding the data privacy regulations that apply to your organization and sector, it is important to establish internal rules and processes. Having a set of guidelines ensures you take all necessary measures to protect your data from attacks. However, not all hacks and breaches originate from external sources. They come from internal sources such as employees, vendors and others who access your systems.According to a 2023 Insider Threat Report, nearly three-quarters of companies reported having internal data vulnerabilities. Your team's role is to identify vulnerability gaps and address them. For example, you might want to explore ways to provide restricted access to specific employees. Does every employee need access to all customer data? Probably not.Enhancing data visibility across your organization can reduce the risk of an insider hack. Plus, implementing strict measures is something you can highlight on your website to demonstrate to potential leads and customers that you are going the extra mile to safeguard the personal information they provide.2. Close remote work-related data privacy loopholesCompanies of all sizes have started to adopt remote and hybrid working. However, they have not necessarily aligned their data privacy practices with their work-from-anywhere arrangements for employees. The result? Many well-intentioned remote workers are putting their companies' data at risk.


When working on a device outside of your network, they may unintentionally expose data in numerous ways. For example, they may use public, unsecured WiFi or download private files onto a personal device. These everyday activities may seem inconsequential, but they open the door to cybercriminals. A Malwarebytes Labs report suggests that approximately 20% of all data breaches can be attributed to lax remote data privacy governance rules.This doesn't mean you should bring everyone back into the office. It simply means that you must pay special attention to the risks of having a remote or partially remote workforce. Some best practices that have worked for other companies include purchasing remote equipment for all remote workers, setting up a secure VPN for access to your systems and providing ongoing training in data privacy best practices. You may even want to consider presenting a quarterly award plaque and accompanying stipend to a remote team member who consistently follows the guidelines to emphasize your commitment to compliance and to reward those who adhere to the rules.Related: Redefining Customer Engagement in a World Where Data Privacy Reigns3. Develop a data breach response planThe last thing a leader wants is to experience a data breach event that impacts their customers. However, it's much worse if you have an event and are unsure what to do during the critical first few hours and days. Consequently, you'll want to collaborate with your marketing, PR and IT teams to develop a comprehensive data breach response plan. The plan will serve as a roadmap to ensure you respond quickly, responsibly and confidently after a data breach.


Your crisis management plan should include a strategy for announcing your data breach. Before making any announcements, ensure all vulnerabilities are closed and your data is secure. Then, speak with the authorities. It's crucial to adhere to all the necessary rules and expectations before sending out any notification letters to customers whose data may have been exposed to malicious actors.As of 2021, Venture Beat reported that approximately two-thirds of small businesses had not created any formal incident response document. Having a plan in place gives your company a fighting chance to appear professional and responsible in the event of a data threat. You'll avoid the helpless feeling of ""what do we do now?"" and have a better chance of retaining customers.Even if your company is in the startup phase, you cannot be too careful with your data. Consumers trust you when they provide their information. Ensure you do all you can to prevent it from being exposed.

29,3 Reasons to Increase Your Cybersecurity Protocols in 2024,"Feb 8, 2024",Sebastian Huelck,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-reasons-to-increase-your-cybersecurity-protocols-in-2024/468996,"
Cybersecurity is one of the biggest challenges facing businesses today. With the rise of technology and increasing connectivity, the threat of cyberattacks has become more prevalent than ever before. In fact, there are 2,220 cyber attacks each day, adding up to more than 800,000 attacks each year.That works out as a cyber attack every 39 seconds.The World Economic Forum has also highlighted the growing concern about cybersecurity, stating that cyberattacks are one of the top risks facing businesses in 2024. This was further emphasized at the recent Davos sessions, where experts discussed the need for stronger cybersecurity protocols to protect businesses and economies.



As the CEO of an 8-figure subsidiary of a publicly traded company, tec5USA, I understand the importance of prioritizing cybersecurity measures to protect our proprietary materials while growing our business. Cybersecurity is no longer just a concern for big corporations; small and medium-sized businesses are also at risk. Therefore, it is crucial for every business to have an effective cybersecurity strategy in place.In this article, I will discuss three key reasons why businesses should prioritize increasing their cybersecurity protocols in 2024.Related: Why Is Cybersecurity Important for Your Business? Neglecting It Could Be Your Downfall.1. Protect your business from costly data breachesAccording to Accenture, the average cost of a cyber attack for a business is $13 million. This includes not only the financial loss from theft or damage of assets but also the cost of downtime, lost productivity and recovery efforts. These costs can cripple a business, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises that may not have the resources to bounce back quickly from a cyber attack.Google Bard, an AI-generated tool, says cyber threats are increasing at an alarming rate. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, the global cost of cybercrime is expected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, a significant increase from $3 trillion in 2015.Furthermore, failure to protect sensitive customer data can result in legal ramifications and damage to your business's reputation. In today's digital age, customers are more aware of their privacy rights and expect businesses to handle their data securely. One data breach can lead to a loss of trust from customers and ultimately impact the bottom line. For our client in Silicon Valley dealing in semiconductor manufacturing, it is mandatory.


There is also the prospective litigation cost if you are found to have fallen short of the cybersecurity protocols set out by regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act). These regulations set out a number of potential penalties for businesses that fail to protect personal data, including fines of up to 4% of annual global turnover or â‚¬20 million, whichever is higher.Implementing ISO 27001, an internationally recognized standard for information security management systems (ISMS), plays a pivotal role in enhancing cybersecurity within enterprises. By providing a systematic framework for managing information security risks, ISO 27001 assists organizations in safeguarding sensitive data and mitigating potential cyber threats. Central to ISO 27001 is the implementation of a set of controls tailored to address specific security risks faced by the organization. These controls encompass various aspects of information security, including access control, encryption, incident management and business continuity planning.Through the adoption of ISO 27001 controls, enterprises establish robust mechanisms for protecting their information assets, ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability. By conducting comprehensive risk assessments and implementing appropriate controls, organizations can identify vulnerabilities, proactively address security gaps and strengthen their cybersecurity posture. ISO 27001 fosters a culture of continuous improvement, prompting organizations to regularly review and update their security measures in response to emerging threats and evolving business needs.It provides a competitive advantage by differentiating the organization as a trusted custodian of sensitive information. Furthermore, ISO 27001 facilitates compliance with regulatory requirements and legal obligations, reducing the risk of non-compliance penalties and reputational damage.2. Safeguard your intellectual propertyIn today's highly competitive market, intellectual property is one of the most valuable assets a business can possess. Without proper cybersecurity protocols in place, your company's sensitive data and trade secrets are at risk of being stolen or compromised by cybercriminals. This not only damages your competitive advantage but also puts the future success and growth of your business at stake.


Effective cybersecurity protocols are a prerequisite for high-tech customers in protecting data integrity, and generally for data protection. In our case, working with clients in law enforcement, if you deal with sensitive data, and if it's construction or high-tech devices related, you need to make sure there are no data leaks out to competition, but also any other areas in the world that might be interested in that technology and want to copy it.Implementing strong cybersecurity measures, such as firewalls, encryption and regular data backups, can help safeguard your intellectual property from cyber attacks. It also gives you a competitive edge by assuring customers and partners that their confidential information is safe.Related: Cyber Attacks Are On the Rise â€” Here's How Your Business Can Continuously Prepare for Threats3. Ensure business continuity during geopolitical unrestA cyber attack can bring your business operations to a halt, resulting in significant financial losses and reputational damage. In some cases, businesses may even have to shut down permanently due to the severity of a cyber attack. Therefore, having effective cybersecurity protocols in place is crucial for ensuring business continuity.


The rapid rise in ransomware attacks, where cybercriminals hold a company's data hostage until a ransom is paid, highlights the importance of being prepared for potential cybersecurity threats.If you look at the global or geopolitical situation, we have growing tension between the U.S. and China and two wars going on in Ukraine and the Middle East. Whenever wars are happening, there's an increasing amount of cyber warfare. So the amount of hack attacks, denial of service attacks, viruses and ransomware is growing.In that environment, it's almost a necessity to have any kind of quality assurance framework â€” such as a cybersecurity framework â€” in this case, protecting you from these threats. It's become far more vital because of that changing business environment and the growing global threats we have to deal with.Regularly updating and maintaining your cybersecurity measures can minimize the risk of successful cyber attacks and prevent disruptions to your business operations. This not only prevents potential financial losses but also protects your reputation and maintains customer trust.


Related: 4 Top Cyber Threats Entrepreneurs Need to Know About in 2024Cyber attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and hackers are always finding new ways to exploit vulnerabilities in systems. This is why it's essential to continuously update and improve cybersecurity protocols to stay ahead of emerging threats.It's predicted that there will be more than 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs worldwide in 2024. This means that businesses need to invest in training and hiring cybersecurity professionals to stay ahead of potential threats.As the CEO of tec5USA, I understand firsthand the importance of prioritizing cybersecurity protocols. By taking proactive measures to protect our business, we can continue to grow and scale without fear of falling victim to a cyber attack. As the threat landscape continues to evolve, it's crucial for businesses of all sizes to stay vigilant and prioritize cybersecurity in 2024 and beyond!

32,8 Trends Shaping the Future of Grid Energy,"Feb 2, 2024",Abe Issa,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/8-trends-to-watch-out-for-in-grid-energy/468703,"
For many, the future of energy seems so close yet too far away. That image is coming into view but is still blurry and distant for many. As a clean grid energy expert, the future is now. These technologies exist, and they're getting better every day. They will define what the energy grid and the homes and businesses of the next 50 to 100 years it supports will look like.For over 20 years, I've been working and leading in the energy-saving and home improvement industry. I've been learning and using my years of experience to educate people about green living for years. More recently, I've been working on the prototype for the home of the future in Denver, CO. Here are some of the energy trends and innovations I see as promising for energy-efficient homes of today and tomorrow.1. Grid analyticsGrids can now collect obscene amounts of data on how energy is used. It can track connected asset performance and identify equipment issues. It can identify trends associated with the time of year and weather patterns through predictive analytics to manage energy production, storage and distribution effectively.



Related: 5 Renewable Energy Sources To Look Out For in 2024 and Beyond2. Grid AIArtificial intelligence can use machine learning to adapt automatically to trends. Imagine a grid that ramps energy production up and down ideally to reduce wasted resources, driving energy efficiency up and, over time, the cost to manage energy down.


In the shorter term, grid AI switches between renewable and non-renewable energy sources. In the future, it can shift among renewable to reach the most eco-friendly and cost-effective mix based on environmental or other factors.3. Remote microgridsMicrogrids deliver hyper-local energy to rural locations. Rather than depending on a more extensive energy grid infrastructure with so many ways to fail between the grid and place, a microgrid produces and stores the energy where it's needed, using whichever renewables are most available.4. Suburban and urban microgridsToday, many microgrids are treated as backup systems for essential services like hospitals, critical data centers, or disaster relief command posts. But as the technology advances, we'll see many more communities using microgrids for everyday applications and even in more urban areas.This would mean localizing power to ""keep the lights on"" while staying connected to (but able to disconnect from) a larger grid. With the concern over the potential for strategic attacks on energy grids, decentralizing the grids is a promising solution.


Related: 6 Tips to Invest in Renewable Energy Now5. EV-supportive grid managementFossil fuel usage continues to be one of the biggest environmental threats. Electric vehicles can reduce our dependence. But problems exist. Charging thousands of EVs taxes older energy grids and makes owning an EV cost-prohibitive for the average family.Green energy grids can and are working with EV owners to solve these problems. Vehicle to Grid (V2G) technology allows EVs to return power to the grid when needed without inconveniencing the car owner. Furthermore, it starts charging the vehicle when demand drops, helping the grid balance more efficiently and preventing blackouts. Whether energy companies reduce rates during non-peak hours or provide specific discount incentives for EV owners using this technology, this system can significantly reduce EV ownership costs.6. Grid cybersecurityAs mentioned, centralized grids are increasingly at risk. While physical attacks are possible, cyber-attacks are much more likely. So, it's no surprise that grids get a makeover with tools like data encryptions, anomaly monitoring, and faster threat detection and response.


Related: Here's Why Solar Entrepreneurs Don't Go Off the Grid7. Longer and more energy storageWe've taken leaps and bounds in the energy storage sector. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has said storage capacity will double in 2024 and continue to increase, making the storage of renewable energy a more viable option in the longer term, further reducing dependence on non-renewable backups or supplementation. At the same time, the storage cost is declining as capacity increases and battery degradation decreases.8. The solar grid side hustleAs Kartik Menon pointed out in their recent article, improvements in grid analytics and connectivity have the potential to open up a new solar side hustle and regional energy collaboration. As sun-soaked homes generate more power than they can use or store during peak production, they need a marketplace to offload the excess and potentially pay for energy when production is low. This system could turn whole blocks into microgrids of neighbors sharing resources.Grid energy is essential to daily life. But the grids of tomorrow are going to look very different. More efficiency, decentralization, greater security, and AI-powered optimizations will help grids power through and deliver to their customers. We've already seen these technologies take shape today, but they still have a way to go. While there is undoubtedly more to be discovered and missing links to be revealed, we're on our way to the green-energy-powered world we want to see.

33,The Ultimate Guide to Conducting a Content Audit â€” Step-by-Step Process for Optimizing Your Website's Content,"Jan 23, 2024",Nikola Baldikov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-ultimate-guide-to-conducting-a-content-audit/468134,"
I've always believed that search engine optimization (SEO) is as much about looking forward as it is about looking back. What do I mean? Many people think that SEO is about creating and optimizing new content.However, it's equally about going back and revamping older content so it continues to perform well on search engine results pages (SERPs). This is where content audits are highly useful.If you want to understand content audits better, such as what they mean and how to conduct one, this article is for you. Keep reading to explore the power of content audits and how they can transform your SEO efforts.



Related: How to 'Spring Clean' Your Website With Content AuditingUnderstanding content auditsA content audit is a careful and in-depth analysis of previously published, or ""old,"" content that needs to be further optimized for improved search engine performance.


Why is it important for any business to conduct one? It's simple. A content audit is useful for:Boosting your rankingsIncreasing traffic to your websiteDriving conversions and engagementAssessing your blog's strengths and weaknessesGaining a better understanding of your audienceGiven this extensive list of benefits, it's clear that a content audit is an essential part of the SEO equation and should not be taken lightly.Conducting a content auditWhether you choose to perform a content audit once or twice a year, or perhaps more frequently, it's important to follow a sequence of steps to ensure the process is smooth and yields the results you're after.


Here's my five-step process to help you achieve your aims.Step 1: Identify your goalNot having a clear goal in mind is like shooting in the dark and expecting to hit your target. From experience, I'd say that the first step in any content audit should be to identify your goal. Goal identification will determine what you'd like to achieve. Remove or prune old content, optimize older articles for improved performance, drive conversions and engagement, boost rankings and traffic, etc.Step 2: Identify and remove ROT contentWith a clear goal in mind, you're ready for step two. This is where you spend a significant amount of time identifying and removing ROT â€” redundant, obsolete or trivial â€” content from your website. This will make it lighter and leaner and capable of offering your audience much more value. Once this ""pruning"" process begins, you're ready to move on to step three.Step 3: Evaluate your content inventoryStep three requires more complexity. You'll need to evaluate your remaining content inventory. It's a good idea to create a new spreadsheet that contains all the URLs on your site. Group these according to categories, such as product/service pages or articles from your blog.


Also, extract the keywords you're hoping to rank for with each piece of content and add these to your spreadsheet to help you determine if some articles' keywords need to be amalgamated into a single article or whether further optimization will be needed.Step 4: Analyze performanceIt's now time to evaluate the performance of each page of content. Some key metrics to monitor include the bounce rate and the amount of organic traffic you're generating, in addition to your SERP rankings. And when this (lengthy) process is complete, you're able to take actionable steps driven by data.Step 5: Identify areas for improvementThere are many reasons why a piece of content is underperforming. Keywords may be cannibalizing each other. Metadata may not be accurate. Your H2s and H3s could be flawed or poorly organized. Your content itself may be irrelevant or outdated. Looking at each of these criteria and making a concerted effort to improve them is a big must.Related: 5 Ways to Optimize Your Content for Better Google Rankings


Best practices for optimizing your contentBased on my experience in doing literally dozens if not hundreds of content audits, there are a few best practices I've picked up along the way, which I'd like to share with you.Use data to drive decisions: Don't approach your content audit in a haphazard way. Use data-driven insights from reliable tools to help drive your decision-making process.Update/remove underperforming content: Don't be afraid to prune or completely remove old content that is underperforming. This will create new space for growth.Focus on SEO and the user experience: Use SEO best practices and tactics to optimize your content both on-page and off-page. Your goal should always be to add value and boost your users' experience.Useful tools for conducting a content auditNext up, I'll share with you a few of the tools that are highly useful in conducting your content audit.Types of tools and templates available:Some of the tools available on the market are well known and for good reason. They're versatile, flexible and offer you insights at the click of a button. Examples of a few of these include: Ahrefs and the Ahrefs SEO plugin, Google Search Console and Google Analytics plus SEMrush.How to choose the right one:Your first instinct might be to go for the cheapest option. But that would be a mistake. What you should do instead is focus on the functionalities that each of these tools offers.Do they help you see which keywords your article ranked for? Do they show you bounce rates? Do they indicate how much traffic you're getting?


Remember: There's no one-size-fits-all approach. There's no single tool that is suitable for every business and every industry. That's why doing your research carefully is so important.Tips for effectively using them:Once you've chosen your tool, it's time to educate yourself on effectively using it. Make sure it offers you the right functionalities to track the right metrics. Going over a couple of tutorials and SEO tool best practices will help make your content audit work that much easier and smoother.Related: 7 Best SEO Tools to Help You Rank Higher in GoogleA case study of a successful content auditAs part of my work with one of my clients, Brosix, I noticed that one of our most important articles started losing positions and traffic on SERPs. That's when I decided to perform a content audit and made the following changes and updates to the article in question:


Improved titles and meta descriptionsRemoved unnecessary informationMade the article keyword richThe results? Traffic jumped from 3,657 to 5,138 in just two weeks.


Conducting a content audit for your website is not a luxury. It's an absolute must if you want to retain rankings, strong positions and good traffic. Sometimes, simple but concerted efforts that drive your content audit can lead to incredible results that are truly worth it. Don't let old content ""ROT."" Instead, update, refresh and renew where necessary to enjoy the incredible results.

34,The Dark Side of AI: 3 Security Predictions to Watch Out for in 2024,"Jan 23, 2024",Apu Pavithran,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-security-predictions-to-watch-out-for-in-2024/468193,"
As a fresh year unfolds, we stand once more on the brink of a year brimming with possibilities, opportunities and challenges. The advent of 2024, a leap year graced with an extra day, presents us with the responsibility of determining how we make the most of this additional time. The approaching year is expected to challenge organizations globally.Yet, those who adopt transformative technologies and innovative approaches will not merely endure but flourish amidst the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. Hence, let's delve into some of the pivotal trends within the realm of enterprise security that warrant close attention in 2024.1. The shift towards automationOver the course of the previous years, the incorporation of AI and ML technologies has become increasingly evident. As these technologies progress, the use of automation is becoming increasingly prevalent. A notable example is the use of AI and ML algorithms to automate threat detection, where vast amounts of data are analyzed to identify anomalies and predict potential attacks before they manifest. In addition, there is a growing sophistication in endpoint protection, with AI playing a crucial role in proactively isolating suspicious behavior and responding to real-time threats.



Furthermore, Apple's introduction of declarative device management last year shifted some responsibility for policy management and implementation to the devices themselves. This move places a strong emphasis on automation in the endpoint management industry. The integration of AI into endpoint management is deemed to lead to a scenario where endpoints autonomously troubleshoot and resolve software issues. Additionally, we can expect to see the use of AI to isolate malware to prevent its spread proactively. In addition to reducing equipment downtime, this also results in considerable cost savings. It's important, however, to recognize that there will be two sides to any technical breakthrough.2. The dark side of generative AIIn 2024, as more organizations embrace rapid experimentation, the risks and challenges accompanying it are also severe. The use of AI coding bots to write code was a huge deal in 2023. It became so popular that companies like Samsung had to ban ChatGPT in their offices. Unfortunately, many companies still write code using such LLMs to write code without checking for any security flaws.


Despite its prevalence, the use of large language models (LLMs) for code generation has raised concerns about the integrity of the generated code. Many companies, in their pursuit of agility, deploy AI-generated code without meticulous scrutiny for potential security flaws. This approach introduces a palpable risk, as these codes may harbor inherent vulnerabilities or dependencies susceptible to exploitation, paving the way for data breaches with potentially severe consequences.Related: 4 Reasons Why Most Entrepreneurs Still Hesitate to Use ChatGPTFurthermore, as AI continues to develop, it has become a valuable asset in the hands of cybercriminals. The year 2024 is poised to witness a surge in AI-driven attacks, with attackers leveraging the technology to craft hyper-realistic phishing scams and automate social engineering endeavors. These sophisticated tactics make traditional detection methods increasingly inadequate, posing a considerable challenge to cybersecurity efforts.The versatility of AI extends beyond text-based endeavors, as it can also fabricate convincingly authentic websites and documents and even mimic human voices. In certain situations, hackers might utilize AI-generated voices, obtained by extracting recordings from unsolicited spam calls, to respond in real time, further blurring the lines between authentic and malicious communication.


As a result, the conventional belief in security awareness and training as a panacea for human-related breaches is likely to face growing skepticism. Consequently, Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) are anticipated to pivot their strategies, emphasizing adaptive human protection approaches in response to the evolving and increasingly sophisticated cyber threat landscape.Related: How ChatGPT and Generative AI Can Transform the Way You Run Your Business3. Is passwordless finally here?For years, the notion of moving beyond traditional passwords has been a topic of discussion, with the promise of a more secure and user-friendly authentication system. Notably, biometric authentication, including fingerprint and face unlock technologies, is becoming increasingly familiar to consumers, positioning it as a promising candidate for a more secure and convenient user verification process.Using biometrics with passkeys is a significant step towards realizing this password-less reality. Passkeys bring several advantages to the table, foremost among them being eliminating the need for users to remember passwords. Instead, individuals can seamlessly log into their accounts and apps using their unique biometric identifiers, which are far more secure than easily vulnerable traditional passwords. Additionally, the versatility of passkeys is a crucial feature, allowing users to apply the same biometric verification method across various devices and accounts. Such a streamlined solution simplifies the process of unlocking devices and easily accessing multiple accounts, while also improving security.


Looking ahead, a big change in the authentication landscape seems imminent. Tech giants like Google and Apple are actively introducing their own passkey solutions, signaling a collective industry push toward a password-less future. While the complete transition to a password-less world may still seem futuristic, the developments in biometric authentication and the adoption of passkeys suggest that 2024 could be the pivotal year, marking a widespread shift towards more secure and user-friendly authentication methods.Related: Passwords Are Scarily Insecure. Here Are a Few Safer Alternatives.Bottom lineAs we step into the unfolding chapters of the new year, the landscape of technological advancements beckons with immense potential, particularly in the realms of automation, generative AI, and authentication.In the business domain, there is a growing anticipation for a heightened emphasis on sustainability standards. Businesses are under growing pressure to integrate environmentally friendly practices into their operations and support the global movement towards a more sustainable future. Simultaneously, the regulatory landscape is evolving, with data privacy legislation gaining momentum across the globe. The protection of personal information is becoming a paramount concern, leading to the formulation and enforcement of stringent regulations. Against this backdrop, 2024 is shaping up to be a captivating year indeed.

35,9 SEO Myths to Say Goodbye to in 2024,"Jan 22, 2024",Nick Zviadadze,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/9-seo-myths-to-say-goodbye-to-in-2024/468281,"
Although most entrepreneurs understand the importance of search engine optimization (SEO), the online world is filled with outdated advice. The consequences of following bad SEO strategies are severe â€” a stagnant online presence, limited reach and missed opportunities for growth. Luckily, it doesn't have to be this way.In this article, I'm going to dispel the nine most common SEO myths that may be hurting your rankings. In turn, you can focus your efforts on the things that matter and keep from making typical SEO mistakes.Related: 5 Simple SEO Strategies to Improve Your Rankings



1. AI is killing SEOMany people believe that with the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT, people will stop using search engines to find information, which will make SEO redundant.Although AI undeniably plays a crucial role in shaping our online experiences, thinking that it will entirely replace search engines is a myth. Because let's face it, AI tools, such as ChatGPT, often create content that lacks the accuracy and depth found in expert-written articles.


For example, if you ask an AI about what are the best SEO tools for your business, you'd get a very uninspired list based on scraped online data â€” no pros and cons, no tool comparisons and no expert insight. In comparison, the top-ranking articles from Google provide well-rounded, in-depth information supported by real-world experience, and that makes it clear SEO is here to stay.2. SEO is a one-time thingA prevalent misconception about SEO is that all it takes for success is hiring an SEO agency, creating some content and ticking off the optimization checklist.The truth is that SEO isn't just a box you can check to rank better â€” it's a dynamic process that thrives on consistent effort. For example, you need to continuously create new content and build backlinks to secure and maintain the best rankings.Treating SEO as a one-time operation is a mistake that can make your online visibility fade quickly.


3. High keyword density is importantBack in the day, keyword density was an important ranking factor. Everybody used to try to pack in as many keywords as possible, which would help them climb the search engine rankings.Nowadays, however, keyword density is not important, thanks to more advanced algorithms that can accurately evaluate the context of online content. As a result, you don't need to jam in your keyword in your content as many times as possible. You should only use your keyword a handful of times when it feels natural.4. You can rank with just a handful of articlesYou can't publish just a few articles on the topic and expect to rank well. No matter how good your content is, Google looks for websites that establish themselves as authorities before granting high rankings.A website boasting 200 well-crafted articles on a topic will outperform a competitor with only 10 articles. That's why you should up your content velocity, as this SEO technique can help you gain topical authority and start ranking quickly.


Related: 5 Tips for Creating SEO Content That Ranks5. You can rank without backlinksThere's an ongoing debate in the SEO community about whether you can rank without backlinks. Theoretically, it might work â€” if you're in a niche without any competition, that is.But the reality of the situation is that in 2024, non-competitive niches are few and far between.So, if you want to target competitive keywords, you need to roll up your sleeves and build some quality backlinks by focusing on guest posting and building online relationships with other website owners.


6. Duplicate content gets you penalizedContrary to popular belief, Google recognizes duplicate content as something that occurs occasionally. When that happens, it aims to avoid redundancy in search results by providing users with the highest quality and most relevant page. That said, Google is also more about streamlining results than imposing punitive measures for unintentional duplicate content.This means that even if you do have duplicate content on your site, you won't get penalized for it.7. Google cares about DA or DRDomain Authority (DA) and Domain Rating (DR) are metrics often used by SEO experts to evaluate the quality of a website. Both metrics are a numerical representation of a website's credibility and influence, which is important for guest posting campaigns.However, although DA and DR are useful indicators for website quality, Google doesn't rely on them to determine search engine rankings. Instead, it uses sophisticated algorithms to assess the relevance and authority of web pages.


8. SEO is all about ranking firstAlthough ranking first on search engines is the best option, your SEO campaign can still be successful without claiming the top spot. That's because the rest of the top-ranking spots also attract a significant number of visitors to your website, which has a positive impact on your online visibility, brand awareness and bottom line.Positions two to four can drive organic traffic to your website, bringing a solid return on investment. So, failing to rank first on search engines does not mean your SEO is a failure.Related: 3 Powerful SEO Techniques That Will Boost Your Website's Search Engine Ranking9. The keyword in the URL is a ranking factorStuffing your URLs with keywords is not as important as most people believe. In fact, including the keyword in the URL is far from being an important ranking factor.


So, instead of wasting time with minor SEO details, you should use proven SEO tips, like creating quality content and building high-quality backlinks.There are many SEO myths out there. Following outdated or bad advice can hinder your SEO progress, preventing your website from reaching its full potential.The nine SEO misconceptions from this list should help you learn where you shouldn't focus your efforts if you want to climb search engine rankings faster.

36,"If You Want to Achieve Your Goals, Stop Obsessing Over Them. Here's Why.","Jan 22, 2024",Maria Vorovich,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-you-should-stop-obsessing-over-your-goals-to-achieve/467972,"
America harbors a uniquely goal-oriented culture. From our homes to our offices, from our bodies to our minds â€” a large majority of us are in a never-ending pursuit of measurable results in every aspect of our lives.Our wristwatches count daily steps, water bottles grade water intake by volume, and weight scales connect to our iPhones to input calories eaten. Dating is a ""numbers game."" Even babies have sleep monitors that output slumber scores. Simply put: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) occupy an outsized portion of our headspace.Nowhere is this phenomenon more present than in a business setting. Corporate offices are filled with executives rushing to read the latest dashboard; social media managers eagerly tally every video view; performance marketers monitor every click. I feel this daily as both a new mom and the owner of a market research company. The last seven months with my daughter have had me losing sleep â€” and not for the reason that you think. She's sleeping great! But I'm staying up obsessively tracking her milestones; did she roll over adequately? Has she ""cooed"" the right number of times today? We use data to help us feel ""in control,"" but ultimately, the data controls us.



My industry is guilty of the same crime. Data dashboards offer an illusion of control. Executives stare at statistics inside the boardroom while the real world runs rampant outside the door. I've seen it many times: a brand tracker reports a seemingly healthy brand, and suddenly, the business falls off a cliff. Culture shifts, consumer preferences change, and despite volumes of data, business leaders are blindsided.We lose out on the grand vista of value by obsessing over a goal, the golden data point at the end of the rainbow. It's never about one number or one data point. The greatest value and the most interesting lessons come from what we'll call data wandering: exploring multiple data points, connecting dots and inviting in the necessary complexity vital to revelatory truths. Here are some perspectives that guide how you wander the data landscape â€“ and relinquish single-digit-chasing.


Related: Why Focusing on KPIs Too Much Can BackfireData is the compass, not the captainThere's a reason that KPIs are ""Key Performance Indicators"" instead of ""Key Performance Answers."" This is your reminder that data very rarely has the solution to your question. Data is a barometer, a clue â€” a critical piece that completes the puzzle. When you shift your perspective and allow data to guide rather than lead, you will become freer to think critically and creatively. As a market researcher, I'm asking you to consider your data an ellipsis versus a full-stop period. In your day to day, practice this mantra by inserting the statement, ""That's interesting, I wonder ifâ€¦"" after every data point you encounter â€“ in work and life.Data is a slice, not the pieIn industry and society, we've gotten really good at housing, analyzing and gleaning insight from big data. Still, it can feel like we are drowning in information â€” information that can be reliable and contradictory at the same time. This is because there will always be more data and a different way to ask the same questions or analyze the same data. And no matter how much data you've succeeded at aggregating, you're often looking at a sliver of reality. If there is a world of truth outside of a metaphorical house, you are looking through a tiny crack in the wall and what you see will always be a partial view. And that's ok, for now. As our industry stands, there is no pie (cue the Matrix: there is no spoon!). When you realize that all data is a glimpse, it makes wandering that much more fun.Related: How to Determine Your KPIs and Achieve Profitability


Data is strong in its flexibility, not its rigidity.In life and in business, novelty and change are the norm, not the exception. When we become too rigid in ""how we do things"" and the data sets we monitor and track, we lose sight of the world around us. Tunnel vision is the antithesis of exploration, and it's often the leading cause of a business's failure to innovate. Kodak was hyper-focused on the success of film photography and didn't see the digital revolution. Xerox was celebrating healthy sales data around copy machines and chose to stifle innovation in favor of their hero product. Blockbuster overvalued the strength of its brand equity measures, failing to see the rise of the little-known company named Netflix.Goal orientation gives us purpose and meaning â€“ but goal obsession makes us psychologically immobile and incapable of seeing the full picture. Consider how 2024 can be your year to embrace feeling out of control â€“ welcoming the idea that despite all the data in the world, you may still not know ""for sure."" This will open you to more innovation, evolution, and changes, big and small.

37,Is Your Website's Traffic Plummeting? Stop Making This Toxic SEO Mistake â€” And Do This Instead.,"Jan 19, 2024",Jeff Peroutka,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/is-your-websites-traffic-plummeting-stop-making-this/465932,"
Have you noticed your site's organic traffic has plummeted over the past few years? This may have been caused by evidence of spammy link-building practices finding their way into your SEO work.Google's link spam update was rolled out in December 2022, supported by the AI algorithm SpamBrain. This update is intended to combat spam and improve the browsing experience for anyone using the search engine. Successful marketers need to be aware of its effects to maintain a squeaky-clean backlink profile that helps, rather than hurts, their site's organic visibility.In this post, I'll take a closer look at what SpamBrain is, its effects on SEO and three of the most effective strategies for aligning your link-building strategy with this element of Google's ranking algorithm.



Related: How to Shake Up a Stale Link-Building StrategyWhat is SpamBrain?SpamBrain is an AI-based algorithm made by Google to identify poor-quality spam content and make it less visible in Google search results. Though it was first launched in 2018, Google only acknowledged it publicly as part of the company's 2021 Webspam Report, suggesting that it's become a larger part of Google's ranking system over time.


Google's 2022 link spam update was rolled out to identify and neutralize backlinks that come from low-quality, spammy sources, preventing webmasters from artificially inflating their rankings.What does SpamBrain mean for SEO and marketers?The link spam roll-out caused a lot of websites' rankings to plummet. These were websites with backlink profiles characterized by spammy link-building practices that Google has consistently warned against, including:Buying links to artificially inflate a website's rankings.Excessive link exchanges between one website and another.Using spammy, low-quality directories and ""link farms"" that provide no value to the end user.Link building through forum comments with spammy, over-optimized anchor text.Excessive distribution of links in widgets, footers, etc.Using automation to generate links with no concern about relevance or context.If you noticed a drop in rankings or organic traffic following the December update, it's possible this was caused by evidence of spammy link-building practices that have made it into your backlink profile.As Google's algorithm updates become more focused on delivering the best possible user experience and more adept at identifying backlinks that go against its policies, it's essential for SEOs and webmasters to consciously build links that avoid spammy practices and run a tight ship when reviewing the state of their link profiles.


Related: 19 Sure-Fire Subject Line Formulas for Link-Building EmailsThree link-building strategies to avoid being penalized by SpamBrainNow that you have an understanding of what SpamBrain is and its function in Google's algorithm, here are three crucial link-building strategies you can use to maintain a healthy backlink profile, maximize the value of your link-building campaigns, and avoid getting penalized by Google's link spam policies.1. Regularly audit your backlink profileIt can be easy to let backlink profile audits fall by the wayside as part of your routine SEO work, especially if you've been investing in organic marketing for some time and your backlink profile is already large and diverse. However, this is an essential step towards ensuring your campaigns operate within Google's policies and not putting your rankings at risk of penalization.Block off some regular time in your calendar to analyze your site's backlinks, checking for any signs of poor-quality, spammy links that can be flagged for removal. This should include links with low-quality or irrelevant referring domains or those that use unnatural, over-optimized anchor texts. While using Google's disavow tool will ensure that spammy referring domains won't affect your rankings in the future, it's important to exercise caution before entering a huge list of domains for disavowal.


Occasionally, you might come across a link with spammy or irrelevant anchor text resulting from poor-quality past SEO work but it exists on a quality domain that could be a major asset to your SEO. In these cases, it's better to disavow specific referring pages or ask webmasters to remove the links manually.2. Review link-building practicesTo ensure that you're not going to be affected by link spam in the future, it's a good idea to set clear link-building policies that you or your staff can follow when executing a link-building campaign. This will ensure new backlinks meet a certain quality threshold and don't run the risk of creating a spammy backlink profile.Some of the things you might want to set policies about for a robust link-building SOP include:Minimum domain authority.Pointers for ensuring your content is relevant, high-quality, and authoritative in line with Google's EEAT guidelines.Approved anchor text.Strategies and examples for framing backlinks in the content.By going into each link-building campaign with a set of firm anti-spam policies, you'll eliminate the risk of spammy practices being flagged by Google as you build your backlink profile.


Related: How To Maximize the Number of Linkable Assets on Your Website3. Commit to high-quality contentRemember that the ultimate aim of SpamBrain and every Google algorithm update is to improve the experience for anyone who uses Google. They want to keep their users loyal, which means serving up the content that's most relevant to their search queries.One of the most effective things you can do to ensure your link-building stays on the right side of Google's spam policies is to keep an ironclad commitment to high-quality content. This is important for your linkable assets and the content that will serve as referring URLs in your campaigns.This means creating content that provides tangible value to its target audience, demonstrates a high level of expertise in the subject matter, and is written for a human audience rather than in a style that's intended to artificially ""game"" a search algorithm.


Though it's not always easy, maintaining a high content standard in all aspects of your link building will prevent spammy practices from seeping into your backlink profile and will set you up for future success with Google's user-focused algorithms.

Most noteworthy businesses and websites are capable of hitting the magic 100,000 visitors per month. Countless high-potential companies lose the battle for page views simply because they don't know how. There are, however, some factors you need to consider before embarking on this quest for more clicks.For starters, there is no one-size-fit solution that works for every niche website. The work involved in generating 100,000 organic visits per month varies depending primarily on the following:The competitiveness of your niche.The quality of your content.Your website's domain's authority and backlink profile.SEO can feel overwhelming as you learn about the different factors and metrics that drive 100,000 organic visitors. Mainly, however, you need to focus on these three factors:



Keywords and competitor research.Content organization â€” pillar pages and content clusters.Deploying your SEO content machine.Let's take a closer look at each of these variables!Related: How to Grow Your Brand's Digital Presence from 0 to 100,000 Followers in Just 6 Months


Keyword researchThe first step is to dig into your competitors' keywords and filter them down to the keywords you can rank for. Use a tool like Ahrefs or Semrush to find the total volume for keywords directly.If your organic visibility is relatively weak compared to your competitors, we recommend staying away from high-volume, high-demand keywords and instead focusing on ""medium-tail"" and ""long-tail"" keywords. These keywords are more specific and less competitive, offering an opportunity to tailor content to specific search intent and achieve higher rankings across several terms.Content organizationNow that you have your target keywords, the next step is to create pillar pages linking out to content clusters for the topics you want to target. This means using the keywords throughout your content naturally and ensuring your content is relevant to your target audience.The beauty of creating pillar pages and content clusters is not only all the internal linking going on and the topical authority that can be created but also the various terms, volume, and difficulty levels that will help you get more keywords ranking.


So, what are pillar pages and content clusters?Pillar pagesPillar pages are the key pages that build topical authority on your website. These pages are typically long-form, detailed articles covering a given topic in detail. Pillar pages are linked to clusters of other content (blogs and articles on the same or related topics), helping them rank higher in search results due to their semantic relevance.A look into the most authoritative websites will explain how these pages look. Investopedia's ""Stock"" page is a great example of this: this pillar page holds the ""cluster"" of everything that is ""Stock"" related.When planning and building content, it's essential to:


Choose the right topics for your pillar pages: Focus on the relevant topics for your target readers, prioritizing high search volume without neglecting low volume. You can use keyword tools like Ahrefs or Semrush to find topics showing decent traffic potential with a high keyword volume but with low enough competition that you'll be able to rank.Create high-quality content: Pillar pages will act as the first resource pages for your readers. These articles should be informative, authoritative and up-to-date with a variety of media forms like images and videos. Google favors content that's authoritative and trustworthy. With this in mind, you should try to write content that will be hard for competitors to replicate and give your audience some practical value based on their search intent.Optimize your pillar pages for SEO: Optimize your pillar pages by placing the right keywords in the headings and bodies and pass backlink equity to your other pages with internal links. Ensure the navigation is user-friendly and organized in a logical way. You should also include a call to action on each pillar page to direct visitors towards conversion.Content clustersPillar pages and content clusters are a powerful SEO strategy for generating organic traffic from Google. Creating content clusters linked to pillar content allows you to create a network of interconnected pages all centered around a specific topic, where you can create valuable resources for your audience and improve your chances of ranking in search results.

Now that you have a strong pillar page, you can start to identify the more specific topics within the pillar focus for your cluster content.Each content cluster should focus on a single topic, with each piece linking back to the pillar page.When setting up internal links, remember to:


Use relevant keywords in your anchor text.Place links in prominent locations. One common practice is to place them at the beginning or at the end of the content clusters contextually.Developing your SEO content machineMost websites with 100,000 visits per month have a consistent content output that keeps the site fresh and relevant. Make sure you're outsourcing or delegating to reliable content experts and tracking your content output with tools like Airtable.There are many ways you can approach content production, but generally, you'll need a team of at least one SEO editor and one writer to reach a consistently high-quality output.You should plan to equip these team members with an editorial calendar for planning content in advance and set formats for briefs and content templates for keeping your content production consistent. You can simplify the process of creating templates and SEO Briefs for your writers using tools like swiftbrief.com, Keywords Insights, or ChatGPT.Ranking on Google means producing well-written, authoritative and useful content that holds tangible value in the eyes of your target audience.


Creating the right content is a major task involving several sub-tasks, such as tracking internal links for the right anchors, ensuring the topics are covered with proper optimization, and others.Are you ready to get to 100K/visits per month?

Yoast is a WordPress-specific SEO plugin that allows businesses to add essential on-page elements to their sites, including meta titles, meta descriptions, keywords and internal links. Once activated, the Yoast plugin displays a score (red, yellow or green) to reflect the degree to which your website is optimized. Some alternatives to Yoast include RankMath and SEOPress.Cost: $99 per year5. SemrushSemrush is one of the best ""freemium"" SEO software options, with a wide range of keyword research functions, site auditing features, content optimization tools and more. Like Google Keyword Planner, you can research keywords relevant to your service or product and even discover the keywords your competitors are ranking for. You can audit your site for on-page and technical SEO issues and receive an easy-to-follow report on how to fix them. Semrush also includes backlink analysis, listing management and local SEO tools, which are not available via Keyword Planner or Google Analytics.Cost: free (limited); paid starts at $129.95 per month


6. SpyFuSpyFu is a small-business-friendly competitive keyword research tool. Its complete SEO marketing suite includes a Pay Per Click ad analyzer, robust historical data, competitive analysis tools, backlink outreach and even custom reporting. SpyFu is a close runner-up to Semrush, as it provides a range of helpful SEO features at an affordable price. However, Semrush is often the preferred option, given that it includes on-page, off-page, and technical SEO tools (the trifecta).Cost: free (limited); $16 per month (annual plan)7. AnswerThePublicAnswerThePublic is not explicitly an SEO tool but rather a ""search listening tool,"" but it made the list because it is supremely helpful when it comes to small business content strategy. And content is one of the most important drivers of organic traffic. AnswerThePublic allows you to search for a primary keyword and discover a ""web"" of questions and/or topics to turn into blog posts or web pages.For example, say you sell dog toys online; some topic ideas generated could include ""Are dog toys machine washable?"" or ""Which toys are safe for dogs?"" These might make interesting blog posts that appeal to the interests of your target audience.

Addressing these issues can help you speed up your website, make it more discoverable by real search engines, and increase your organic rankings, leading to more site traffic. Screaming Frog is best paired with a keyword research tool like Semrush to ensure a holistic SEO strategy.Cost: free (limited); paid starts at $259 per year


So now what?In small business marketing, the challenges are unique, often stemming from limited resources and personnel juggling multiple roles. SEO can feel intimidating, especially to small business owners facing limited technical and financial resources. However, the advantages of operating in a niche market with lower competition and cost-effective campaigns are undeniable. To harness these benefits, businesses can leverage powerful yet budget-friendly SEO tools. Elevate your small business's online presence with these tools, turning challenges into opportunities for growth and visibility.

42,Meta's AI Chief Says He Turned Down a Job as a Google Director in 2002 Partly Because of Low Pay,"Jan 5, 2024",Beatrice Nolan,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/meta-ai-chief-yann-lecun-once-turned-down-google-for-low-pay/467954,"
This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Meta's chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, says he turned down a job offer for director of research at Google in 2002.In a post on X, LeCun said there were several reasons behind the decision, including the size of the company and the compensation package.



LeCun said the salary was low, especially at a time when he needed money to support his teenage sons. Despite the low compensation, LeCun said ""the stock option package would have ended up stratospheric.""He also said the company had 600 employees and no revenue at the time. This meant the role would have involved many things other than research, including corporate strategy and management, he said in the post.


LeCun, who won the Turing Prize for his research in 2018, said he wanted to refocus on research in several areas, including machine learning. The deep-learning pioneer also said his family didn't want to move to California at the time.He added that if he'd taken the role at Google, he may have changed parts of the company culture.In the post, LeCun said, ""Had I joined, I think the research culture at Google would have been different. I might have made it a bit more open and a bit more ambitious a bit earlier.""Critics have previously accused Google of being slow and overly cautious with its AI development.


The success of the Microsoft-backed ChatGPT reportedly raised alarm bells at Google. The company has since released competing products for several of OpenAI's products, including its own AI-powered chatbot to rival ChatGPT.Google representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

43,How Business Leaders Can Take Control of Their Business With Data,"Jan 5, 2024",Kristopher Tait,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-vertical-integration-allows-leaders-to-actually-control/467160,"
The parable of ""The Blind Men and The Elephant"" tells the story of six blind men who come across an elephant for the first time. They each examine a different part of the elephant. The trunk. The ears. The tusksâ€¦ You get the gist.Consequently, each person comes to a very different conclusion about what an elephant is.They are all partly right â€” but also entirely wrong.



The moral of this story is simple. Different perspectives and incomplete information can lead to varying â€” and often inaccurate â€” interpretations. It's an old story. But it's a fable we should pay close attention to in our modern world. Especially when working with data.Related: Using Data Analytics Will Transform Your Business. Here's How.


Less will (almost) always be moreBusiness leaders worldwide want to use their data to make better decisions and get more accurate insights into their business.But often, businesses will have multiple layers in their tech stacks. Some are new. Some are old. Some are integrated. Some are totally siloed. Each of these layers captures different data. And you get inaccurate insights when these pieces aren't talking to each other.Businesses have access to more data than ever before. But quantity doesn't equal quality.For many organizations, the actual quality of their data is being diluted. You create misaligned incentives by having so many different elements in your tech stack. One aspect of your stack may tell you one thing, but then the next part can contradict it. We see this a lot in advertising technology. A myriad of different buying platforms, data partners, publishers, analytics tools, CRM, segmentation tools and more. Often, it becomes so messy over time that it's hard to get the actionable data you need to create insights, actions, and business impact.


Access to lots of data sets does not equal good data. Looking at data sets in silos is an easy way to paint the wrong picture, which increases the likelihood of poor decision-making.Data is exciting, but you need to be able to view it in a single place, which is why I think the principles of vertical integration should be implemented here.Vertical thinkingVertical integration is a strategy that allows a company to streamline its operations by taking direct ownership of processes. In other words, it allows you to control your own destiny. In theory, it gives businesses greater efficiencies, reduced costs, and more control of the manufacturing and distribution process. Tesla is a famous example of this model practice.Tesla implemented vertical integration across its business structure â€” but with a major focus on two key aspects: battery production and energy storage. Tesla knew that batteries were critical to EVs - and that success hinged on owning a highly contested battery supply chain. This enterprise allowed Tesla to leverage its expertise in battery technology and apply it to the energy storage market, creating synergies and shared resources across different product lines.


It does everything from designing the cars, building the tech, and making its own chips to selling the cars. Everything is in-house, meaning supply chain issues or manufacturing partners don't slow it down. This integration has helped the company scale its operations, drive technological advancements, and position itself as a sustainable transportation and energy solutions leader.Owning your data can work in the same way. But without the need to build a multi-billion dollar gigafactory in Nevada.By taking control of your tech stack and ownership of your information, you gain a more holistic view of what is happening with your business. And you also insulate yourself from issues in the outside world.This is invaluable on its own. But this singular view becomes even more powerful when you factor in the exponential growth of AI and ML technologies. Applying these tools to a vertically integrated data set can transform a business and unlock previously unknowable insights.


Essentially if your data is disparate and not well integrated, you can never get to the ""Unknown Unknowns""â€”the things you didn't even know to ask about. There are patterns invisible to human eyes. You can only see these with good data.More insights. More efficiency. More control. Vertical integration offers businesses control of their supply chains. But there are challenges, too. Even if you aren't building huge factories, you need investment and support to make the necessary changes. And most importantly, you need to ensure that becoming self-reliant doesn't mean you get tunnel vision and lose sight of developments outside your business.Related: 8 Ways Data Analytics Can Revolutionize Your BusinessData and elephantsIf you look at different data sets in isolation, you will likely emerge with an incorrect idea of what an elephant â€” aka your business â€” really is.You might be partly right in places, but you will also be entirely wrong.Vertical integration allows leaders to see the full picture of their business â€” from customer to creative, hoof to tusk.

44,5 Simple SEO Methods That Produce Major Traffic for Small Businesses,"Dec 22, 2023",Jason Hennessey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-simple-and-effective-seo-methods-for-small-businesses/465669,"
Search engine optimization (SEO) is, of course, pretty much an existential marketing consideration at this point: Without it, you're sunk. That said, a great many owners find associated strategies to be confusing and complicated, and inevitably highly technical. But worry not: There are simple yet effective SEO techniques that dependably produce more traffic for smaller and/or new businesses.Create product-specific landing pagesA common mistake is consolidating all of a company's products or services onto a single web page, but this means missing a vital opportunity to optimize product- or service-specific landing pages for target keywords.Take a Los Angeles-based family law firm, for example. Many firms list all their services (divorce, child support, child custody law, etc.) on one page. But those terms, independently, carry a ton of search volume, and so will be better optimized for individual web pages and targeted content.



So, consider all your services or products, then use keyword research tools like Semrush or Ahrefs to determine the organic search volume for each. Once you have determined a keyword target for each page, optimize content for it, which includes using a keyword(s) in the page title, subheadings and body content.Related: How to Create an Effective SEO Strategy in 2023


The power of guest postsAnother simple and effective way to generate more traffic is through guest posting â€”partnering with other publications, websites or blogs and writing or otherwise publishing content on their site.Reach out to peers or websites whose work interests you, and ask if they accept guest posts. You might have to present a few topics for approval and be sure to adhere to each site's guidelines (though many will accept content with no strings attached).Posting in this way can help earn backlinks to your website, which boosts its domain authority, and in turn SEO. That said, backlinks are rarely guaranteed, so also focus on the benefits of earning referral traffic via another website's audience and on the promotion of your content on their marketing channels.Related: 12 Secrets to Pitching the Perfect Guest Post


Optimize local Google and directory listingsThis strategy is particularly useful for small businesses targeting a specific geographic area (whether city, county or state), because people often use a variety of search engines to find services or businesses near home.The most obvious one is Google, of course, which has its own online listing platform: Google Business Profile. Start by creating your Profile, then select your category, and be sure to include business hours and contact information, along with high-quality photos. Keep in mind, too, that the more 5-star customer reviews you earn, the better rankings you'll have in Google Maps.Other online directories like Bing Places for Business, Yelp, The Real Yellow Pages (aka YP), Better Business Bureau, Foursquare and MerchantCircle can be used to attract local customers. Also consider industry-specific directories (such as Avvo for lawyers and Angi for home services).Related: Supercharge Your Local Listings and SEO with These 5 Tools


Generate effective contentOne of the best ways to increase traffic for a small business is by posting engaging and SEO-friendly content. Even if you don't have a large market, you'll command virtually unlimited reach if there's content on board that people are actively searching for.For example, say you own a small beauty supply boutique. Local reach used to be pretty much limited to foot traffic and traditional media, but now a vast audience can be reached with informative content on topics such as summer skin care, the best face oils for dry skin and preferred organic makeup brands.Once again, a good way to begin would be to use a keyword research tool to generate topic ideas relevant to your business and audience, then craft material accordingly (keeping in mind that non-writers can always use ChatGPT or other AI solutions). Include links to your products or service pages to attract even more attention.Related: 6 Tricks to Optimize Your Site for Search Engines


Leverage search-driven platformsGoogle isn't the only search engine in the game, to be sure: There are many others â€”including Pinterest, LinkedIn, Bing and YouTube â€” that use search-driven algorithms to connect users with brands.Pinterest can be especially effective for fashion and beauty brands, small retailers, artists, designers and marketing service providers. Similarly, YouTube and LinkedIn allow users to search for topics or content creators. On YouTube, someone might search for ""useful marketing tips"" and get directed to a marketing agency's channel, while on LinkedIn a potential client might search for ""business coach.""On all these platforms, small businesses can once again gain leverage by offering valuable and audience-relevant content. Each will have its own ""SEO best practices"" that you can apply to help content rank higher (see YouTube SEO, Pinterest SEO, and LinkedIn SEO).Related: How to Achieve Explosive Growth on Pinterest

AI-driven SEO strategiesA primary goal of all SEO specialists, including myself, is to increase rankings. With AI SEO tools, this is now a much faster and easier task. Here are five tools I use when helping clients:AgilityWriter: With AgilityWriter, you can provide the tool with your topic and keywords, and it generates an outline and an article. It's fact-based and provides resources. It can also generate metadata for you. Furthermore, it can sometimes provide you with internal and external links to help your link equity.NeuronWriter: You can feed your already-written article into the tool. Then, you can select the leading competitors for your chosen keyword. The article's use of keywords is evaluated against competitors, enabling you to optimize the article for keywords your competitors have used but you haven't. It can also generate a meta title and description for you. In addition, you can get a score for the top-performing article and work on improving your score so that it beats the leader in the niche in terms of keyword optimization.Bing AI: Bing AI offers three primary options in its browser. These are ""Chat,"" ""Create"" and ""Insights."" It can provide resources and answer queries in addition to a multitude of other things, such as generating images based on text.

In addition, you need to openly address communication challenges with your team and clients about managing expectations when it comes to the role of AI in your SEO efforts.It's undeniable: AI tools for SEO can significantly boost your efforts to climb rankings and produce higher-quality content in a fraction of the time.

47,5 Guest-Posting Tips to Help You Rank Higher on Search Engines,"Dec 20, 2023",Nick Zviadadze,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-guest-posting-tips-to-help-you-rank-higher-on-search/466428,"
Many entrepreneurs struggle to rank high on search engines despite investing in search engine optimization (SEO). As a result, their website remains buried on the fourth page of Google, where nobody can ever find it.This is commonly the result of neglecting link-building. Backlinks are still a vital ranking factor in 2023, which is why you need to find a way to acquire them.Enter guest posting â€” an excellent way to get backlinks and boost your SEO efforts. That's why I want to share five guest-posting tips to help you rank faster on search engines and improve your online visibility.



Related: 5 Common SEO Mistakes That Are Killing Your RankingsWhy guest posting is important in 2023In 2023, artificial intelligence (AI) models have revolutionized content creation, making it more accessible than ever. But with tons of content flooding the internet, one question arises: How do search engines decide what content to rank higher?


While they use many ranking factors, backlinks are probably the most important.When two websites have similarly excellent content, the one with better quality backlinks will rank higher on search engines. That's why you need to develop a good link-building strategy that focuses on guest posting.Here are the five tips that can help you master guest posting to start ranking higher on search engines:1. Pick the right topicsWhen you're analyzing a website, you should examine what kind of topics they already cover. Many people make pitches that are not relevant to the website or send generic emails to pitch topics that have been covered thousands of times, with no unique angle. That is clearly not going to get a ""yes.""


Instead, you want to dive deep into the blog section and dissect the existing topics. Use your favorite SEO tool to learn what keywords the website ranks for. Then, compare them with competitor websites and identify any gaps.Pitch a topic crafted around a keyword that they're not ranking for, but their competitor is. That will give you a fresh perspective on a topic of interest, which increases the chances of a positive response.2. Position yourself as an expertWebsite owners get countless guest posting requests and only answer a few. So, if you want to get a response, you need to position yourself as an expert.Website owners seek to provide true value to their readers, which is why they want to hear insights from established experts who have a lot to offer. You can get a positive response by positioning yourself as an expert in your guest post outreach email and explaining how your knowledge and expertise are relevant to their business.


To achieve this, you need to introduce yourself, your professional background and the depth of your experience that positions you as an authority. Clearly articulate the topics you specialize in when contributing as a guest blogger.Positioning yourself as an expert builds credibility and assures website owners that your insights will benefit their audience, which increases your chances of securing a backlink.Related: 3 Powerful SEO Techniques That Will Boost Your Website's Search Engine Ranking3. Partner up with other guest bloggersYou typically get one backlink from a single guest post. However, you can collaborate with other guest bloggers to amplify the benefits of your guest posts.Here's how it works.First, you need to identify and partner with bloggers actively engaged in guest posting. When you create a guest blog for another website, you link to your partner bloggers. In return, they also include a backlink to your website when doing a guest post.This symbiotic approach helps secure several backlinks from a single guest blog, maximizing your link-building efforts.4. Create a high-quality guest postAfter securing a guest post, most people don't put too much effort into creating it. They write a short-form article that offers nothing unique compared to hundreds of other posts covering the same topic. This approach is only going to get you ghosted by the website owner because it's clear that your only goal is to acquire a backlink.


With guest posting, it's all about providing value. That's why you want to stand out from the crowd by creating high-quality content that offers real value to the readers.Your guest blogging content should be long-form with expert quotes, current data and compelling visuals. Think about the type of blog post you want to publish on your website and provide the same quality.This approach ensures your guest post leaves a lasting impression on the website owner, helping you build a relationship with them. As a result, they'll be more open to future collaborations.5. Offer something in returnSometimes, website owners won't be open to guest posting. So, you can offer something to sweeten the deal and provide more value than the guest post.


For example, you can propose to share the guest post with thousands of followers on X or other social media platforms. That way, their content gets more clicks, expanding their reach and improving their website's online presence.You can also propose a mutually beneficial exchange by offering to link back to their website. If your website is new and doesn't have too much authority, you can offer to include a backlink to their website in another blog post you have planned for the future. That provides them with quality content and a backlink, which is a win-win for everyone involved.Related: 5 Link-Building Tips to Help You Rank on Page 1Backlinks are still crucial for SEO in 2023, and the best way to approach link-building is to start guest posting.


Guest posting can help you acquire backlinks and build relationships with other websites. To be more successful at guest blogging, you need to pick the right topics, position yourself as an expert, partner with other guest bloggers, create high-quality content and offer value.These five tips will help you acquire more backlinks and improve your search engine rankings.

49,"4 Ways This SEO Expert Uses AI to Create Content â€” and How You Can, Too","Dec 13, 2023",Summit Ghimire,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/top-tricks-to-using-ai-for-content-creation-from-an-seo/459299,"
Navigating through 2023 has been an interesting journey, witnessing how different industries have integrated generative artificial intelligence technology into their operations. How smoothly that process has gone has depended heavily on the openness â€” or lack thereof â€” toward the new technology.Industries like human resources, accounts payable and accounts receivable have seen a gradual integration of automation. For other industries, particularly creative ones, the experience has been more jarring. Misunderstanding the technology itself and apprehension over the potential for job loss has undoubtedly hindered its acceptance.While these industries have their unique approaches to AI integration, the field of SEO presents its own set of challenges and opportunities, as we've observed at my company, Outpace SEO. Our goal has been to find those areas where it is both feasible and prudent to utilize the technology. One key area of operations where we've found significant success is content creation, which is long-established to be a crucial factor in the development and success of any company's website and SEO results.



Depending on the industry, size and scope of a company, the specific aspects of generative AI and machine learning systems that effectively integrate into a company's operations will vary. Ultimately, it's on the company's leadership to take the appropriate steps to ensure successful utilization.Related: Writing Content With AI Won't Help You Win Against Google Search Rankings. Here's Why.


Where to optimize content creation with AI in SEOMost business professionals would feel comfortable stating that generative AI and machine learning systems are highly valuable for their ability to reduce time, energy and capital invested into data analytics and other non-creative processes.For creative tasks, though, there can be a misperception of the limitations of generative AI capabilities. These systems can efficiently complete aspects of creative processes, steps like initial research, idea development, structure and outlining, template design and the like.

50,10 Powerful Link-Building Tactics for Boosting Your Website's SEO,"Dec 12, 2023",Jeff Peroutka,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/10-powerful-link-building-tactics-for-boosting-your/466091,"
Link building is an essential cornerstone of any solid SEO strategy, and with Google's continued trend towards machine learning in its algorithms and rewarding sites that display relevance, quality, and authority, building a healthy link profile is harder than ever.In this post, we'll look at 10 of the most powerful link-building tactics you can use to build a quality backlink profile and start climbing your target SERPs.Related: Why Is Link Building So Controversial?



Guest bloggingGuest blogging is the classic go-to for link-building tactics for one simple reason: it works!This tactic involves contacting blogs and online news sources in your niche and pitching the site owners' content outlines. If they accept and like your content, you can link back to your target website either as part of an author bio or within the body of the content.


There are a few better ways to ensure your backlink's referring page has the kind of topical relevance that Google loves to see. It's also a great way of demonstrating your expertise to your target audience in the process. Just be sure to cast a wide net with your blog outreach, and don't just stick to sites that explicitly call for submissions.Leverage your existing networkLeveraging your existing network is one of the easiest link-building tactics out there, yet it's unfortunately neglected by many SEOs.If you've spent a long time in your industry, you've likely built a rich network of ex-colleagues, partners or other contacts. These people may be able to authorize organic dofollow backlinks on their site and will already be familiar with your level of expertise in a particular topic.Ask around and see if your network can throw some relevant links your way.


Register on business directoriesDirectories are a controversial subject in the modern SEO community. However, considering how cheap and easy it is to acquire these kinds of links, there's very little downside to finding directories with a clear relation to your niche and getting listed with a link to your site.If you choose your referring domains wisely and look for a high degree of relevance for both the directory site as a whole and the businesses that are listed on it, you'll be able to build a high volume of valuable links in a very short space of time.This can be a particularly useful link-building tactic for local brick-and-mortar businesses looking to optimize for localized keywords, such as ""florists in Honolulu.""Related: 19 Sure-Fire Subject Line Formulas for Link-Building Emails


Broken link buildingAnother big one among low-cost, low-effort link-building tactics, broken link building is a great way to build links at scale for those embarking on a new SEO campaign.This tactic involves finding broken links (pointing to a dead page) on websites that have a topical relationship to your business and reaching out to webmasters, suggesting that they amend the link to point to one of your resources.The referring webmasters get to improve their user experience, and you get a powerful new link!Unlinked mentionsLink-building through unlinked mentions is one of the more attractive link-building tactics because it doesn't involve creating fresh external content to act as a referring page.


In this strategy, you simply find mentions of your brand name on external sites, then reach out to the webmasters and ask them to link their mention of your business. As they're already familiar with you and are happy to mention you as an authority in your industry, you're likely to have a high success rate.Competitor link buildingCompetitor link building involves analyzing your competitors' backlink profiles to determine which kind of content is most likely to garner high-quality links within your topic focus.Using a backlinks analytics tool, you'll be able to see whether your competitors get the lion's share of their links to infographics, ultimate guides, tutorials or other kinds of content, and also discover the actual focus of the content.You can use this research to inform your own content calendar and maximize the chances of attracting quality, organic links from similar referring domains.Related: 6 Elements Your Link-Building Campaign Must IncludeRepurposing contentThink about your site's MVP â€” that one piece of content that gets a huge proportion of all the traffic and shares and has kept on proving its value long after it was first published.If it's done well in its current format, it will likely see the same success in other formats, such as a video or infographic.Though it's one of the higher-effort link-building tactics on this list, repurposing content can pay dividends by building on your stock of evergreen content and offering plenty of long-term value.


Redirect links pointing to inferior contentDuring your research for SEO drives, you've probably come across pieces of competitor content that have a ton of quality backlinks despite the content being fairly mediocre.If you've got a page on your site that you know blows a certain competitor out of the water, then you may be able to acquire new, powerful backlinks by reaching out to the referring domain authors and suggesting they link to your content instead.Considered one of the ""gray hat"" link-building tactics, redirecting competitor backlinks will not only help your visibility but could decrease your competitors' in your target SERPs.Forum link buildingForums and similar sites are often associated with spammy, low-quality link-building tactics. However, they can be fantastic referring domains for links to content and resources that are relevant to the conversation and useful to the site users participating in these communities.


One of the best link-building tactics for sites with a rich library of authoritative content, this strategy involves looking for discussions about your business niche on sites like Reddit or Quora, offering some useful input, and linking to your content as a reference.Social media link buildingSocial media can be a hugely effective tool in your link-building arsenal, enabling you to become a more visible authority and develop a strong network of content creators who are likely to cite you as an authority.Some of the most effective social media link-building tactics include using popular hashtags when sharing content to get your online assets in front of journalists and bloggers, following journalists in your niche to look for interview and citation opportunities, and actively participating in industry discussions to get your brand in front of potential linkers.

51,'Victory Over Google!' Epic Games Just Won An Epic Court Battle Against Google Play,"Dec 12, 2023",Jonathan Small,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/google-lose-epic-antitrust-court-battle/466792,"
Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, won a Battle Royale over tech giant Google late this afternoon.After a month-long trial but just over three hours of deliberation, a nine-person federal jury in San Francisco ruled in favor of Epic, concluding that Google held an illegal monopoly over the Google Play Store and engaged in practices that undercut Epic Games' ability to compete fairly.The jury concluded that Google's conduct not only affected Epic Games, but potentially harmed many developers dependent on the Android marketplace for their business.



""Victory over Google!"" Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney said on X. ""After four weeks of detailed court testimony, the California jury found against the Google Play monopoly on all counts. The Court's work on remedies will start in January. Thanks for everyone's support and faith! Free Fortnite!""

Free Fortnite! https://t.co/ITm4YBHCusâ€” Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) December 12, 2023Related: Android System Case: Supreme Court To Hear Google, CCI Appeals From October 10What this meansThe decision is a major loss for Google, which has consistently been able to withstand legal attacks from other game makers. Google may now have to change its Play Store rules, opening up the possibility for an alternate app marketplace on the Android platform. It may also affect the rates Google charges developers for in-app purchases, currently set at a substantial 15-30%.Presiding Judge James Donato is expected to define the specific remedies of the Epic Games case early next year, but the decision carries significant implications for the industry. Other Big Tech companies may now be vulnerable to challenges on how they control pricing and payments on their platforms. It's also bad news for Google, which is also embroiled in another high-profile antitrust trial in Washington, D.C., over its search and advertising sectors.


Ruled a monopolyGoogle's lawyers argued that the company couldn't possibly hold a monopoly because it competed with Apple's app store, the largest in the world. But that didn't sway the jury, who saw pages of internal Google documents and emails. At one point during the trial, the judge issued a stern reprimand to Google for deleting chats that could have been pertinent to the case.Today's ruling came two years after Epic mostly lost a similar case against Apple â€” a ruling that both sides are trying to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.But the repercussions of this case are expected to be felt widely, standing as a stark reminder that even the seemingly untouchable Goliaths of the tech industry are subject to the law.

OpenAI's ChatGPT dominated headlines this year. Now, Google's own large language model is on the scene.Google announced the launch of Gemini, a groundbreaking AI model heralded as its ""most capable"" to date, on Wednesday.Related: Google Gears Up to Compete With Microsoft-Backed ChatGPT â€” Here's What It Means



Gemini arrives in a suite of three sizes â€” each designed for specific tasks: Gemini Ultra, the ""largest and most capable model""; Gemini Pro, meant to scale across a broad range of tasks; and Gemini Nano, optimized for mobile use.Google's Gemini Pro outperformed OpenAI's GPT-3.5, executives told CNBC. But they avoided questions about how it compared to GPT-4.


Gemini will be integrated across consumer-facing products, powering tools such as Google's Bard chatbot and allowing a more engaging Search Generative Experience.Starting December 13, developers and enterprise clients will be able to harness the capabilities of Gemini Pro through the Google AI Studio and Cloud Vertex AI.Beyond consumer use, Google envisions Gemini fulfilling a versatile range of business needs â€” transforming customer service interactions, providing astute product recommendations and enabling companies to identify market trends with greater acuity.Additionally, Gemini's potential extends into creative realms; it could facilitate content creation for marketing campaigns and blogging efforts and offer productivity enhancements through meeting summarizations and streamlined code generation.

54,5 Ways SEO Can Help Grow a Mom & Pop Business,"Dec 8, 2023",Jason Hennessey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-ways-seo-can-help-grow-a-mom-pop-business/465089,"
Small, independently owned shops, almost by definition, rely on tighter teams and target smaller markets while providing often niche products or services. And small they may be, but mom-and-pop operations can be mighty: They often bring a family legacy to their customers, along with close customer service â€” experiences not easily found in larger commercial sectors.If you run such a shop, it's common to rely on local foot traffic and targeted social media for much of your marketing efforts. Fortunately, both of these channels benefit from good search engine optimization practices.1. Optimize your Google Business ProfileYour Google Business Profile is a prime piece of virtual real estate, and it's free. Simply sign up using an existing Google account and either claim an existing listing or create a new one. Once you can access your profile, you can optimize it to attract local customers â€” people looking for products/services online and those interested in visiting a physical location. A well-executed one will attract more organic traffic, phone calls, leads and, ultimately, more customers.



Related: How PR and SEO Can Converge to Supercharge Your Online ExposureA few optimization essentials:


Be sure to fill out every part of the profile, including business name, address, phone number and hours of operation (all information should be consistent with what's on your website and other online listings).Choose the most accurate category to describe your enterprise, and add relevant attributes regarding other important details.Consider including high-quality photos or videos of the physical space and products or services. Profiles with photos receive more clicks and calls.Solicit more Google reviews: Encourage customers to leave comments on your profile. Not only does this improve engagement, but it also sends positive SEO signals to Google, meaning potentially higher search results placement.List services or products, including detailed descriptions and pricing.Incorporate booking and/or reservations: If your business takes appointments, integrate booking options (such as Calendly).Keep information updated: Make sure to update your profile to reflect any changes in hours, contact information, services, etc.2. Create localized contentMost small businesses target a specific geographic area â€” whether they realize it or not. With that in mind, it's wise to have regionally specific website content to attract relevant traffic, including keywords indicating a particular service area. Consider, for example, geo-specific terms that describe your company, then validate that they receive actual search volume (using a tool like Semrush) and apply them on site pages (including titles and descriptions) according to on-page SEO best practices.Related: 4 Ways to Win at Local Content Marketing3. Placement in local directoriesThere are, of course, other online listings and resources that can earn you organic traffic. These include (but are not limited to) Bing Places for Business, Yelp, The Real Yellow Pages (aka YP), Better Business Bureau, Foursquare and MerchantCircle. You might also find directories specific to your service area, such as the local chamber of commerce.In the process, avoid spammy directories, which can be vehicles for unauthorized/unwanted traffic, including malware. These are often characterized by outdated web design, overwhelming pop-up ads, promises for ""links"" in exchange for a fee and a lack of moderation.


4. Social media ""check-ins""You might not consider Instagram a ""local"" platform, but with its location-tagging feature, it can be! By encouraging customers to ""check in"" on social media, you can attract potential customers from the area and/or gain more likes or follows, both valuable assets. Any business can benefit from such efforts, especially smaller ones that depend on limited traffic.One creative way to encourage customers to engage is by creating an on-site Instagrammable spot or some other kind of selfie station. Ask visitors to tag your location and include a photo with their posts.Related: 5 Reasons Why Your Brand Needs a Strong Social Media Presence5. YouTube marketingThis video colossus has more than two billion users, and just like most other online platforms, people use keywords to search it. You can boost YouTube's organic reach to your company by posting engaging content that provides true value. With the right optimization, it will generate hundreds to thousands of new views and new customers. Concepts could include the story of your business's foundation, testimonials from happy customers, product demonstrations and tutorials, local events or Q&A sessions with other business owners or thought leaders.

55,5 Tips to Choose an SEO Agency (That Actually Delivers Results),"Dec 5, 2023",Nick Zviadadze,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-tips-to-choose-an-seo-agency-that-actually-delivers/465849,"
Hiring a search engine optimization (SEO) agency can be a gamble because you only start to see results after six months to a year of active work.But waiting for months, even a year, only to realize your SEO plan isn't working can be a significant business setback. It costs time and money you could've spent to grow your business in another way.That's why choosing the right SEO agency that delivers results is vital.After years in the SEO industry, I've identified the five most important factors determining whether an agency is good:Related: Questions to Ask When Choosing an SEO Agency



1. Look for transparencyWhen choosing an SEO agency, the number one thing you need to consider is transparency. Don't be swayed by fancy industry terms and jargon. Instead, look for clear and specific strategies.For example, it's not a good sign if an SEO agency states it ""works on your on-page and off-page SEO"" without giving you any specifics. Instead, you want an agency that offers a clear month-to-month plan that outlines every step of the SEO journey and explains its importance.By being aware of each month's deliverables, you can assess whether the agency is delivering on its promises. It acts as a roadmap, making the SEO process more tangible and measurable. That way, you can understand the aim of specific actions and track the agency's progress.A clear SEO strategy also enables better communication. When you know all the next steps, you can provide your input and address any concerns, creating a more effective partnership.


Lastly, an SEO agency should be transparent about the expectations that it sets. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Trustworthy agencies set honest, achievable goals and timeframes, ensuring you know exactly what outcomes to expect.2. Ask for previous resultsPrevious results best indicate whether an SEO agency can really do its job. That's why you should always inquire about past results, specifically in your industry.For example, if you run a local restaurant and need an SEO agency to improve your online presence, you should go with an agency that has previous experience with local businesses, especially in the food industry.You should also closely investigate any claims that SEO agencies make. For example, let's say that an agency claims to have increased website traffic by 200% in six months. These results are impressive if the website already has 20,000 monthly visitors, but not so much if they only have 100 monthly visitors.Remember, concrete results matter â€” not just percentage increases. So, ask for specific numbers and make sure they are relevant.


Related: 3 Powerful SEO Techniques That Will Boost Your Website's Search Engine Ranking3. Request an air-tight scopeBefore you start working with an SEO agency, request an air-tight scope of your partnership. A well-defined plan is a pact between you and the SEO agency, aligning expectations and promoting transparency. It enables you to see the inner workings of their approach and answer vital questions, like:How many articles will they publish each month?What are the quality metrics for the backlinks they're going to build?What other SEO actions are they going to take, and when?An SEO agency should create an actionable plan that explains every step. For example, in the first month, they may do a content audit, keyword research and a backlink audit.By month two, they may implement critical on-page SEO fixes and start publishing content. The third month brings the beginning of an active link-building campaign, promising to deliver at least 10 backlinks. Then, the following months bring a steady flow of 15 articles and 10 backlinks.A detailed SEO scope clearly explains the journey ahead, keeping you informed and allowing you to hold the agency accountable.It's a two-way street of expectations and results, which significantly improves your collaboration.4. Review content and backlink qualityContent and backlink quality directly impact your website's search engine rankings. That's why you must ensure that the content and backlinks you receive are qualitative.Quality content should answer questions, provide solutions and entertain your readers. If an agency delivers 500-word, short-form articles, then that's a big red flag. In 2023, long-form, comprehensive articles perform a lot better.Meanwhile, a good backlink originates from a legitimate, authoritative website with real traffic. If your agency wants to deliver ""forum backlinks"" or ""blog comment backlinks,"" they're just wasting your time.


Related: How to Know If You're Producing Quality Content5. Ask about reportingWhen investing in an SEO agency, you want to be in the know on their performance at all times. That's why you need to ask about the agency's reporting practices.Start by asking about their reporting schedule. Monthly updates are standard, giving you a regular overview of your SEO progress. You also need to know what's in those reports. Look for a breakdown of the most important metrics like impressions, key page traffic and overall website performance.Lastly, you need to understand how they measure and track progress. They should have metrics in place, tracking monthly changes. This isn't just about numbers; it's about revealing the story they tell and how it impacts your business. A good agency ties its efforts to lead generation and revenue impact. After all, your SEO journey should translate into real-world success.


Choosing the right SEO agency can help your business thrive. However, in an industry where results take months to surface, the wrong choice means wasted time and money.Don't leave your business success to chance â€” pick the right SEO agency by prioritizing transparency, past results, detailed plans, content and backlink quality and effective reporting.

      Key Takeaways    



        Why Google will start purging abandoned accounts
      


        How to prepare and avoid a massive Gmail bounce rate
      












    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

""If a Google Account has not been used or signed into for at least two years, we may delete the account and its contents,"" Google announced in a blog post, and that time is coming soon. In December, the tech giant will begin removing inactive accounts along with their content across Google Workspace, which includes Gmail. The policy applies only to personal Google accounts â€” but for businesses like yours, that may result in a spike in bounces.Why Google will start purging abandoned accountsGoogle's decision to weed out inactive accounts is another step the company is taking to prevent security threats like spam, phishing and account hijacking.""If an account hasn't been used for an extended period of time, it is more likely to be compromised,"" Google's VP of Product Management Ruth Kricheli explains. Abandoned accounts have weaknesses bad actors could exploit. Old passwords and a lack of two-factor authentication make them vulnerable and ""a vector for unwanted or even malicious content, like spam,"" adds Kricheli.



How to prepare and avoid a massive Gmail bounce rateFor businesses like yours that use email to connect with customers and prospects, Google's move is a high bounce rate alert. With Gmail being the largest email provider in the world, your email list likely contains many personal Gmail accounts, especially if your business caters to consumers.Email providers consider a bounce rate under 2% acceptable. But once you've crossed that threshold, your emails can start landing in the spam folder. Bounces tarnish your sender reputation, which is a 0 to 100 score Internet service providers (ISPs) use to determine whether you're a legitimate sender or a spammer. The closer to 100 your score is, the more ISPs trust you as a sender â€“ and deliver your messages to the inbox. Lower scores mean your emails could be spam.


So, how can you prepare beforehand and avoid emailing addresses that may bounce? Being proactive is much easier than fixing the damage.Related: 5 Simple Tweaks for Better Email DeliverabilityRemove inactive subscribers Many businesses hold on to subscribers longer than they should. Having a sizable email list can give you a wider reach. However, in email marketing, engagement trumps such vanity metrics. Also, if someone hasn't opened your emails in more than six months, what are the chances they'll ever start engaging again?So, segment unengaged subscribers and try to win them back with an enticing offer. Make sure you put it right in the subject line and preview text so they can't miss it. Then, remove non-openers and keep only prospects who click. Before Google starts deleting them, it's best to prune these accounts yourself to avoid any bounces.


Validate your entire email listObserving how your inactive subscribers react to a targeted campaign gives you useful audience insights. But inactive subscribers aren't the only risky types of contacts you could have on your list. Abuse emails, for instance, belong to individuals who tend to report many emails as spam. To avoid potential spam complaints, some email marketers prefer to weed them out using an email verifier.There's also the issue of temporary email addresses, which many people use to avoid giving out their real address. Temporary emails self-destruct and cause your emails to bounce, so deleting them from your database is good prevention.On average, almost a quarter of your database goes bad yearly, according to ZeroBounce's Email List Decay Report. The upcoming Gmail purge will only add to this natural data decay, so validate your list again to ensure it's safe to use.How Google will delete inactive accountsWhile Google's policy took effect in May 2023, it won't affect inactive Gmail users until December. The tech company will delete abandoned accounts in several phases, starting with those people created and never used again. Could you have any such email addresses in your database? Check your email marketing reports. If any subscribers signed up for your emails but never opened your messages, remove them immediately.


Related: How to give your email marketing a boost ahead of the holidaysAbandoned accounts are hurting your email marketingAs a business owner trying to reach your customers' inboxes, you must always be aware of your sender reputation. Bounces and spam complaints affect it dramatically, but so does poor engagement.When people don't react to the emails you send, ISPs interpret that as an indication that your content isn't helpful. As a result, your emails are more likely to go to the junk folder. That's why email marketing best practices involve regularly pruning unresponsive subscribers. Their mere presence on your email list hurts your email deliverability. And when they'll start bouncing, the damage will be even more severe.So, reevaluate the health of your email list so that your newsletters and campaigns can make it to the inbox. The Gmail purge is the best reason to look into the quality of your contacts today.

That's because search engines view quality websites as reliable, so if your content is good enough to get an endorsement from them, it benefits your credibility with search engines.But how do you recognize a quality backlink?


A quality backlink comes from a real website with a real audience. You should avoid private blog networks or link farms, as backlinks from these sources are only going to hurt your search engine rankings in the long run.A quality website has a high domain rating or domain authority and good SEO standings. For the backlink to have the most impact, it should come from a website in a relevant niche and it should be a do-follow.Forum backlinks, blog comment backlinks and links from self-publishing platforms like Reddit, Medium and Quora have little impact on your website.2. Leverage competitor backlinks to your advantageOne of the best ways to get backlinks is to analyze your competitors' link-building efforts and leverage those insights to your advantage.


To begin, you need to run a competitor's website through your favorite SEO tool to get a list of their backlinks. Next, you should analyze why each website links to your competitor's content.Was it active link building? If that seems to be the case, you can also reach out to that website and arrange a backlink.Was it a product feature? In this case, you can reach out to the journalist or a blogger and offer exclusive access to your tool or service in exchange for a featured mention.Maybe your competitor's content contains unique data or high-quality infographics that attract more backlinks. If that's the case, you need to focus on creating better-quality content to outshine them.

Everyone knows how valuable backlinks are in 2023, and nobody will give you one unless you offer them value.For example, you can offer to give back a link from your website or include a backlink to their website in a future guest post. Maybe you can share their content to your social media following or to your email list of 5,000 plus people.The important thing is to know what you can offer your link-building prospects and really capitalize on that.


4. Create useful resourcesQuality websites are careful about who they link to. They want to provide their readers with the best possible experience, and if your website doesn't offer any value, there's no reason why they should give you a backlink.Creating useful resources is a great way to improve your passive and active link-building efforts. According to 70% of SEO experts, creating data and research content attracts the most backlinks.You can also use valuable content for active link building. For example, if you create a useful resource â€” like an interesting case study or data from an in-depth survey about the current state of your industry â€” quality websites are more likely to link to it than some generic blog post.In a nutshell, the more valuable your content is, the more likely people are to link to you.


5. Build relationshipsInstead of chasing one-off links, you can benefit more from building long-term relationships with bloggers. Begin by offering value â€” share their content, provide insights or help them out on a small project. Keep the lines of communication open, and drop a genuine comment or share from time to time.Investing in these types of relationships can result in more backlinks in the future. For example, after establishing a solid connection with a blogger, you can leverage that relationship to build another backlink or link to another partner website as a favor.Related: 12 Tips for Creating Meaningful Business Relationships OnlineWith quality content creation being easier than ever, backlinks are still one of the most important factors search engines use to rank your content.


You need to embrace quality over quantity, learn from competitors, provide value, create invaluable resources and foster lasting relationships. That way, you'll easily conquer the link-building world and start ranking high on search engines.

58,Google Is Mass Deleting Accounts This Week â€” Here's How To Make Sure Yours Is Safe,"Nov 28, 2023",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/google-purging-inactive-accounts-this-weekhow-to-save/466061,"
If it's been a while since you checked your primary, secondary, or burner Google account, you might want to log inâ€”before it's removed forever.Google will begin removing inactive accounts this week on Thursday, December 1, along with all of the account's data and contents, which includes everything such as emails, documents, photosâ€”even calendar events.Here's what to know about the upcoming account purge.



Why is Google deleting inactive accounts?According to a company blog post published in May, Google's VP of Product Management Ruth Kricheli said that the action would be taken in an attempt to protect Google users from security threats including phishing scams and account hijacking.""If an account hasn't been used for an extended period of time, it is more likely to be compromised,"" Kricheli wrote. ""Our internal analysis shows abandoned accounts are at least 10x less likely than active accounts to have 2-step verification set up. Meaning, these accounts are often vulnerable, and once an account is compromised, it can be used for anything from identity theft to a vector for unwanted or even malicious content, like spam.""


What accounts are eligible for deletion?Google will begin wiping out accounts that have been inactive for two or more years.Business accounts and accounts affiliated with educational institutions and companies will not be affected, regardless of their last time of login or usage.""This update aligns our policy with industry standards around retention and account deletion and also limits the amount of time Google retains your unused personal information,"" Google said.When will Google start deleting inactive accounts?Google will be taking a ""phased"" approach to deleting inactive accounts starting December 1.The company noted that accounts that are on the chopping block have been receiving notices and warnings over the past few months of the upcoming purge.How do I prevent my account from being deleted?Use it or lose itâ€”and as soon as possible.This can be done by simply logging in and sending an email, using Google Drive, or even watching a YouTube video or conducting a Google search while logged into your account.In order to have no risk of deletion, it's important to log in or perform one of these actions at least once every two years.

60,How to Master the 5 Primary Challenges in Online Verification,"Nov 27, 2023",Ihar Kliashchou,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-to-master-the-5-primary-challenges-in-online/465181,"
Implementing a new technology into a business process usually sounds daunting for most companies. This phase may create a slew of concerns, from picking the right solution to dealing with a potential increase in churn rate if customers dislike the update. Such a scenario is typical when companies deploy an identity verification (IDV) solution.According to a 2023 Regula global survey, 65% of organizations have already implemented IDV solutions. Significantly, among companies not using the practice now, 94% would consider deploying it in the next year.However, few can avoid emerging difficulties at different IDV deployment stages. With no guidance at hand, many inevitably make common mistakes. In this article, we'll focus on the major constraints on the road to a smooth online IDV flow and address the doubts of stakeholders associated with it.



1. Identifying business needs for identity verification implementationDetermining the intentions behind including an IDV component in a corporate system is a big hurdle. This task often involves one or two employees researching and making choices. Unfortunately, in many cases, these initial people don't always completely understand the business needs. They might be IT department guys who also manage other parts of the corporate infrastructure and have vague ideas about the business needs and end-user expectations. As a result, their choices might be based on wrong assumptions.The first step, often overlooked, is mapping out a detailed project charter. The document should include the company's goals and the key benefits it expects by adopting the solution - whether it's about enhanced security, streamlined user experience, business growth or compliance. It helps determine critical features and find the right IDV vendor and solution that meets all initial requirements. Naturally, the task should be assigned to specialists with the right skills.


Preparing the final document with the critical business needs and goals agreed upon with key stakeholders helps keep all the parties of the process on the same page.Related: Here's Why Passwordless Authentication Is Better for the Business Environment2. Data protection challengeData protection issues continue to be a barrier to IDV adoption for 42% of the companies surveyed by Regula.For those concerned, we recommend choosing wisely between the two commonly used scenarios for IDV implementation: Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and on-premises solutions.


Available on cloud infrastructure, SaaS solutions save time and expenses. Almost everything is the vendor's headache. However, the software developer's reliability is critical. Clients should review the vendor's data security and protection policies that help evaluate and address all risks associated with security concerns.On-premises solutions deployed in a trusted in-house perimeter are likely more secure. Access to customer data is not shared with third parties, which reduces security risks. That makes these kinds of solutions more solid but potentially more costly. Additionally, with all power comes responsibility. When choosing on-premises IDV, companies need a data access policy covering all aspects of handling sensitive information.Unluckily, data breach risks are always present, regardless of the chosen path. Still, the second scenario gives more control over the situation. It's also worth remembering that hybrid IDV solutions combining the two approaches are also available.Related: The Proactive Solution to Data Protection That Every Modern Business Should Be Using


3. The cost of securing an overly complex tech environmentAny IDV system requires a complex tech environment, including data processing and storage components, which is a big challenge for many businesses, as 40% of companies mentioned in the survey.The cost of an IDV system varies depending on the industry, business size, and current infrastructure. It comes down to what the particular company's needs are. It's possible to start with a more affordable cloud-based solution to cover the bare essentials. As the company's database (and business) grows, a slow transition to on-premises IDV is an option. Moreover, the cost of ownership for in-house systems can be significantly lower than the initial expenses. For cloud-based solutions, this rule often works in reverse.Another factor that may significantly affect total costs is the comprehensiveness of the solution. Mixing different components from multiple providers to create a custom system is commonplace. However, this approach often requires more funds for implementation time and ongoing interoperability maintenance. That's why 28% of enterprises prefer single-vendor solutions containing all the essentials for biometric and ID checks.Requesting the vendor's roadmap at the consideration stage enables businesses to understand how the solution will evolve. It helps plan for implementing future functionality and avoid possible mismatch issues, making the solution easier to maintain.


Related: 5 Strategies for Tech Companies to Level Up Their Green Credentials4. Concerns regarding the ability to detect new types of fraudIdentity fraud detection is one of the key motivations behind implementing an IDV system. Threats are constantly evolving, and now we are seeing waves of more sophisticated fraud. The Regula survey found that, in 2023, most organizations have already faced the latest types of fraud: 37% experiencing deepfake voice fraud and 29% falling victim to deepfake videos. Moreover, most businesses, especially from the US, expect these threats to grow within the next two years.IDV vendors try to keep up with the topical issues associated with identity fraud. That is another point where the developer's roadmap can be a key factor for companies in their search: evaluating the software features designed to detect sophisticated attacks and scams can be very insightful and a great differentiator. Typically, vendors with in-house R&D have more possibilities to track new identity fraud risks and address them promptly.5. Finding the right balance between security and customer experienceFinally, businesses are paying extra attention to customer experience (CX). According to the survey, improved CX is the main determinant of success for 55% of organizations that deploy online identity verification procedures. To compare: in 2023, this factor is more crucial than reduced security (50%) and legal (45%) risks.


When chasing the best CX, businesses can often sacrifice some security fundamentals. On the other hand, a long and complicated identity verification process can lead to higher abandonment rates. That's why finding a balanceâ€”an ideal point between these opposite polesâ€”is vital.The story doesn't end when the solution is implemented. The next stage involves maintaining the system, including regular performance monitoring and updates.That's when complete, timely support from the vendor and the company's representatives responsible for the task â€” business process analysts and IT specialists â€” play a decisive role. This helps businesses reach their crucial aim â€” to stay competitive and compliant.

63,"To Maximize Your Profits This Black Friday, You Need to Collect More Than Your Customers Dollars","Nov 14, 2023",Gene Marks,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/to-maximize-your-profits-this-black-friday-you-need-to/464741,"
Black Friday â€” the day after Thanksgiving â€” is the biggest shopping day of the year and the start of the holiday season, which, for many retailers, can contribute as much as 30% of their annual sales. So it's a big day. But if you think Black Friday is just about the holiday season, you're wrong.Of course, the day is important for the holidays. Black Friday was the biggest day for in-store shopping in the U.S. in 2022, reaching 72.9 million consumers, up almost 15% year over year. But it's just as important for after the holidays. That's because Black Friday isn't just about sales. It's really about data.My smartest clients know this. And they make it a priority to leverage Black Friday as a way to collect as much information as they can from everyone entering their store. Why? Because the data they collect will help drive sales long after the holidays have ended.



Retailers of all sizes face a significant drop-off in sales after the holidays, and it's always a struggle to generate demand. But it doesn't have to be that way. The data you collect from your Black Friday traffic can boost your sales in those slow winter months. So, how to do this? You need a reason for the customer to stay engaged.For starters, collect an email at checkout. Asking for a ""like"" or a positive online review is great, but you're not collecting data that way. Asking for an email is a way for you to control the engagement. It's true that sometimes some won't want to share, and that's fine, too, because people have to opt in if you're going to market to them online. So encourage them. Say that you'll add them to your special ""VIP Customer Club,"" which will make them eligible to receive future discounts and special promotions. Some retailers ask if a customer would like a receipt emailed, and that's another good way to collect that information.


Another strategy is to push your visitors to your website. Hopefully, you're selling your products not just in your store but also via an ecommerce platform. If you don't, you really should because my most successful clients sell products through multiple channels. On Black Friday, offer a special promotion for customers who choose to purchase products online or special products that are only offered online. When someone buys from you online, you're collecting their data, and you can give them the option to have their email added to your VIP club at checkout. At the very least, you'll be collecting physical shipping/ordering data that can be used for future postcard mailings.Consider a raffle. It's simple and old school, but it's an effective way to collect an email address or physical mailing address. Have them drop a business card or fill out a form to get a product or service for free and, of course, ask on that form for permission to add to your VIP Club. Your cost of giving away free stuff is minimal compared to the benefit of using that data for future marketing.Many of my retail clients do events. These are the businesses that generally offer experiences or lifestyle products, and they enjoy doing in-store events to further educate their community. The pandemic taught us that doing these events online can also work. Schedule an event for January or February and promote it in your store. People would need to sign up for this event, so have an online or physical way to do this in order to capture their information.Partner with others. All of the above activities can be replicated by friends of yours on the Main Street. By offering co-promotions with some of them, you can pool your resources and share your data. This way, you can potentially double the amount of information you're collecting on Black Friday.


Finally, use a loyalty program. The suggestions I've made above would incur minimal cost. But if you want to step things up - and pay more â€” you can subscribe to retail loyalty platforms like Clutch, Recharge, Smile.io and others. These platforms â€” which are mainly designed for mobile use â€” allow your customers to accumulate points, get access to gift cards, belong to a recurring program, join certain membership tiers and take advantage of VIP ""exclusive"" offerings. They provide real-time data analysis of program usage, can be customized, and also integrate with other software.These are all great ways to collect the data you need. But the most important thing is what to do with the data once you have it. And for this, you need a good customer relationship management (CRM) program.A CRM is merely a database that will store whatever information you obtain about anyone who's walked into your store. Some loyalty platforms and most point-of-sale systems either offer this capability or can be integrated with a standalone CRM system, and there are many platforms available at an affordable price. You will use this database to build demographics and sales history about your customers.When a CRM system is used the right way, no customer â€” or prospective customer â€” falls through the cracks. Using the data you've collected on Black Friday and throughout the holiday season, they should be receiving regular (opt-in) emails or postcards from you about product offerings, events or other activities at your store. You can leverage the data to target specific customers based on what they've purchased from you. You can use the data to create lookalike campaigns on both Facebook and Google, where you can target online ads directly to them. As you build this database, you'll build a community of customers that you can go back to year after year.


And that's the most important thing about Black Friday. It's not just one day of sales. It's also a day to collect data for future sales. If you approach it that way, you'll see a revenue increase that can extend far beyond the holiday season.

65,5 Common SEO Mistakes That Are Killing Your Rankings,"Nov 10, 2023",Nick Zviadadze,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-common-seo-mistakes-that-are-killing-your-rankings/464843,"
After Google rolled out its latest core algorithm update, many websites saw a steep decline in their search engine rankings. The Search Engine Optimization (SEO) game has changed, and you need to adjust your approach if you don't want your website to get left behind.From what I've seen in the past year, most of the websites lost their rankings because they were making the same exact SEO mistakes. In this article, I'm going to outline five common SEO mistakes I've seen in 2023 and explain how to avoid them.Related: 5 Simple SEO Strategies to Improve Your Rankings



What is SEO and why is it important?SEO is the practice of optimizing a website and its content to improve search engine rankings. It involves various approaches, from on-page optimization to fine-tuning the technical details. The main goal of all of these strategies is to secure the top positions on search engine result pages.In a nutshell, SEO is a vital element of online success because it can:


Boost online visibilityDrive organic trafficProve your authorityImprove user experienceDespite search engines and SEO constantly evolving, businesses don't always follow the best â€” or most updated â€” SEO practices. Here are the five most common SEO mistakes I've seen in 2023 that can tank your search engine rankings.1. Focusing on SEO busy workSEO is a complex field, and many business owners don't know where to focus their efforts for the best results. So, what they do is try different SEO strategies and approaches, often doing too much.The truth is, you don't need to audit your website five or six times a year and fixate on adjusting every little detail. Instead, you want to focus your efforts on the biggest needle movers â€” content creation and link-building.Your website's content should be at the heart of your SEO strategy. It's what can cause search engine algorithms to rank your website high and what can attract, engage and turn your website visitors into customers. Similarly, building backlinks signals that your website is trustworthy and authoritative, boosting your search engine rankings.


Focusing on content creation and link-building will most likely have the biggest impact on your SEO success, especially if your website is new.2. Having low content velocityContent velocity involves creating more content quickly. The logic is simple â€” you can't rank for what you don't have. So, more content means more chances to rank for relevant keywords.However, many websites have low content velocity, which sabotages their SEO potential. They focus on publishing one article per week, which is usually not enough.Let's say you publish four articles today. In about six months, you should have four ranking articles. Now, double that publishing rate, and you'll have eight ranking articles, effectively having doubled your SEO performance.


The takeaway is this: The faster you publish, the faster you're going to rank.Related: 5 Essential SEO Strategies For Entrepreneurs to Boost Their Traffic3. Doing selfish link-buildingIn 2023, everyone knows the importance of backlinks. This means nobody is going to give you one for free. And why should they? Instead, these days, most websites ask for compensation when providing a backlink.The problem? Paid link-building is against Google's guidelines. Fortunately, there is a way to bypass this and get backlinks for free. In your outreach emails, focus on what you can offer your prospect.


Here are three ""offers"" that have worked for me in the past:Reciprocal linking: Propose to link back to their website when they give you a backlink.Future guest posts: Offer to link to their website in a future guest post.Quality content: Deliver an in-depth, keyword-optimized blog post relevant to their niche.4. Relying on ad hoc keyword researchSome people have a very ad hoc approach to keyword research. They do it weekly, choosing keywords randomly and creating content around them. The problem with this approach is that you never get a comprehensive view of your niche.As a result, you don't know whether the keywords you're choosing are optimal because there's no frame of reference. To fix this, you should cast a wider net and find as many keywords as possible. Think 200 to 300 keywords that provide you with enough content material for the next few years.From there, you can see what keywords bring the most value. You can compare keyword intent, search volume and difficulty ranking to discover the best options. The more comprehensive you are in the initial stage of your keyword research, the better your SEO outcomes will be in the long run.Related: 5 Common Keyword Research Mistakes and How to Avoid Them


5. Building low-quality backlinksWhen it comes to link-building, quality is more important than quantity. High-quality backlinks can give you a significant ranking boost, helping your website reach the first page of search results.Low-quality backlinks, on the other hand, spell trouble. At best, they won't have any impact on your rankings. At worst, they'll lead to your site getting penalized and losing rankings. So, how do you know which backlinks are good?You can assess backlink quality by:Checking quality metrics (DA, DR)Analyzing the website's SEO performance (monthly traffic)Ensuring topical relevanceAssessing trustworthiness (is the site legitimate?)Avoiding backlink farmsRemember, one high-quality backlink is worth more than 10 low-quality ones.Steering clear of these five common SEO mistakes is vital to maintaining your website's search engine rankings in 2023.By focusing more on content creation, upkeeping content velocity, avoiding selfish link-building, conducting comprehensive keyword research and prioritizing quality backlinks, you can set up your SEO strategy for success.

No matter your industry, Big Data and analytics are fundamentally changing how businesses operate and make decisions. Throw in a culture of rapid digital transformation, and the expectations for leadership roles are shifting at an unprecedented rate.It's no longer sufficient for C-suite executives and senior leaders to simply excel in traditional management skills such as strategic vision and people management. Now, the currency of effective leadership also includes an intimate understanding of data analytics.Consider just a few of the ways that Big Data and analytics are driving decisions in the modern workplace:



Customer analysis to better understand customer needs, preferences and behaviors.Predictive models to forecast future trends or performance.Risk analysis to identify potential threats and opportunities.A recent survey proves the power of data analytics: 44% of executives consider data crucial for strategic decision-making, while 37% believe it offers deeper insights into their business.As a C-suite executive, an ability to interpret data-driven insights from these types of analyses can create a competitive advantage for climbing the corporate ladder. But how should you get started with data analytics?


Related: Five Ways Big Data Can Help Your Business SucceedThe evolving landscape of modern leadershipThere was a time when the primary expectations for senior leaders were aspects like visionary thinking, strategic planning and people management. While these skills remain vital, the technological revolution has introduced a new dimension to leadership: data literacy.The arrival of ""Big Data"" and the learning models that drive it have made data literacy increasingly crucial for executives. Data literacy involves reading, analyzing and communicating insights from vast volumes of data. It requires understanding statistics and techniques like machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).As a senior leader, your ability to understand and use this data boosts team effectiveness and positions you as a forward-thinking executive. Consider KPIs â€” the backbone of performance management. By interpreting the data, gain insights into team performance and areas for improvement.


This enables you to make better decisions and have more informed conversations with your team members. Plus, understanding the basics of machine learning helps you identify opportunities for automation or optimization that may have been missed.Strategies for integrating data analytics into leadershipIf data literacy is a new skill that can boost your career, the question becomes: How can you cultivate this skill to help your resume rise up the ranks? For senior leaders interested in harnessing the power of data analytics for career growth, here are some strategies to consider:Develop a data-driven mindsetBefore diving into tools and techniques, developing a data-driven mindset is crucial. Start by asking data-based questions in meetings, challenging assumptions with empirical evidence, and encouraging your team to do the same.

67,How to Use Predictive Analytics for Improved Marketing and Customer Satisfaction,"Oct 19, 2023",Murali Nethi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-use-predictive-analytics-for-improved-marketing-and/463553,"
As the volume and variety of customer data continue to grow exponentially, predictive analytics has emerged as a crucial tool for personalized and relevant marketing. By analyzing past behaviors, preferences, and other attributes, companies can better understand how to engage each customer.Of course, making the most of predictive insights requires more than just data science skills. An empathetic and thoughtful approach is also needed to ensure analytics enhance customer experience, not just drive short-term gains.When applied respectfully with the customer in mind, predictive marketing paves the way for more meaningful one-to-one interactions. Let's explore how companies are leveraging this trick to personalize across the customer lifecycle.



Related: A Complete Guide to Using Predictive Analytics in Your BusinessUnderstanding customers through better segmentationCustomer segmentation involves dividing the customer base into subgroups or segments based on common traits like demographics, purchase habits or preferences. Traditionally, businesses relied on basic data points for segmentation, but predictive analytics takes it to the next level by uncovering hidden patterns. For instance, it can recognize that:


Customers from a particular city are more likely to purchase high-end products if offered an easy payment option.Young families tend to make repeat purchases around holidays and vacations.Loyal customers who purchase multiple times yearly have a higher chance of upgrading to premium offerings.Armed with these deeper insights, companies can create highly tailored segments instead of relying on basic criteria. This level of precision is crucial to developing marketing strategies that truly resonate with each group. For example, loyalty programs and special discounts can be designed specifically for high-value customers.Related: 10 Reasons Why Good Customer Service Is Your Most Important MetricCreating targeted marketing campaignsOnce customer segments are identified, predictive analytics further enhances marketing by predicting customer needs and recommending the best offers, content, and messaging for acquisition or re-engagement. For instance:Past purchase history can indicate the likelihood of a specific customer needing a particular product or service shortly. Proactively communicating related offers at the right time can drive consideration and conversion.Web browsing and search data reveal customer interests, which can be used to serve personalized, relevant, contextual ads.Social listening helps identify trends and comments, which offers an opportunity to design campaigns addressing pain points or anticipating upcoming demands.Analyzing seasonality and locality helps maximize results by predicting the best times, channels, and creative elements for each campaign.In essence, instead of relying on generic mass marketing, predictive analytics facilitates creating campaigns that are tailor-fitted for individual customer groups down to an individual level through personalized touchpoints. This precision and relevance make the marketing far more impactful and drives better engagement and response.


Optimizing spending based on potentialA core benefit of predictive analytics is the ability to estimate customer lifetime value and predict future potential or churn risk for each segment. Armed with this information, marketing budgets can be apportioned strategically to concentrate resources on high-potential groups while neglecting low-yield or declining segments.For example, consider two customer segments: loyal customers with a 2-5-year history of repeat purchases and new customers from the last six months. While both are important, predictive models can recognize that:Loyal customers have a much higher lifetime value due to their ongoing spending patterns. Extra efforts should be made to retain them through incentives and superior experiences.New customers have uncertainty around long-term loyalty. Resources should be invested carefully here by analyzing their initial interactions for signs of commitment or disengagement.Similarly, for acquisition campaigns, predictive scoring helps identify audiences with the highest propensity to convert rather than relying on broad targeting. This ensures marketing efficiency by focusing budgets on areas with maximum return potential. Over time, as predictions evolve, spending allocation can also be tweaked continuously for optimal results.Related: How Various Industries Are Depending On Predictive Analytics


Measuring effectiveness and continuous improvementThe true promise of predictive analytics is initiating better campaigns and constantly optimizing them through ongoing measurement and refinement of models. The post-campaign analysis incorporates outcome data like clicks, purchases, or churn to assess:Which segments/individuals responded most positively to tailored offers and content.Whether the predicted probabilities aligned with actual consumer actions.How external factors like competitor actions, events, or trends influence performance.Measuring campaign success, identifying deviations, and feeding real outcomes into models strengthens their accuracy. Predictions and strategies can be dynamically adjusted as patterns from new responsive behaviors are uncovered.For example, a loyalty program can find higher-than-expected churn in customers predicted to be low-risk. And analyzing their actions can reveal reasons like poor product quality affecting a demographic. This feedback loop allows predictive capabilities to continually evolve by learning from successes and failures.Those willing to embrace this transformation are well-positioned not just to meet but exceed customer expectations - and stay firmly ahead of the competition.


Embracing a data-driven approach through user-friendly software is an important step towards personalized, impactful marketing at scale. By acting on predictive intelligence, you can strengthen relationships with existing customers while acquiring new ones relevant to your business.

Google announced on Tuesday it's hoping to make entering passwords a thing of the past with more widespread adoption of its ""passkey"" feature, which launched earlier this year.""We'll continue encouraging the industry to make the pivot to passkeys â€” making passwords a rarity, and eventually obsolete,"" the company wrote in the release.To use passkeys, users employ a fingerprint, face scan, or PIN to unlock a device, a system that the company says is ""40% faster than passwords.""Google emphasized that passkeys are phishing-resistant and employ specific cryptography that ensures they are secure.Still, the company recognizes that new technologies take time to become mainstream, and making passkeys a default setting won't happen overnight. Traditional passwords ""may be around for a little while,"" the release added, so users will still have the option to use a password for signing in if they wish. Users can also opt out of passkeys by disabling the ""Skip password when possible"" feature in their settings.Other tech giants such as Uber and eBay have already implemented passkey options for users on their platforms. Apple also began offering passkeys with the launch of iOS 16, which allows users to ditch traditional passwords instead of passkeys across apps and linked accounts on iCloud.

70,How to Use Data-Driven Marketing Strategies to Maximize Your Investments,"Oct 11, 2023",Jessica Wong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-use-data-driven-marketing-strategies-to-maximize/459462,"
Explore the dynamic landscape of data-driven marketing and its transformative impact on businesses of all sizes and industries. From harnessing consumer insights to optimizing ad spend and driving engagement, this article delves into the strategies and technologies that empower modern marketers to thrive in the digital era. Discover how data-driven campaigns, including programmatic advertising, are revolutionizing the way brands connect with their audiences and achieve remarkable results.What is data-driven marketing?Data-driven marketing puts data at the heart of all marketing decisions with the goal of making every marketing effort relevant to a brand's audiences, interests and behaviors. Consumer data determines which creatives will be used, which marketing channels the brand will select, and how those creatives will be presented.As opposed to listening to input from in-house teams such as finance or product development, data-driven marketers prioritize insights gained from actual customers. Their goal is to optimize each aspect of their strategy for consumer connection.



Related: 10 Elements of a Successful Data-Driven Marketing StrategyThe impact of data-driven marketingLeading brands have been using data-driven marketing for a few years to great effect. Just five years ago, those brands were in the minority. A 2018 study by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found only 2% of businesses qualified as 'best-in-class' at data-driven marketing. However, these few were rewarded with up to 20% more revenue and 30% more cost savings compared to their competitors.


Since then, the pandemic disrupted virtually every industry. As customer behaviors changed rapidly, older data-driven models were no longer working. As a result, some brands reverted to mass marketing while others doubled down on targeting and tried an even more precise approach, according to marketing specialists at McKinsey & Co.Over the past two years, consumer behavior has shifted, retaining some of the pandemic-induced changes but also starting to become more predictable once again. Consequently, brands are adapting their marketing strategies.A 2023 survey by Hubspot showed that far more brands are now using a data-driven approach. 36% of marketers confirmed that data was essential for understanding customers. 32% believed that investing in data gathering boosted ROI.Related: Your Data-Driven Marketing Is Harmful. I Should Know: I Ran Marketing at Google and Instagram


Harnessing consumer insightsSo, how can brands use data to maximize ROI?Harnessing consumer insights to inform campaign planning and implementation is one of the most effective ways to increase ROI. Brands can gain those insights by analyzing consumers' behaviors, opinions and thoughts and encouraging consumers to share real experiences with a brand.Encouraging customers to share online reviews, distributing surveys or analyzing social media comments can all be part of a brand's approach to data collection. While not all feedback may be positive, each piece of information gives the brand team a concrete insight into the consumer's mind.These insights remove any guesswork from decisions relating to marketing campaigns, prioritizing one product over another and targeting the most promising audiences with campaigns.


Driving consumer engagementBefore digital marketing channels revolutionized how brands connect to their audiences, marketing could be seen as a one-way street of brands talking to audiences. Today, consumer engagement has become one of the essential ingredients of successful marketing.Social media platforms are ideal for real-time consumer engagement. They give brands unparalleled access to consumers in a natural environment instead of a focus group, for example. The most successful brands in this area understand what type of content drives engagement the most and deliver this type of content to their audience.Related: 9 Cool Ways You Can Use Data-Driven Marketing to Gain CustomersOptimizing ad spend with programmatic advertisingMaximizing ROI from digital ads is another item high on the priority list of marketing teams. Effective media buying is one of the keys to this, but it is also a strategy that has traditionally been time-consuming, involving requests for proposals, tenders, negotiations and quotations.


Programmatic advertising is starting to change this. In simple terms, programmatic advertising uses automation and algorithms to streamline media buying. Software takes over instead of a human buyer choosing or bidding on digital advertising space. Website and social media traffic data, information about consumer behavior, demographics and other contextual data support the software's purchase decisions.Using this procedure, brands can target their audiences more precisely and cost-efficiently. The success of this approach is reflected in the growing programmatic advertising spending across the United States. Experts believe that spending is set to increase from $127 billion in 2023 to $168 billion in 2024.Brands can use this approach to optimize their campaigns in real-time based on the feedback received by the software. It is an excellent opportunity to enhance a campaign's ROI.Applying programmatic advertising in practiceIf that sounds a little too technical, here are two examples to bring programmatic advertising to life.


Dynamic Creative Optimization. Even if you have not heard of dynamic creative optimization, it has almost certainly targeted you. Assuming you searched for flights to a tropical island. A resort chain on that island then uses DCO to present personalized accommodation adverts in that destination. As you continue browsing, you see more of their adverts. The content changes dynamically, displaying updated prices and limited offers to convince you to book a vacation.Retargeting Abandoned Shopping Carts. Potential customers abandoning orders can be a significant problem for eCommerce businesses. Programmatic advertising allows those businesses to place adverts in front of you, reminding you to complete your purchase. Sometimes, brands may even offer incentives to persuade consumers to pick up where they left off.ConclusionData-driven marketing allows brands to target consumers more precisely than ever before. As digital marketing and advertising platforms continue to evolve, data collection and analysis must adapt to new environments and circumstances. One thing is clear: few brands, if any, will thrive without solid data-driven marketing practices. Start putting yours in place now!

71,What Separates Thriving Restaurants From Failing Ones? Here Is the Key Ingredient Entrepreneurs Can Harness to Unlock Success.,"Oct 9, 2023",Greg Davis,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/why-you-cant-afford-to-ignore-your-restaurants-internet/459362,"
The internet is a key factor in the growth and development of modern businesses, and restaurants are not immune to its effects. A strong internet connection for a restaurant fuels more than just the free public Wi-Fi service offered to customers. The challenges brought forth by 2020 proved that internet health is a vital component of a strong restaurant business.In fact, the digital divide is becoming increasingly evident in the restaurant world, and those who utilize the internet and tech well will survive. While a strong internet connection is critical for many reasons, these ten are the most pressing.Related: Business Network Health â€” Why You Must Prioritize It (and What It Could Cost If You Don't)



1. Utilize cloud-based POS systemsManaging orders and inventory starts with a robust POS system. Fast internet allows restaurants to use cloud-based systems that provide real-time updates of both orders and shrinking inventory. Both wait staff and guests benefit from the ability to turn tables more quickly, lessening wait times and making the time from walking in the door to getting food on the table faster. Because of the reliance on online POS systems, many restaurants, like the fast-growing pizza chain Jet's Pizza, now choose secondary internet connections to ensure their POS is always on.2. Offer online ordering (and home delivery)Restaurant guests are growing increasingly accustomed to having restaurant food at home. A healthy internet connection at your restaurant means easy online ordering for your customers. Slow connections contribute to abandoned orders and lost revenue. Robust internet connectivity also increases your ability to offer delivery service.


Related: Best POS Systems of 20243. Streamline your payment processingWhether you rely on a simple Square Reader system or a complex POS processor, your ability to take card payments is crucial to your success as a restaurant. According to the Pew Research Center, 41% of Americans make none of their weekly purchases using cash, and only 14% say they use cash for all of their payments. Cash is on the way out, and you need strong internet to take card payments and continue producing revenue for your customers.4. Take real-time reservationsModern restaurant guests appreciate the time savings of a reservation, and the internet allows you to take reservations without impacting your daily operations and taking up staff time. However, again, this requires a strong internet connection to track and access those reservations when the guest arrives at the restaurant, ensuring their table is ready for them.5. Keep data safe and secureData is increasingly essential to the modern restaurant. Keeping that data secure and backed up requires a flawless internet connection. Without the internet, you cannot track sales receipts, guest preference information and data about inventory in real time.


Related: 6 Easy Tips to Speed Up Your Internet Connection6. Build a social media and online presenceWhen you have a reliable internet connection, you will be able to build an online presence more efficiently, and that's critical to your restaurant marketing. Not only can you quickly upload photos and videos to your social media channels, but your guests can do so as well. The more engaging your online presence, the more effective your restaurant will be; a strong internet connection makes that happen.7. Improve customer service through better communicationCustomers choose to communicate with the modern restaurant through online chats, reviews and emails. If you have a weak internet connection, those messages will be delayed at best and lost at worst. Fast, friendly responses to customer communication are essential to the guest experience, requiring a fast internet connection.8. Update digital menus in real-timeDigital menus are becoming increasingly popular. QR code menus allow guests to browse on their phones while their table is prepared, and they eliminate the need to keep paper menus sanitary between guests. They also allow you to update in real time if you run out of a popular dish. Over half of restaurant guests say they appreciate a QR code digital menu that is kept up-to-date. Again, this requires a good internet connection to use well.


Related: Best Credit Card Processors of 20249. Use Wi-Fi to improve guest ambianceDo you want your guests (and staff) to be in a good mood while they are in your restaurant? Then, upload a soothing or fun playlist using your internet connection. Do you want to make your restaurant convenient for your guests? Free Wi-Fi in the building can also help. They can do research or play online games while they wait. Parents can even use the connection to keep antsy kids occupied and the noise level down in the restaurant. For these scenarios to play out, your internet connection needs to be healthy.10. Improve overall operational efficiencyWith all of the different moving parts of a busy restaurant, from scheduling to inventory management, you will need your tech to function properly. Again, this requires strong internet. Both the back-of-house team and the front-of-house team need the internet to do their jobs.This list is just 10 of the many reasons why a strong internet connection is a vital component of a restaurant. In light of these facts, restaurant owners must prioritize a healthy internet connection â€” it's the backbone of your success and not something you can afford to overlook.

73,A Complete Guide to Local Keyword Research,"Oct 4, 2023",Omar El Bahr,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/a-step-by-step-guide-to-local-keyword-research/459583,"
Keyword research is a major step in any well-planned SEO strategy. This is due to the significance of keywords in things like content optimization and improving ranks on search engine results pages. Usually, keyword research is conducted as the first step to lay the foundation of the whole SEO strategy.Additionally, they are conducted globally, as the main aim of any website is to appear on results pages for people from all around the world and achieve global success. Little did they know that they needed to start locally to succeed globally. But how, you may ask? Easy â€” local keyword research!Related: Local SEO Has a Surprising Impact on Your Business. Here's How to Use It



What is local keyword research?You know how sometimes when you type something into a search engine and then your location, it returns websites that are exactly what you are looking for? Well, I used to think this was magic back in the day. It turns out it is not; it is just a very good local keyword research process. Local keyword research is the process of finding and identifying keywords used by users in your local area.What should you look for in a keyword?Before using any keyword, there are some characteristics that you need to carefully look for. These characteristics are volume, relevance and difficulty. So, let us look into each one.


Volume:The first thing is the volume. The volume of a keyword is the number of searches that have been conducted in search engines for these specific keywords. This volume will be global, with many tools breaking down the global volume to the top countries using it. This is rather beneficial, as it can show you whether or not this keyword is used heavily in your country.Relevancy:The second thing you need to keep an eye on is relevancy. This includes analyzing search intent and seeing which keywords match your content or query. This will help you target keywords that relate to your industry and niche and avoid wasting your efforts on irrelevant keywords.


Difficulty:Difficulty is a major element that you need to keep a good eye on. Keyword difficulty is the extent to which a keyword would be hard to rank on result pages using it. Difficulty usually happens due to a large number of websites using this keyword or the authority of the websites using it, making it hard for others to do the same. Difficulty ranges from 1 to 100, so it is better to choose keywords with low keyword difficulty so it is easier to rank quickly and effectively.Related: 5 Common Research Mistakes and How to Avoid ThemBenefits of conducting local keyword researchCompetitive advantage:


With the mistaken belief that local keywords are less competitive than global ones, many businesses ignore local SEO. You can gain an edge over rivals who aren't investing as much time and energy into local SEO by conducting local keyword research and optimizing your website for targeted local keywords.Enhanced user experience:Including helpful details like your store's address, hours of operation, phone number and contact information is a crucial part of local SEO. Streamlining the process by which users can locate certain pieces of content improves the overall quality of the site's usefulness.Higher conversion rates:


Doing some localized keyword research might help you focus on search terms that have a significant commercial purpose. People who are actively looking for a product or service in their area are more likely to buy it, increasing your conversion rate and improving your return on investment.Build local authority:Building local credibility for your business can be accomplished through the consistent use of local keywords in content and the optimization of a website for local search results. When search engines see that your content is relevant to a specific geographic region, they may give you a higher page rank and earn the trust of those users.A step-by-step guide to conducting local keyword research1. List your services and products and the potential keywords


The first step is listing the products and services that your business offers. For instance, if you own a barber shop, you will list down some things like hair coloring, hair straightening, haircuts and so on. You would need to think about all the possible outcomes. Based on all of these, you would be able to list potential keywords that customers might use as well. For instance, if you are based in Colorado, there is a chance that potential customers will search for ""affordable haircuts in Colorado."" Try to be as creative as possible and think of all the variations that customers could think of.2. Find your target keywords using a keyword research toolAfter coming up with all the potential keywords that customers might use, it is time to validate them. In this step, you will use the powerful capabilities of any local keyword research tool to find which keywords match the ones on your list so that you can start using them.3. Time for a competitor analysis


Think you are done with the local keyword research tool? Well, think again. One of the most important steps of keyword research in general, not only locally, is getting a glimpse of your competitors and seeing what they are doing and what keywords they are using. This will help you get a better understanding of the keywords used in this industry or market and find a way to be ahead of the competition.Related: 14 Easy Ways to Rank Your Website Higher on GoogleBest local keyword research toolsThere are many local keyword research tools that you can find on the market. Therefore, let us suggest a few that you might like.The first one is Ahrefs. Ahrefs is considered one of the first SEO tools on the market, which gives it an authoritative position among all tools. The local keyword research tool on Ahrefs is one of the best among thousands of tools. It allows you to analyze each keyword both globally and locally to get a complete picture of it.

Google Keyword Planner will provide you with accurate insights about any keyword. Additionally, it has a filtering option where you can filter keywords by location to find trending keywords in your local area. I mean, it's Google; what'd you expect?In summary, local keyword research is crucial for optimizing SEO. By focusing on local keywords, businesses can achieve improved visibility and relevancy in their area. The benefits of this localized approach include a competitive edge, increased map visibility, better user experience, higher conversion rates and local authority building.

74,The Next Stage Of Google's Rally Just Started,"Sep 29, 2023",Sam Quirke,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/the-next-stage-of-googles-rally-just-started/462950,"
Despite a sudden 8% drop in the earlier part of the week, shares of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are well on their way to undoing the dip and reclaiming their recent highs. The current rally, underway since last November, has already tacked on as much as 65% to share value. It also puts the stock at its highest level since the start of 2022. This was right around when the pandemic-fueled tech bubble was starting to burst, and it was at the bottom of that subsequent 45% slide where the current rally started.So, all things considered, it's been a good year for Alphabet shares so far. And with last week's dip continuing to be reversed, it's starting to look like the next stage of the rally is about to begin.



Recent HeadwindsThis will be a welcome shift in momentum for the bulls, who were surely starting to get a bit worried with the latest bout of selling. Recent headlines concerning antitrust lawsuits in particular, which for context also included Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), have been among the key headwinds affecting the stock. For a short time earlier this week, it was looking like the start of something serious, with Alphabet shares having their worst week since February. But with Tuesday's low having been snapped up into the close and every session since finishing higher, there's a sense the bears have lost their chance. In many ways, this could be a good thing for Alphabet shares. Even though it might make for pretty reading, rallies that only travel in one direction are rarely sustained and tend to see volatile swings before long. Instead, short bouts of selling, like we've seen with Alphabet over the past week, allow a stock to catch its breath as investors take profits and trim positions. 


Bullish OutlookOne of the key drivers to Alphabet's rally this year has been the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). While it has become arguably the year's biggest buzzword, few companies have shown themselves truly capable of capitalizing on its potential. However, Alphabet is an exception. Earlier this month, the team at Needham named Alphabet as one of those they expect to be a key beneficiary of generative AI. They went so far as to reiterate their Buy rating on Alphabet shares, a move which echoed that of the Bank of America team. In his note to clients earlier this month, analyst Justin Post also slapped a $146 price target onto Alphabet stock, which implies further upside of at least 10% from where they closed on Thursday. If they hit this in the coming sessions, it would also mean they'd set a new high for the current rally and would be that much closer to hitting last year's all-time high. Technical SupportFrom a technical perspective, the long thesis is supported as well. The rally has, to date, been characterized by a series of higher lows and higher highs, which together form the strongest of uptrends and point to a steady stream of buyers coming in from the sidelines on each dip. 


The recent dip was so sudden that it sent Alphabet's Relative Strength Index (RSI) plunging towards 30. While it didn't quite hit that key level, a reading of 39 on Tuesday of this week pointed to fairly oversold conditions, which helps explain the solid run of buying since. Early trading in Friday's pre-market session pointed to this continuing into the weekend.  Getting Involved So, for those of us thinking about getting involved, there's clearly a lot to like. Investors have brushed aside recent headwinds while fundamental and longer-term tailwinds remain in place. From a long-term perspective, the rally has, in many ways, been done a service by the recent dip, and there's every reason to think Alphabet shares will soon be changing hands for more than $140 a pop.

In the context of supply chain management, real-time tracking and visibility are game-changers. IoT devices, such as GPS sensors and RFID tags, provide continuous data streams that allow entrepreneurs to monitor their goods at every stage of the supply chain journey. This means they can pinpoint the exact location of products, monitor their condition and track their movement from manufacturer to distributor to retailer.The benefits are twofold. First, this level of visibility significantly reduces the risk of theft and losses since any anomalies or deviations from the planned route can trigger immediate alerts. Second, it offers valuable insights into the overall efficiency of the supply chain. By analyzing data on delivery times, transportation routes and storage conditions, entrepreneurs can identify areas for improvement, optimize routes and ensure that goods reach their destination faster and in better condition.2. Inventory management:IoT sensors are capable of automating inventory management with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. These sensors can monitor inventory levels in real time and send automatic alerts when stock is running low or when products are approaching their expiration date.


This proactive approach to inventory management has numerous advantages. It prevents stockouts, ensuring that businesses never run out of essential supplies, which can be especially critical for just-in-time manufacturing processes. It also helps in reducing overstock situations, which can tie up capital and storage space. Ultimately, this level of control not only optimizes storage space but also improves cash flow management by reducing excess inventory costs.3. Predictive maintenance:Within the IoT ecosystem, smart technologies can predict when machinery and equipment are likely to fail. IoT sensors on machines can continuously monitor their performance, collecting data on factors such as temperature, vibration and energy consumption. By analyzing this data, predictive maintenance algorithms can identify patterns that indicate when a machine is deviating from its normal operating conditions, suggesting a potential breakdown.This predictive capability is a game-changer for supply chain operations. Instead of relying on scheduled maintenance, which can be costly and lead to unnecessary downtime, businesses can address maintenance needs proactively. This minimizes downtime, reduces repair costs and ensures smooth operations. In essence, it keeps the supply chain running like a well-oiled machine.


4. Reduced costs:IoT-enabled supply chains are inherently more efficient. The real-time data provided by IoT devices allows businesses to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies quickly. For example, if goods are consistently delayed at a particular warehouse or if delivery routes are suboptimal, these issues can be promptly addressed.By optimizing processes and streamlining operations, businesses can significantly reduce costs in various aspects of the supply chain, including transportation, warehousing and labor. For instance, they can minimize fuel consumption by optimizing delivery routes, reduce warehousing costs by better managing inventory levels and enhance labor productivity by automating routine tasks. This cost reduction not only improves profitability but also enables businesses to remain competitive in a rapidly changing market.Related: IoT: Introduction And Disruption Of Supply Chain Management


The power of data analyticsIoT generates an immense amount of data, but its true potential is unlocked through data analytics. Entrepreneurs can harness this data to gain valuable insights into consumer behavior, demand patterns and supply chain performance. By leveraging advanced analytics tools and machine learning algorithms, businesses can make data-driven decisions that enhance their competitiveness.Smart technologies beyond IoTIn addition to IoT, several other smart technologies are making waves in supply chain management:1. Blockchain:Blockchain technology is revolutionizing supply chain management by offering secure and transparent tracking of products and transactions throughout the entire supply chain journey. Here's how it works:


Secure and immutable records: Every transaction or movement of products is recorded in a secure and immutable blockchain ledger. This means that once data is entered, it cannot be altered or tampered with. This inherent security ensures the authenticity of records, reducing the risk of fraudulent or deceptive practices.End-to-end transparency: Blockchain provides an unbroken, transparent chain of custody for products. Entrepreneurs can trace the origin of each product, monitor its movement from manufacturer to distributor to retailer and even verify its authenticity. This level of transparency not only reduces the risk of counterfeit goods but also enhances trust among consumers.Smart contracts: Blockchain allows for the implementation of smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with predefined rules. These contracts can automate various supply chain processes, such as payments, quality inspections and compliance checks. This automation reduces administrative overhead and ensures that contractual obligations are met promptly.2. Artificial Intelligence (AI):AI-driven algorithms are a powerful tool for optimizing supply chain processes. Here's how AI can transform supply chain management:Demand prediction: AI algorithms can analyze historical data, market trends and various external factors to predict demand accurately. This enables businesses to adjust their production and inventory levels accordingly, reducing the risk of overstocking or stockouts.Process automation: AI can automate routine and repetitive tasks, such as data entry, order processing and inventory management. This not only reduces labor costs but also minimizes the potential for human errors, improving overall efficiency.Enhanced decision-making: AI can analyze vast amounts of data in real time to make informed decisions. For instance, it can optimize delivery routes based on real-time traffic data or recommend the most cost-effective suppliers. This data-driven decision-making leads to more efficient supply chain operations.Personalized customer service: AI-powered chatbots and customer service platforms can personalize recommendations and resolve customer issues more efficiently. This enhances the customer experience and fosters brand loyalty.3. Robotic Process Automation (RPA):Robotic Process Automation involves the use of robots and automation technologies to streamline various aspects of supply chain management. Here's how RPA is making a significant impact:Warehouse operations: Robots can automate tasks within warehouses, such as picking and packing products. They work with precision and consistency, reducing the potential for errors and increasing order accuracy. This not only speeds up order fulfillment but also reduces labor costs.Repetitive Task Automation: RPA can handle repetitive and rule-based tasks, such as data entry, invoice processing and tracking shipments. By automating these tasks, businesses can free up human resources for more strategic activities.Enhanced efficiency: RPA can operate around the clock, ensuring that supply chain operations continue without interruptions. This enhances overall efficiency and reduces lead times.Cost reduction: By automating routine tasks, RPA reduces labor costs and the potential for errors that can lead to additional expenses. It also optimizes resource utilization, ensuring that operations are cost-effective.Related: How AI Can Revolutionize Our Broken Supply Chain

76,Why Reporting and Analytics Tools Are the Top Budget Priority for Marketers Today,"Sep 18, 2023",Michelena Howl,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/this-is-the-top-budget-priority-for-marketers-today/458776,"
Recession or no recession, marketing budgets are getting smaller. Marketers are being asked to do more with less.The upside of this is that it provides clarity to the priorities marketers need to make with the budget they have. Time and money work the same way in that regard. Given an unlimited number of hours in a day, you'd accomplish everything. But that's not how life (or budgets) work.Over several informal conversations with marketing leaders at over 20 companies across a range of industries, we asked what struggles, pain points and wish lists dominated their day and influenced their spending decisions.



Specifically, we asked what their priorities were when making budget allocation decisions.One clear desire rose above the rest â€” Reporting and Analytics. If they were given free money to spend on anything they liked, increasing their reporting and analytics capabilities regularly came out on top among the wish lists.


Related: How to Grow Your Business With Marketing Analytics: The Ultimate GuideThe marketer's wish listHere are the top 10 results, in order of importance, of how these marketing leaders told us they would stack rank their priorities against their budget. This was not a list of pre-set options, but rather what they volunteered themselves that simply laddered up into the categories below.Take a look and see if your priorities match:Reporting / AnalyticsMachine Learning / Artificial IntelligenceStabilityAudience GrowthCustomer JourneyUI and operational efficiencyPrivacy and TrustLoyaltyContentSimplify StackWhy Reporting / Analytics?The first question, of course, is why? What makes Reporting and Analytics so important that it so far outpaces the other items on this potential wishlist?For starters â€” ROI. Marketing departments have to constantly justify every action and every dollar through the results they achieve. Marketers (and those they report to) need to see that their efforts are performing as expected in terms of direct attribution (read: revenue) across all channels â€” email, mobile, and so on.That leads us to autonomy. Marketing teams would prefer to analyze the results of their campaigns themselves directly from the platform they use, rather than rely on a separate IT or tech department to pull data for them.


Not only is this more efficient from a time/resources perspective (eliminating the back-and-forth request/response/request/loop), but it also makes the insights gained more actionable within the marketing team and the campaigns they manage.Automation is another one. Marketing teams are trending smaller as budget is pulled away into building IT and tech-focused groups like marketing automation. So, marketers say they're spending too much time on data creation and the manual tasks behind that effort, and would prefer platforms with built-in automation wherever possible to help them.This includes connecting data and analysis functions directly with the CRM platform they use, as well as proactive predictive customization to automatically implement campaign changes based on pre-set parameters.And finally, monitoring is a big part of the data/analysis equation. The ability to monitor incoming data and make rapid changes as needed is a logical place to invest data and analytics dollars. This includes robust A/B testing capabilities with the ability to rapidly and dynamically modify tests on the fly, as well as the ability to monitor the entire customer journey.


Preferably, this monitoring can take place through a single dashboard that compiles all datasets from across the platform (or integrates data from multiple platforms) to reduce the number of multiple screens or handoffs necessary with most systems today.Related: 5 Analytics Tools to Supercharge Your Marketing StrategyWhat to report/analyze?The ability to report and analyze data is one thing. Knowing what data to focus on is another.Revenue was a common data point the marketers we spoke with wanted to measure. Partnering with a technology company that can track web behavior and tie it back to channel performance is a key data point. What marketing emails, ads and other tactics are driving the most revenue, and why? If something outperformed historical trends, what was the differentiating factor? Could a change in one channel drive a shift in channel share?


Engagement stats like clickthrough is another important metric to monitor because engagement often leads to revenue. Conversions are important.And finally, ensuring that interested customers are being serviced properly through digital channels to avoid involving a human intervention, which can tie up resources and ultimately slow down a conversion. Imagine receiving a push notification with a coupon code but then not being able to redeem that code upon checkout.The ""human"" cost associated with any digital channel snafu can be expensive in the form of customer service representatives ultimately needing to complete the transaction. Keeping the activity online and completing sales in a single session is the mark of a well-functioning marketing campaign that drives both engagement and revenue.Ultimately, the number one goal is to avoid sparking a phone call to customer support. A phone operator can only assist one person at a time, while a website can serve thousands.


On paper, good data reporting and analysis seem obvious. Time and time again, good data and analysis result in improved ROI. But in the reality of the fast-paced marketing world, carving out the time needed to both collect and analyze data can be difficult when doing so remains a manual process.That's why companies should seek out and demand automated reporting and analytics features from their marketing platform providers. Revenue modeling and channel attribution are too important to be left to chance. Working with a platform that can easily automate this kind of performance reporting, and then using AI to detect the small shifts in these results, gives marketers the insights they need to optimize their efforts in real time.In other words, the same tools that marketers use to automate marketing outreach should make collecting and extrapolating data just as easy and automatic. This allows marketers to spend more time making the data more actionable for more personalized communications â€” and ultimately, more meaningful relationships.Related: 10 Tools Helping Companies Manage Big Marketing Data

77,A Cybersecurity Expert Reveals Why You're a Cybercriminal's Next Target â€” and 5 Things You Can Do to Beef Up Your Defense.,"Aug 16, 2023",Claudette McGowan,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/a-cybersecurity-expert-reveals-why-youre-a-cybercriminals/456722,"
If your company was hit by ransomware today, who would you call? Or perhaps a better question: How would you call them? It sounds absurd, but as a cybersecurity expert, I've seen organizations paralyzed in the first hours after an incident simply because nobody knows anyone's cell number anymore. Without access to email or messaging systems, communication grinds to a halt and workers, customers and suppliers are all left wondering what is going on. Panic rapidly escalates into a crisis.There's a tendency to think about cybersecurity as being the responsibility of the IT or security department. But protecting your company comes down to two things: organizational culture and planning. That's why some of the most important people on cyber defense aren't in the IT team â€” they're in human resources.The HR team is uniquely placed to embed cybersecurity preparedness into the everyday working of an organization. It's responsible for building the policies and processes to mitigate risks and ensure the business has the competencies to be resilient to foreseeable challenges â€” and those include cyberattacks. And as the custodians of employees' sensitive personal information, HR teams are themselves prime targets for hackers.



Unfortunately, this vital role is often overlooked. So here are five ways HR can help make your business a tough target for cybercriminals.Related: 78% of Employers Are Using Remote Work Tools to Spy on You. Here's a More Effective (and Ethical) Approach to Tracking Employee Productivity.


Build a cybersecurity cultureEternal vigilance is the price of our liberty to roam the internet. The number of threats is mind-blowing â€” a recent report found the average education institution faces more than 2,300 attempts to breach its systems in a week, while healthcare organizations fend off more than 1,600 attacks. With so many digital grenades being lobbed, it's incredibly hard to catch them all. However, a strong cybersecurity culture helps an organization defend against attacks and limits the blast radius when one does get through. The tough part: Everyone has to be on the same page when it comes to online behaviors.Step one is to ensure you have the training tools so that employees know what they should and should not be doing. Most organizations are reasonably good at this. Whereas, many fall short by not putting that information into practice every day.The best way to ensure that everyone considers cybersecurity a fundamental part of their responsibilities is to build it into performance reviews. This should not take the form of calling out workers for every dodgy link they click on. Instead, it should be a constructive conversation about how they're keeping up with their cyber literacy training. There are cyber health-check tools that workers can use to analyze their online behavior and address weaknesses (like reusing Pa$$w0rd across half the internet or not using two-factor authentication) and often these can be used to track progress toward cybersecurity goals at an organizational level.When safety precautions are regularly discussed, they just become part of how you do business.


Protect your crown jewelsHR has custody of some of the most sensitive information in an organization â€” and hackers know this. In the past five years or so, many companies have adopted platforms that enable employees to self-serve routine tasks like vacation requests. However, third-party platforms come with risks. Hackers target them in so-called supply chain attacks, knowing that if they get lucky, they can access troves of information from multiple companies. In 2021, more than 300 organizations were breached in a hack of a widely used file transfer system. One of these was the University of California, which said the information exposed included employees' social security numbers, driver's licenses and passport details (the UC system offered its staff free ID monitoring services).Job one for HR professionals is to ensure employee data remains confidential. Perform extensive due diligence before your organization signs up for any third-party HR service. Only consider companies that comply with international standards (SOC 2 and ISO 27001 are the main ones to look out for) and check online for reports of security incidents at the site in the past few years. Also, look into where your data is being stored and how it is being backed up. Depending on your location and industry, you may have to comply with data residency laws.Stop hoarding dataUpdating the data retention policy should be on the to-do list of every HR department. I say updating because every company has a data retention policy whether they know it or not. If yours isn't written down, then your policy is simply to keep everything forever. And that exposes you to considerable risk. The more data you have, the worse a breach can be â€” it's especially bad if you're hoarding data you no longer need. Many jurisdictions have limits on how long companies should retain sensitive information â€” it's often around seven years for records on former employees.Figure out who will call the shots when a breach happensCybersecurity may be everyone's day-to-day responsibility, but when an attack gets through there should be one person in charge of the response. In cybersecurity lingo, we call this the incident commander. While everyone can have an opinion on the best course of action, decision-making power rests with them.


The job spec for incident commander only has one line: It's whoever best understands cybersecurity issues in your organization. Depending on the size of your business, that might be a cybersecurity leader, the head of IT or it could be Joanne in accounting who took a few courses on this stuff. Whoever it is, make sure you've identified them before an incident happens and have clearly communicated that to your team. Once a cybersecurity incident happens, events move quickly â€” in one case I was involved in, the hackers gave a 45-minute warning before starting to post sensitive information â€” so you don't want to waste time figuring out who's in charge.Run some drillsPlanning is only one half of the equation. Practice is the other. Plenty of research has shown that people don't think clearly in stressful situations. We perform drills for fires and earthquakes to give us a framework to fall back on in an emergency. The same idea works for cybersecurity incidents. Set aside two hours once a year to run a tabletop exercise with key staff that simulates what you'll do if the company is hacked. In these exercises, someone takes the role of a moderator to explain the nature of the attack and what's been affected, while everyone else plays out how they'd respond.The first time you conduct the exercise, it'll likely be a mess â€” but that's the point. The scramble to figure things out will reveal the gaps in your plans. Over time, the drills will become second nature.Related: So, You've Been Hacked. These are the Best Practices for Business Leaders Post-Hack


And write contact information down â€” on paperPut the incident team's phone numbers down on paper and update the list regularly. Yes, it's old school. Yes, it's annoying. And yes, one day you'll be thankful you did.

79,7 Crucial Metrics to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Your Marketing Campaigns,"Aug 14, 2023",Alex Quin,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/7-metrics-to-evaluate-the-success-of-your-marketing/457248,"
The ability to quantify the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and strategies is no longer a luxury; it's a strategic imperative that separates thriving businesses from those merely treading water. This article highlights the significance of measuring marketing ROI and explores key performance indicators (KPIs) that can help steer your marketing efforts toward tangible success.The importance of measuring marketing ROIDefining marketing ROI involves determining the profitability of an investment in marketing by comparing the gained revenue against the incurred costs. This calculation is central to understanding the impact of marketing campaigns on the bottom line. By evaluating ROI, businesses gain insights into which marketing efforts are delivering the most significant returns and can allocate resources accordingly.Measuring ROI is particularly crucial for marketing agencies and their clients. In an era driven by data, both parties benefit from the ability to make decisions grounded in evidence. A data-driven approach allows marketing agencies to fine-tune their strategies and tailor them to specific audiences, ultimately leading to more effective campaigns.



As per a McKinsey survey, companies that base their decisions on data and analytics exhibit remarkable statistics: They are 23 times more prone to customer acquisition, six times more adept at customer retention and stand a staggering 19 times higher chance of achieving profitability.For clients, it ensures that their investments generate tangible results, fostering a sense of trust and satisfaction in the agency's work.Related: How to Gauge Marketing Success in a Shifting Business LandscapeChallenges in measuring marketing ROIWhile the benefits of measuring marketing ROI are substantial, challenges often arise in the measurement process. Tracking the diverse touchpoints of modern marketing campaigns, accurately attributing conversions to specific channels and accounting for indirect impacts can be intricate tasks.Another issue that may arise is that different businesses and industries have varying sales cycles and customer journeys. This complicates the establishment of a standardized ROI measurement methodology.Addressing these challenges requires a combination of strategy and technology. Marketing agencies must adopt data integration techniques that consolidate information from various platforms to form a comprehensive view of customer interactions.


7 key performance indicators (KPIs) for marketing successAs we have established so far, effective marketing is more than just creative campaigns; it's about making informed decisions based on quantifiable metrics. These key performance indicators (KPIs) serve as beacons in the vast sea of marketing data. This section further explores seven crucial KPIs that can help with marketing success!1. Website traffic and user engagement metricsIn the digital realm, a brand's online presence is paramount â€” more so than ever. Website traffic acts as a foundational KPI, encompassing metrics such as page views, unique visitors and bounce rate.Beyond mere numbers, these metrics signify the extent of a campaign's reach. But traffic alone isn't enough; user engagement metrics like time on page and click-through rate (CTR) offer a deeper perspective. These KPIs reveal not only the quantity but the quality of interactions, allowing businesses to refine content strategies and enhance user experiences.2. Conversion rate and goal completionsThe ultimate goal of marketing is to convert potential customers into active ones. The conversion rate, a pivotal KPI, measures the percentage of visitors who take a desired action â€” a purchase, sign-up or download. In different industries, the average conversion rate for landing pages is around 2.35%. But the top 25% of performers achieve rates of 5.31% or higher. For optimal results, aiming for the top 10% is advisable, as these pages boast conversion rates of 11.45% or more.


Paired with goal completions, which signal the successful attainment of predetermined objectives, these KPIs provide a holistic view of marketing effectiveness. They illuminate the alignment between strategies and outcomes, ensuring that campaigns resonate with target audiences and contribute to business objectives.3. Customer acquisition cost (CAC)Understanding the cost of acquiring a new customer is pivotal. Customer acquisition cost (CAC) quantifies the investment required for each new customer. A study by Invesp highlights that businesses are willing to spend five times more to acquire new customers than to retain existing ones.This KPI holds the key to evaluating the efficiency of marketing spending. Lowering CAC directly enhances return on investment (ROI) â€” a reduction in acquisition expenses translates to higher profitability. Strategies for optimizing CAC include refining targeting methods, improving conversion rates and nurturing leads more effectively.Related: What Is Good Data-Driven Marketing? Here Are 5 Examples of What Big Data Can Do.


4. Customer lifetime value (CLV)Customer lifetime value (CLV) is a transformative KPI that gauges the potential value a customer brings throughout their engagement journey. Research suggests that companies with the strongest omnichannel customer engagement strategies retain an average of 89% of their customers. In essence, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is closely intertwined with omnichannel strategies in the realm of marketing.Effectively utilizing multiple channels to engage customers throughout their journey substantially contributes to long-term customer relationships. In this context, CLV becomes a vital metric that measures the potential value of a customer across these various engagement touchpoints.5. Return on advertising spend (ROAS)Return on advertising spend (ROAS) helps evaluate the effectiveness of advertising campaigns by comparing generated revenue to advertising expenditure. A high ROAS signifies optimal budget allocation and campaign efficiency. Conversely, a low ROAS prompts a reevaluation of advertising strategies, ensuring resources are channeled into campaigns that deliver substantial returns.6. Social media engagement and influenceEngagement signifies the degree of user interaction with a brand's content, measured by metrics like likes, comments, shares and clicks. It reflects your content's resonance and the sense of community it fosters. On the other hand, influence goes beyond interaction, gauging a brand's capacity to shape opinions and sway decisions, often propelled by collaborations with influencers. Combining these two can nurture customer loyalty and extend your brand's impact beyond its immediate audience.


7. Email marketing performanceEmail marketing remains an indispensable facet of digital communication, with compelling statistics underscoring its significance. Average open rates across industries hover around 38.49%, while click-through rates stand at approximately 2.91%, indicating the potency of well-crafted email campaigns to capture recipients' attention and drive engagement.Effective email marketing strategies encompass personalized content, compelling subject lines and valuable offers, harnessing their potential to foster customer retention, lead nurturing and revenue growth.Data analytics and measurement toolsData analytics plays a pivotal role in capturing, interpreting and deriving insights from marketing data. Analytics empowers businesses to make informed decisions based on evidence rather than assumptions. This shift towards data-driven decision-making enhances marketing strategies by aligning them with customer preferences and behavior.Related: The Most Important Marketing Metric You're Not Measuring


Popular measurement tools for marketing ROISeveral tools have gained popularity for their effectiveness in measuring marketing ROI. For example, Google Analytics offers comprehensive insights into website traffic, user behavior and conversion rates. Google Tag Manager simplifies the tracking and implementation of analytics tags. SEMrush aids competitive analysis, keyword research and SEO optimization. Hyros stands out for its advanced attribution modeling capabilities, offering a holistic view of customer journeys. Google Data Studio facilitates visualizing data and creating dynamic reports. These tools empower marketers to decipher performance, optimize strategies and enhance ROI by making informed data-driven decisions.In a landscape where marketing strategies can make or break a business, measuring ROI has emerged as an indispensable practice. The discussed KPIs provide a comprehensive framework for assessing marketing success and guiding decision-making. As marketing agencies and businesses continue to navigate the dynamic marketing ecosystem, embracing data-driven methodologies and measurement tools will be instrumental in achieving sustainable growth.

This as-told-to essay is based on an interview with Tyler Ashby, president at Agents Only Technologies.Google was a dream opportunity that offered me career validation, financial security and a sense of personal pride.Before joining Google, I spent 20 years in the customer service and business process outsourcing field. Specifically, I launched and ran customer contact centers around the globe. From the start of my career, I was always drawn to the people side of the business. This drove me to take a particular interest in people-first operating principles with an emphasis on creating technology and processes that make the humans involved more valuable.



My time with Bain trained me to tackle customer experience and costs using customer journey mapping, service blueprints and people/process/technology analytics. As a result, I developed a strong passion for identifying and improving efficiency without compromising the end experience. I've launched projects across the world for notable companies such as Sprint, Dell, Epson, Citibank, Samsung, Telstra and Virgin.I joined Google somewhat circuitously. I originally interviewed with Fitbit, but during the hiring process, Google announced its plans to acquire the company. At that point, I had several job options, but I chose Fitbit, primarily because I would have the chance to work at Google down the road.


Initially, the experience at Google was exciting; the opportunities seemed endless. I underwent onboarding from an engineering group, Noogler Training, and had unlimited access to self-paced training and experts from various skills. It seemed like everyone at the company had a ""go try it"" attitude and there were no restrictions on creativity.Related: How Do You Win the Innovation Game? Google's 'X' Marks the Spot.However, I soon realized that Google's innovation, particularly regarding generative AI, was limited.""The customer service department had limited to no access to even basic data tools â€” let alone any of the leading tech being developed.""When Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of devices and services, presented his roadmap, the priorities and core action plans laid out in it did not align with those of a tech innovator. Although our engineering groups were enabled and encouraged to experiment and developed brand-new applications for our technology through side projects, we in the customer service department had limited to no access to even basic data tools â€” let alone any of the leading tech being developed within Google.The customer service teams primarily used outdated third-party tools. Even with the perfect execution of the 18-month roadmap, we would still be technologically behind the leading industry standard. Google's roadmap lacked any plans for generative AI in customer service.In 2018, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiary Google, showcased Google Duplex's AI capabilities at I/O, where it successfully called a hair salon and booked an appointment using AI voice and transcription. But in 2020, when I asked about it, no one in customer service had used it or brainstormed applications for Google customer service. In 2021, I gained access to Meena, Google's AI chatbot, but I was the sole user within my team.I discussed the matter with engineering mentors and learned about Google's unwritten stance: Google doesn't invest in customer experience through service; the company believes in making the product better. I was given several examples from YouTube and Stadia that indicated the limited influence of the services organization within Google. Because of this, I believed Google had no intention to innovate the customer experience.


Neither Pichai nor Osterloh explicitly stated that Meena, a generative AI, wouldn't be part of customer service. Although Pichai has a positive vision for AI's potential, there were no explicit plans. Most importantly, our roadmap didn't pave the way for generative AI integration, which would require significant work on processes, tools, data management and tech stack integration. The focus was on cost reduction â€” not preparing for implementing this groundbreaking tech. Despite raising questions about this through Dory, Google's internal Q&A, and other channels, they remained unaddressed.What's more, I spoke to four different leaders within my organization â€” a Fitbit director, direct manager, director of scaled operations and CS tools/transformation director â€” about the opportunities with Meena and how we could go about working between the engineering org and the customer service org.They confirmed what I already knew: Google wasn't innovative enough for me.""Google didn't excite me or give me a sense that I was truly making a difference.""I decided to leave Google when presented with an opportunity at Agents Only, a gigCX platform addressing contact center issues by employing technology to link brands with seasoned gig agents, forming an instant virtual contact center. Centered around the agents, the company aims to harness top-notch talent to create the best customer outcomes.My choice between Google and Agents Only was a trade-off between long-term stability and personal satisfaction. Ultimately, I realized that my work at Google didn't excite me or give me a sense that I was truly making a difference. When I resigned, I sent two of those colleagues I'd spoken with an email referencing the Meena predicament; I told them Agents Only was offering me the chance to use tech to make a difference.Without the Agents Only opportunity, I would have stayed at Google due to the stability and benefits that were valuable to my family. It was only the appeal of joining a startup that gave me a chance to make a real difference that could have pulled me away.Additionally, Agents Only's people-centric philosophy, technological vision and innovation potential were major selling points. I also knew and trusted the founder, Ben Block: He had put his money where his mouth was many times in the past when it came to taking care of agents, so I believed him when he said the company was founded to make agents' lives better.


I signed on â€” and it was the right decision.Related: How to Tap Into Innovation, the Most Essential Part of Your Entrepreneurial JourneyAgents Only is at the forefront of disrupting the contact center industry and raising the quality of life of the agents.There is such a huge pool of dedicated talent that cares about doing a good job for themselves, the customer and the client. I want to enable these agents to make a larger share of the money by paying them more and use our technology to remove layers of ineffective command and control management. We are currently operational in four countries, and I'm looking forward to adding agents in every country of the world and creating an OnDemand GigCX solution that will become a part of every company's customer strategy.


""Internally, we are using generative AI to coach the agents on behaviors that lead to better outcomes.""To date, we've handled over 12 million customer contacts, using 100 million data points to rate agents, and processed $250 million in revenue for our restaurant and hospitality clients. This was done at a cost 40% lower than normal operations while being able to pay the agents almost twice as much as the industry standard.We've also delivered incredible flexibility in terms of staffing â€” going from 700 agents to over 2,000 agents for a single day to handle restaurant calls during the Superbowl.Reliability is a key component too. When we allowed 100% of agents to choose their schedule, they successfully delivered on 98% of those hours, surpassing the industry average of 82%. We have achieved an impressively low attrition rate of less than 1% as our agents tend to remain on our platform once they join.


As for generative AI, the access it gives to knowledge and self-learning capabilities is highly valuable. Internally, we are using generative AI to coach the agents on behaviors that lead to better outcomes. They are incentivized for these behaviors and can have in-depth coaching conversations with the AI that allows them to ask clarifying questions, get expert examples or receive objective feedback on their skills.Related: Why Are So Many Companies Afraid of Generative AI? | EntrepreneurThe most exciting part of generative AI will come when used in tandem with other types of AI. Combining machine learning AI or analytic AI with generative AI will allow human interaction and development that is real-time and takes into account every piece of data available to define and optimize, as well as task automation and real-time augmentation. The result could be a learning and development loop allowing anyone to learn anything â€” while also putting that knowledge into practical execution via automation.

82,On-Page SEO vs. Off-Page SEO vs. Technical SEO â€” Here's How to Properly Optimize Each,"Aug 2, 2023",Omar El Bahr,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-optimize-on-page-seo-off-page-seo-and-technical-seo/456429,"
On-page SEO, off-page SEO, and technical SEO are three of the many terms found in the never-ending and extensive world of SEO. However, they are each extremely important. Very similar, yet so different is one way to describe on-page SEO, off-page SEO and technical SEO. These terms are SEO specialists' first and foremost priorities, as they either improve your businesses and make them stand out if they are probably optimized or don't help your business at all if they are not.This article will explore these terms, how to optimize each properly, and the key differences.Related: The 4 Pillars of SEO You Need to Know



What is on-page SEO?On-page SEO is the process of optimizing your website's pages to be able to increase your domain authority and rank on all search engine result pages (SERP). Well, isn't that what SEO means in general? Well, you are somewhat correct; it is. However, on-page SEO is more concerned with what takes place internally on the website.Still confused? Let me break it down for you. On-page SEO includes everything that you do on your website; it has nothing to do with any efforts you exert outside. For instance, the content you write in hopes of ranking is on-page SEO. Images, videos, headlines, articles, keywords and so on are all examples of on-page SEO.


Best practices for on-page SEOThe practices to optimize on-page SEO are way more extensive than you may think. There are many varied methods and techniques that could improve technical on-page SEO effectively and efficiently. So, here are the most common and best practices you could consider:Use high-quality images:Images are a big deal when it comes to the user experience. Usually, users are more attracted to websites that include more images and media. In order to ensure proper and effective on-page SEO, make sure to optimize all the images on your website. This includes using high-quality images and a suitable image file format. Also, remember to compress the images to avoid messing with the site's health and speed.Optimize meta descriptions:


Meta descriptions are texts that appear below your article's or web page's main title on SERP pages to give a brief description of the content. Optimizing meta descriptions is very important for optimizing both content and on-page SEO. So, how can you optimize them? First, keep them simple. Meta descriptions are usually very brief; they can't go over 160 characters. So, make sure to be brief but also inclusive. Your meta descriptions should also be unique so that they can attract users from search engine results pages. Most of the time, users disregard meta descriptions as they can be repetitive or misleading. Thus, make sure to write something new, engaging and precise.What is off-page SEO?Off-page SEO is the process of optimizing the SEO of a website or webpage. Yes, isn't this the exact same purpose as on-page SEO and SEO in general? Well, again, you are 100% correct. On-page SEO and off-page SEO have the same essence and serve the same purpose. However, the way they both accomplish this is totally different.As we previously stated, on-page SEO techniques take place inside the website. On the other hand, off-page SEO techniques and efforts are executed outside. However, all the impacts reflect directly on the website and contribute significantly to improving the ranking on all SERPs.Related: 3 Ways to Make Your Content Rank Higher on Google


Best practices for off-page SEOImplement link-building strategies:Link building is one of the most effective techniques when it comes to optimizing off-page SEO. It is the process of getting other websites to refer to your website â€” either to an article, a certain page or the main website. The process of link building generates what are called backlinks, which are great factors for most search engines. Backlinks are usually acquired organically or through link exchange platforms. If you aim for perfect and extremely effective backlinks, you should definitely consider good and suitable link-building strategies.Consider guest posting with reliable websites:Guest posting is yet another powerful off-page SEO practice that you should implement. Guest posting is the process of publishing articles on another website in the same field. Guest posting and link building are interconnected, as the article you write for another website will link to your website, which means a new backlink. This can help you gain recognition and attract new potential users and customers. However, with guest posting, you should be sure of the website you are writing for and know whether it is reliable or not to avoid gaining toxic backlinks.


What is technical SEO?Technical SEO refers to the process of improving a website's search engine visibility and performance from a technical point of view. While on-page and off-page SEO concentrate on factors like content and external factors, respectively, technical SEO addresses the technical aspects of a website that influence its search engine rankings. Technical SEO has some key elements like site speed, indexing, website structure and many more that need to be optimized and updated regularly to ensure that it's effective.Related: How to Create an Effective SEO Strategy â€” A 2023 GuideBest practices for technical SEOTechnical aspects can be a big deal. However, there are also solutions and effective methods for everything. So, let us explore the best practices you can use to improve your website's technical SEO.Optimize your website's loading speed:


The loading speed of your website is one of the most significant technical SEO factors. A slow-loading website can negatively affect the user experience and increase abandonment rates. To optimize the loading performance of your website, you should reduce the size of your images and employ effective caching techniques to reduce response time. Consider using a content delivery network (CDN) to distribute your website's content across multiple servers, thereby decreasing response times for users worldwide. By optimizing the loading speed of your website, you can increase user satisfaction and enhance your site's ranking in search engine results.Use HTTPS for a secure website:Implementing HTTPS, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is not only crucial for website security but can also have a positive effect on your website's ranking. Google has stated that HTTPS is a ranking factor, which means that websites with HTTPS are likely to rank higher in search engine results. HTTPS protects the data exchanged between a user's browser and your website, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive information. You must obtain an SSL certificate and configure your website to use HTTPS in order to implement HTTPS. This minor modification can have a significant effect on your website's ranking and overall security.In summary, on-page SEO optimizes content and elements within the website, improving relevance and user experience. Off-page SEO enhances the website's authority through link-building and guest posting on external platforms. Technical SEO focuses on improving technical aspects like site speed and security for better indexing and user engagement. Be sure to follow the best practices for each one so that you can increase your website's visibility and search engine rankings.

83,Why Business Owners Must Rely on Data (and Not Gut Feelings) When Making Marketing Decisions,"Aug 1, 2023",Jackie Cullen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-business-owners-must-trust-data-over-opinions-in/456187,"
When it comes to marketing any business, data never lies. However, it is easy to let our personal tastes and inner voices prevail, even if we do not have the data to back it up. The business owner's opinions certainly have a place in devising their marketing plans, but they should never become an obstacle to success. And that is why I always use hard numbers to guide my marketing plans rather than gut feelings.Opinions are great, but facts are betterWorking with a variety of clients across the country, I see a variety of personality types, not only in the business owners themselves but in their businesses as well. I always want to respect my client's input. After all, they know their business and clientele best. However, most of the entrepreneurs I encounter are looking for a noticeable improvement in their bottom line, and to make that happen, they must be willing to accept that they do not always know best when it comes to marketing.Often, the results the business owner perceives are not the whole picture. For example, they may believe that they are getting more ""duds"" than quality leads when in reality, the number of quality leads they are getting has increased month to month. This skewed perception may occur because negative experiences tend to leave a more lasting impression than positive ones do. The business owner may be overhearing snippets of conversations that lead them to believe that incoming leads are lower quality than what they would like, or their front-office staff may be talking more about the so-called ""bad"" leads than the good ones.



It could also be that quality leads are coming in but are not converting because the staff has not been trained well on how to handle them correctly. Whatever the case may be, many business owners will make a blanket statement about the quality of leads they are getting based on incomplete information and then jump to the conclusion that the marketing is not working.Related: What Is Good Data-Driven Marketing? Here Are 5 Examples of What Big Data Can Do.


Business owners like to have a say in how their marketing looks and feels, which is certainly acceptable and very much encouraged, especially at the beginning when I am getting to know them. However, there comes a point when the marketing professional needs to take the reins, and some business owners have a hard time relinquishing control. They would rather rely on their own feelings and tastes to determine whether a marketing campaign will work or not.They also fail to consider that their target audience may not think or react the same way they do â€” and that just because they find something appealing does not mean it will work from a marketing perspective. I see this often with highly technical services. The business owner, who is naturally an expert, wants to include a lot of industry-specific terminology in the marketing because that is what appeals to them as a professional. They do not realize that technical language will not resonate with their target audience, which consists of non-professionals who know little to nothing about their field.Why data mattersMarketing is a science as much as an art. Especially today, with digital technology, there are countless ways to test ideas and track results. With modern technology, there really is no reason not to make marketing decisions based on data. In fact, I always test my ideas before implementing them on a large scale, because there have been times when I thought an image or an idea would be a hit, and it turned out to be a complete miss. Testing saves time and money and leads to more successful marketing strategies and happier clients.I also use best practices and tactics I know that work from experience and previous testing rather than going with my gut or basing decisions on what I like or dislike because I am not the target audience, so my personal opinions are mostly irrelevant. I gather as much data as possible before, during and after a campaign and use it to make future decisions for my clients. And while my clients' feelings are always important to me, I find that numbers and revenue make a more compelling argument when deciding whether to discontinue a marketing strategy.


Related: 3 Tips to Achieve Growth in 2023 Through Data-Driven Marketing StrategiesOutsource the hard partA sole proprietor may not have the means to establish an internal marketing department for their business, let alone the time and energy to conduct testing for every marketing decision they make. Business owners are spread especially thin without also having to take on the added burden of creating, implementing and tracking their marketing campaigns. That is why outsourcing all marketing to a professional who not only knows how to do those things but also understands how to interpret the data on the back end is always a good strategy no matter what stage of growth your business is in. Unless you have a marketing degree, it is unlikely that your expertise and experience extends to understanding marketing metrics and testing. Relying on a reputable marketing professional saves valuable time, expense and a lot of stress.As a marketing professional, I appreciate my clients wanting to be actively involved in their marketing strategies, but I am also not afraid to hit them with some hard data when their personal opinions start to impede their success. The numbers will always tell the unvarnished truth, giving me and my client the ability to make better, more informed marketing decisions. The best and most rewarding scenario is when the client and the marketing agency understand each other's roles and work together to make choices based on facts rather than feelings.Related: Remove the Guesswork From Growth With These 4 Marketing ROI Boosts

84,3 Ways Leaders Can Use Data to Grow in Shrinking Economies,"Jul 31, 2023",Elizabeth Cholawsky,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-ways-leaders-can-use-data-to-grow-in-shrinking-economies/455472,"
According to the International Monetary Fund, advanced economies will see an especially pronounced growth slowdown, from 2.7% in 2022 to 1.3% in 2023. Tech leaders are facing economic headwinds, yet encounter continuous pressure to maintain aggressive revenue growth in an increasingly competitive global landscape, which begs the question: How do I shift from a strategy of growth at all costs to efficient, sustainable growth?Leaders need to find a way to make sense of this dynamic environment and use it to their advantage. But the growth tactics that worked yesterday will not get us through these unprecedented times.Related: How (and Why) You Need to Put Sustainability and Community Ahead of Fast Growth



Against the oddsAs a CEO, you're under a lot more scrutiny, so you need to have a way to make the best decisions while being able to provide logic.Changing economies are an opportunity to reevaluate decisions across the entire organization and find ways to increase throughput while doing more with less. Data-driven insights are how leaders navigate the rapidly changing market. They are how leaders lay down a foundation for long-term success, even in a down economy.


I've worked as an executive through the dotcom bust, the tumultuous financial crisis of 2008, Covid-19 and whatever's happening right now. Throughout these adverse economic conditions, here's how objective data fuels growth strategies in even the most difficult of times.1. Find inefficiencies in your go-to-market engineChanging economies are an opportunity to reevaluate decisions across your entire organization and find ways to increase throughput. To hit the same revenue targets with fewer resources, you have to cut the waste out of your GTM engine, for example:Misallocating resources to unproductive marketsInequitable or incorrectly prioritized sales territoriesInefficient account scoring and targetingSpray and pray sales and marketing campaignsMany companies are finding success by simplifying their strategy to survive the downturn. This means leveraging available technology to increase the amount of first-party data you have and using this information to make strategic, data-driven decisions. Data should be driving choices around the types of target customer accounts, industries and segments that teams focus on:


Where have you had the most success so far?How can you use that information to predict future successes?When are customers/prospects dropping off?Are customers successful in using my product/service?What are the factors contributing to churn?Related: 3 Tried-and-True Strategies to Help Marketers Navigate Turbulent Economic Conditions2. Use data to size your market and sell more effectively After looking inward, leaders must use data to look outward â€” to size markets, identify prospects, segment and score accounts and personalize the customer experience.Down economies are an opportunity to ask yourself:


Can you uncover more opportunities? Can you decrease customer acquisition cost (CAC)?How are your territories aligned with our total addressable market(TAM), serviceable addressable market (SAM) and servicable obtainable market (SOM)?How can I improve my territory planning and allocation to increase productivity and sales rep success/retention?Have I identified all competitive displacement or complementary offering opportunities?What can you do differently that hasn't been tried yet?Using data to size your markets helps you produce more predictable, efficient outcomes and increase ROI from your campaigns and individual contributors. These choices will have an impact on your bottom line for years to come and are especially important in down economies.3. Aligning teams around data and goalsData isn't one size fits all â€” leaders need to understand what types of data and how to use it depending on which department, product or strategy. At the same time, your teams need to be working together toward the same goals using the same data and terminology to drive decision-making, especially when facing difficult economic conditions.For leaders, shrinking economies are also an opportunity to reprioritize accounts, rethink marketing campaign targeting and align your sales and marketing efforts to drive alignment and efficiency â€” all powered by data-driven insights. Typically, leaders look immediately toward cost-cutting measures in a bear market, but it is also time to reassess this short-term strategy. A shrinking economy is a time to be proactive, to use capital to take advantage of a shifting ecosystem â€” particularly in the B2B tech sector, which has historically done well or rebuilt stronger from the rubble. But knowing where to deploy your capital is an important part of this equation. Leaders must leverage the below data-driven insights to capitalize on down economies and turn headwinds in their favor:


IT spend, tech installs, hardware and tech stack, buyer intentVendor market penetration to find threats, trends and well as competitive displacement and complementary offering opportunitiesUntapped market potential by uncovering gaps and whitespace in your marketsContract insights (who are an account's providers, for how long, what are the account's renewal timelines, and more)Intent-to-buy signalsSpend analysis (how much an account spends broken down by technology category and providers)With market intelligence and technology intelligence, leaders can develop insight-driven strategies to optimize resource allocation based on revenue potential, accounts with adequate budgets and compatible technology stacks, find threats, trends and opportunities.Related: 3 Tips to Achieve Growth in 2023 Through Data-Driven Marketing StrategiesGrowing while others shrink""Past performance is not indicative of future results."" We've all seen this disclaimer before, and it's true â€” what worked yesterday will not get us through these unprecedented times. But what if, as a leader, you could deliver predictability â€” even in the least predictable times, insights into IT spend, technology install, tech stack and other customizable criteria to identify opportunities for growth benefit everyone in an entire company, from department to department, use case to use case.It works, I've seen it. Even in this unpredictable economy, objective data has empowered not only my customers, but the entire industry.

85,"So, You've Been Hacked. These are the Best Practices for Business Leaders Post-Hack","Jul 31, 2023",Apu Pavithran,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/been-hacked-these-are-your-next-steps/456066,"
Data is the most valuable asset in today's interconnected world, where ones and zeroes reign supreme. However, securing every last byte of the predicted 181 zettabytes of data that will be consumed by 2025 is a dystopia in and of itself. So, as a business leader, it's not a matter of if but when your organization will face a cyber incident.Immediate financial losses aren't the worst part of a data breach. In fact, the lasting effects are the more troublesome ones. Long-term implications of a data breach spread across a company and impact its reputation, customers, workforce, databases and even its network architecture.How you react following an attack has an enormous influence on the effectiveness of your recuperation efforts and the long-term viability of your organization. In this article, we will explore the essential steps business leaders should take and the pitfalls to avoid in the challenging journey after a hack.



Related: How to Protect Your Customers (and Your Brand) From Data BreachesEssential steps in the wake of a data breachMuch like death and taxes, cyberattacks are now a part of everyday life. By following a prepared strategy, the actions you take can maintain data security, significantly reduce risk and help mitigate some of the fallout.


The first hours and days following a cyberattack are crucial. Unfortunately, in many cases, weeks and months can pass before companies realize they are breached. The sooner you respond, the better your chances of minimizing its impact on your organization. Quickly finding breached endpoints and servers and rapidly segregating them should be prioritized. This strategy prevents lateral movement within the corporate network and hinders dangerous code from infecting further systems.Successful containment brings us to the next phase â€” assessing the scope of the hack. A major part of efficient recovery depends on knowing how large the breach is. Conduct a thorough investigation to determine what data has been compromised and how it could affect your company's operations. Before restarting operations, do a comprehensive analysis, uncover any vulnerabilities, fix them and ensure all affected systems are secure. Depending on the scope and resources of your in-house IT team, you can either employ vulnerability management tools or engage the expertise of a seasoned cybersecurity firm.Related: Cybercrime Will Cost The World $8 Trillion This Year â€” Your Money is in Danger. Here's Why Prioritizing Cybersecurity is Crucial to Mitigate RiskPerform a thorough evaluation of your current security protocols, policies and technologies when there is even a slight indication of a breach. Identify any vulnerabilities or loopholes that were exploited during the assault and put strong measures in place to stop similar attacks in the future.


The primary actions to consider here include implementing a Secure Access Service Edge solution (SASE), an Identity Access Management solution (IAM), Endpoint Threat Detection and Response (EDR) cloud security solutions and a combination of Unified Endpoint Management (UEMs) and endpoint security solutions. Regardless of the blend of tools and solutions you choose, the end goal should always be to promote a culture of zero trust in the digital landscape.Employees tend to be the most vulnerable branch of a company's security architecture. Cybercriminals exploit these human vulnerabilities through social engineering and phishing attacks. Reports show that 74% of all attacks last year were instigated due to human error. So, routinely instruct your employees on cybersecurity best practices, highlighting the need to use strong passwords, spot phishing scams and adhere to safe protocols. When executed successfully, employee education is a strong deterrent against future assaults.Like a seasoned gladiator ready for battle, merely arming yourself for the hack is insufficient; you must also be prepared to defend yourself from attacks. Frequently put your crisis response plans to the test and refine them via simulated exercises. Through such drills, you can identify any shortcomings or deficits in your response capabilities and fine-tune the process. A well-trained team can react swiftly and efficiently to reduce the damage brought on by a breach.Critical mistakes to avoid post-hackRecovering from a hack is a strenuous and exhausting endeavor, and there are certain obstacles or pitfalls to avoid that could turn a fiery blaze into a roaring inferno.


The most important thing is that there is no room for denial. Hiding a breach under the rug or downplaying its severity only worsens the situation and builds distrust among stakeholders. Transparency is crucial after a cyberattack. Inform your staff, clients, business partners and the proper authorities as soon as possible about the incident and its severity. It's also important to control your reputation and communicate effectively. Ignoring public relations can have a long-lasting negative effect on your brand and customer loyalty.Another mistake is overlooking the importance of cybersecurity insurance. Cyber insurance is a critical part of any company's risk management strategy. Even companies with robust security systems are susceptible to hacking, and cyber insurance may help shield them from the resulting financial fallout. The global average cost of a single data breach was $4.25 million last year. Compared to that, the cost of a comprehensive insurance policy is only a fraction of that amount.Related: The Top 3 Mistakes Businesses Make After a HackBottom lineA cyberattack is likely to happen to any organization that functions digitally, but how an organization responds to such an incident matters. Successfully navigating the path to recovery helps organizations emerge stronger, more resilient and better prepared to turn victimhood into vigilance.

86,This Department Might Be Holding Your Business Back. Here's How to Change That.,"Jul 31, 2023",Paul Rubenstein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-hr-might-be-holding-your-business-back/455652,"
A while back, I went through the talent strategies for a dozen companies across numerous sectors and came to a frustrating conclusion: It was hard to tell them apart, fueled as they were by nostrums like ""reduce turnover,"" ""improve engagement"" and ""increase diversity.""Increasingly, it's a challenge to tell the industry or geography of an organization if you read its talent strategy with the company name covered up. Too often, it contains just broad generalizations only loosely connected to leadership, business process or planning â€” is disjointed from day-to-day decisions about individual people. Sometimes, such a strategy isn't even written down.Be forewarned that sameness does not yield greatness. Those prevailing similarities are indicative of a real problem in the HR world: We've hit a wall.



Decades of progress pushed the profession into what it is today: a business unit that's good at reducing risks and keeping talent costs low. But processes perfected through multiple transformation cycles â€” from specialization and scale of David Ulrich's ""three-legged stool"" to digital transformation and moving processes to the cloud â€” have now become the problem. Too many companies have fallen into the trap of looking at every problem through an HR lens, instead of asking the important question, ""Is this an HR problem, or a business problem?""Today, this department has a golden opportunity to better shape business outcomes. Companies that articulate and execute talent strategy well will have a clear competitive advantage in a fast-evolving economy, where finding and retaining the right people is the challenge.


Here's how HR can get out of its way and start driving real results.Related: 5 Ways HR Can Drive Success In Today's Turbulent TimesThink differently about dataTraditional HR data about headcount, compensation or diversity has never gone far enough. Oriented inwardly, it has served to meet certain needs (including compliance, risk reduction and planning) while offering little practical guidance to the rest of the company. It's time to change that.This means tapping into new datasets that reflect modern work. Let's start with skills data. Businesses should consider not thinking in terms of ""roles"" and start thinking in terms of skills â€” getting beyond headcount and understanding the critical knowledge that defines the highest-performing departments, or individual workers. HR can create real value for those outside that department only when people data is layered with business data. The only limit is imagination.


Armed with skills data, businesses can move the needle â€” can predict an ability to deliver on products, understand where they stack up next to competitors and get ahead of recruiting challenges, instead of just reacting to them. The good news is that thereare contemporary skills-mapping platforms that can provide precisely these insights.Related: The Benefits and Drawbacks of AI Integration in HR DepartmentsAn eye to the networkThere is another and equally critical data set: network. Static org charts rarely provide insights into how knowledge is transferred and how work gets done inside organizations. Far more valuable is an understanding of a peer network: Who is meeting, emailing, Slacking and videoconferencing? This information spotlights the real water carriers inside an organization, and contemporary organizational network analysis platforms are revealing more detail in this area all the time.


Today, people data is typically locked behind HR's walls, but value only emerges when it's blended with critical business metrics. Combining network and people data might illustrate, for example, who is over-leveraged with meetings and at greatest risk of burnout. Combining people, network and CRM data can also show sales leaders how staff members really spend their time, and so help find a path to achieving quota.Related: HR Analytics: How Should Big Data Be Used in the Workplace?Don't just reactâ€¦ drive changeTapping into this new and blended data helps us to connect people practices with the bottom line, but that's just part of the challenge. We also need to ensure that it's being used proactively, not reactively. Until now, HR has been largely staring into the past; we've been stuck asking people to enter data on how the year went when we could be showing how their year will go â€” or better yet, how their year could go.With the right people analytics, applied in the right way, we can peer over the wall and change a company's trajectory â€” can spotlight, for instance, not simply a team's highest performers, but what patterns of behavior they share. Then we can use that information to guide others along a path to high performance. But for that to happen, we have to put new insights into the hands of people managers â€” the frontline leaders who are best positioned to impact teams.


Do you know who does this well? Finance. Think about how CFOs communicate with their companies. They distribute key financial information like profit and loss statements regularly to the entire organization. That information shapes every decision, at every level. HR data, meanwhile, is locked away in the name of privacy and legal compliance. This overly cautious approach all but ensures being stuck in a reactive mode, with more and more analysts gazing into the rearview.Related: This Entrepreneur Has Solutions for HR Problems You Didn't Know You HadWe've got a wealth of people data. Put it where it counts â€” in the hands of those who make daily decisions that shape people's experiences at work, and in turn, directly affect the bottom line. Otherwise, what are we even doing?In this age of scarce and expensive labor, HR has never been more important. There will be winners and losers, and the companies that don't articulate and execute on talent strategies will almost certainly be left behind. It's time for this vital department to truly shine, to lead from the other side of the wall.

87,Senior Executives Are Falling Behind The Digital Curve â€” Here's What It Takes to Stay Ahead.,"Jul 28, 2023",Tim Madden,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/senior-executives-are-falling-behind-the-digital-curve/448337,"
As digitalization continues to shape the modern business landscape, senior executives are now more than ever required to stay current and relevant. A Deloitte survey found that 67% of executives felt ""uncomfortable"" accessing or using data from advanced analytic systems.For executives to stay ahead of the curve, having a solid understanding of digital literacy is essential. This includes being knowledgeable about new technologies and their potential challenges and risks. It also means being up-to-date on the latest software, hardware, and digital tools trends that can help increase efficiency, productivity and communication.So what major areas of digital literacy should senior executives focus on to stay current and relevant?Related: 11 Leadership Guidelines For The Digital AgeAccepting AI and machine learningIf the time it took for companies to adopt the internet felt short, the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has felt even shorter.



AI and machine learning aren't necessarily new technologies; their practical uses are evolving quickly. Senior executives should be familiar with AI and its capabilities to understand how it can help improve the customer experience and overall business operations.94% of corporate leaders surveyed by Deloitte believe that AI will profoundly affect their businesses within the next three years. Learning what AI offers in data analytics and workflow automation can help senior executives stay relevant in the digital era.Embracing big data analyticsAnalytics has always been a powerful tool for businesses, but the rise of big data has made them even more valuable. With big data comes an increased potential to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences that can help inform better decisions and strategies. A NewVantage Partners survey found that 97% of senior executives are boosting their investments in data initiatives.Senior executives should be familiar with the fundamentals of big data analytics and understand how they can use big data to their advantage. They should be able to leverage analytics to improve decision-making, identify market trends, and uncover customer needs more efficiently.


Implementing agile methodologyThe digital landscape is constantly changing, and senior executives need to stay agile in order to keep up with the latest trends.Agile methodologies â€” those that focus on rapid delivery and iterative development cycles â€” are becoming increasingly common in the enterprise. Senior executives should be familiar with agile principles and be able to apply them to their own organizations.Agile-focused leaders are often better equipped to handle change and adapt quickly to disruptive market trends. They can also provide better guidance for their teams, enabling them to move faster and successfully transition into the digital era.Investing in cybersecurity and privacyAs digital transformation takes hold, the need for strong security protocols and privacy practices becomes even more critical. A KPMG survey found that 39% of senior executives see their company as unprepared to handle cyber attacks. Executives need to understand the basics of cybersecurity and ensure their organization complies with applicable regulations.


It's also critical to understand the importance of protecting customer data and how companies can ensure they're providing a secure user experience. This includes understanding the latest security trends and best practices and how to respond quickly in case of a cyber attack.Related: The Emerging Cybersecurity Trends In 2023Upskilling and reskilling the workforceEnhancing one's digital literacy goes beyond learning for yourself â€” it should also include staying up-to-date on the skills necessary to successfully train and manage a digital workforce. No matter where your teams work, they want to know that they are being equipped and empowered to perform their jobs effectively.Senior executives should strive to learn about the latest upskilling and reskilling trends in digital fields, such as AI, machine learning, and automation. They should also understand how these technologies can improve overall business operations â€” from boosting employee productivity and efficiency to unlocking new insights into customer behavior.


Supercharging innovation across the organizationTechnology can be an excellent tool for driving innovation and creativity, but senior executives must understand how to leverage it effectively. This means having a clear vision of where the organization is going and using digital tools to help achieve that goal.Creativity should be encouraged across departments, and senior executives should be able to provide guidance and resources that help teams develop innovative solutions.Engaging in the digital marketplaceBusiness is moving from the brick-and-mortar world to the digital environment, and executives need to understand how to engage effectively in this new marketplace. Investing time and resources into how a company can engage online and utilizing digital channels to reach customers is essential for success in the digital world.Senior executives should grasp the evolving e-commerce landscape well and be familiar with best practices such as leveraging customer reviews, providing targeted promotions, and using data-driven insights to create personalized experiences.


For instance, understanding how to use social media platforms and other digital tools to build customer relationships can help create a more loyal base of followers.The bottom lineThe world is changing and leaders need to understand the importance of staying ahead of the digital curve.As senior executives, it's essential to recognize that embracing digital transformation is no longer an optional strategy â€” it's a requirement for success in today's economy.

88,Why Focusing on KPIs Too Much Can Backfire,"Jul 19, 2023",Anna Johansson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-focusing-on-kpis-too-much-can-backfire/454600,"
Bureaucrats love their key performance indicators (KPIs) â€“ metrics that presumably allow them to gauge the health of various business activities. And to be fair, they can be quite valuable as part of an overall strategy that prioritizes data analytics and data-driven decision-making.But listen. There's a big problem with glorifying KPIs â€” or at least relying on them too much. And too many companies today are falling into this trap.The ""right way"" to see KPIsOkay, let's be reasonable here. KPIs can be useful â€” and powerful for guiding an organization's direction. When used properly, KPIs are objective, easy to interpret and measured with specific intent. These are truly reliable data points that can be used to empower decision-making.



However, even in this hypothetical perfect scenario, it's important for organizational leaders to use these metrics properly. You should never use a single metric to fuel your decision-making, and you shouldn't use metrics alone to guide all of your visions for the future of the company.You can think of KPIs as being different types of food in a well-balanced diet, or as different assets with different strengths and weaknesses as part of your overall investment portfolio. They're incredibly useful, but they're only a portion of your strength in organizational decision-making.


Related: How Key Performance Indicators Can Actually Kill Key PerformanceThe KPI monsters we've createdWhy have we deviated from this vision? There are a few explanations worth exploring. Personally, I think it's mostly about disproportionate evaluation. Collectively, we've come to see KPIs as being more powerful and informative than they actually are. That's not to say that they're not powerful or not informative; this is merely an assertion that we've overestimated and misinterpreted them. Let's take a look at some of the specific ways this manifests.An exercise in vanityVanity metrics are a prime example of how KPIs can be misused and misinterpreted. Put simply, vanity metrics are metrics that make you feel good about a specific outcome or strategy, without really providing information on how things are running.For example, follower count is a commonly tracked vanity metric in social media marketing. It does have some value, and it certainly feels good to see your follower count increase. But your number of followers has little to do with more measurably impactful things like follower engagement, brand awareness, conversions or revenue generated.


Ambiguous meaningsSometimes KPIs carry ambiguous meanings. Let's take a commonly used one in the customer service and customer experience world: net promoter score (NPS). Hypothetically, NPS helps you estimate consumer sentiment, and you measure it by asking people how likely they are to recommend your business to others. But sometimes, these answers have little to do with consumer sentiment. It's nice to know that some of your customers would hypothetically recommend your business to others, but why would they do this? What's driving them? And how likely are they to follow through on this?There are tough complexities to work out with almost any KPI; attempting to boil down large, complex topics into a single measurement is an exercise in futility.Misleading dataYou can use data to support just about any argument you want. For example, let's say we're using data to compare the effectiveness of different marketing strategies. There is one strategy that's very challenging to pull off, but if you use it successfully, it's incredibly powerful. If you want to make the argument that you should use this strategy, you can cherry-pick the best case studies and prove how powerful it can be. If you want to make the argument that you should not use this strategy, you can take a measurement of the average results and show that typically, this strategy isn't worth using.In this way, data points can sometimes become crude tools with which we simply assert our previously formed opinions. In their best applications, KPIs should challenge us and force us to think critically.


The almighty incremental changeEmbedded growth obligations (EGOs) drive countless companies forward, forcing them to grow, grow, grow. And on a smaller scale, organizations are sometimes held back by a focus on incremental change, shackled by the KPIs that guide them.Once you identify that a KPI is important, the organization becomes incentivized to keep pushing that KPI higher. The goal is usually to see a change of at least a few percentage points after each predefined time period. Obviously, incremental growth is a net positive in most cases, but sometimes, it's better to take a short-term KPI loss in pursuit of a more fundamental, disruptive change that leads to better long-term results.In other words, obsession over incremental changes can limit the true potential of organizational development.Lack of actionabilityOne final problem to note about KPIs is that they sometimes lack actionability, or a ""so what"" factor. It's great that your organization is seeing higher CSAT, but what does that mean for the organization, how should it change your decision-making, and where do you go from here?


None of this is meant to suggest that you should stop tracking KPIs or using them as part of your approach to organizational decision-making. But we need to get real about our obsessiveness and misuse of these sometimes-trivial and sometimes misleading data points.Let's be better data analysts.

By optimizing a website's content and structure for search engines, it becomes more likely to appear higher up on SERPs, which can lead to more clicks and visits.Better brand credibility and authority: When a website appears higher up on SERPs, it can give the impression of being a more authoritative and credible source of information. This can help build trust with potential customers and lead to increased brand recognition and awareness.Cost-effective marketing: Compared to other forms of digital marketing, such as paid search or social media advertising, SEO can be a relatively cost-effective way to attract and convert website visitors. While there may be some upfront costs associated with SEO, such as hiring an SEO specialist or investing in SEO tools, the ongoing cost of maintaining and improving an SEO strategy is typically lower than other forms of marketing.Long-term benefits: While SEO is not a quick fix and can take some time to show results, the benefits of a well-executed SEO strategy can be long-lasting. By consistently optimizing a website's content and structure for search engines, it can continue to rank well on SERPs and attract organic traffic for months or even years to come.How to create an effective SEO strategyThere are certain steps that will allow you to build or plan an effective SEO strategy for your business.

This could be in the form of blog posts, articles, infographics, videos or any other type of content that provides value to your target audience. When other websites find your content useful and relevant, they are more likely to link to it.Guest blogging is another method for increasing backlinks.

91,How to Control the Google Search Results for Your Name,"Jul 13, 2023",Jeremy Knauff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-control-the-search-results-for-your-name/453610,"
A study by Pew Research shows that 56% of Americans search their own name to see what comes up in the results. For some, this is about vanity, but for entrepreneurs, what shows up can mean the difference between success and failure.When someone searches your name, what do they find? Do the search results present a powerful impression of you and your expertise? Do you look like a ghost, or do the results present a negative impression?Taking control of the search results for your name is critical in today's digital landscape because potential clients, JV partners and journalists are absolutely going to look you up before getting involved with you.



In this article, we are going to unpack the tactics you can use to dominate search results for your name.1. Optimize your personal brand websiteThis is your online headquarters and it's a great way to control at least one listing in the search results. However, it's essential to make sure your website is optimized for search engines so that it actually ranks highly for your name.


The first step is to use your name, first and last, in the domain. Ideally, it should be exactly that, but if that's unavailable, you can either add something to it or use a non-dot-com extension to find an available domain. If you do add something to the domain name, you should add that to the end rather than the beginning.It's also critical to incorporate your name in the title tags, headings, image names, image alt text and text throughout your website.Schema markup provides search engines with additional information about your website, such as your profession, social media profiles and contact information. In addition to helping to improve ranking, it also alters how your site displays in the search results â€” making it more likely that people will click through.You should also create a concise and enticing meta description that includes your name and value proposition. This won't affect ranking, but it can help to increase clickthrough rates.


Related: 5 Simple Steps to Build a Personal Brand2. Optimize your images for SEOHumans are visual creatures, so utilizing images and video can be a powerful way to control what's in the search results for your name.This media, if optimized properly, will typically show up somewhere on the first page, taking up a significant portion of the search results. While it's important that it conveys the impression you want to make, it's also important to make sure it meets the criteria search engines are looking for.Your images should be large, high-quality and named appropriately based on your name (e.g. jeremy-knauff-speaking-rec-2023.jpg).


When it comes to size, the bigger the better, and if you're using srcset, which you absolutely should be using, you can easily upload extremely large images with no degradation in website performance, because a user's browser will only load the one that's most appropriate for their screen resolution.These images could be just about anything you can come up with, such as:Images with quotes from you.Book covers from books you've published.You speaking on stage or virtually.When you publish these images to your website, you'll use the appropriate alt attributes to help search engines understand what they are about. If your website is built on WordPress, you'll have an opportunity to add the appropriate alt text when you upload them through the media uploader. Then, when you place them into your content, they will already have the appropriate alt text in the code.In some cases, you can also set the alt text when uploading images to some social media platforms as well. If you have the ability to do that, you should.And then finally, we should point links to these images. Especially if they're on your own websites or other authoritative websites.3. Optimize your videos for SEOYour videos should also be large and high quality, but the name doesn't really matter. I generally aim for at least 1280 pixels wide, but ideally 1920 pixels, which is considered HD. It's worth noting that while 1920x1080 is still considered HD today, 4K resolution at 3840x2160 will soon become the new standard.Unlike with images, you'll want to upload these videos to YouTube since the platform has a superior tech stack for delivering videos. Also, Google loves to rank its own properties in the search results, and YouTube is a Google property.You'll also want to embed these videos using YouTube's embed code on your own website where relevant because that will help them earn more views. And if someone happens to stumble across your videos in the search results, more views create a stronger impression.


I also recommend properly implementing schema markup where you've embedded these videos to help search engines better understand what they are about. It's pretty easy to get deep into the technical weeds on this, but it's well worth the effort.Related: Personal Branding: The Key to Success in the Digital Age4. Build and optimize your social profilesYou need to own your name on all of the major social networks, but two in particular â€” Twitter and YouTube â€” are especially useful because they tend to take up significantly more real estate on screen than others.We've already discussed the role video plays, so there's no need to reiterate that benefit.


As for Twitter, if you're active, Google will display your recent tweets directly in the search results. This takes over a significant portion of the screen, very close to the top of the page.You also want to make sure that your social profiles are consistently branded, so you should use the same headshot and cover photo on each platform. Dimensions will vary slightly from platform to platform because each has different size and positioning requirements, but the general layout should be the same.It's also important to properly use schema on your website and link to your social profiles from your website to help search engines connect the dots between you and your social profiles.5. Public relations and guest postingPart of controlling the search results depends on building new digital assets, but we can also leverage existing digital assets as well.


Getting featured in the media and guest posting can be powerful tools because we're leveraging existing, authoritative digital assets like news outlets, trade publications and high-traffic blogs to get an authoritative article to rank for your name.Getting featured in the media comes down to pitching journalists in a way that demonstrates how your insight and story will benefit their audience. But keep in mind: This is a busy and noisy industry, so most of your pitches will go unanswered no matter how awesome they might be.This means you need to focus on the long game, which means investing time into building and nurturing relationships with the journalists who cover your industry.Guest posting can be a bit easier, especially when it comes to smaller outlets such as trade publications and blogs. You'll start by pitching the editor, in some cases, with a summary of the article, and in other cases, with a complete article. That depends on the outlet, and most list exactly what they want.


This is a great strategy because most outlets are starving for quality content. The more articles you contribute, the more likely your author page at that outlet is to rank for your name. Plus, each article gives you an opportunity to demonstrate your expertise â€” which helps to improve your image with both prospects and journalists.Related: 6 Steps to Improve Your Personal Brand on Google6. Build high-quality backlinksLinks from other websites pointing to your own website, social media profiles, articles and media coverage will significantly improve where they rank in the search results.You can do this by creating quality content that's informative and engaging. Then, reach out to industry influencers, other content creators and website owners to ask them to link to it. The concept is simple, but execution is more difficult because most requests will go unanswered. In many cases, they will ask for payment in exchange for a link.


When it comes to paying for links, it's important to properly evaluate the website first. The quality of the website will determine the impact it will have on helping another website rank higher. It's also worth noting that buying links is considered a violation of Google's webmaster guidelines, so there may be some risk involved.You can also guest post on reputable websites where you'll have an opportunity to contribute high-quality content. This typically includes a link back to your personal site within your author bio. In some cases, you may be able to include one or more links in the body of your article as well. And of course, you can link to anything from your own website.Use these tips to take the power back of your own personal name and personal branding. Owning your name's image on Google will pay dividends in the long term.

92,YouTube vs. Facebook Ads: Which Is Better? Here's Your Answer,"Jul 12, 2023",Corey Zieman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/youtube-vs-facebook-ads-which-is-better-heres-your/450880,"
You can get a much better return on YouTube ads compared to what you can get through Facebook ads in today's environment. While both of these platforms can still get you a positive return, the return you get on YouTube ads is much bigger overall.Both platforms still give advertisers the same fundamental returns as always by offering insights into who is interested in buying products and services in your market in real time. In my experience, YouTube has gotten significantly better at offering these opportunities for their advertisers, while Facebook has gotten much worse during the same three-year period.Here are five reasons that YouTube's ads now greatly excel in offering these buyer opportunities to your business so that you can increase the overall return from your ad budget in 2023.



Related: Why YouTube Ads Should Be in Your Advertising BudgetReason 1: Facebook's data is not as good as it used to be and certainly not as good as Google's (who owns YouTube now)Facebook's great marketing results of the past were largely built on customer data that they previously collected/purchased from Apple users, which tracked what they typed into their devices in real time. Unless you are in a niche where it's plausible to target users without having this preexisting knowledge about your users, your returns will not be as good as they were back in 2020 and earlier.


To that end, YouTube ads now give you a better opportunity to get in front of prospects who are looking to buy what you sell in real time.Users who have recently made ""purchase"" related searches on Google in the recent past (for example, searching: ""Amish furniture stores"") can now be targeted on YouTube using video ads. There is a very high probability that these users would buy from you if you were to get in front of them while on Google's YouTube.YouTube also gives you the ability to get in front of lists of people who have made specific searches on YouTube before as well (for example, searching: ""Best toolboxes to buy under $3,000""). This gives you even more opportunities to advertise to people who are likely to buy from you in real time using YouTube's platform.Reason 2: You can't target customers who are researching your competitors on Facebook anymoreIt used to be that you could target most of your competitors' fans or prospects while on Facebook, but not since the privacy policy changes in 2021. On the flip side, YouTube directly provides a way to get in front of your competitors' prospects while on YouTube who:


Have recently watched one of your competitors' YouTube channels (signaling future purchase probability), andAre currently watching a video about your competitors anywhere on YouTube (by having an ad appear during the video in question).Both of these methods can be very profitable for your business.While your competitors have paid big money to collect an audience in your niche, you can easily swoop in and steal these prospects by making a more compelling pitch during or after one of their videos. No fluff: This is the most profitable way for you to make money in online advertising today.While Facebook allows you to target competitor audiences, this generally only works for competitors with more than $100 million in yearly revenue.Reason 3: You can't target people who are actively seeking to solve problems on Facebook like you can on YouTubeYouTube has the second biggest search engine aside from Google itself. People visit daily to search for recommendations on whom to buy from in your niche. The question is if they will buy from you or somebody else who shows up for all your keywords in your space (for example, searching: ""Who has the lowest interest rates on VA loans in 2023?""). Finding customers on YouTube is similar to Google search, but cheaper because YouTube advertising is less competitive, with fewer companies investing in producing videos that run ads there.


Meta still does have some digital equivalent of knowing who's in the market for products/services in your niche as they collect data on what their logged-in users do after leaving Facebook. However, it's nothing like Google's level of data, where they have all their users' previous Google and YouTube search histories. According to Kinsta, Google Chrome also holds 77% of the web browser market users in 2023, adding to your advantage of using YouTube ads.Reason 4: YouTube's lead/purchase tracking is now much better than Facebook'sFacebook scaled back how many days they let you track users after clicking on one of your ads with changes to their attribution settings in January 2021. You can only track a user after clicking on one of your ads in Facebook for up to seven days, whereas it used to be up to 30 days.On the other hand, YouTube allows you to track users for up to 90 days after the user clicks on an ad and up to 30 days after just seeing your ad. More than 50% of people do not make a purchase in your market upon first making it to your site.Based on the Pareto Principle, you must find the 20% of your advertising that generates 80% of your results if you expect a good return from online advertising, and YouTube's extra bit of tracking data makes the difference.


Reason 5: For niche businesses, YouTube scales much more than FacebookIt is hard to build a campaign that scales on Facebook nowadays for niche businesses. Whereas Facebook's ad platform had been previously great at finding customers for niche businesses using their customer lookalikes matching algorithm, the results with this feature now are far less effective.For example, our company generated great results through Facebook ads for the Nolah Mattress company using their customer matching algorithm in 2017, however, when using the same exact algorithm to advertise a different mattress company The Spinery in 2023, the results were not nearly as effective.Knowing the exact 1,000 people that are considering a purchase in your space at any given time is far more important than the ability to get in front of random users on Facebook.SummaryYouTube gives you the perfect opportunity to get in front of savvy consumers to steer them in your direction while they research before making a purchase. Experienced marketers know this, which is why Wyzowl's 2021 video marketing survey showed a clear increase in the number of people creating YouTube ads. Therefore, in 2023, YouTube is considered a must-have tool to scale up any niche business.

93,Why Data Privacy is The Key to Building Consumer Trust in Marketing,"Jul 10, 2023",Vikas Agrawal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/want-to-build-trust-focus-on-data-privacy/454624,"
Did you know that 422.14 million people were impacted by data compromises in 2022 in the US alone? With increasing instances of data breaches and unauthorized data use, it's no wonder that data privacy has become the top priority for customers. A Cisco report states that 76% of people say they would not buy from a company they do not trust with their data.As a result, you must apply comprehensive data safety measures to retain your customers' trust in your company. This is especially crucial in marketing because customer data collection, storage and analysis drive modern marketing.If you are wondering how you can take measures to safeguard customer data while marketing and bolster their trust in your company, you're at the right place! I've put together this guide to help you understand data privacy in marketing in simple terms. It will also help you devise cost-effective strategies to adhere to customer data regulations.



Related: 8 Ways a Data Breach Could Take Out Your Company TomorrowUnderstanding data privacy in marketingData privacy in marketing refers to protecting and responsibly handling consumer information collected throughout your marketing endeavors. Why is this crucial?


Marketers engage in a plethora of data collection and handling activities. This includes personal and behavioral data that help them gain insights into their target audience and provide personalized experiences. However, the threat of data privacy breaches is growing daily, and a breach can have severe consequences.These include reputational damage, legal repercussions, financial loss and loss of customer trust. So, every marketer must prioritize customer data security and comply with privacy regulations. Let's understand how this works.Related: Schools Are Getting Slammed By Cyberattacks and Student Data Is No Longer Safe. Here's How to Navigate Cybersecurity in the New, Digital ClassroomEnsuring customer data protectionFirst, you must ensure your website is secure, and consumer data is used for legitimate purposes. After all, the Harvard Business Review found that 84% of consumers avoid shopping from brands with suspicious websites. But there's more! Here are the critical methods you must apply carefully to safeguard your consumer's privacy and trust.


1. Compliance with data protection regulationsThe most important step is to ensure compliance with data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States. These two acts are the primary customer data regulation frameworks, and if not followed, they lead to substantial fines and reputational damage.CCPA, which was enacted in 2020, grants consumers the right to know about collected personal data and request the deletion of their information. It mandates the organizations to provide a list of third-party organizations that will have access to the data upon request from the customer. Enterprises failing to comply with the regulation can face statutory damages that range from $100 to $750 per consumer per incident.GDPR was enacted in 2018. It grants individuals control over their data. Businesses that comply must obtain informed consent for data collection, provide privacy policies and notices and implement measures to protect the data. Noncompliance can result in a fine of â‚¬20 million or 4% of total revenue, whichever is higher.


By incorporating stringent measures as per these laws, you will fulfill the legal requirements and instill confidence in consumers regarding their information and strengthen the brand reputation.2. Implementing Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)Multi-factor authentication is an added layer of security for enhancing data security in marketing, and it is growing in use due to its effectiveness and ease of use. Under MFA, users must provide multiple forms of verification, such as a password or code sent to their phone number or email.As a marketer, you can implement MFA across customer portals, employee access, and administrative dashboard. You can also go a step ahead and implement advanced methods such as biometric systems to strengthen security further.


With MFA, you can significantly decrease the risk of a data breach by allowing only authorized individuals access to sensitive customer data. This will naturally bolster consumer trust regarding your data handling practices.Related: Safeguarding Your Corporate Environment from Social Engineering3. Implementing Decentralized FinanceDeFi is an innovative technology that uses blockchain to create a decentralized ecosystem for secure financial data management. As per a recent survey report by Antier Solutions, about 15-20% of small businesses are already utilizing DeFi services for financing successfully. This indicates that Defi is living up to its promise of safety and reliability. But what makes it so effective, you may ask?


DeFi platforms use ledger technology and cryptography to decentralize data storage and eliminate potential risks. Moreover, DeFi uses smart contracts to ensure transparency between both entities. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts that automatically execute predefined conditions and are stored in blockchain. You can utilize smart contracts to obtain consent from consumers regarding data collection and usage.In contrast to Defi, traditional centralized financing has data storage systems that pose inherent vulnerabilities to data breaches. So, vulnerability at even a single point can allow hackers to extract data.4. Prioritize Supplier and Vendor SecurityMarketers who collaborate with third-party suppliers and vendors may provide access to consumer data. If you are amongst them, it is necessary to conduct due diligence when selecting partners. Furthermore, your contracts with them should include provisions that require third parties to comply with the same data protection and privacy standards as you.


5. Establish Incident Response PlansDespite all measures, there's always a risk of things going south as technologies develop rapidly! So, developing a comprehensive incident response plan is vital as it helps you effectively address and mitigate the impact of any data breaches or privacy issues. Here's what you must do to establish an effective incident response plan-Start by establishing a cross-functional incident response team. This must comprise individuals from different departments, such as IT, communication, legal, etc., to bring together a range of expertise.You must have an escalation plan ready to ensure incidents are promptly forwarded to the appropriate management level.Develop clear communication protocols for both the internal stakeholders and external parties, such as the affected customers and regulatory authorities.Designate official spokespersons for prompt and transparent communication because it helps maintain trust and demonstrates a commitment to addressing the incident responsibly.Lastly, don't wait for emergencies! Conduct regular tabletop exercises and simulations to test the effectiveness of your plans and identify areas for improvement.Summing upData privacy has become the most fundamental aspect of maintaining customer trust and building strong relationships in the era of data-driven digital marketing. Its importance cannot be overstated in a world where data breaches are rising in frequency and customers are increasingly sensitive about their data safety.


So, remember to analyze and implement the points in this guide carefully and always stay up-to-date with the latest privacy regulations, data security threats, and customer expectations. The area of data safety is constantly evolving, and only the most agile and vigilant marketers will find lasting success.

Ashley Madison was pitched as a safe haven for infidelity, a confidential platform for connecting wandering spouses with new partners â€” until a hack exposed the darkest secrets of millions of users.In 2015, hackers released the data of 36 million Ashley Madison users across 46 countries, including people's names, phone numbers, addresses, credit card numbers, and even information about their sexual preferences, The New York Times reported at the time.The leak outed swarms of high-profile users from reality stars to clergy. The fallout led to a slew of divorces and reports of suicide.Eight years after the hack, no one has been charged in connection to the data breach.RELATED: T-Mobile Data Breach Affects 37 Million CustomersHulu is set to unpack the drama in a new mini-series titled ""The Ashley Madison Affair"" premiering on July 7.Keep scrolling for everything you need to know about the infamous Ashley Madison hack.What Is Ashley Madison?The website Ashleymadison.com was founded in 2001 by former sports lawyer Noel Biderman.The social media platform connected users looking for extramarital affairs and profited off the fees, which also included a $20 charge to delete users' private information as an extra layer of protection.



Prior to the hack in May 2015, Biderman told the BBC that he started the website to normalize infidelity. At the time, he was on a mission to take his company public (which didn't end up happening) after allegedly generating $150 million in revenue from subscriptions to the site the year prior.RELATED: Marriott Just Got Hit By Another Data Breachâ€”For At Least the 7th Time Since 2010Prior to generating millions in revenue, Ashley Madison rose in recognition for its aggressive marketing efforts, according to Vox. In 2009, the website caused a stir for trying to buy a Super Bowl ad. Although it was rejected, the ad went viral on YouTube.At the time of the hack, Ashleymadison.com was owned by Canada-based parent company Avid Life Media, which acquired Ashley Madison in 2007. That year, Biderman was appointed president and CEO of Avid Life. The parent company also owned several other websites that allowed people to indulge in fantasies. 


What Happened When Ashley Madison Was Hacked?On July 19, 2015, a hacking group called the ""Impact Team"" released a statement explaining they had hacked Ashley Madison and retrieved millions of pieces of confidential information. The group threatened to publish the data if the website was not deleted in 30 days.The news was first reported by technology journalist Brian Krebs on his website Krebsonsecurity.com. According to the statement, which Krebs obtained, the hackers said that Ashley Madison ""profits on the pain of others"" and shared alleged company secrets, including that the ""Full Delete"" feature, which was supposed to scrub a users history on the website for a fee, was not doing what it promised.""Full Delete netted ALM $1.7mm in revenue in 2014. It's also a complete lie,"" the hacking group said. ""Users almost always pay with credit card; their purchase details are not removed as promised, and include real name and address, which is, of course, the most important information the users want removed.""RELATED: I'm a Business News Editor, and Even I Fell Victim to an Online Scam That Cost Me $300


If Ashley Madison didn't comply with the hacker's demands, they threatened to release ""all customer records, including profiles with all the customers' secret sexual fantasies and matching credit card transactions, real names and addresses, and employee documents and emails.""After no movement from Ashley Madison, the hackers went ahead and published 9.7 gigabytes of data from 36 million users on the dark web on August 18, 2015.The hack released personal information and credit card history, including 15,000 government email addresses, Wired reported at the time. Additionally, the hackers alleged that the connections made on the website were fake and the work of bots.""We have explained the fraud, deceit, and stupidity of ALM and their members,"" the hackers said, per Wired. ""Now everyone gets to see their data.... Keep in mind the site is a scam with thousands of fake female profiles. See Ashley Madison fake profile lawsuit; 90-95% of actual users are male. Chances are your man signed up on the world's biggest affair site, but never had one. He just tried to. If that distinction matters.""


Avid Life Media denounced the hackers in a statement after the attack and proceeded to cooperate with police. Despite offering a $500,000 reward in Canadian currency (equal to $380,000 U.S. at the time), no one has been charged in connection to the hack to this day.RELATED: A Retired Teacher and Her Daughter Were Scammed Out of $200,000 Over Email: 'I'm 69 Years Old and Now I'm Broke and Homeless'Who Was on the Ashley Madison List and What Celebrities Were Called Out?

However, The Guardian reported that politicians, priests, military members, civil servants, and celebrities were among the hundreds of public figures named for having Ashley Madison members.The aftermath of the hack cost lives.


Two people died by suicide after being outed for their participation on the platform, Reuters reported at the time. Additionally, CNN reported that a pastor and professor at New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, John Gibson, took his life after he was exposed on the website. He was 56 years old.Josh Duggar, whose greatly religious family was known for their hit TLC show ""19 Kids and Counting,"" was called out for paying nearly $1,000 for two Ashley Madison accounts from 2013 to 2015. He married his wife Anna in 2008.""I have been the biggest hypocrite ever. While espousing faith and family values, I have secretly over the last several years been viewing pornography on the internet and this became a secret addiction and I became unfaithful to my wife,"" he said in a statement at the time, according to the International Business Times.Despite his infidelity and later his child pornography prison sentence, he and Anna are still married.RELATED: Avoid Falling Victim to a Remote Job Scam With These Expert TipsOther notable names exposed in the hack were Christian blogger Sam Rader, Casey Anthony prosecutor and Florida state attorney Jeff Ashton, and Josh Taekman, husband to former Real Housewives of New York star Kristen Taekman.""I signed up for the site foolishly and ignorantly with a group of friends and I deeply apologize for any embarrassment of pain I have brought to my wife and family,"" Taekman said in a statement at the time. ""We both look forward to moving past this and getting on with our lives."" The Taekmans are still married.Founder Noel Biderman wasn't safe from the hack, either. The leak included three years of stolen emails from Biderman exposing his extramarital affairs. He had previously denied participating in his own website, Krebs on Security reported.He resigned from his position as CEO in August 2015.


Where Is Ashley Madison Now? In the months and years following the attack, many of those exposed have been the target of extortion emails. In some cases, the emails revealed personal information and demanded $1,000 in Bitcoin as ransom, according to Forbes.After Biderman resigned as CEO, he was replaced by Rob Segal as CEO and James Millership as president in April 2016, per The New York Times. They later changed the name of the parent company Avid Life Media to Ruby Corp.Together they ramped up damage control, including highering outside help to secure their website from future attacks and publicly stating their no-bot policy.Additionally, they were investigated by the FTC and hit with a slew of lawsuits. In December 2016, the FTC found that Ashley Madison deceived its customers and failed to protect its users, a press release stated at the time. They were ordered to pay a $1.6 million settlement.

In 2016 the website had 45 million subscribers and brought in $80 million in revenue, per NYT.In 2017, Paul Keable stepped up as Ruby Corp CEO, which he still holds today. He said that the website reached 65 million subscribers in 2019 during a March 2020 interview with Venture Beat. Additionally, he said the website received 17,000 new subscribers a day during the throws of the COVID-19 pandemic.

97,Writing Content With AI Won't Help You Win Against Google Search Rankings. Here's Why.,"Jun 30, 2023",Summit Ghimire,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/why-using-ai-to-write-content-wont-help-you-rank-on-google/454021,"
When it comes to navigating times of recent upheaval, few industries have had to navigate change as much as the world of search engine optimization. It's been chaotic, to put it mildly.After surviving the seismic shifts of Google's Helpful Content Update, rolled out in the fall of 2022, SEO professionals were caught up in the uproar ignited by OpenAI's ChatGPT program in early 2023. By February, Google was issuing guidance regarding artificial intelligence-created content. Then, in March, it released its first core algorithm update of 2023, followed by a page experience adjustment in April and a significant reviews system update.May then arrived, and with it, the annual Google I/O developer conference; it was here that the Alphabet Co. announced the gradual rollout of a new update for its helpful content system. The update is designed to help the company take into account personal and expert points of view, integrating a high value placed on experience when it comes to its search results and rankings system.



Suppose we step back and consider the myriad changes throughout 2022 and 2023; we sift through the haze of the ""AI vs. Human"" content creation debate. Clearing out all the confusion, we can hone in on core principles of ""people-first content creation"" moving forward.For a truly impactful user experience, designers must prioritize every part of Google's E-E-A-T guidance: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness. When paired with an effective page experience, quality content will satisfy the algorithm and, most importantly, the visitors.


Related: Small Businesses Can and Should Consider Investing in AI Technology â€” With a Cautious ApproachGoogle's Helpful Content Update and the emphasis on people-first contentIn late 2022, Google completed its Helpful Content Update rollout, a major course adjustment designed to be a haymaker punch against a glut of SEO-first content. The goal was to better recognize and reward websites that prioritize people-first content.The company fights a relentless battle against content with little-to-no value, the meaningless content that clutters up the internet and endlessly frustrates web users searching for â€” you guessed it â€” truly helpful content. Google has long been committed to ensuring a quality user experience for everyone that uses its search engine, and rightly so. Website visitors deserve not just high-quality content but easy-to-find resources.The company's Q2 2023 core update in March carried intentions similar to the initial Helpful Content Update. The company explained, ""The changes are about improving how our systems assess content overall.""


First announced in May, the new wave of changes is driven by the same motivation. In addition to a new ""Perspectives"" filter designed to highlight the relevant experiences of others in search results, the gradual update also aims to find the ""hidden gems"" often lost in ""unexpected or hard-to-find places.""Quality content matters, whether from AI or human effortIn February 2023, Google clarified its position on AI-generated content, clearing up the confusion that had been brewing. The company prioritizes high-quality content, regardless of whether humans or machines generate it.On the Google Search Central Blog, the company wrote, ""It's important to recognize that not all use of automation, including AI generation, is spam. Automation has long been used to generate helpful content."" More so, it continued, ""AI can power new levels of expression and creativity, and serve as a critical tool to help people create great content for the web.""This is the heart of the matter: AI is a tool, not a comprehensive replacement. It is one tool among many in the creator's toolbox.


However, it is abundantly clear using automation or AI strictly to manipulate rankings in search results is viewed as a violation of the company's spam policies. The company has a long track record of prioritizing the integrity and trustworthiness of high-quality content.Related: How to Make Great Content â€” And Get More ViewsIntention is key to Google's algorithmWhen creating content, it's important to begin by clarifying your intention. What is the purpose of a website's content? The search algorithm is finely tuned to identify the markers of generic content designed only to snag the attention of the crawlers that scout the nooks and crannies.Operate with the intent to provide ""original, valuable content that offers a satisfying experience,"" and you'll set yourself up for success, with the caveat for content creators that any final product ""adheres closely to their area of expertise."" In 2023, experience may be a finalist for the SEO industry's themes of the year.


Three questions can serve as effective guardrails during the creative process; Google recommends asking: Who? How? Why?Who authored it? Is the byline easy to find? Is further information about the author(s) accessible or evident?Is it clear how a piece of content was created? Is there evidence to substantiate the information given? Was automation or artificial intelligence used in the creative process? If so, why?Why was the content created? Specifically, how is it helpful or useful for visitors?Adding an E to E-A-T: the importance of evident experienceAbove all, Google's ranking systems aim to identify content demonstrating expertise, experience, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness (E-E-A-T). In December 2022, Google added the second E for experience.They've recognized the importance visitors place on the validity of the information. They want to see evidence of relevant experience that an author possesses. The more the visitor believes in the author's experience and knowledge, the more they are likely to trust the authority and trustworthiness of the content, and the better their overall experience.Related: How to Outrank AI-Generated Content With Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness


Focus on quality content to boost user experience, regardless of how you attain itOne constant throughout the evolution of Google's search algorithm is the importance of the user's experience. Ensuring quality websites populate for any query is the foundation of retaining visitors. A positive user experience encompasses many elements outside of content quality, like a site's page performance â€” but ultimately, content is king.However you decide to integrate AI technology into your creative process, the quality of and intention behind the content and the level of expertise made evident should serve as your guideposts to the sustained success of your website.

As I can personally attest, working for a company that is quickly expanding has its perks and is an exhilarating experience. The environment is fast-paced, always changing and employees at all levels have opportunities to stretch the boundaries of their current roles to grow professionally. At the same time, setbacks are inevitable for any business â€” but for fast-growing companies in particular, scaling and resources can be some of the biggest challenges, which is why choosing the right marketing tools is crucial for long-term success.Here are the five most indispensable marketing tools that will take your business to the next level.Related: 10 Marketing Strategies to Fuel Your Business Growth



1. Marketing automation softwareWhat if you had a tool that could help you stay in front of your prospects and customers with content that is both timely and relevant? That is the power of marketing automation, making marketers more efficient and their communications more personalized. A recent survey we conducted found that email marketing was the most common area where B2B marketing leaders utilize marketing automation, though more are beginning to use it in other channels.The same survey also found that 87% of respondents now have some or all of their customer journeys fully automated, with many respondents reporting plans to continue to optimize this piece of their marketing strategy. This isn't surprising due to the host of benefits that can accompany the use of marketing automation â€” notably, it can help to eliminate mundane, time-consuming tasks for your marketing team, which in turn allows them to focus on the larger strategic initiatives to drive business growth.


As a fast-growing company, you likely don't have the time or the resources to get it all done. Marketing automation is essentially an extra hand (or two) that can be a tremendous help. Plus, customers have no idea if something is automated or not because you can still personalize your content as though it was sent especially for them based on their preferences and behaviors.2. SEO intelligence applicationsYou could be writing amazing blog posts and webpages, but if you're not hitting on the right keywords, you're missing the mark. Effective, optimized content continues to be the most long-term, high-value strategy that companies rely on. Without an SEO tool, your team is merely guessing and possibly flying blind. There are many choices available and some have ultra-low and even free entry points, so the message is clear: Pick one and act on it. These tools will help you choose the right keywords and phrases to use and help you monitor the competition to see where you can improve.Related: 3 Marketing Tactics Entrepreneurs Should Implement to Improve Their Return on Investment3. Middleware/app connectorsThis is about leveraging the application programming interface (API) economy to connect and optimize all of your software tools. In 2022, organizations worldwide reported that they were using an average of 130 SaaS applications. That is a lot of software! It also means that integration is one of the keys to success for fast-growing companies, especially when it comes to applications. If your platforms aren't ""talking to each other,"" your customer relationships will likely suffer as a result.


If you have a sales software program and a separate billing app and they aren't synced, your customer isn't going to be too happy when you reach out about a new feature if they were overcharged for something. But you won't know this if your sales and billing software don't integrate. By utilizing an app connector, you can create workflows across IT, marketing, HR, finance, sales and customer support to leverage your tech stack to its fullest potential. When the process is seamless, your growing customer relationships and profits will flourish as a result.4. A project and task management toolYour marketing team is an interconnected group of experts who rely on each other to achieve their goals. For example, when your digital marketers run an ad, they need the content team to write copy, the graphics team to design ads and the marketing operations team to schedule follow-up emails when people engage with ads. These things must happen in a sequence so that everyone meets their deadlines; e.g. the design team can't design the ad without the copy coming first.In short, communication and hand-offs among these team members are vital, and therefore a project management tool is a must. If your team is two or three people, perhaps a spreadsheet and a Slack channel will do. Any more than that, and you've got to up your game.Related: 3 Marketing Trends to Adopt in 2023


5. A CRM that scales as you growCustomer relationship management (CRM) is one of the most important tools that all companies, especially fast-growing ones, need to invest in. That's because CRM enables a heightened customer experience by showcasing the status of each relationship in real time, which is critical. When utilized, you have a 360-degree view of each customer at all times across all of your internal teams. One important factor that fast-growing companies need to factor in when choosing a CRM is that it must be able to scale with you as you grow. Legacy CRMs can be limited in their scope as your business grows, but a modern CRM tool will do the opposite â€” they were built for businesses of all sizes, and the platform is flexible and scalable, which is key.Being part of a fast-growing company is exciting and terrifying at the same time, but if you implement these strategic marketing tools into your plan (and budget), you can scale successfully to grow and flourish with the right marketing systems in place.

99,Why SEO Is Critical for Small Businesses (and How to Improve It),"Jun 19, 2023",Joseph Camberato,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-seo-is-critical-for-small-businesses/452721,"
Search engine optimization (SEO) helps increase website traffic by improving search engine ranking. If you've wondered whether your small business really needs to focus on SEO, you aren't alone.Over 50% of small businesses don't have an SEO strategy, and 22% have no plans to create or implement one in the coming year. Considering that SEO can help businesses establish authority within an industry and build brand awareness, neglecting to explore the world of SEO can severely limit growth.Further, it's a great way to organically promote a business for free. Organizations of all sizes can benefit from SEO, whether it is an online shop or a brick-and-mortar business.



Related: 5 Essential SEO Strategies For EntrepreneursBenefits of SEO for small businessesAs stated, good SEO practice for small businesses is a must. Here are just a few reasons why:


Cost-effective: When compared to paid advertising, SEO is a cost-effective strategy for small businesses. You may choose to invest in paid software to help you measure your results, but the benefits will far outweigh the costs.Improves the user experience: By focusing on SEO, you'll improve the user experience for your website visitors. This will improve engagement and likely result in higher conversion rates.Competitive advantage: By investing in SEO, you'll gain a competitive advantage over other businesses in your industry. For instance, let's say you run a service-based business and target local customers. Focusing on SEO means your business will show up higher in search results when customers look for local businesses in the same category.Long-term results: SEO is a long-term strategy that will continue to benefit your business for years to come. Paid ads stop generating traffic once you stop paying, but SEO will continue to deliver results over time.How to develop an SEO strategyWithout a proper strategy, it will be impossible to capitalize on SEO. Here are four strategies small businesses can use to create a strong SEO strategy that will carry a business into the future and pay dividends in the long term.1. Keyword research:Google's algorithm is always changing, but one SEO strategy that has remained fairly consistent over the years is keyword research. When you do keyword research, look for words and phrases that your target audience will be searching for on Google.As your business begins to rank for those keywords, you'll start to get more traffic to the company website. When you're just getting started, it's a good idea to look for high-volume, low-competition keywords.


That means a lot of people are searching for that keyword, but it's still pretty easy to rank highly for it. The easiest way to find this information is by using a keyword planner. This software can be expensive, but you can find free tools to use.Related: 7 Ways Small Businesses Can Use SEO to Boost Customer Service2. Optimize your website:Once you know what keywords you're trying to rank for, you're going to strategically place them throughout your website. For example, you can use certain keywords in the alt tags of images, the titles of your posts and page descriptions.


Simply adding keywords to your website won't be enough on its own â€” you also need to consider how well the website functions overall. For example, your page speed is a significant ranking factor because a fast-loading website improves the user experience.Since most people use phones to access the internet, you also need to make sure your website is mobile-optimized. If not, you'll probably have a high bounce rate since the website won't format correctly on mobile devices.3. Get backlinks from high-authority websites:Google gives more weight to credible sources, so another SEO strategy is to get backlinks from high-authority sites. One way to obtain backlinks is by becoming an expert source for journalists and bloggers.


If you join a free site called Help a Reporter Out (HARO), you'll see requests from journalists looking for sources to use in articles they're writing. You can monitor these requests daily and send pitches when you have something valuable to contribute.This strategy isn't easy, and it's important to always send high-value pitches. Still, if you stick with it, you'll start to receive backlinks and build your domain authority over time.4. Regularly create new content:Consistently creating new content is another way to improve SEO ranking since Google rewards sites that create high-quality content. However, you need to publish new content on a regular basis, not just every once in a while.


The easiest way to do this is by coming up with a content calendar and publishing schedule. Brainstorm 12-15 potential blog posts you could write, and figure out how often you can realistically write new articles. You can also start incorporating relevant keywords into your blog posts.If you're wondering whether SEO matters for small businesses, the answer is a resounding yes. As a small business owner, SEO can help you increase your online visibility, build credibility and attract the right audience to your website.It's a cost-effective marketing solution that delivers long-term results. You won't see results immediately, but with time and effort, you'll continue to improve your Google ranking.Related: A Basic Guide to SEO and Its Impact on Online Businesses

103,Top 6 Ecommerce Trends You Need to Know in 2023,"Jun 15, 2023",Mohamed Elhawary,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/6-ecommerce-trends-you-need-to-know-this-year/452998,"

Read along as we unravel the technological marvels that can redefine the ecommerce industry in 2023 and beyond.1. Social commerceOver the last few years, social media platforms have emerged as one of the most powerful marketing tools. From being designed as communication platforms, functioning as business opportunity providers, helping companies to market products, engage customers online and provide real-time customer support, social commerce has come a long way. It has been estimated that more than 100 million Americans indulge in online shopping through social media platforms, with Facebook marketplace being a top choice. Thus the ability to find the required products on their favorite social network, with a unique shopping experience, this online retail is surely one of the biggest eCommerce tech trends for 2023.



Related: What Brands Need to Know About Social Commerce2. Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL)Buy Now Pay Later is a unique tech trend that is a hyped ecommerce tech trend for 2023. The BNPL service allows customers to purchase the required goods with easy and interest-free installments, making high-value products more accessible and affordable. They no longer require traditional credit cards or to pay upfront payments. With just a few clicks, customers can opt for the BNPL option at the checkout and proceed with their transactions.


This service gained massive traction during the COVID-19 pandemic as people wanted flexible and alternative funding sources, and BNPL was an ideal option. Nowadays, most ecommerce has integrated the BNPL service and streamlined the checkout processes, providing a user-friendly and financially empowering solution for consumers.Related: The Future of Online Shopping Is 'Buy Now, Pay Later'3. AI-powered personalizationWith 2023 rolling out, artificial intelligence has surfaced as one of the most popular ecommerce tech trends. In times when everything is available to everyone online and online presence has become an everyday norm, consumers do not want to be treated like a coded entry on the Excel sheet of clients.They want to enjoy a more personalized experience with the brands they are willing to invest in. Thanks to the rapid technological advancement in digital marketing, AI has provided multiple digitally powered solutions. AI-powered chatbots and AI voice assistants are one of the most popular ones. An AI Chatbot can keep your customers engaged throughout the journey, from providing a personalized greeting message to assisting with all intersecting ends.


They can analyze larger chunks of customer data and predict buying habits, which can help provide relevant information to the clients and keep them meaningfully engaged with the brand. On the other hand, an AI power voice assistant responds to the consumer's verbal commands and provides them with the most relevant results.4.

This is an online platform where the host shows different goods to the consumers in real-time. While it is a relatively new trend in the USA, picking up pace in 2023, it has already made its mark in countries like China and India. Streaming allows companies to show their product in all dynamics, respond to real-time customer requests and engage with their feedback instantly. Thus with the customer attention span dropping each year, livestream commerce is a prominent trend to invest in in 2023.Related: 3 Ecommerce Trends You Need to Know in 20235.

It streamlines all the critical processes involved, including sourcing, production, transportation and distribution.In the modern digital world, companies optimize their supply chain by using innovative AI technology, which helps them predict the demand, generate a desired inventory, build an efficient network design and pre-analyze distribution inefficiencies.While the ecommerce field is experiencing a boom, as more and more people prefer online convenient shopping, this has also pushed companies to put forward their front foot and cope with the emerging eCommerce tech trends. With the correct tools and innovations, businesses can capitalize on new opportunities, revolutionize customer experiences and stand out in a crowded digital retail space.

104,Google Employees Are Reportedly Mocking the Company's Updated Hybrid Work Policy,"Jun 14, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/google-workers-slam-new-hybrid-work-policy-on-internal-site/454128,"
Last week, Google told employees in a company-wide email that new measures would be taken to update its hybrid work policy in an effort to strengthen its in-office presence.The updates included stricter measures to hold employees accountable, such as giving reminders to workers with frequent absences, tracking office badge swipes, and considering attendance reports in performance reviews.Google's Chief People Officer, Fiona Cicconi, wrote in the email that when employees spend at least three days a week in the office, they ""feel more connected to other Googlers.""



However, it seems not all Googlers are on board.To be clear: ""return to office"" actually means taking away people's offices.At home, I have an office. At Google I have a desk (at best). https://t.co/rWX6ZIjASlâ€” Kenn Knowles (@KennKnowles) June 8, 2023An internal site called Memegen has been flooded with posts and comments regarding the new policy, CNBC reported, with some comparing the new policy to treating the employees like ""schoolchildren.""""If you cannot attend the office today, your parents should submit an absence request,"" one post viewed by the outlet reads. ""Check my work, not my badge,"" says another.A spokesperson for Google told Entrepreneur that the badge records are reviewed to identify those with prolonged and consistent absences (if someone hasn't shown up in four or five weeks). The company doesn't review individual swipes or daily attendance, he added, as Google expects that workers are coming in three times a week as per the policy.""Our hybrid approach is designed to incorporate the best of being together in person with the benefits of working from home for part of the week,"" the spokesperson said. ""Now that we're more than a year into this way of working, we're formally integrating this approach into all of our workplace policies.""


Google, which has long been known for its extensive office perks and campus-like environment, has cut back on some benefits over the past year in an effort to cut costs as in-office attendance has dwindled â€” and it's not just free snacks or fitness classes, some workers say they don't even have the essentials.Related: Google CEO Responds to Accusations That Company is 'Nickel and Diming' Workers: 'We Shouldn't Always Equate Fun With Money'""New York City workers do not even have enough desks and conference rooms for workers to use comfortably,"" Chris Schmidt, a software engineer at Google, told CNBC.

106,How to Do Good With Your Data and Harness Analytics to Serve Underserved Populations,"Jun 12, 2023",Scott Straub,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-to-harness-data-for-the-underserved-market/452545,"
Simply knowing who's included in our most underserved populations can be a challenge that makes public sector outreach nearly impossible. To overcome these obstacles and better serve consumers, we must first identify the underserved and their needs. Public agencies can use two powerful tools to help reach the most vulnerable: credit and alternative data.Defining underserved populationsThe first thing agencies must do is understand what an underserved population is. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has a good definition specific to healthcare: individuals who have experienced healthcare disparities. Healthcare disparities can manifest due to a lack of available services, difficulty accessing care and limited knowledge about navigating the healthcare system or finding providers. Agencies looking to define underserved populations can adapt this definition to their specific fields.The Federal Reserve also has a good working definition: people who don't have access to a bank. This lens is handy because a lack of access to essential banking functions is a significant barrier to receiving other public services. Without a bank account, options to cash checks are limited and often come with additional hurdles like stricter controls, timing requirements, increased fees and more. Those without a bank account also can't receive direct-deposit benefits or savings interest rates that could help them get ahead. Identifying the unbanked or underbanked first is an excellent way to use data to find and reach more individuals likely underserved by public benefits.



Research shows underserved populations regularly fit into specific demographic groups. These groups include the unemployed and elderly, veterans, disabled persons, those living below the poverty line and those residing in rural areas. Through a combination of factors, these groups are at the highest risk of needing government benefits while often participating in assistance programs at lower rates.Related: Leverage the Power of Data to Boost Your Sales â€” and Your Customer Connections


Out-of-reach insightsAs it stands, government agencies could better understand who uses their services. A lack of comprehensive understanding is partly due to outdated privacy laws and red tape; until recently, government websites weren't allowed to collect cookies on their visitors. Of course, there's a fine line between privacy protection practices and using data to reach underserved populations better. Still, many government agencies can be more effective in using the data they have at their disposal. Crucial insights may remain out of reach for agencies that struggle to analyze the reams of data that can exist across systems.Public sector executives must meet this pervading problem with a viable solution. Veterans are one significantly underserved group â€” often because states don't have access to a robust database covering their veteran populations. However, they're only one of the groups often overlooked by public agencies. And while many agencies are getting better at using digital tools and data analytics, there's still work to be done. Improving outreach is one way to close this gap, and we can do so through the judicious use of good data.Related: Using Data Analytics Will Transform Your Business. Here's How.Data unlocks doors The private sector is good at leveraging data to identify and reach its customers. Most brands and companies know the demographic data of their typical consumers â€” and they're experts at turning that knowledge into profits. Data can reveal where a company's target market lives, how it responds to advertising and other key behaviors that better enable retailer outreach. Public sector agencies can operate in the same way.For example, take the bus system in Montgomery County, Maryland. The county's Department of Transportation redesigned its bus system to introduce the Flash. That redesign happened because the agency looked at its proprietary data behind its typical user. Before the redesign, bus riders often had to make multiple transfers, adding inconvenience to their lives.


The Montgomery County Department of Transportation (MCDOT) reviewed whom this problem impacted, the peak times it affected them, and how the city utilized the busing system. Then, it created new routes, resulting in significantly improved and efficient customer experiences. Innovations like these are precisely what other public sector agencies need to embrace to serve constituents more effectively.Related: Redefining Customer Engagement in a World Where Data Privacy ReignsTaking actionGood data is essential to determine the best way to connect with consumers. But how exactly do busy public sector leaders begin implementing a more robust data analytics strategy? External data is readily available through many public sources. Companies like credit reporting agencies have access to a plethora of information on underserved populations. They can help pinpoint the most vulnerable audiences â€” who they are and what they need â€” to maximize the good a new outreach program can do.Internal usage data may also be key to determining the highest area of need. Public transit is an excellent example: Adding a bus route in an affluent suburb may not be as important as expanding or optimizing routes in a high-density metropolitan area because most suburban people have cars. Agencies will only discover information like this by leveraging data.Analytics are particularly valuable when they inform the best strategy to reach those in need. Not all methods work for all audiences; one group may be best reached via email, another may be more open to television ads, and yet another may be most receptive to telephonic outreach. Analytics can provide valuable insights that keep agencies from wasting resources on dead-ends or unnecessary services.


Quality service begins with informed outreachPublic services are intended to help the people who need them most. But to meet the mark, we must first know their needs. Improving the customer experience begins with a solid outreach strategy guided by both external and internal data and analytics.Modern tools can help us close the gap in need, enhancing the quality of life for the most vulnerable and elevating our society. Data is the engine powering the train toward that goal.

107,These Major Companies Are Closed on Juneteenth in 2023,"Jun 12, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/what-companies-are-closed-on-juneteenth-2022/429409,"
Since Juneteenth was designated a federal holiday in the United States by President Biden last year, governors, mayors and CEOs of major companies have followed suit and given employees the day off as a paid holiday.Juneteenth, recognized annually on June 19, marks the anniversary of the day federal troops liberated the last enslaved people in Galveston, Texas in 1884. That day, nearly two-and-a-half years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, is recognized as the effective end of slavery in the United States.Related: 21 Inspiring Quotes From Black Leaders From Throughout American History



Juneteenth is the first new federal holiday since 1983, with Martin Luther King Jr. Day being the last to be instituted. Although Juneteenth is now recognized on a federal level, not all companies and states have complied. But certain companies have stepped up to honor Juneteenth this year and beyond.When is Juneteenth recognized in 2023?Juneteenth is Monday June 19, 2023.


Who gets Juneteenth off as a paid holiday?Juneteenth is now one of 11 federal holidays, joining others like Christmas and the Fourth of July. Federal organizations such as banks and public schools observe these holidays by giving employees the day off.State vs. national regulationsAlthough Juneteenth was officially designated a federal holiday by the Biden administration in 2021, certain states and cities abide by their own regulations, with some having recognized the day as a state holiday before 2021. New York, New Jersey, Virginia, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Washington, Oregon and Delaware have all made Juneteenth a state holiday â€” with Texas being far ahead of the pack by instituting it in 1980 and Massachusetts in 2007. New York, New Jersey, Virginia, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania recognized the holiday in 2020 â€” a year before it became federally instated â€” prompted by the murder of George Floyd. When a holiday is recognized at the state level, all government employees and programs have the day off to observe. Private businesses and organizations determine their schedules.Related: Here's How Business Leaders Are Responding to the George Floyd ProtestsThese major companies have announced Juneteenth is now an annual company holidayBig names like Nike, Target and Best Buy are setting the standard for others to follow by observing the day with either time off or extra pay.


Nike announced in 2020 it would be recognizing Juneteenth as a paid federal holiday for all its U.S. and Puerto Rican employees. ""Across our Nike, Converse, and Jordan family, we will close our corporate, retail, manufacturing and distribution operations in observance of Juneteenth to provide educational opportunities that honor Black history and culture,"" said Nike director of communications for North America Jenna Golden in an email to NPR.Ride-sharing app Lyft is honoring Juneteenth as a paid company holiday for all corporate employees. However, the policy doesn't apply to Lyft drivers, who are independent contractors.Related: More Companies Have Designated Juneteenth a Paid Holiday (Updated)Zillow is also giving employees the day off for Juneteenth. ""As part of our ongoing commitment to racial equality, Zillow observes Juneteenth as a paid company holiday, and encourages employees to take the day for reflection, volunteerism, education, and activism to commemorate the end of slavery in the U.S.,"" Zillow vice president Kristina Adamski said in a statement.


Tech companies like Twitter, Google, and Square have joined in making Juneteenth a paid company holiday, with Twitter making its signature blue bird logo black on the holiday in 2020 and adding the hashtag BlackLivesMatter to its description. Google also hosts a company-wide ""Juneteenth Day of Learning"" prior to the day off. Amazon has not made Juneteenth a company holiday, but has adopted an anti-meeting approach to the day, as well as offering a range of ""online learning opportunities"" throughout the day.Certain retail corporations, such as Target and Starbucks, have opted to stay open but will pay employees time-and-a-half on Juneteenth.What does it mean moving forward?Because Juneteenth is still fairly new to the federal holiday calendar, many businesses have yet to sort out an adjusted schedule for workers. Still, the companies that have acknowledged the holiday since day one are setting an example for others to follow.Related: Walmart Juneteenth Ice Cream: Retailer Pulls Flavor From Shelves Amid Major Backlash

Over the past three years, remote and hybrid work has swept the workforce, and some employees prefer doing their jobs from the comfort of their own homes â€” much to the chagrin of many companies that want their workers in the office.Now, Google is set to crack down on employees who haven't been coming into the office.On Wednesday, Google's Chief People Officer, Fiona Cicconi, told employees in a company-wide email that new initiatives will be taken regarding the hybrid work policy will be enforced, The Wall Street Journal reported, including issuing reminders to workers with frequent absences, tracking office badge swipes, and factoring attendance in performance reviews.



Cicconi wrote in the email that Googlers who spend at least three days a week in the office ""feel more connected to other Googlers"" and it is ""magnified when teammates work from the same location,"" Cicconi wrote in the email, viewed by WSJ.""Of course, not everyone believes in 'magical hallway conversations,' but there's no question that working together in the same room makes a positive difference,"" the email said.
