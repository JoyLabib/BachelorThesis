Today, Joshua Britton is the founder and CEO of Debut, a biotechnology company delivering ""high-performing"" cosmetic bioactive ingredients ""at unprecedented speed."" But before the startup began to innovate in the biotech space, it was just an idea, one that stemmed from ""some academic research,"" ""a lucky Uber ride"" and a ""vision for the beauty industry,"" Britton says.Image Credit: Billy Economou, BE Studios. Joshua Britton.Britton completed his Ph.D. in biochemistry and organic chemistry before furthering his studies at University of California, Irvine. Afterward, he decided to apply what he'd learned to ""this new thing called cell-free and synthetic biology,"" which refers to the processes within biotechnology that enable the creation or modification of biological organisms. Essentially, enzymes or microbes can be ""taught"" how to make powerful ingredients — including plant or flower molecules — in a reactor in a lab setting.



Naturally, the process comes with massive implications for the multi-billion-dollar beauty industry, which relies on natural ingredients for fragrance and other properties. Britton decided it was time to bring the biotech mainstream. But, of course, he also needed to fund the venture. While working at the back of his professor's lab by day, he had a side hustle driving for Uber at night to earn some extra cash. When he got to talking with one passenger and pitched her his idea, she was sold — and wrote him a $100,000 check to support his efforts.Related: EntrepreneurTV Is Now Live — and Free.

Britton's passenger would be Debut's first investor, but certainly not its last: The company raised $22.6 million in a Series A round led by Material Impact in 2021 and $40 million in a Series B round led by BOLD, the venture capital fund of L'Oréal, the world's largest cosmetics company, last year.""Whenever people want [fragrance] products, they have to effectively use agriculture to get them.""Debut has already brought the technology to market with a consumer skincare brand called Deinde, which targets inflammaging, a process associated with the aging of the human body. The products contain Naringenin, a potent polyphenol typically found in grapefruit peel that's been clinically proven to strengthen the skin barrier and reduce inflammation. According to Britton, the clinical claims allow for ""product differentiation in market,"" and many brands are coming to Debut as they seek to convert from other mainstays like Vitamin C, niacinamide and squalane.But fragrance will be Debut's next frontier, a move that coincides with growing consumer demand for transparency and natural ingredients — and concerns over the beauty industry's impact on dwindling natural resources. The majority of fragrance ingredients from fragrance houses are cultivated, perhaps from the ""from the lavender fields of France"" or the roots of a certain type of tree, Britton says, which requires land, water and agrochemical use.

One Company Dared to Go Where None Had Before — and Even Levi's Is On Board.""Whenever people want these products, they have to effectively use agriculture to get them,"" Britton explains. ""The fragrance industry has been very good at hiding the fact that the majority of fragrances are actually chemically derived. If you dig pretty deep into them, you'll find that they're made from petroleum-based synthesis. And that's just what we're looking to change.""""There could be 200 or 300 compounds in there all at different levels. And you have to be able to mimic that exactly in a bioreactor.""When it comes to fragrance, Debut is all about ""mimicking nature."" Sometimes, that means mirroring a single ingredient, a process that's not unlike making wine or beer, where a watery, sugary solution is mixed with a cell, but instead of producing wine or beer, it produces a fragrance model, Britton explains. It's a method that involves limited land use, no agrochemicals and ""very little waste.""


Of course, some scents ""are very complex mixtures"" that require a careful balance of different notes — and Debut has developed the technology to replicate those as well, Britton says. ""The nose is so sensitive that if you have a fragrance from a root, for example, what you'll see is there could be 200 or 300 compounds in there all at different levels,"" he explains. ""And you have to be able to mimic that exactly in a bioreactor. If you [don't], then you won't have the same smell, and the product won't be successful.""Related: The Future of Food: How Biotech Will Save Us AllDebut is all about putting successful products in the hands of consumers — foregoing biotech's standard horizontal integration model, whereby companies seek out a scientific solution that's then produced at a very small scale for a vertical one that emphasizes the end consumer and product from the start, according to Britton.""When we think about how to bring synthetic biology to people, it's in the form of tangible products,"" Britton says. ""That means that we have to not only do groundbreaking research but also interact with our consumers and users. We have to understand how to make formulations. We have to make physical products.""

1,Most People Have No Business Starting a Business. Here's What to Consider Before You Become an Entrepreneur,"Apr 22, 2024",Cynthia Kay,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/what-to-consider-before-starting-a-business/472665,"
There is no such thing as the perfect time to start a business. I know. Growing up in a family business, I always thought I would love to own my own business, but I was waiting for the perfect time. Then, I got fired from my job in broadcasting and had to decide what to do. Was I ready to take on being a business owner? Did I have enough experience? Where would the start-up funding come from? Did I want to own one, or was I just enamored with the American dream of being a business owner?The hard truth is that most people have no business starting a business because they have unrealistic expectations and have not done the hard work to ensure its success. The statistics bear that out. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""20% of new businesses fail during the first two years, 45% during the first five years, and 65% during the first ten years.""I have been in business for more than 35 years, which puts me in the category of only 25% of the companies that make it 15 years or more. Am I clever or lucky? Or a little of both? I believe that small businesses could significantly improve their odds by starting the right business at the right time and taking the right steps.



Related: You Won't Be a Successful Entrepreneur Until You Adopt These 3 HabitsThe right businessIdeally, there are two things to consider. First, the type of business. The right business for one person is very different than the right business for another. In my case, broadcasting experience was a great foundation for starting a media production company. I had worked for several television stations in a variety of roles, so I understood both the production aspects, what might be compared to operations in other businesses, and the financial considerations.


When you start a business in an industry where you know you have an edge, you see the opportunities and the pitfalls. You can become a recognized leader faster than someone who is just getting started. You also may have recognition or awards that give you instant credibility. In my case, I have won over thirty broadcast awards, indicating that I was a seasoned professional.One side note: I know people who have been very successful in starting businesses without a specific background in the product or service. These are, however, well-educated businesspeople who can successfully lead an operation and have found others with the skills and understanding of the industry. Being a franchisee is another way to get started because the franchise owner has put the products, systems and training in place to jumpstart ownership.The second thing to consider is the business owner's passion and commitment level. Even knowledgeable and prepared individuals must work hard during the first few years to set the foundation. Business owners know that means missing family events, long hours, and plowing money back into the operation instead of putting it in their pockets. If you have a passion for business, it is easy to stick it out. If you don't, resentment builds, and the business suffers.Related: Passion, Freedom, Impact: The 3 Ingredients of Business Success


The right timeYou might think that timing is about the age at which you start a business. It is not. Entrepreneurs start businesses at all ages. Over the years, we have seen many young people and their parents on Shark Tank trying to find an investor for their businesses. One might argue that the business is really the parent's idea, but not always.At the other end of the scale, there are encore entrepreneurs. These are successful business owners who sold their businesses and could not sit still or who left corporate America and struck out on their own late in life. Of course, many of those who are starting businesses are millennials and Gen Zers. The right time is at any age.What's more important is whether or not the product or service is ready for the market and in demand. Media production as an industry has been consistently in demand since I started but was even more popular during and after the pandemic as people needed to communicate but did not want to travel or meet in person. Many side hustles have soared in popularity, and there is still room for new entities. But others have crowded fields. It's important to look at the competition and see how your offer measures up. Is it different, a better value, or more convenient?One last thing to consider: Sometimes, you are so far ahead of the market that you need to do more than just sell; you need to educate and create demand. Think about it. Things like computers, meatless burgers and even kitty litter changed or created an entirely new industry. Timing here is tricky. Get in too early, and it takes huge resources to get noticed. Too late, and you can't catch up.

  He Took His Side Hustle Full-Time After Being Laid Off From Meta in 2023 — Now He Earns About $200,000 a Year: 'Sweet, Sweet Irony'
  
    When Scott Goodfriend moved from Los Angeles to New York City, he became ""obsessed"" with the city's culinary offerings — and saw a business opportunity.

      Key Takeaways    



        Goodfriend turned his passion for food tours into a business with some encouragement from his friends. 
      


        The business made about $30,000 a year before Goodfriend was laid off from Meta and went full-time with the venture.
      


        Goodfriend appreciates being able to ""pursue something I love and earn a salary from it.""
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Scott Goodfriend, who was working as an executive producer in New York City when he launched Ultimate Food Tours. Goodfriend coordinates food tours all over New York City, ""allowing the participants to experience the city's culinary scene in a whole new light.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Ultimate Food Tours. Scott Goodfriend. When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it? I moved to New York from Los Angeles in 2011. I always loved traveling and getting lost walking through different cities. When I moved to New York, I was fascinated by the ability to visit anywhere in the world by subway, even neighborhoods that were far away. I researched different restaurants and then started thinking, well, maybe I can eat at a few different places, so I started planning walking routes to different eateries on Google Maps. My friends found out I was doing this and wanted to join.



Eventually, the word spread. My friends and family from out of town started calling me when they came to visit New York. They would tell me about a neighborhood they wanted to explore and ask if I could plan a food tour. I enjoyed the challenge and was happy to do this, and I probably ended up planning 50-100 tours over seven or so years.Related: TV Shows All Entrepreneurs Should Be Watching


During this entire time, I was a broke freelance TV producer living in the East Village who lived off a fair amount of $1 pizza. I lived close to Chinatown and figured I could probably take a short walk and find something better. I not only found delicious food but also discovered the variety, depth and complexity of Chinese food, which I became obsessed with. I started doing tons of research into the regions, cuisines and history and the Chinese experience on the Lower East Side. I started taking people to Chinatown, and they fell in love with the tour. They told me to do this as a business, and I always poo-pooed the idea, saying I didn't want to build a website or do the marketing (sweet, sweet irony — but more on that later). My friend encouraged me to put my tour on something called Airbnb Experiences. I posted the Chinatown tour on Airbnb in 2019; it got to the top of Airbnb in a short timeframe. Then, Covid-19 hit, which shut my operations down for over a year.In 2021, I reworked the tour and put it back on Airbnb, and it got to the top of the ""Activities to do in NYC"" list. People started asking me what other tours I had, so I wrote more. Eventually, I had to hire people to help run the tours and help with the marketing. It got overwhelming because I was also working my dream job as an augmented reality producer at Meta, but then….I was part of the Meta layoffs in 2023! I had a decision to make: Go work for another company I really loved and respected, or pursue my entrepreneurial dreams. I decided to pursue Ultimate Food Tours full-time. It's been great, and I've learned so much doing it. I am really glad I made the jump.Related: This Dad Started a Side Hustle to Save for His Daughter's College Fund — Then It Earned $1 Million and Caught Apple's Attention


What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?The biggest challenge while building my business was deciding where to focus and invest my time. You need to be strategic about what parts of the business you invest in and focus on. Since entrepreneurship doesn't have a playbook, the answer is often to go for it, analyze the results, learn from it and do better next time.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?Ultimate Food Tours evolved tremendously over the last few years, and I'm lucky enough for it to be my full-time job now. Before switching to this as a full-time role, I was making around $30,000 a year. I probably saw consistent revenue between the second and third years. At this time, I was only pursuing Ultimate Food Tours on the weekends, so I was making around several thousand dollars a month.What does total annual revenue look like now?Currently, I generate around $200,000 a year and have seen the brand grow by about three times year-over-year.Related: This Insurance Agent Started a Side Hustle Inspired By Nostalgia for His Home State — Now It Earns Nearly $40,000 a Month


What do you enjoy most about this side hustle? I love being able to leverage my passions and turn them into business strategies. A great example of this is our content marketing. I come from a family of foodies, and I have always loved history and making videos, so I created a social series called Origin Stories, which tells the history behind New York's famous foods and the best places to eat them. We have three seasons and plan to begin long-form content soon. I am so proud of this because we get to use our platform to drive traffic to local restaurants while simultaneously building our own brand. It's conceptualizing and executing these win-win strategies that really got me excited about running a business.Being an entrepreneur is a lifestyle! When I first started, I was putting in around 20 hours a week. Since making my side gig my full-time job, I probably work between 50-60 hours a week. Combining my passion with my livelihood allows me the flexibility to pursue something I love and earn a salary from it. I also utilize outside technology that helps streamline my finances and save me time to focus on my business and personal life.What's your advice for others hoping to start successful side hustles of their own?Stay organized! It's easy to get overwhelmed with various spreadsheets and different numbers flying around. Using an accounting sofware helps free up time on my schedule, allowing me to turn my attention to other areas of the business like marketing and developing additional tours.Whatever idea you have, whatever your big dream is, take that first step now! Buy that domain name, make that social media post, whatever it is. Just do one small thing a day, and the rest will fall into place. Make it part of your routine, and you'll see a return.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.


If you're working a full-time job, try to bite off what you can chew and plan your side hustle schedule around your current commitments. You'll be able to see if it has room to grow, and if you do think you want to make it your full-time thing, start putting things in place that prepare you to make the jump when you feel ready.Network and talk to other entrepreneurs! The most valuable thing I found was talking to other people who started businesses and food tour companies of their own. They knew what needed to be done and were able to fill in a lot of the gaps in managing my time and gave me the insights needed to successfully launch my own business.

3,They Designed One Simple Product With a 'Focus on Human Health' — and Made $40 Million Last Year,"Apr 18, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/simple-health-focused-product-led-to-40m-in-revenue-in-2023/472859,"
Branch Basics founders Marilee Nelson, Allison Evans and Kelly Love ""never set out to sell soap,"" let alone launch a cleaning brand that would generate tens of millions in annual sales.But the company's ""mission to create healthy homes"" while keeping cleaning routines simple continues to resonate with customers — 50% of whom are returning, according to the brand. Among other select accessories, Branch Basics offers a comprehensive ""starter kit,"" which features a fragrance-free, ""plant- and mineral-based"" cleaning concentrate along with various glass bottles that can be filled with different combinations of the solution and water to meet specific needs: from wiping down a bathroom counter to doing a load of laundry.Image Credit: Courtesy of Branch Basics. Marilee Nelson, left; Allison Evans, center; Kelly Love, right.



The story of how the company came to be begins with Nelson, who, after battling chronic illness, was told that she'd never have kids and needed to go on dialysis. Nelson wasn't sold on the prognosis and turned to another doctor who used ""food as medicine"" — a leap of faith that ""literally changed her life,"" eradicating those health issues and even inspiring her to become a medicinal cook. Later, after her 10-year-old son was exposed to pesticides and suffered brain and immune system damage, she took another hard look at environmental factors that might contribute to healing.""His immune system had been so damaged that he could not detoxify the things we're all exposed to every day,"" Nelson says, ""and he would have extreme reactions. I took one box and thought, Oh, I'll keep my favorite perfumes in here, favorite skincare products and things, in the closet, and when he gets better, I will bring them back out."" However, according to Nelson, the box's removal made such a significant difference that it showed her ""how important it is to [recognize] how powerful these chemicals are."" Nelson's son started to heal, and when word of mouth spread, she developed a course to help other people better understand the products in their homes.


Related: How This Pediatrician-Turned-Entrepreneur Transformed a Health Policy into a Consumer Product for Kids""Of course, the type of fuel we put in our bodies matters for how we feel.""Nelson's niece, Allison, had a similar experience. Diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, Evans was told by doctors that ""no lifestyle change"" could help her heal and to take birth control indefinitely; in college, she faced a range of symptoms — muscle aches, loss of motor skills and more — and says she was prescribed numerous medications to no avail. At the time, Evans and her aunt Marilee weren't particularly close, but she consulted with her and realized that some simple lifestyle changes just might help her feel better.According to Evans, removing certain products with synthetic ingredients and eating whole foods did help her condition improve, and as graduation neared, she decided to spend eight weeks with Nelson in the Texas Hill Country, where she'd learn more about healthy living from her aunt. Her friend Kelly joined her, and despite being in good health, also noticed a transformation — ""My dry itchy eyes, headaches, muscle aches are all gone,"" Love recalls, adding, ""the more I learned about all this, it just made sense to me: Of course, the type of fuel we put in our bodies matters for how we feel, how we think, how we act.""

The organization also notes that even naturally occurring fragrances, such as citrus, ""can react to produce dangerous pollutants indoors.""


""Nontoxic"" labels on products aren't the be-all and end-all either, Nelson notes. After all, ""it's the dose that makes the poison,"" as the Swiss physician and chemist Paracelsus said nearly 500 years ago. According to Nelson, looking at the ingredients themselves is key. The founders want people to feel empowered to examine any product — from Branch Basics or another company — and understand the ingredients being used. To that end, they offer a $99 ""Toss the Toxins"" course to ""walk you through a step-by-step process to remove products that pollute your home and body.""Related: Go Green Or Go Home: 3 Ways Industrial Facilities Can Clean Up Their Acts""Our 32-ounce liquid concentrate cleans your windows, cleans your baby's bottom, cleans your produce.""Branch Basics' ""minimalist"" product line is meant to make the whole process easier — and save time.

It's so safe it can be used on the skin.""


""Our 32-ounce liquid concentrate cleans your windows, cleans your baby's bottom, cleans your produce, takes off your eye makeup, cleans your countertops [or] your hardwood floors — whatever depending on the the ratio,"" Evans adds.The approach is resonating with customers, the company reports. Gross sales grew around 42% year over year from 2022 to 2023, with revenue hitting $40 million last year. The company currently has more than 50,000 product subscribers, 600,000 email subscribers and 10,000 five-star reviews on its concentrate and Oxygen Boost, which amplifies the power of the concentrate ""for tough cleaning jobs.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Branch Basics""We know that human health is our priority... [that] keeps everything aligned.""The company's laser-focused commitment to its customers — it reportedly responds to every single customer question on Instagram and TikTok — no doubt fosters a lot of that brand loyalty. What's more, Branch Basics boasts a 6% referral rate compared to the industry's 2% average.""We approach everything [by asking] What do we want?"" Love says. ""What's missing in the market? What do we, as people who are moms, as people who are health-conscious, need and want? Because, most likely, other people would need and want those things, too. We know that human health is our priority, so when we formulate products or make our marketing plans, [that] keeps everything aligned.""This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

How were you introduced to EdTech, and what inspired you to start your side hustle in that space?When I had the opportunity to tutor STEM classes in college, I quickly realized teaching was my passion. I excelled on the newly formatted MCAT and decided I wanted to help students achieve higher scores (one of my students even reached the 99th percentile!). A college friend suggested I create a pre-med club focused on innovative learning experiences, which sparked my interest in curriculum development and the use of learning management systems supported by professionals in medical and scientific fields. The idea to build a website and offer tutoring services emerged after I hosted a successful MCAT seminar, and my commitment to tutoring in college laid the foundation for my future endeavors.



My tutoring venture expanded into a holistic coaching experience, which focused on the psychology of studying, anxiety management and wellness, including the utilization of 24-hour planners, exercise and nutrition. This comprehensive approach led me to pursue a psychiatry residency. Despite not initially seeing myself as a business person, the need for innovation in MCAT preparation drove me to entrepreneurship.Related: Best New Shows for Entrepreneurs (Streaming Free)


After collaborating with peers in clinical trials, we launched online clinical research courses, aiming for excellence and continuous improvement. This endeavor was more than a business; it was about making a meaningful impact and addressing broader needs. CCRPS INC was founded to address the underemployment of foreign medical graduates and healthcare professionals in the U.S. despite their impressive credentials. Together with colleagues in clinical trials, we aimed to provide educational courses to help these individuals secure entry-level positions that offer both competitive salaries and a sense of purpose. We established a strong online presence, developed expert-led courses and focused on education and career preparation. Our commitment to quality content quickly earned us recognition and trust, positioning CCRPS as a leader in the field.What were some of the first steps you took to get CCRPS off the ground?First, we identified our niche by recognizing a gap for non-clinical medical professionals seeking valuable career paths. We built a user-friendly website and formed partnerships with providers, building trust by seeking out video and audio reviews from graduate students to help other students have a better idea of our comprehensive and in-depth educational approach. We collaborated with experts to create high-quality course materials and secured the necessary accreditations to establish credibility. We also offered comprehensive career support and focused on quality education, which spurred organic growth through referrals and a robust online presence.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building the side hustle, and how did you navigate them?Building and growing a startup requires constant ""figuring out"" of challenges. The biggest challenge was meeting and surpassing our clients' needs so they could continue to grow. Additionally, delegating to the right people requires trial and error; you can't expect to get it right from day one! The key to overcoming these challenges is learning to be okay with the ups and downs, being the rock when changes don't go as planned and consistently providing excellent services.Related: This Insurance Agent Started a Side Hustle Inspired By Nostalgia for His Home State — Now It Earns Nearly $40,000 a Month


How long did it take you to see consistent revenue from your work within EdTech?From the outset, our business achieved net profitability, a testament to our compelling curriculum. Starting with one in-person student whose enrollment funded our initial website and SEO efforts, we adopted a strategy that allowed us to reinvest early profits into expanding our operations. This approach was essential in both our foundational stages and as we scaled, particularly with the MCAT company.Despite promising early enrollments, our focus has always been on student success and quality education rather than merely generating revenue. This commitment enabled us to reduce prices over time, making education more accessible and aligning with our belief in the importance of affordable education. Engaging students meaningfully requires commitment, evidenced by our successful partnerships with contract research organizations and our lean yet effective operational model.How do you balance your entrepreneurial pursuits with a demanding career in medicine?Following a year-long hiatus to launch CCRPS, I transitioned back into my residency. Today, brilliant clinical research professionals and a solid team manage the day-to-day operations and business aspects, ensuring student success remains a priority at CCRPS while I fully immerse myself and focus on my residency.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.


What do you enjoy most about running your own business?I appreciate the profound influence I can have on students' success and career advancement. Witnessing their growth, seeing their achievements and knowing that we play a pivotal role in shaping their futures is incredibly rewarding and reaffirms my passion for education entrepreneurship every day. With over 22,000 student members from more than 1,200 organizations, including six government agencies and 308 universities, the reach and influence of CCRPS are evident. A 2024 LinkedIn review of graduates highlighted remarkable outcomes, with placements in over 1,600 companies and 23% achieving managerial roles or higher. Furthermore, the initiative has significantly contributed to developing the clinical research workforce for various contract research organizations. This progress, driven by a team of exceptional clinical research educators, underscores the collective effort and dedication to advancing clinical trials and healthcare.What's your advice for others hoping to start successful businesses?Learning how to harness and delegate our strengths effectively is crucial. Sometimes, guidance from those who've walked the path before us can be a game-changer; seeking expert mentorship in areas we find challenging can make all the difference.Start small and focus on what matters: In a world brimming with startups, it's vital to remember that at the heart of every idea and venture are the people we aim to help. They are our priority, always. Let's embrace our unique talents, lean into learning and always put people first.This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

8,7 Link-Building Tactics You Need to Know to Skyrocket Your Website's Rankings,"Apr 12, 2024",Jeff Peroutka,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/7-techniques-for-successful-website-link-building/470502,"
Climbing the Search Engine Results Page ranking requires sophisticated SEO practices, including link building — the process of acquiring inbound links or attracting other websites to link to your content. If done right, it is a powerful growth strategy that can propel web pages' visibility and authority.When sites link to your content, they direct traffic your way, which is, of course, essential for discoverability and exposure, especially if a site is newly made. Perhaps even more importantly, backlinks' quality and quantity are among Google's most important ranking factors, as well as determinants of a site's domain authority. Put simply, a site will never perform well SEO-wise unless its' managers strive for successful link-building.Here are some effective techniques that will juice that vital task.



1. Pitch to relevant and authoritative websitesOutreach, or requesting website owners (in your niche or industry) to link to your website, is one of the foremost link-building tactics. To be effective, it's important to craft a compelling and convincing pitch, one that includes how useful, in-depth and unique your content is—both relevant and informative, and not something that can be easily produced by a novice blog writer.As much as possible, make your outreach personalized yet professional, and avoid using templates. This helps to effectively convey a desire to improve not only your link profile but also the value you're providing to site visitors.


Email is usually the go-to outreach channel for link building, but you can also consider social media platforms, especially if the recipient is active on these channels.Related: 2 Things You Need to Convince Google You're an Expert In Your Niche And Drive Traffic2. Broken link buildingMany websites have external ""broken"" or ""dead"" links that direct users to inaccessible or non-existent pages. Such links can harm a site's UX and SEO performance, and website owners are typically on the lookout for ways of addressing them.Via broken link building, you can reach out to websites in the hope that they will consider your content as a ""replacement"" for their dead links. This is similar to the above outreach technique (except that your request centers on providing an alternative external link), so the same tips apply — including highlighting new content's originality, accuracy and helpfulness.


3. Produce 'link-worthy' contentAn organic way to boost your inbound links is to create quality content. When other websites deem yours helpful, factual and original, they are more likely to link to associated pages, even without you reaching out to them. So, what makes content link-worthy? Value. If writers, bloggers and journalists see worthwhile information or opinions in content, they'll likely include its' links in their work.Examples of such content:• Step-by-step guides: In-depth instructional primers (with illustrations or videos) that solve problems with specific and valuable takeaways.• Professional interviews: Acquired opinions from industry leaders can provide credible material worth referencing.• Data analysis: Extracting insights from data using statistical tools—potentially valuable for other content creators.• Polls: In-the-moment analysis: a finger on the public pulse regarding an issue.• Case studies: Accounts of real experiences—whether from individuals or organizations—which can provide a nuanced analysis of various problems/situations.• Research studies: This can be an original experimental or descriptive research that aims to generate new findings about a subject.• Visual content: Including graphs, charts, infographics and images.• Online resources and tools: Digital tools that people can use to more easily perform tasks. For example, a website's tax calculator can be used as an inbound link by content that discusses tax preparations.Related: The Step-by-Step Guide to Creating and Publishing Quality Content4. Benchmarking competitors' linksTo see how you can improve your link profile, compare it to others in your sector. Check out their pages, see which ones generate the most backlinks, then make a guess as to why. (For example, a competitor might perform well because of well-structured how-to guides or data-driven insight posts.)


Moreover, ""glimpsing"" at competitors' link profiles will likely present potential link sources relevant to your content. You might discover websites, blogs or directories interested in linking to content like yours, and you can then approach them.5. Guest bloggingThis process involves sharing content for other websites in the hope of getting links back to your site and offers a number of benefits. First, guest blogging reliably results in both audience and traffic growth. Second, it's a cost-effective link-building solution. As you write guest blogs, include links within the copy that point to your own content — easy and without any monetary cost.Be strategic, however, when choosing sites to approach; they must be credible and have high domain authority to ensure that your site will actually benefit.Related: 4 Ways Guest Blogging Grows Your Blog Audience Quickly


6. Look for unlinked mentionsOther websites might mention your website or digital business without linking to it. While this potentially improves your exposure, it's additionally beneficial to request actual backlinks from site owners.7. Apply the ""skyscraper technique""This term and strategy refer to outperforming widely linked competitor content by producing a more comprehensive and valuable alternative. Once you have published your improved version, approach websites that link to your competitor's content and request that they link to your enhanced version instead.Managed effectively, the result will be not just new inbound links but also nabbing traffic from competitors as you climb the search results. To make this technique work, however, it's important to thoroughly assess how to noticeably surpass the quality of a competitor's content—perhaps by having a more authoritative author, updating facts and data, adding new viewpoints or insights, incorporating visual elements and/or making the entirety simply easier to read.Related: 5 Ways to Steal Your Competitor's Web Traffic


Successful link-building involves smart outreach to relevant websites, production of link-magnet content, assessing competitors' link profiles and other tactics. All will fuel the objective of improving website user experience and offering real value to readers. Once achieved, you'll have a robust link profile that propels SEO success.

9,Bantam Bagels' Founder Fell Into a Mindset Trap 'People Don't Talk About' After Selling the Now-Defunct Business for $34 Million — Here's What Happened,"Apr 12, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-happened-to-bantam-bagels-founder-reveals-her-struggle/472502,"
In 2013, Elyse Oleksak, co-founder of Bantam Bagels, got a call from her husband Nick about a bite-sized snack that would set some big plans in motion. ""Mini bagels stuffed with cream cheese,"" Oleksak recalls him saying in her recently released memoir A Shark Ate My Bagel: How We Built Bantam Bagels. ""Sort of like doughnut holes, but bagels."" Oleksak had heard plenty of ambitious ideas from her entrepreneurially-minded husband in the past, but tiny stuffed bagels were one she could get behind. The duo met at a grocery store after work to start experimenting.Image Credit: Courtesy of Elyse OleksakIt was the beginning of Bantam Bagels' near-decade-long journey, one that cycled through ""success followed by failure"" and ""elation followed by panic,"" Oleksak tells Entrepreneur exclusively.



The business made a splash on Shark Tank, where the Oleksaks struck a $275,000 deal for 11% equity with Lori Greiner (hence the title of Oleksak's book) in 2014. In the next several years, it saw sales hit $45 million as it expanded the product line to include mini stuffed pancakes and egg bites, landed in 10,000 stores and 8,500 Starbucks and was ultimately acquired by the Ohio-based T. Marzetti Company for $34 million in 2018 before ceasing operations in 2022.Related: All 7 'Shark Tank' Stars Share Tips on How to Become a Millionaire


""We were going to die in the wake of our own success if we didn't do something about it soon.""Like many entrepreneurs who find themselves at the helm of a fast-growing business, the Oleksaks had an ""aha moment"" when they realized their cash-versus-growth dilemma. ""We got to a point where even though this was our baby and it was something that we had owned at near 100% for so long, we were going to die in the wake of our own success if we didn't do something about it soon,"" Oleksak says. So the Oleksaks sold to T. Marzetti. It felt like a perfect match, Oleksak recalls, and the couple stayed on in marketing and product development capacities.However, getting used to her new relationship with the company wasn't easy, Oleksak admits. It's a struggle that didn't make it into the book, she says, but an important one nevertheless. According to Oleksak, with all of the focus on success stories and flashy sales, there's an all-too-common experience that gets lost in the narrative because ""people don't talk about"" it: How do you cope when all of your hard work pays off and your dream finally comes true?""Every single ounce and fiber of our being was dedicated to the survival and growth of this company [for years],"" Oleksak explains, ""so when you operate in this fight or flight mode for so long, it just becomes who you are."" Simultaneously chasing success and steeling for calamity takes a serious mental toll, Oleksak says, and when there were no more fires to put out, her brain began ""inventing disasters"" that didn't exist and therefore had no concrete solutions — a never-ending ""spiral.""


Related: 4 Ways Highly Successful People Handle Tough Times and Get Back on Track""When we were left feeling safe and at peace, I almost didn't know what to do with that safety and peace.""""We found loving arms for our explosive child,"" Oleksak says. ""We did it. But every single sense of self and success [had been] wrapped in this swirl of panic at all times, so when we were left feeling safe and at peace, I almost didn't know what to do with that safety and peace. Your brain almost doesn't know what to do when it stops. I personally went through an extreme breakdown."" Oleksak likens the experience to those of professional athletes who have to redefine themselves after a career in sports.Seeing your biggest dream become a reality can be amazing, but you have to prepare your brain for a complete mindset shift and pick up the appropriate tools to navigate that, according to Oleksak. The entrepreneur is a huge proponent of therapy and credits it with helping her recalibrate what it takes to get from one day to the next without considering chaos a foregone conclusion. ""I worked through a lot to find mental peace and stability and be able to be present again in the moment,"" she says.


Unfortunately, just a couple of years after T. Marzetti acquired Bantam Bagels, the pandemic put pressure on the supply chain, making it a challenge to stock the same variety of products as retailers streamlined processes wherever possible. By that point, Oleksak says she and her husband had given up a lot of decision-making authority and weren't involved in the conversations that ultimately led T. Marzetti to stop production of the brand. Still, Oleksak — and the nearly 1,500 people who signed a petition in support of Bantam Bagels' return — would love to see the products make a comeback one day.Related: 5 Ways to Protect Your Mental HealthAs Oleksak reflected on her entrepreneurial journey ""full of ups and downs,"" she kept coming back to all of the connections she'd made along the way — from every customer who purchased a Bantam Bagel to the manufacturers who took a chance on the product, celebrity endorsers including Oprah, Sarah Jessica Parker and Whoopi Goldberg, and so many more — and wanted to give back with a behind-the-scenes look at lessons learned over the years. So Oleksak put pen to paper and drafted A Shark Ate My Bagel, then opted to self-publish it ""the entrepreneurial way,"" with a marketing plan that included her own website and an Amazon push.""Thank God I organized all those lessons because, man, did I make a lot of mistakes,"" Oleksak laughs. These days, she's approaching the publication of her book as she would the launch of a ""mini business"" and says she's putting most of her energy into that right now. But she also looks forward to working with small businesses in the future, helping them avoid the mistakes she made and secure wins of their own.

      Key Takeaways    



        Kerr saw the demand for enamel pins in the artist community and thought the sales could help fund his daughter's 529.
      


        Within a few days of launching his site, he had an order for 1,000 pins from someone he ""had no link to at all.""
      


        Now, Alchemy Merch offers additional products, sees nearly $2 million in annual sales and boasts partnerships with major brands.
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Alchemy Merch owner Greg Kerr, who was working as a musician when he started selling custom pins in 2015. Today, Alchemy Merch is a full-time business that creates custom products for companies including Apple, Nickelodeon, National Geographic, Nike and more, as well as independent artists looking for ways to monetize their artwork in new ways.Image Credit: Courtesy of Alchemy Merch. Greg Kerr.When did you start your side hustle, and what inspired it? I'd been running a literary-inspired apparel brand, Miles to go, and had begun making enamel pins as one of the products we offered back in 2015. Some friends began asking me for help to get them made because of how confusing overseas production can be. Around that time, my wife and I decided we'd try to have a baby, and on the day we found out we were pregnant (Father's Day in 2016), I bought a domain for Pin Game Strong. I saw there was a demand for help within the artist community, and I initially thought if we could put a few hundred dollars into our daughter's 529, it would be a win. The original intention was that we'd keep running the apparel brand and help people make enamel pins on the side. I quickly recognized that there was a huge gap in the market to offer retail-quality merchandise. Everything was focused on promotional products, and with my background in running a brand, I thought it was important to focus on products people would be proud to bring to market. There was a need to go beyond promotional and into fully custom.



Related: This Insurance Agent Started a Side Hustle Inspired By Nostalgia for His Home State — Now It Earns Nearly $40,000 a MonthWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I'd seen a post on an episode of the Adventures in Design podcast talking about how someone should help people make pins. At that point, I had made thousands of pins for myself but hadn't thought about offering it as a service. I offered to help anyone interested and got a quick response. Word of mouth spread, and I saw that people wanted a safe outlet for making pins. Knowing we had a child on the way was the catalyst to buy a domain and throw together some pricing. I was familiar with how promotional products companies price their products and decided I'd try to beat them. Once the site was up, things started happening quickly, and within a few days, I had an order for 1,000 enamel pins from someone I had no link to at all.Image Credit: Alchemy MerchWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?As things started moving quickly, I had a lot of struggles with my time and how to balance it with the brand that had been paying my family's bills for the past few years. We went from $0 to $1 million in sales in 18 months, and it was just me. I did all of it: managing the business, handling all orders, communicating with factories and all art. It was a lot to handle. We didn't spend a cent on advertising in the first two years. Word of mouth was spreading and keeping me as busy as I could handle. My first step was to get some help on handling art files so I could keep working on customer interactions. I wish I'd looked for help sooner, but when I finally did get the help, it freed me up to focus on sales more.


Related: How to Get the Most Money Out of Your Side Hustle During Tax Season, From an Expert Who Raised $75.2 Million to Make Filing EasierHow long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn? Within six months, we'd surpassed the monthly revenue of the brand I'd been working on for eight years prior — and it kept growing. Once we saw how quickly it was moving, the secondary goal became to replace my wife's income by the time she'd have to decide whether to go back to work or not after our daughter was born. We hit that goal and kept on running upward.You've since turned the side hustle into a full-time business, Alchemy Merch. What's been key to that growth, and what does revenue look like now? We hit a point where I needed to let go of the previous business so I could focus all of my time on making products for others. We started as Pin Game Strong and kept on adding new products in: patches, acrylic keychains, washi tape, etc., and the name just felt too limiting. We'd built up solid name recognition but knew it was time to grow beyond pins. Growth has been challenging for the past few years. When Covid hit, we got knocked back twice. First, we had delays in factories returning to work that caused a lot of refunds for events lined up. Then in March, they returned, and the U.S. got hit with lockdowns. A lot of our business is driven by events. Artists sell at fairs, cons and other events, and corporations will [make items] for conferences or team events. Pre-Covid, we were up only, and since then, we've been working hard to really focus on tightening up what we do and how we do it to help stand out. Although we have had growth the past two years, it's not until this year that we are seeing the energy back in people to create again. We have been floating right under $2 million a year in sales for the past two years and are hoping to finally break past it and continue to grow.Related: Don't let your good idea go to waste.

Making not only products, but also full-on retail-ready merchandise can have a lot of obstacles for creators, and our goal is to remove those and help guide them. Working with other creative people all day is constantly inspiring. Our goal as a team is to collaborate and elevate a customer's project.


As you consider the business's future, what are you most excited about? I'm excited about expanding the types of products we offer and continuing to help creators. There is not a lot of direct competition in our field and at our size, so the chance of someone looking to acquire us is low. I hope to keep building a company that continues to provide for my family and our employees and keeps helping people.Related: She Used Her Kids' College Fund to Build a Side Hustle, But the Product Was 'Unsellable' — Here's How She Got Back on Track for $100 Million in SalesImage Credit: Alchemy MerchWhat's your advice for others hoping to start successful side hustles of their own?Although I didn't actively think about it at the time, Alchemy Merch is a marriage of all of my skill sets and hits on what I really want to be spending my time doing. It's tough running a business in the after-hours if you have a 9-5, but if you really want it, you need to put in the work. If you are thinking about starting a side hustle, really think about what you want to do and if there is a need for it or space in the market for you to improve upon what is out there. The market told me how badly Alchemy Merch was needed, and I responded. When it became clear that this had legs, I never looked back. I've been self-employed for the past 20 years, so it gave me some clarity to run with the momentum and recognize what we were doing had real value.

11,Want to Be the Next Apple? Here's the Secret Sauce Used By Steve Jobs to Build Consumer Trust.,"Apr 9, 2024",Jessica Wong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-do-marketing-and-branding-like-steve-jobs/470410,"
Take a look at any ranking of the world's leading brands, and one name appears toward the top of that list every single time: Steve Jobs' Apple. Like countless startups today, Steve Jobs began his journey in a garage with little more than a vision.So, how did he build one of the world's most recognizable and trusted brands? Steve Jobs relied on one simple philosophy to set his company apart from its competitor: He viewed Apple's branding as a bank account or a vault.Read on to discover how you and your team can replicate his strategy to grow your business.Depositing Credibility into Your Bank AccountA brand represents the intangible assets that entrepreneurs possess, while branding is the process of enhancing the brand by instilling credibility and trust. A good brand is one that consumers trust to create a high-quality product or deliver great service. Where that level of trust exists, there is room for errors. Great brands are not infallible, but they handle problems well, for example, by admitting to mistakes and taking care of their customers through difficult situations.



Make Deposits, Avoid WithdrawalsSteve Jobs' idea is simple: Every time a company does something good, it deposits something into its bank account or adds something to its vault. Launching a successful product is just as much a deposit as finding a mutually beneficial resolution when there has been a problem. Whenever your customers walk away feeling that they have been treated respectfully, trust in the brand increases.At my marketing company, we don't sell products, but we still find efficient ways to make deposits on a regular basis. Deposits can take a variety of forms: customer service, partnerships, feedback loop, etc. During this time, every single blog post prospect customers read and find useful, every leadership piece they enjoy and share is another small deposit into our ""brand bank account.""On the other hand, whenever someone has a negative experience with your business, a withdrawal is made from your vault. Launching an unsuccessful product would be a large withdrawal. But even an unfriendly interaction on a customer service hotline can cause your brand to lose a consumer's trust.How Do You Have a Healthy Brand Bank Balance?Just like your team works hard to maintain a positive balance in your company's actual bank accounts, every team member should understand the importance of maintaining a healthy brand bank balance. In theory, it is as simple as ensuring that deposits outnumber withdrawals. In practice, that is not always so easy, and no brand is immune to making mistakes or being unlucky.


Here's a good example of when Apple avoided a heavy withdrawal. When the company launched its then-revolutionary face recognition technology for iPhone X in 2017, the technology simply did not work. This temporary glitch put a dent in Apple's stock market value for some time. However, due to the company's well-established brand reputation and history of innovation, loyal customers and supporters remained steadfast. Apple swiftly addressed the technical issues, demonstrating its commitment to quality and customer satisfaction. As a result, trust in the brand was restored, and within a short period, Apple rebounded, showcasing the resilience of a robust brand bank account.Maintaining a healthy brand bank balance requires constant deposits, small and large. Withdrawals, even if they seem incredibly small, need to be taken seriously. A small issue can quickly snowball and create significant damage to a brand.Companies that Use Steve Jobs' Banking AnologyThe concept of brand bank balances is not just for large or well-established businesses. Every interaction, online or off, can lead to deposits or withdrawals.As a startup founder or a small business owner, you can look at businesses around you for examples and inspiration or consider these household name brands:The Ford Motor Company. In 2023, Ford noticed an issue with brake hoses and windshield wipers. Both could have endangered drivers, their passengers, and other road users, and the manufacturer decided to recall up to 1.5 million vehicles. Is that a deposit or a withdrawal? At face value, a recall would be a withdrawal. However, by being open with customers about the reasons for the recall, and streamlining the process to minimize the inconvenience for clients, Ford strengthened consumer relationships throughout the process.Peloton. Exercise equipment manufacturer Peloton did not fare so well when reports of potential safety issues started surfacing, including the death of a child. Rather than dealing with the reports proactively and initiating a recall, the company dragged its heels and eventually faced a $19 million fine.While that is a significant physical withdrawal from the company's bank account, it is arguably an even larger withdrawal from the company's brand bank account. Re-building consumer trust after being seen to be careless with the safety of users and their children will likely cost more time and investment than a timely recall would have done.Start Thinking Like Steve JobsPrioritizing consistent deposits into your brand bank account forms the basis of customer loyalty and significantly contributes to brand longevity. Even small deposits will add up over time like compound interest does in a real bank account. This concept is what makes this analogy so useful for businesses of any size and at any stage of their development. No matter whether your business is a very early-stage startup or you are working as a sole trader, Steve Jobs' 'secret sauce' can help you transform your business.In the next article, we discuss strategies for making better and smarter deposits into your brand bank account.

It is a very simple yet powerful idea to help startup founders and small business owners build trust with customers and other audiences.

Syed Lateef runs his Airbnb business in Chicago.


 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Syed Lateef, a 36-year-old Airbnb Superhost in Chicago. It's been edited for length and clarity.I'm the CEO of SyedBnb, a short-term rental company with over 300 units and 100 employees.After dropping out of college for one year before returning to get my degree, I started working in finance, but I didn't aspire to have the lifestyle of the company's VPs. I wanted wealth, exotic cars, luxury vacations, time, and freedom, so I pivoted to real estate.



I started my business in 2017, and in 2023, we made $11.5 million in revenue and $1.4 million in net profit.Real estate was the key to the life I wantedAfter being let go from my first role as a financial analyst, I landed a job at Allstate. I was promoted three times within five years, but the salary increases weren't meeting my expectations.I realized that the people I knew in my community who were wealthy and had nice homes or cars were involved in real estate, which made me believe that was one of the main drivers of wealth.I started listening to the ""BiggerPockets"" podcast and read ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad,"" which motivated me to pursue financial freedom. I expected it to take me 15 years to replace my salaried income through real estate, but I was determined.


In 2016, I purchased my first multifamily building in Chicago using savings from my finance job and a loan on my 401(k). I put one of the units on Airbnb with a goal to make double the rent in one month that I could expect from a long-term tenant.I hired cleaners and virtual assistants to do the admin work and implemented pricing software from the outset (I use PriceLabs).Within four months, I made three times the expected market rent for a long-term tenant. I realized what an incredible opportunity this was and converted all the units in my building into Airbnbs. I was addicted and wanted more.Three to four months into my side business, even though my family and friends encouraged me to keep my salaried role, I gave my notice to leave. I was now a full-time entrepreneur.


Since its launch, I've scaled the business to over $35 million in revenueOne of Lateef's units in Chicago. Courtesy of Syed LateefI became an Airbnb Superhost in 2018, which means my average reviews are above 4.8 out of 5.In the second year, I expanded into rental arbitrage (renting units from landlords and subleasing them on Airbnb) after realizing it was an easier way to grow my business. After furnishing my units, I lacked the cash to buy more rentals. I now own 13 apartments and arbitrage 320.


My revenue hit $2.8 million in 2019. 2020 was a down year due to COVID-19. By 2022, I had my first eight-figure year, reaching $10.5 million in revenue.I only work a few hours a weekWith the help of my employees and the implementation of author Gino Wickman's guiding principles of the EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System), my workweek hovers around two hours.EOS is a set of concepts and tools for entrepreneurs to have people in the right seats, track scorecards, document processes, identify issues, and get traction on their business. Weekly leadership meetings using the EOS system help me achieve a two-hour workweek, but those two hours are intense meetings.I also handle my landlord relationships and business growth, but that's periodic, as well as the occasional proverbial fire.


The biggest mistake I made was growing too quicklyThe biggest mistake I made was being too optimistic about growth in the winter before the pandemic. I started scaling and ran out of cash, but I didn't expect COVID-19 to hit me with a knock-out punch. My revenue went to zero. Airbnb refunded all my future guests. I didn't have the money to pay the landlord's rent.I negotiated with all my landlords to allow me to stay in business. I purchased assets from bankrupt companies and was able to scale significantly. For example, I bought furniture for $250 per apartment from a bankrupt company.Here's my Airbnb adviceMy best advice to other aspiring Airbnb Superhosts is to learn from other hosts' experiences. Get in the Airbnb Facebook forums and connect with others. Attend networking events. Hire a coach or purchase a course to help you start the business.Then, take action. If you can't afford a property, consider rental arbitrage. So many people get stuck in the learning and planning process. Inevitably, you'll learn while being in the actual business.


When I got started, I asked my sister, who's into interior design, to help me furnish my first Airbnbs. For guests' needs, we modeled hotels to see what items created a good stay. I learned everything myself through experience.Let's put you on the fast track to success. Accelerate your business growth with our all-inclusive subscription.

Everyone knows the exasperation of unnecessary friction.We've all navigated systems that create maddening ordeals rather than give us simple answers, services, or refunds. We've sat through endless meetings with blabbermouths and ill-defined agendas. We've pulled our hair out over rules, procedures, traditions, and technologies that once made sense, but are now antiquated, pointless, and inefficient. These are all soul-crushing forms of organizational friction that make it difficult to do simple things. And as professors at Stanford's School of Engineering and Graduate School of Business, we spent the last seven years researching the causes and cures for these problems.But one of our biggest discoveries surprised us. It turns out that friction isn't always a problem. In fact, sometimes it can be a solution.

16,4 Ways AI Startups Can Avoid Becoming Obsolete,"Apr 5, 2024",Yusuf Efe,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/4-tips-for-ai-startups-to-avoid-obsolescence/471819,"
The rapid progress in AI is intensifying uncertainties for startups and their founders. Each model release from big AI players poses a challenge, potentially rendering thousands of startups obsolete, including those who believed they had a defensible tech stack. Similarly, the release of new open-source models can negate years of effort by startups overnight. This evolving landscape underscores the critical need for careful ideation and business model formulation for AI entrepreneurs.To aid in this endeavor, I offer four key pitfalls to avoid, along with strategic recommendations, drawing from my extensive academic and industrial research.Related: 6 Ways AI Is Revolutionizing Startup Ecosystems



1. Develop an AI-embedded product with organic workflow integrations and strong user experienceImagine you've launched a startup that creates game assets for gaming companies using AI. Users upload images, specifying styles and providing textual descriptions for new designs, which your AI then brings to life, aligning with the users' visions and the initial style cues. However, this AI isn't integrated into the designers' daily workflows or fine-tuned based on their evolving needs, rendering it only an external aid that shines as long as its outputs surpass industry standards. Then the following question arises: what will keep your clients from switching to a competitor offering a superior solution?Therefore, your AI should integrate seamlessly into clients' workflows, adapt over time and provide an engaging experience. Consider Notion as an illustrative example. It may not be a giant player in AI, but its users like the intuitive note-taking experience enhanced by an AI assistant. Even with superior models available, users stick with Notion for its smooth, integrated AI experience, demonstrating the value of user-friendly design over raw power.


Related: 5 AI Hacks You Need to Know About in 20242. Ensure your AI product is finely tailored for niche marketsIf you are not creating the high-tech infrastructure from scratch yourself, then it might be overambitious to create an AI product with a focus that is too broad. There are mainly two reasons for this: Firstly, market leaders in these broad areas are swiftly incorporating state-of-the-art AI into their products, driven by the need to stay competitive and the ease of using foundational model APIs when developing in-house solutions isn't viable.Take, for instance, the initial rollout of APIs by OpenAI. Numerous ambitious entrepreneurs aimed to leverage these AI capabilities to challenge established players across various sectors. However, OpenAI's subsequent partnerships, through ChatGPT Plugins, with industry giants like Expedia, Instacart and Zapier showcased the rapid integration of AI into leading businesses, helping them preserve their positions. Notably, OpenAI's collaboration with Zapier presented a significant challenge to Adept AI, a startup formed by prominent AI researchers, since both companies aim to ease computer workflow automation via natural language commands. This scenario illustrates that opting for a broad focus in AI can be risky even for highly technical teams.Second, despite major AI firms' commitments to foundational technologies, they're branching into application layers to boost revenue, targeting areas where minimal effort yields a broad impact. This shift towards products with expansive objectives suggests a strategic pivot for smaller AI startups: focusing on a highly specialized niche. By crafting an exceptional AI experience in a specific domain, an emerging AI startup can establish a competitive edge, leveraging specialization as a strong strategy in a market dominated by broader initiatives.


Related: How to Find Your Startup's Niche3. Avoid confining your AI product solely as a plugin for existing software — opt for a standalone solution insteadThe emergence of generative AI APIs inspired numerous entrepreneurs to enhance everyday tools like Excel, PowerPoint and various software development platforms using AI. They crafted AI-enhanced plugins to augment user experiences within these applications. For instance, innovative tools enabled users to automate routine Excel tasks, significantly boosting productivity, particularly for finance professionals. Initially, these AI-enhanced solutions saw a surge in demand.However, the landscape shifted when major platforms began integrating their own AI solutions, such as Microsoft Copilot for Finance or Google's AI features in Gmail and Docs. These in-house developments rendered many third-party plugins nearly redundant. This evolution underscores a critical lesson for startups: relying excessively on a single platform can be risky. Ensuring your business's resilience means diversifying your dependency and continuously innovating to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving tech environment.4. Develop solutions that receive natural support from the AI ecosystemA strategic approach to selecting an AI startup idea is to focus on areas likely to receive ecosystem support. Major AI firms are continually advancing models with the capacity to revolutionize various industries and businesses of differing scales. Yet, integrating these models is not without its challenges. Businesses often hesitate to fully deploy these models in customer-facing applications due to uncertainties about outcomes' safety and concerns about data privacy, which could lead to the exposure of sensitive information.


Recognizing these hurdles, large AI corporations are particularly encouraging of startups dedicated to addressing these integration issues. These new ventures are working on solutions like conducting model evaluations, establishing data privacy safeguards and developing innovative security protocols. For example, OpenAI started grant programs to promote AI Safety and Security efforts. This support underscores the opportunities for startups to contribute value by facilitating the safe and effective adoption of AI technologies across various sectors.Related: The White House's AI Executive Order

This Side Hustle Q&A features Dixie Bagley, ""a once single mom of two who started a business empire with negative $1,500 in her bank account."" Today, Bagley is a wedding planner, dessert shop owner and the founder of the Southern Wedding Collective, an online directory for wedding vendors in the South.What was your day job when you started your side hustle?I was a personal trainer at the time.When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?In 2008, my husband and I purchased a very unique European-style barn with the intention of turning it into our home. While remodeling, I hosted a wedding as a favor to an acquaintance. The feedback was incredible, and that ""favor"" started the ball rolling toward transforming the barn into a wedding and event venue.

I had zero interest from potential clients, so I moved on to Facebook. I posted photos of the venue every day and came up with a package, which I posted on Facebook as well. I immediately booked two weddings, and after that, the leads started flowing in from referrals and sharing about successful events.


What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them? One of the bigger challenges was learning to take the public's opinion with a grain of salt regarding what and how I should do things regarding the venue. There were a lot of strong opinions on what I should do with the barn due to its local history. Many people felt they had a valuable opinion of what should be done and how it should be done. One of the other big challenges was learning how to set and respect my boundaries and balance my personal time with work. In the first five years of getting the venue off the ground, I was terrible at work-life balance. I was consumed by the venue and did not give much thought to my own personal time.Related: This Mom Started a Side Hustle After a 'Shocking' Realization in the Toy Aisle. Her Product Was in Macy's Within the Year — Seeing Nearly $350,000 in Sales.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn? Consistent revenue came within the first six months. In the beginning, I offered limited packages at a minimal investment, yet I still managed to book about $100,000 within the first year.You now own several successful businesses. How did you go from side hustle to owner of multiple companies? Once the first business became consistent and respected within the industry and the community, other opportunities started to land in my lap. If they were a good fit with our existing business and a good business opportunity, we gave it a lot of thought and moved forward with those companies — not just for our benefit, but for the benefit of the community and the clients they would be serving.


What do you enjoy most about running your businesses now?The independence and freedom of being my own boss allow me to incorporate personal vacation time into my life without having to ask permission. I can work as much as I want to and enjoy my personal time as well. I get to choose what my work-life balance looks like.Related: I Was a 25-Year-Old Nurse When I Started a Side Hustle to Combat Anxiety.

      Key Takeaways    



        When I think about the most successful entrepreneurs I know, I realized they say ""no"" to many opportunities.
      


        While it feels counterintuitive, the most crucial question to ask is: ""What won't we do?"" 
      


        Gather your team and make a thorough ""Won't Do"" list. Be thoughtful about it and commit to the result. 
      












    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

""We've said no to Fortune 500 companies,"" said Tim Bergler of Percipio Group Consulting during an expert panel session with 50 entrepreneurs in the room. Bergler was sharing the one piece of advice he would give new entrepreneurs in Portland, Oregon's EO Accelerator program. ""Don't be afraid to say no if you can't nail the work for your customer,"" he continued. His answer rang a bell for me.Recognize the power of noAs I thought about the most successful entrepreneurs I know, I realized they say no to most ""opportunities."" When I reflected on my companies, I noted that our greatest successes occurred after we got really clear on what we would not do.The overarching issue is that most people say yes too much. When you start a business, you mostly think about what you will do — which is pretty much anything to grow the company. So, you say yes to everything and focus on getting more sales however you can. And while that might work in the short term while you are smaller, it doesn't work long-term, and may even keep you smaller.



That's because as a growing company, resources are finite and can easily be wasted. Saying no is critical because it empowers you to focus your limited resources — people, time, money — on the core elements that drive success best.Related: Stop Overworking Yourself Because You Say 'Yes' Too Often — Here's How to Harness the Power of a Simple 'No'


Devise your ""Won't Do"" listWhile it feels counterintuitive, the most crucial question to ask is: ""What won't we do?"" Gather your team and make a thorough ""Won't Do"" list. Be thoughtful about it and commit to the result. Watch how this exercise focuses and propels your company.Businesses with a narrow focus on delivering only what they can nail for the customer — a product or service not readily found elsewhere — are the successful ones. Think about all the businesses you love. Are they doing everything for everybody, or just one thing exceptionally well?Take the grocery business. Standard grocery stores sell an astonishing range of food items in a super-competitive segment with low profit margins. Compare that with Costco or Trader Joe's, which are high-profit and focused on what will or won't sell. They only stock value-added items that customers can't find elsewhere. The top fast-food businesses — McDonald's, Starbucks, Dunkin', Chick-fil-A and Taco Bell — all have strong ""Won't Do"" lists.A recent headline referenced ""the most important stock on planet Earth,"" which rose from obscurity to a $2 trillion valuation because of its ""Won't Do"" list. That company, Nvidia, creates technology that enables AI. Nothing else.


Related: Focusing as an Entrepreneur Is All About Choosing Opportunities WiselyThe impact of strategic omissionI failed to create a ""Won't Do"" list for my first company, a commodity business that wasn't particularly successful.The second time around, my self-storage business was way more focused. We shopped our largest competitors — Public Storage, Extra Space Storage and CubeSmart. Then, we thought deeply about what we could provide that they did not, as a way to differentiate ourselves.We made a comprehensive list detailing what we did not like about those companies. That list informed our ""Won't Do"" list, which includes:


Change our prices every dayUpsell or push extra products/servicesSave hidden costs for move-inRoute calls through a call centerAct like our customer is bothering usMandate insuranceBe a national companyPut a customer in a space that isn't right for themThat list is simple but magical. It does four remarkable things:Determines what you will do. Deciding what you don't like and won't do is a hack to identify what you will do, which is basically the opposite. Establishing a ""Won't Do"" list creates a clear, inspiring answer for what you will be to your customer.Becomes the ultimate time-saver. By eliminating what you won't do, you create space to focus on what you will do — and enhance that offering.Simplifies decision-making. Decisions are either on-brand or off-brand; the list makes it quite obvious.Clarifies your brand in a way you otherwise couldn't. When you nail what you will do, your company will be more successful and profitable. You offer something unique that is not a commodity.Your ""Won't Do"" list is an essential business tool. It doesn't only limit business scope — it can also help shape how you operate; your business practices, pricing structure and how you will treat your customers. A plumbing company might opt out of electrical work but also exclude practices such as overcharging, pushing upgrades or setting half-day-long appointment windows. Ultimately, a ""Won't Do"" list streamlines your focus and helps narrow your niche.Related: How to Say 'No' More Often: Why Every Entrepreneur Needs a 'To-Don't' ListFocus your business with boundariesBack to Bergler, who ran a management consulting company with a narrowly defined space where they could add significant value. He was as selective about the quality of people on his team as he was with the type of business they would do. The resulting quality of work put them in high demand. Eventually, incoming work opportunities exceeded capacity. He turned a lot of business away and even referred clients to competitors when he felt his company could not truly nail it.


As a result, clients started to approach Bergler first because they had so many misses with sub-par competitors. It made Bergler the preferred provider for their best clients. When he chose to sell the business, multiple buyers were confident in the company's durable income because of its 20 years of consistent performance and sky-high customer satisfaction.With our self-storage company, we enjoyed a lot of success quickly. Our differentiated brand made us a customer favorite, earning us higher marks than the big-box companies and ultimately making us a great acquisition candidate when we chose to sell.When we started a new company focusing on vehicle storage, one of the first things we did was shop our competitors and brainstorm our ""Won't Do"" list.As I think of the many businesses I know through 20 years in the Entrepreneurs' Organization, I can tell you there is a robust correlation between success and abiding by a strong ""Won't Do"" list. Do yourself a favor: Make your ""Won't Do"" list today.

21,How to Harness AI for a Competitive Edge in Marketing,"Apr 2, 2024",Rodolfo Delgado,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-harness-ai-for-a-competitive-edge-in-marketing/471647,"
Have you ever wondered how your favorite local spots seem to know exactly what you're craving or what book you'd love to read next? This isn't luck — it's the power of artificial intelligence (AI) at work. The digital era has ushered in a revolutionary shift, particularly for small businesses, enabling them to leverage AI for unparalleled personalization and engagement.Consider the local coffee shop that now knows to send a comforting note with a discount on your preferred latte during dreary Monday mornings or the family-owned bookstore that introduces you to your next favorite author, all based on your previous interactions. This level of personalization transcends traditional marketing, turning every customer interaction into an opportunity for connection.Related: Beware the Duplicity of OpenAI — 4 Strategies to Safeguard Your Brand in the Age of AI



Personalization with AIPersonalization is at the core of AI's transformative promise for small business marketing. It's about going beyond the one-size-fits-all approach, delivering experiences that resonate deeply with each customer. For instance, a boutique pet store might implement AI to remember not just purchase histories but significant dates for each pet, sending out personalized reminders and offers that perfectly coincide with these moments. This strategy transforms routine transactions into meaningful exchanges, fostering a sense of community among customers.By tapping into AI's potential, businesses not only survive in a competitive landscape but thrive, crafting experiences that convert customers into loyal advocates for the brand.


Building trust through transparency and the ethical use of AITrust is not just built on promises but on consistent, transparent actions. Small businesses leveraging AI have a unique opportunity to lead with transparency, setting a new standard in customer relations. Imagine a local health food store that uses AI to customize nutritional recommendations for its customers. By openly sharing how they use customer data to improve health outcomes and ensuring robust data protection measures, they deepen trust. This transparency transforms AI from a behind-the-scenes algorithm to a tangible benefit in customers' eyes.Many big brands, such as Amazon Fresh, have already made suggestions based on our previous shopping experiences. Small businesses, however, have the advantage of adopting new technologies quickly. The real opportunity for entrepreneurs comes from iterating technologies that improve their customers' experience — and they learn which are best by A/B testing quickly and efficiently.Related: How AI Can Help Small Businesses Do More in Less TimeLeveraging AI for enhanced customer engagementEngagement in the AI era transcends traditional marketing, turning every interaction into an opportunity for connection. A boutique gardening store, for example, uses AI to suggest plants and gardening tools based on the season and the customer's purchase history. Such personalized interactions do more than drive sales; they cultivate a community of gardening enthusiasts who feel seen and understood. Through AI, businesses can create a virtuous cycle of engagement, where each personalized recommendation strengthens the bond with their customers.


Customer experiences with AIInnovation through AI isn't just about automating processes; it's about redefining the customer experience. Small businesses can use AI to create interactive, immersive experiences that captivate customers. For instance, a small fashion retailer could use virtual try-on AI technology, allowing customers to see how clothes look on them through an app before making a purchase. This innovative use of AI enhances the shopping experience and bridges the gap between online and physical retail, offering personalized engagement that customers cherish.Related: How Small and Mid-Sized Businesses Can Leverage AI to Compete With Large CompaniesFostering a culture of continuous AI adoptionThe key to successful AI integration is fostering a culture open to continuous learning and adaptation. Small businesses thrive by staying nimble, and incorporating AI into their strategy should be an ongoing process, not a one-time effort. Encouraging a team mindset that values innovation and is not afraid to experiment with new AI applications can lead to discovering unique solutions that propel the business forward. Celebrating successes and learning from setbacks will create a resilient, AI-savvy organization.It's crucial to understand the impact AI has on the customer experience and the internal processes that power small businesses. Embracing AI technologies can streamline operations, from inventory management to customer service, freeing up valuable time for entrepreneurs to focus on strategic growth and innovation. This operational efficiency, paired with previously discussed enhanced customer engagement strategies, sets a solid foundation for small businesses to meet and exceed modern consumer expectations. In this era of rapid technological advancement, the integration of AI allows small businesses to remain competitive, agile and forward-thinking, ready to adapt to the ever-changing market landscape and consumer behavior patterns.


As the digital landscape evolves, so will the opportunities for small businesses to leverage AI. This promises an exciting future where technology and human creativity combine to create unparalleled customer experiences. The journey into AI-driven marketing is not without its challenges, but the rewards are boundless for those willing to embark on it.

23,The 3 Trusted Advisors Every Business Needs,"Mar 29, 2024",Frederick Royall III,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/3-advisors-every-business-owner-needs/471580,"
Entrepreneurs feel enormous pressure to meet ambitious goals and deliver for their customers, employees, investors and other stakeholders. The good news is that you don't have to go it alone.It's imperative to have a robust and strategically placed network of trusted partners, experts and advisors to lean on as you navigate challenges and reach new milestones. While there are numerous examples of external experts that business owners can benefit from and learn from, three stand out in my experience.1. A bankerBankers are at the center of the business ecosystem and are well-positioned to provide strategic guidance, facilitate connections and suggest comprehensive solutions to help you achieve your goals.



Over time, a banker could help provide:Expertise in capital structures and solutions: Your banker should be your go-to resource for assessing and optimizing your capital structure. They can provide deep knowledge on the types of solutions available to you — from something as simple as a line of credit to more complex offerings around debt and equity and tapping into the public and private markets. As you get up and running, you must establish a plan for managing cash flow and liquidity. They can help. Critically, a banker can also offer guidance on the best financial solutions to meet your operating needs today and achieve your long-term goals in the years to come.Strategic direction and guidance: Beyond traditional financial matters, a banker can provide insight into your overarching business strategy and help with goal setting. This may include reviewing your long-term plan, talking through your product set to determine if there are any gaps, and helping you consider domestic and global expansion.Expert network connections: Stemming from those strategic decisions, bankers can make introductions to essential partners, investors, and other industry experts to help you identify your next ample opportunity. In practice, this vital network can help guide you as you seek advice on more dynamic financial situations like navigating the supply chain, raising capital, entering new markets, structuring a governing board, implementing DEI practices, and so much more.In short, your banker should help you open doors and see around corners. They can help you tackle tough issues and solve pressing challenges and will be there to support you in the moments that matter.


Related: If You Want Your Clients to Truly Value You, You Need to Be Their Trusted Advisor. Here's How.2. An attorneyLike a banker, an attorney can advise your strategy and growth plans through a different but equally important lens. In my experience, in addition to legal counsel, attorneys bring exceptional industry knowledge and sound judgment and challenge you to think critically about your business.An attorney will focus on defining your business structure and can weigh in on the following:Contracts and agreements: Assistance crafting and negotiating documents such as contracts and non-disclosure agreements.Protecting what's yours: This includes protecting your intellectual property through patents, trademark registration and copyright protection.Implementing risk mitigation strategies: Identifying and navigating relevant laws, industry rules and regulations.Providing strategic counsel: Navigating complex legal landscapes, anticipating specific potential challenges and helping to safeguard your interests while promoting the long-term visibility of your business.When choosing an attorney, consider someone who specializes in your industry and the relevant area of law, has experience with your specific legal needs and has guided businesses through various growth stages. If you get it right, your attorney could bring a unique perspective to your company and pose questions you might not have considered.


Related: How to Find a Good Franchise Lawyer3. An accountantAn accountant is an essential member of your core team. They have a fiduciary responsibility to ensure the reporting, accounting and controls around your financial statement are reliable, timely and accurate. They can also provide significant value by implementing processes to prepare your business for key milestones.Working closely with the banking team, accountants can help:Simplify statements: An accountant will prepare and review statements to ensure accuracy and provide a clear overview of your business's financial health. They might conduct internal audits to ensure efficient financial processes or external audits for larger enterprises seeking outside funding.Maintain financial compliance: An accountant will work with you to ensure that your financial records are up to date, including tracking income, expenses and other financial transactions.Optimize administrative processes: Your internal accounting team will likely be responsible for all forms of process management, including, but not limited to, financial planning and forecasting, employee benefits, real estate and facilities, and physical and operational security. Engaging an external accountant can provide expertise around these tasks and help streamline processes and workflow.Related: 5 Tips for Finding a Great Advisor for Your Startup


A strong team for the long-termThroughout your entrepreneurial career, you will lean on and learn from many different experts. These three are just the beginning. Be methodical and diligent when searching for your trusted advisors, and don't be afraid to tap your network for referrals, seek out individuals at industry conferences, or reach out to other business owners whom you admire.Each person on your team should play an integral role, and the success of your business depends on your ability to fully trust them and their unique expertise. It takes time to build a team of trusted advisors, but if done right, I'm certain that this investment will pay dividends in the long term.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features 29-year-old Jason Nelson, who turned his wedding entertainment side hustle into full-time business The Essential Jason Nelson. Image Credit: Michael Romeo CreationsWhat was your day job when you started your side hustle, and why were you interested in entrepreneurship?When I started playing the saxophone and piano for weddings, private events and nightlife in 2019, I worked as an email marketing coordinator for a retail company in the New Jersey suburbs. I've always been extremely passionate about chasing happiness over money, so becoming an entrepreneur happened by coincidence when I discovered a way to combine my love for entertaining others with my love for mainstream party music.



Related: I Started a Semi-Passive Side Hustle That Earns $33,000 a Week on Amazon: 'Selling There Is a No-BrainerHappiness for me is the ability to wake up every day to do what I love and know that my work makes a difference in the lives of others. After all, being able to entertain over 200 wedding couples during the happiest day of their lives and hearing the phrase, ""You were literally the life of the party. You made our wedding — we couldn't imagine it without you,"" truly humbles me and makes me want to entertain as many people as I can all over the world.


When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it? While I started my side hustle in March 2019, I've played the piano for more than 21 years and the alto saxophone for over 18 years. From an early age, I learned that I have a perfect pitch which has allowed me to play any song by ear.When I attended Rutgers, I became obsessed with mainstream house music. During my free time in college, I enjoyed spending hundreds of hours mixing dance tracks in my DJ software program to make mixes for my friends to play at parties (and even DJ'ed for my friends at parties from time to time, too). Around 2015, I started an Instagram account where I posted short videos of popular songs on the piano and sax (The Chainsmokers, Post Malone, Blink-182, Fetty Wap, etc.) and eventually was hired by a friend's sister to play cocktail hour piano at her wedding. She also had me play along with the DJ for her intro to her reception, and I ended up staying the entire wedding.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I was so attracted to the adrenaline rush from my first wedding that I became obsessed with replicating the feeling. I contacted several entertainment companies in the New Jersey/New York area and quickly started getting booked to play at events. Above any compliments I received about my musical talents on the sax and piano, I kept hearing the word ""energy."" ""Oh my God, you literally have so much energy"" and ""You're literally the life of the party"" were two phrases I heard over and over again, so I realized that my passion for entertaining others far outweighed any passion I've ever had for music.Related: This Gen Zer's Stylish Side Hustle Earns About $20,000 a Month and Paid Off His Parents' $200,000 Debt: 'I Enjoy the Hands-Off Nature'


While playing several events each weekend, I focused on building relationships with different vendors in my industry, including DJs, event planners, photographers, videographers and other entertainers. I also continued gathering content (both photo and video) from my events to grow my Instagram and TikTok accounts, where at least 50% of my event leads now come from. I'm so fortunate to be able to post content from weddings and other events and have the opportunity to reach virtually anyone across the entire world, which has led me to travel for incredible destination events in places like Puerto Rico, St. Maarten, and later this year, Aruba and Dubai.@essentialjasonnelson Wedding guest energy was off the charts at this one ?? #weddings #destinationweddings #rosecliffmansion #rosecliffmansionwedding #theknot #weddingwire #bridetobe ♬ original sound - THE ESSENTIAL JASON NELSONWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?I wanted to leave my 9-5 marketing job at the start of 2020, but once the pandemic hit in March, I lost practically all of my event bookings lined up for the rest of the year. However, I was so fortunate to still have a paycheck and work from home when most full-time event industry professionals were shut down. I remained patient and continued to grow my side hustle by networking virtually, posting content and working on the administrative part of my business because I knew it was only a matter of time before events came back. Sure enough, we saw a surge of events being played (including weddings) in 2021, and I knew I made the right decision to leave the 9-5 world.Since the majority of my event bookings are operated through my LLC (I don't have an agent or any employees), a few years ago, when I started receiving an increase in demand for myself at events, there was a period when I was overwhelmed with how manual the booking process was (scheduling calls, sending contracts and invoices, etc.). However, I started automating my booking process in 2022 using HoneyBook, which I now use to automate the process from a client inquiry through booking. I have so much more free time to devote to innovating my entertainment style in the ever-changing industry and can focus on getting myself physically ready to be on my feet and bring energy to the dance floor for many hours each weekend.Related: I Was a 25-Year-Old Nurse When I Started a Side Hustle to Combat Anxiety. It Made $1 Million in 7 Months — Then Sold for a Life-Changing Amount.


How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?Within the first year of launching my side hustle, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to play the sax at Angelina Pivarnick of Jersey Shore's wedding and the grand opening party for The Edge NYC. Events like these so early on in my career gave me the confidence to want to take my side hustle full-time. I was on track to earn between $45,000 and $50,000 in 2020, and at the time, my goal was to find a way to replace my email marketing income.You've since turned the side hustle into a full-time business. What does total revenue look like now?I currently earn between $150,000 and $175,000 a year playing events and was fortunate to make $176,000 in 2023.What do you enjoy most about running your own business?Being able to share my love of entertaining others through joyful celebrations is what I love most about owning my own business. I also love the ability to set my own schedule and decide when I want to work and when I want to take time off for myself. I'm so thankful that I have full control over my business and continue to strive to find the perfect balance between my career and my personal life.Related: 4 Simple Mistakes That Can Crush Your Creative Side Hustle, From an Expert Who Raised $45 Million to Support Independent Workers


What's your advice for others hoping to start successful side hustles of their own?Ask yourself the question, If money didn't exist, what would you do? I never feel like I'm working because I love what I do. While it may be frustrating to not see an immediate ROI with customers and sales, continue to build your business based on what you'd do if money didn't exist so you can continue to have fun along the way and not get lost in why you started the business in the first place. Always be prepared, show up on time, strive to work well with others and be able to adapt to any and all situations.Find your strengths and triple down on them. What sets you apart from everybody else?Also, use social media to your advantage, especially since it's absolutely free to post! You never know what might happen by being unafraid to share your story with the world. Be yourself, and I promise you, there will be someone who will resonate with you and your story.This article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of being a Young Entrepreneur®.

Her Product Was in Macy's Within the Year — Seeing Nearly $350,000 in Sales.","Mar 28, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/her-shocking-discovery-led-to-a-side-hustle-and-over-300k/471768,"
In 2022, Elenor Mak, now founder of doll company Jilly Bing, was busy balancing her business development role at a healthcare company and raising her 2-year-old and 4-year-old children. Back then, she ""was definitely not looking to start"" a side hustle. She'd founded an ecommerce fashion company in the past and knew what it took to get a business up and running. But that changed when her young daughter Jillian began playing with stuffed animals and dolls.Image Credit: Courtesy of Jilly Bing. Elenor Mak.""It reminded me of my own childhood,"" Mak tells Entrepreneur. ""You're playing with dolls; you're trying to make sense of the world. She was bossing her dolls around, like, 'Eat your dinner. Wash your hands.' Acting like a mom. Not in those words, but at age two, sort of using those words, simpler versions of those words.""



Related: How to Go From Side Hustle to 7-Figure Business and Beyond, According to 3 Women Who Did ItOne day, Mak's mother gave her granddaughter a ""beautiful blonde, blue-eyed doll."" When Mak asked her why she'd chosen that doll instead of one that looked like her daughter, her mother said, ""It was the prettiest one on the shelf."" Despite knowing her mother meant well, Mak found those words ""so heavy,"" a reminder of her own experience with lack of representation as a child.


""They gave them an Asian name, like Ling, or like a bad haircut. It was so shocking and disappointing.""Mak decided to buy her daughter a doll that looked like her and figured it would be a straightforward process: Because I live in San Francisco, and it's 2022. But it wasn't. Her local toy store didn't have one. Neither did the second she visited. Or the third. The toy aisles at major retailers like Target and Toys""R""Us seemed as though they ""had not evolved"" since Mak was a kid, nearly four decades before.""There were just rows and rows of Caucasian dolls, brunettes, and then at the very end of the aisle, you would have these dolls that I think were intended to be Asian because they were holding a panda bear,"" Mak recalls. ""They gave them an Asian name, like Ling, or like a bad haircut. It was so shocking and disappointing.""Mak looked to Asia for more options, but asking her relatives what they could find only turned up ""Eurasian-looking dolls,"" she says, adding that ""dolls largely represent what society thinks is beautiful, and in Asia, what's beautiful is still the Caucasian sort of features."" Mak remembered wishing she were beautiful like the dolls she had growing up, and ""her mommy bear instincts"" kicked in — she was determined to get her daughter a doll that looked like her, even if she had to make it herself.


Related: I Started a Semi-Passive Side Hustle That Earns $33,000 a Week on Amazon: 'Selling There Is a No-Brainer'How hard could it be? ""It's really hard — really hard — to make a good doll.""Mak Googled ""how to make a doll,"" and armed with an MBA from Harvard Business School and her ""strong business background,"" she got to work on a side hustle that would shake up the $40 billion toy industry. Although she admits the creative component wasn't where she excelled (""My 6-year-old son is a better artist than me,"" she quips), she had a clear vision when it came to the business side and the potential for major demand: ""The Asian American population is one of the fastest-growing — we're 7% of the country's population.""And how hard could it be to make a doll in an age where we're churning out Teslas and developing AI? She recalls thinking. As it turns out, ""it's really hard — really hard — to make a good doll,"" Mak says. Fortunately, her business background helped her develop an essential ""superpower"": ""finding really good people."" Mak did cold outreaches to Asian designers at large toy brands and leveraged her own extensive network to connect with professionals who could bring the dream to life.


Image Credit: Courtesy of Jilly Bing. Elenor Mak and her daughter Jillian with the Jilly doll.By June 2022, they had their team of four. Mak conducted a lot of research over the next several months, speaking with Asian families and looking at photographs of kids and dolls to really try to understand what parents wanted. ""It's not just about saying, 'Oh, this doll's Asian,'"" Mak says. ""But what mattered to them? What were the features? What were the backstories?"" In December of that year, the prototype for Jilly Bing, named for Mak's daughter Jillian and the Chinese word for cookie, ""bing gan"" (Jillian's first word), was ready to share with the world.Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a Month""Adult women would write in and be like, 'Oh my gosh, it's like healing for my inner child.'""Jilly Bing started shipping dolls in August 2023 — and sold out of its stock of 2,000 within six weeks. Greta Gerwig's blockbuster hit Barbie had also put the spotlight on dolls that summer, ""opening up the national conversation"" and presenting ""an opportunity for us to change the narrative for not just our Asian children, but all children,"" Mak says. At that point, Mak realized the ""high-risk, high-effort"" passion project she'd worked on as a side hustle for the past couple of years — taking late-night business calls after her kids were asleep and balancing it all with her full-time day job — would benefit from her undivided attention.Jilly Bing also appeared on the Today show around that time, and the positive response was ""overwhelming."" ""Adult women would write in and be like, 'Oh my gosh, it's like healing for my inner child. Life would have been so different if I had a doll that looked like me growing up,'"" Mak says. ""Even non-Asian parents writing [in to say], 'Oh my gosh, I think my kids should have dolls that look like their friends.'""By early this year, Jilly Bing was on shelves at Macy's; the retailer reached out after the Today segment. ""It's a company I grew up with,"" Mak says, ""so it was just really wonderful that they saw the value of Jilly Bing so early on."" Jilly Bing is also part of Macy's Mission Every One initiative, which has committed $5 billion of spending through 2025 to its people, partners, products and programs ""to create a more equitable and sustainable future.""Related: How This Doctor-Turned-Entrepreneur Is Trying to Change the World Through Play


""Seeing the kids' reactions to having a doll that looks like them keeps me going [more than] everything else.""To date, Jilly Bing has sold approximately 5,000 dolls, Mak says. At $68 apiece, that's more than $300,000 in sales.And Mak's favorite part about running her business? That would be the testimonials from her young customers. ""It's seeing the photos,"" Mak says. ""And hearing the stories [from them] — and my own daughter — saying, 'She looks like me. She has black hair like me.' [And] little Asian boys saying, 'She's beautiful like my mama.' It's just seeing the kids' reactions to having a doll that looks like them that keeps me going [more than] everything else.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Jilly Bing. 


Mak had to ""trust her gut"" to start the side hustle turned full-fledged business that's leaving its mark on the toy industry and beyond, and she looks forward to building the brand out in the years to come.""I am most excited about being able to create characters,"" Mak says. ""We started to branch into comics because it's a doll, but we're starting to create the stories. I've got a vision of a whole cast of Asian American characters that actually reflect what Asian America looks like today. We have mixed Asian children, you have boys, you have Southeast Asian. Jilly's our first doll, so I'm excited to grow and introduce the world to the rest of Jilly Bing's friends.""

29,I Built My Company to 23 Profitable Stores. Here's My Advice to Small Business Owners Who Want to Grow Their Retail Presence.,"Mar 26, 2024",Anna Harman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/studs-founder-shares-advice-for-venturing-into-retail/470820,"
If you were to take a stroll down the shopping haven that is Prince Street in downtown Manhattan, you'd come across two distinct camps of brick-and-mortar locations: need-to-have stores and nice-to-have stores. Smack dab in the middle of the bustling SoHo neighborhood, you're more likely to find the latter, with sky-high real estate prices that suit tenants like Apple and Louis Vuitton — companies that would do well even if they didn't have outposts there. Go a few blocks east, though, and you'll land in Nolita, a charming, trendy area with a bit more edge. Nolita, in many cases, is the land of need-to-have stores — including us at Studs.When navigating your retail growth, the distinction between need-to-have and nice-to-have is a crucial one. It's how we've built our company to 23 profitable stores since my co-founder Lisa Bubber and I first founded Studs — a retail and ecommerce brand that has reimagined the ear piercing experience — in 2019. Because, as it turns out, there's no such thing as a business built on ear piercing without a physical space to actually do the piercing itself. So here are three pieces of advice I offer to any new entrepreneur looking to grow their business and wanting to know if a physical store is right for them.Related: Anna Harman explains how her company has reimagined ear piercings and jewelry for Gen Z and millennial customers.1. Ask yourself this question As an entrepreneur, my greatest piece of advice for other business owners looking to expand their retail footprint is to start by asking themselves one question: Why? In our case, we knew we needed to have stores by the very nature of our business. We can't execute our mission without them — which is why you'll find us in Nolita, not SoHo — and at 23 other locations nationwide.



In other words, ask yourself this: What's the purpose of your store, and how does it fit into the broader context of your business?For some companies, a nice-to-have store can still be incredibly important for the overall value proposition. Stores can be so much more than just transactional. Physical stores can offer their customers an experience that supports their overarching brand identity. Other stores can simply be a destination, a headquarters for community gatherings that support the mission of the brand.Related: One of the Biggest Mistakes Aspiring Entrepreneurs — and Almost Everybody — Make2. Get down and dirty with your financesIf you need to have a store in a practical sense, you have to be able to afford the store. And if you do, in fact, need a store, get down and dirty with your finances. Ask yourself these questions:


What can I afford?How much product can I expect to sell?How many people do I need to have in the building in order to sell the product?And finally, how do I make enough money to pay my rent — and, hopefully, have more to spare?Related: 7 Ways to Fund Your Startup in 2024This becomes a very different decision-making process for businesses that just want to have a store — but a store isn't necessary to the company's bottom line. Take a buzzy beauty retailer that views its brick-and-mortar offerings as extensions of its community-building strategy: How do you design an experience that makes it more compelling for consumers to take time out of their busy days to visit a store in person and enter the world of the brand, as opposed to just buying the product online?At Studs and for many other service-based companies, this thinking is still top of mind — but we also need our stores to be financially sustainable. The return on investment becomes a much more critical piece of the puzzle.Related: How to Increase Foot Traffic to Your Retail Store


3. No detail should be overlookedSo, now you've determined your retail expansion ""why"" and how you'll be able to afford it in the first place. My third and final piece of advice comes down to your business model. Every detail of your business model will make an impact, and the more you study and nitpick your business in the early stages, the easier it will be to scale.In the early days of Studs, we spent a lot of time answering all sorts of nitty-gritty questions. No detail was to be overlooked. How do we price the product? How many people will work in the store, and how will they be compensated competitively? What are the store hours? These are all decisions that add up to the economics of the store, which — spoiler alert — can and will change dramatically from neighborhood to neighborhood, city to city, state to state. Ironing out the economics early, with absolute, meticulous detail, will make the day-to-day of running a store that much more seamless.Looking ahead, I expect to see more nice-to-have stores generally, but that certainly doesn't mean need-to-have stores are going anywhere. Having any sort of retail footprint is hard work, and that doesn't matter what kind of store it is. But these three tips make the process a bit more navigable, especially when you're just getting started.Related: How to Write an Operations Plan for Retail and Sales Businesses

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dr. Jenny Woo, educator and founder of Mind Brain Emotion, the company behind a line of card games and other tools for the development of emotional intelligence. The story has been edited and condensed for clarity. There's some research that shows that today's college students are way less emotionally intelligent compared to those a decade ago. And this research was done before the pandemic, so you can imagine what that looks like post-pandemic. I've also seen a lot of research on the impact of distance learning and social isolation, where adults and kids just don't have the same opportunity to interact with people. For kids, this translated into social anxiety and regression [in] communication skills and language, and just that unwillingness to connect with people.Image Credit: Courtesy of Mind Brain Emotion. Dr. Jenny Woo.



I've done management consulting for Fortune 500 companies, and through working with senior leaders, I found that soft skills in the workplace are not quite emphasized, which really impacts the health of an organization's team. When I was researching this area at the children's level, I realized, Oh my gosh, these are the skills that basically weren't really taught or discussed in school. So, while at the Harvard Innovation Labs, I took a research-backed approach to develop a tool in the form of a card game that anybody could enjoy — you don't have to go to school or anything. (I wanted to do something that was easy and accessible because I'm the first one in my family to graduate college.)Related: This Gen Zer's Stylish Side Hustle Earns About $20,000 a Month and Paid Off His Parents' $200,000 Debt: 'I Enjoy the Hands-Off Nature'


The development of my first card deck, which launched in May 2018 with the help of a Kickstarter campaign, stemmed from a combination of education research and industry experience. I was in a master's program in education that was focused on the intersection of cognitive science, neuroscience, education and child development, and I guess psychology sprinkled in there. I started with the 52 Essential Conversations to really help people have purposeful conversations in an authentic and vulnerable way. This would be parents with children, adult parents and grandparents with children in school. It's almost like the pearls of wisdom that you want to leave someone close to you — to feel good that they're set for life and can make responsible decisions.I didn't even really think about developing more card decks, but organically, as I was testing the game out with users and gathering these case studies, understanding how people are actually engaging and interacting with it, I realized that in order to even begin to have these vulnerable, heart-to-heart conversations, you need to have that trust, respect and understanding first. And so that is where I created the second deck, which is the Relationship Skills deck — to help people go back to the drawing board, connect with each other and build that caring trust necessary to even have a conversation. I released that one in January 2019.Related: Her 'Crude Prototype' and $50 Craigslist Purchase Launched a Side Hustle That Hit $1 Million in Sales — Now the Business Generates Up to $20 Million a YearAmazon is a platform that's continuously growing in terms of people who rely on the service, so selling there is a no-brainer.

I'm lecturing but also providing a service through my online course as Mind Brain Emotion, my company. So every quarter I teach, and they pay me directly per person taking my online course.

I speak a lot to entrepreneurship classes at the graduate college level, and one time I got this question from someone: ""Can you start a business if you're not really passionate about what you're selling if it will make a lot of money?"" My answer is, ""Why would you want to do that?"" My advice is to do something that you're truly passionate about and hopefully passionate about for a long, long time because it is a grind. You're going to get negative customer reviews, which is like a death sentence for a business. And you have to love what you're doing enough to just pick yourself up and keep going. That also goes into knowing what your values are; you're going to have so many dilemmas and decisions that you need to make, and in order to weigh the pros and cons, you have to go back to your values and what's important to you.Related: Learn How You Can Take Advantage of Amazon's Advertising Tools to Get More Eyes on Your BusinessAdditionally, as a solopreneur, you don't know what you don't know, and that's one of the biggest challenges I see when I talk to other entrepreneurs.

31,How To Embed Your Client Needs into Your Business DNA,"Mar 25, 2024",Rim Elijah,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-embed-customer-centricity-into-your-business/470963,"
Today, the evolving dynamics of the B2B landscape demand more than just service enhancements to achieve true client orientation. It requires a foundational shift in strategy, embedding a deep understanding of client needs into every facet of the business.In this piece, I talk about how strategic client orientation extends beyond the introduction of new features and suggest a comprehensive approach that integrates client feedback into the very fabric of your business operations.Understanding client orientation as a strategic approachClient orientation in the B2B sector transcends the mere addition of novel services or features. It embodies a strategic foundation integral to a company's success. This strategic approach involves a deep understanding of your client's needs, preferences and challenges, ensuring that every aspect of the business operation, from product development to marketing, aligns with delivering exceptional value to your target audience. I see it as embedding client-centric thinking into the company's DNA, where every decision is made with the client's best interest at heart.



While things like proactive customer support or live webinars might initially appear as client-oriented innovations, true client orientation requires a holistic strategy that considers every touchpoint in the client's journey, ensuring that their experiences are not just satisfactory but exceed expectations.Related: How Pivoting Saved My Business When Things Didn't Go According to Plan


Integrating client feedback into business strategyThe essence of a client-oriented strategy lies in the systematic integration of client feedback into all areas of business operations. This process begins with the collection and analysis of feedback across various channels, turning these insights into actionable strategies that directly address client concerns and desires.Regular strategic reviews also serve as checkpoints to assess how well the company's offerings align with client expectations and market demands. These reviews ensure that client feedback isn't just heard but is a driving force behind strategic decisions, leading to continuous improvement and adaptation.For instance, the feedback from the attendees of EOSDA webinars helped us recognize the need for deeper client engagement and the implementation of more personalized, value-driven offerings in our space/agriculture industry. This decision exemplified how strategic client orientation evolves based on comprehensive feedback analysis in our team.Related: The Role of PR in the Changing B2B Landscape


Aligning departments towards a unified client-centric visionAchieving a truly client-oriented company requires the alignment of all departments toward a shared vision of putting the client first. This alignment ensures that every team works cohesively to enhance client satisfaction and loyalty from product development to sales, marketing, and customer support.A pivotal step in this process is establishing clear communication channels and collaborative platforms where insights about client needs and feedback are shared and discussed openly. Such an environment fosters innovation and ensures client-centric strategies are consistently applied across all touchpoints. By doing so, each department contributes to a unified client experience that is seamless, personalized, and, above all, oriented toward exceeding client expectations.The transition to this aligned approach signifies a company-wide commitment to understanding and truly meeting the clients' needs, marking a significant shift from isolated efforts to a holistic strategy.Practical implementation of a client-centric strategyMoving beyond foundational theories, strategic frameworks, and established collaboration platforms, our actionable approach to client orientation is manifested through the deliberate modification of internal processes, product development, and communication methods to better align with client needs. Such changes demonstrate our commitment to transforming client feedback into tangible improvements that enhance the client experience.


As an outcome, the development and adaptation of our product offerings are now directly informed by client interactions, ensuring that new features and services are not only innovative, but also directly responsive to identified client needs.By actively implementing strategies that reflect our dedication to meeting and exceeding client expectations, we are now able to foster stronger client relationships and position ourselves as a responsive and evolving leader in our industry.Related: Why B2B Companies Can't Ignore the 5th P of Marketing — PaymentsBottom lineStrategic client orientation is the cornerstone of a successful B2B company. It surpasses traditional service enhancements to foster a deep-seated commitment to understanding and addressing client needs. The journey from continuous feedback collection and analysis to pivoting to more personalized client solutions reveals the transformative power of adopting a client-centric approach to each of our team members.


By ensuring that client feedback informs strategic decisions and that all departments are aligned in their commitment to client satisfaction, you can enhance client relationships and solidify your competitive advantage in the market.My ultimate takeaway is clear: a strategic, holistic approach to client orientation is essential for businesses aiming to thrive in today's dynamic market environment.

Grace Ryu has eight income streams that make up her six-figure income. Courtesy of Grace Ryu


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Grace Ryu, a 23-year-old content creator based in Houston. The following has been edited for length and clarity.I quit my tech job in March 2023 to explore other income streams. My 9-5 took up too much of my time, and I wanted to focus on ways to make money while I was sleeping or traveling.



Chasing different income streams aligns with my personality — it satisfies my desire to explore and try as much as possible. If I grow bored with one area, I can shift my focus to another, and if one stream isn't that profitable, I have others to fall back on.Here's a breakdown of my eight income streams, with earnings, difficulty level, and time spent each week:


1. Luxury picnic businessEasy rating: 9/10Lucrative rating: 7/10I run a luxury picnic business with my best friend and my boyfriend. We initially posted our products on Facebook Marketplace and school flyers and broke even the first week of promoting them.We re-invested all that money into expanding the business model, like buying more equipment for group picnics. We've since worked with businesses like Kendra Scott, local hotels, and Texas A&M University.We have a six-person team, so I no longer do the physical setup and tear down, and I only put in one hour a week. During March through May, October, and November (peak picnic months), I can take home up to $3,000 a month.It's easy and affordable to start and doesn't require many skills besides having an eye for aesthetics. It's also lucrative because profit margins are very high since there are little to no variable expenses.


2. Influencer brand dealsEasy rating: 8/10Lucrative rating: 10/10I'm a micro influencer, and I have a TikTok account where I post about my life, my streams of income, and product promotions.Brands reach out and ask me to post a dedicated or integrated TikTok video. I used to make content for brands for free, but now I charge at least $1,000 per post.I spend around one hour a week on brand deals. At first, making content and editing was hard because I had to get used to the software and apps. After doing this for two years, I'm very fast at it because I know exactly which clips to add and how to do voiceovers.It takes time to build a following on a platform, but once you get to that point, it's very easy to work with brands for sponsorships. I make between $1,000 and $2,000 per post for about an hour of work.


3. Affiliate marketingEasy rating: 7/10Lucrative rating: 9/10I started doing affiliate marketing through Amazon's influencer program and make anywhere from $500 to $2,000 monthly.In my TikToks, I feature work-from-home essentials from Amazon and link them. Then, people go to my storefront and buy through the links, and I get paid a commission.It takes about five minutes to apply for the program, but you have to have a social media profile that promotes content.If you never post anything, you'll likely get rejected. I have friends who only have a few hundred followers, but they make unboxing videos, so they were accepted.


Anyone can do affiliate marketing because it's easy to start, but the money isn't always guaranteed. It takes lots of time and patience on any social media platform for a post to go viral, which will bring in sales. Once that happens, money comes in fast over a few months, and it's all passive income.4. User-generated contentEasy rating: 4/10Lucrative rating: 8/10User-generated content (UGC) differs from sponsorships because it's content for brands to use directly. I used to work with a lash company, which paid me to make TikToks, but I don't post that content on my account.I have a few retainer clients, which means I'm paid a regular monthly fee in exchange for a set amount of content.I earn about $6,000 to $8,000 a month from UGC. It takes around eight hours a week and can be more demanding than other income streams. I need to craft videos that convert well in sales, which takes extra brainpower.


5. Pet sittingEasy rating: 10/10Lucrative rating: 10/10I got into pet sitting as a side gig while working in tech. I started on Rover, an app that links pet owners with sitters. Setting up a profile and passing a background check is quick, and you can start earning as soon as you're booked.It's ideal for remote workers like me — getting paid to hang out with cute animals is great, and I can still manage other tasks, like checking up on my picnic business, answering emails, or creating content.In January 2024, I was pet-sitting almost every day, and I enjoyed it because it was such a relaxing job. The only downside is I didn't get to travel as much since I needed to stay with the pets.It's an extremely easy side hustle if you understand pet care and behavior. Pets are super easy to work with as long as they're not puppies — puppies are more work.


6. Airbnb arbitrageEasy rating: 2/10Lucrative rating: 4/10Airbnb arbitrage is my least favorite income stream — I may be letting go of this soon because the Airbnb market isn't as hot as it used to be a few years ago.How it works is I rent a property from a landlord for $1,700, for example, and once my business partner and I get the green light to use it as a short-term or mid-term rental, we list the property on platforms like Airbnb and VRBO. We're tenants but act more like property managers, and we then earn profits from these listings.After splitting earnings with my business partner, my net profit is around $600 per month. Since we focus primarily on mid-term stays, which require less frequent turnovers, my partner and I spend about five to six hours monthly on maintenance and cleaning, typically at the end of each stay.It's my least favorite side hustle because the financial risk is the highest — you have to accommodate guest needs, and the work is not enjoyable either. After monthly expenses, I don't think the payout is enough to justify the effort.


7. Selling digital productsEasy rating: 10/10Lucrative rating: 4/10I created a content creation e-book because I've had many people on social media ask me to coach them. Whenever people ask me about content creation, I direct them to my link so they can buy my e-book.I sell it for $20, and each month I make $60 to $80. I don't promote it that much since I only have it as a resource for when people ask.Anyone with enough knowledge about a specific topic can create an e-book or digital product, so it's easy to do. However, it does take time and effort to bring in sales.8. NannyingEasy rating: 8/10Lucrative rating: 9/10I nanny for a family that flies me from Houston to New York three or four times a year. I stay for two to three weeks and get paid $1,200 a week.


My day-to-day is very simple — I take the girls to school in the morning, and when I come back, I can make content or go outside and explore the city. When the girls come home, I eat dinner, play with them, and then put them to sleep.The families I babysit for in Houston and the family I nanny for in New York are all amazing to me and compensate me generously, which makes my job enjoyable and easy. The hardest part is when the kids are sick because I have to be more hands-on. Aside from that, once you become familiar with their routines, it's super chill.I wish I had diversified my income soonerAlthough building my income streams took a lot of hustling upfront, I wish I had started sooner. I went from making $8/hour working a labor-intensive job as a ranch hand to now making over $100,000 a year from only working around 40 hours a month.For those who are considering creating more income streams, don't be reckless or stingy with your spending. Be courageous in investing in yourself, a business idea, or in others. If your dreams don't scare you a little, they might not be big enough.

33,"She Never Wanted to Start a Business, But Chronic Insomnia Was Motivation — Here's How She Achieved 8 Figures in Sales and 8 Hours of Sleep a Night","Mar 19, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/bearabys-founder-surpassed-20m-in-sales-gets-better-sleep/471256,"
Dr. Kathrin Hamm, founder and CEO of sleep-wellness company Bearaby, never wanted to be an entrepreneur. After graduating with her Ph.D. in economics, she started as an economist at the World Bank. Her work took her all over the world and provided invaluable insight into the small, medium and women-founded enterprises she tried to convince banks to lend to — but she ""learned firsthand how hard it is, especially in developing countries, for women to get access to finance and start and grow their businesses.""During her time in India and Bangladesh especially, Hamm faced long, ""exhausting"" travel days. She'd ""never been a good sleeper,"" waking easily even as a child, and she developed a chronic case of insomnia. It began ""on a more moderate level,"" with difficulty falling and staying asleep, before the periods of wakefulness became longer and longer, motivating her to look into different solutions.Image Credit: Courtesy of Bearaby. Kathrin Hamm.



She started by investigating various mattress options, but when she dug deeper, she found an article discussing weighted blankets. The piece focused on helping children with sensory issues, Hamm recalls, but it also mentioned that evenly distributed weight on an adult body could support better sleep. Hamm was immediately intrigued — as a potential customer.Related: The No-Excuse Approach to Sleep and Work Performance for Entrepreneurs


""Let me buy a product, sleep better and then move on with my career.""""I came from a consumer lens,"" Hamm says, ""and knowing how hard it is for women to start a business, I [was] like, Yeah, I'm good here. I don't want to start a business or even think about becoming an entrepreneur. Let me buy a product, sleep better and then move on with my career.""However, the purchase process proved difficult. Unable to find options online, Hamm had to go to a pharmacy in Germany, where she's from, to place an order. Six weeks later, a ""big bean bag"" arrived. It was orange and blue and ""very noisy,"" Hamm says. She was reluctant to even try it at first and wondered if she'd made a mistake.""But then I put it on during the day on a weekend, and I just passed out after 10 minutes,"" Hamm says. ""And I woke up more than two hours later, [after] a solid nap, completely passed out, and I'm like, Wow, this is magic. This thing works for me.""


Related: Fighting Sleep Is a Losing Management Strategy. Let Your Employees Take Naps.So Hamm kept using the blanket at night, but there was a problem: Because the blanket was filled with plastic beads to add weight, she often got too hot. The underlying functionality works; the weight on my body works, Hamm remembers thinking, but how it is made doesn't work. After some research, Hamm discovered that the technology, which largely consisted of bead-filled chambers between layers of blanket, had been around for 30 years — ""Nobody had innovated anything about this product.""""Why can't you just use strips of cotton?""Hamm decided to experiment with alternative designs. She drew some inspiration from her time spent in India, ""where there's a culture of making rugs, knitting, crocheting,"" but the ultimate breakthrough came from a conversation with her mom. Hamm had been considering changing the material or adding holes for airflow when her mom said, ""Why can't you just use strips of cotton?"" They would create a thick yarn that could be knit together for natural airflow, eliminating the need for heavy artificial materials that shift around and reduce comfort. That idea led to the development of Bearaby's first small blanket, made from a cut-up t-shirt.


Confident she was onto something, Hamm opted to take a year's leave from her job to focus on the business. ""I didn't want to take too much of a risk, again, knowing that it can get really hard,"" she admits. ""[But] my boss was super supportive, and she said, 'Look, if it doesn't work out, we make a case study out of it.'""Hamm withdrew $120,000 from her retirement fund and raised just over $250,000 from a crowdfunding campaign to fund the prototypes for the first batch of blankets. She also looked into patents, but they were expensive, so she did the drawing herself, then had a lawyer put together a provisional patent application, which entitles the filer to 18 months before they have to pay more money. That went through just a couple of days before launch in December 2018; the blanket sold out in two weeks and was the only product of its kind on the market for a couple of years, Hamm says.Image Credit: Courtesy of BearabyRelated: How to Take Advantage of the 'First-to-File' Patent System


Despite the early success, the more than 50 factories that Hamm approached weren't inclined to take on the product. They'd never seen anything like it: It wasn't apparel, and it wasn't bedding. So, for that first year and a half, Hamm rented a small garage outfitted with knitting machines and knitters to churn out the first products. The strong sales helped the business continue to finance production, which was a good thing, too — because people still weren't all that interested in investing in the first-of-its-kind product.""In hindsight, we had to learn to be profitable.""Hamm leaned into the ""bootstrap"" mentality, which was a blessing in disguise. ""In hindsight, we had to learn to be profitable,"" she explains, ""to become in tune with our production processes and marketing processes, to be efficient, which sometimes you didn't see at that time in the direct-to-consumer space. Everyone was like, 'I raised that much money, and I'm putting that much million on a marketing spend.' So we never had it, but now, in an environment where money is not flowing [as] freely, we never had that money in the first place, so we are feeling pretty good right now.""Bearaby saw another major advantage in brand loyalty. Hamm notes that people seeking wellness and sleep tend to form an ""emotional connection"" with the blanket,"" and that it's easy to fall in love with a brand that helps you sleep better. Substantial interest also translated into an early retail presence. Just five months in, Bearaby was in West Elm, thanks to customers who walked in and wanted to try the blanket. That happened with Nordstrom, too.


Related: Customer Loyalty Is Your Holy Grail for Success. Here's How to Cultivate It.As Bearaby considered expansion, it centered on functional products that would uphold its commitment to quality and sustainability (the company is certified by third-party organizations, including The Global Organic Textile Standard, The Forest Stewardship Council and The Global Recycled Standard). Because anxiety so often goes hand in hand with insomnia, the company landed on its warmables line; boasting a weighted and heated neck wrap, bottle and lap pad, it ""takes the nervous system to zero,"" Hamm says.Image Credit: Courtesy of BearabyNaturally, Bearaby's products have become an integral part of Hamm's own sleep routine, and as she's gotten older, she's realized even more just how much sleep she actually needs. ""Now I sleep for a minimum of eight hours,"" she says. ""I'm training myself to get nine to 10 hours of sleep, obviously not every night, but definitely every weekend. Also, [it helps] whenever I get a chance to take a nap, like just a 20-minute nap to reset. [I make sure that I have] these conscious breaks, whether [it's] napping or deep breathing because running a business is a marathon, and if we don't take care of our bodies, we're not able to do that over a very long time.""


""Just have tunnel vision for one year, and then reevaluate after those 365 days.""Hamm's five-year marathon with Bearaby has led to over eight figures in sales and more than 10 patents — but it all started with a single, somewhat reluctant leap of faith. And according to the founder, that's exactly what it takes to be successful.""Once you believe in a product, just take a chance and give yourself a year,"" Hamm says. ""It's much more manageable if you [have] a considerable time frame where it's like, Okay, in that year, I'm giving everything I have, 100%. Because sometimes we second guess ourselves. After [a few] months or six weeks, we don't see the success, [and] we start doubting ourselves. You say [I have] one year, and I'm not asking if this is working. Just have tunnel vision for one year, and then reevaluate after those 365 days.""This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

When Will Ahmed launched his wearable tech company WHOOP, the odds of success were not in his favor. The iconic company Nike had just entered the space with its own wearable product, FuelBand. How could Ahmed's startup possibly compete with an international powerhouse whose name literally comes from the Greek goddess of victory?It turns out quite well. Nike discontinued the FuelBand in 2014, while WHOOP became a $4 billion company. How did Ahmed slay the swoosh—not to mention other competitors in the space, such as Microsoft, Google, Fitbit, and Jawbone? He credits his success to a combination of a well-defined strategy and a healthy dose of naivete.""I had an idea for a product that I thought should exist in the world. And it didn't make sense to me why that product didn't exist. I thought it should be there,"" he said on my podcast One day with Jon Bier.



 Here are four key takeaways from our lively conversation.


Learn from the greatsIronically, Ahmed's strategy for WHOOP took a page out of Nike's playbook of old. Back in the days of Air Jordans and ""Bo Knows,"" Nike had ""a deep obsession with creating a shoe that could make athletes run faster,"" recalls Ahmed. However, Nike didn't use the same strategy for FuelBand, which it raced out to market without consulting athletes.""If I were Nike, I would have [asked] how do we start at the tip of the pyramid? We need this to be something LeBron wears, Serena wears, and Tiger wears. Then we're going to tell that story and bring it to the masses,"" he says. They just skipped that whole step… They didn't validate it with their athletes.""Conversely, Ahmed did extensive market research before his launch, giving him an advantage over competitors.Related: The Extraordinary Career of Nike Founder Phil Knight - Biography


Make technology the servant, not the masterSometimes, you want a product that whispers instead of shouts. Ahmed rejects the idea that wearables should be a constant companion, always vying for our attention.""Technology should improve your life, not invade it,"" he says.That's why WHOOP quietly collects data without demanding the wearer's constant engagement.""We wanted to collect this information in the background and then say the right things at the right moments,"" he says. ""There's a certain principle behind that, which is to have the product disappear in the background on your behalf.""


Don't fear failure— but don't idealize it, eitherAhmed believes that the fear of failure has killed many great ideas before they've had a chance to become a reality. But he also thinks that in today's tech culture, ""failure has been romanticized as sort of an appropriate end state. There are a lot of these weird phrases in the technology industry, like, 'test, iterate, fail.'""Instead of focusing on our failures, he says we should embrace our successes.In building a WHOOP, there were a number of moments where we were on the razor's edge of failure, and what it took to overcome those moments was a profound level of focus, pain management, overcoming stress,"" Ahmed recalls. ""I have a lot of pride in that. I feel a connection to that younger self and the team around me that was able to pull through that darkness when the company almost failed.""Related: 10 Lessons About Failure That Every Entrepreneur Needs to Know


Lean into gratitudeAhmed says that many entrepreneurs chase dopamine by setting goals and reaching them. The problem is that success never feels as good as we think it will, so we keep moving the goalposts until we're numb to any real happiness.His solution is to inject some gratitude into his life.""I know this will sound a little woo-woo to some people, but gratitude releases serotonin. That's another way to make yourself feel happy,"" he says. ""Gratitude is appreciating where you are, and the team you're with, and that is the sort of happiness unlock to the hard-driving entrepreneur.""How does he practice gratitude? ""I meditate first thing in the morning, and as part of that, I actively think about things I'm grateful for,"" he says. ""I also have a journaling practice where I write down three things I'm grateful for.""


This can be as simple as his morning cup of coffee, a loving look from his wife, or maybe even beating out Nike in 2014.Related: Why Gratitude Makes Leaders More Effective

      Key Takeaways    



        Rowley recognized a gap in the market when it came to aesthetically pleasing baby gear — like wraps. 
      


        She bought a few thousand dollars worth of fabric and a used serger and opened an Etsy shop, then got to work. 
      


        After her husband joined the company, they hired their first employee, and sales exploded — to $1 million. 
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Elle Rowley, founder of Solly Baby, a company that produces sustainably sourced baby wraps made of 100% certified TENCEL Modal and other baby gear. In 2023, Rowley stepped away from her day-to-day role (she now serves the brand as a strategic advisor and is on the board), and the company welcomed Nicole Newhouse as CEO to lead the next stage of Solly Baby's growth.Image Credit: Courtesy of Solly Baby. Elle Rowley.When did you start Solly Baby as a side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?



After having my first baby in 2009, I was surprised to find a surge of creative inspiration that I had never known before having kids. My husband was still in school, and I was hungry to start something to supplement our meager student income. By the time I was pregnant with our second child in 2011, the online world was fertile ground for mothers looking to start a side hustle from home. I tried a few different things, but I intuitively knew that there was a gap in the market when it came to aesthetically pleasing baby gear, so I was pretty focused on that space throughout my pregnancy.I loved wearing my first baby, and I'd heard that wraps were the most comfortable way to wear an infant, so being industrious and broke, I made two wraps out of cheap jersey knit fabric — one for me and one for a friend who was also pregnant. While my crude prototype was far from what the product became, I could see the potential for this long piece of fabric to actually be a fashion accessory for the wearer rather than ""baby gear."" What really sealed it, though, was the first time I timidly ventured out holding my toddler's hand and carrying my baby wrapped on my chest. Before we left the front porch, he was asleep and breathing deeply on my chest. The increase in confidence that I felt with each step was palpable. I felt liberated, and at the same time, I'd never felt more connected to my baby. I knew I was on to something.


What were some of the first steps you took to get the side hustle off the ground?I found a fabric supplier in the fabric district of Los Angeles, purchased a few thousand dollars worth of fabric (thanks to credit cards and a loan from my in-laws), bought a used serger on Craigslist for $50 and opened an Etsy shop. Then, I got to work mostly when my babies were sleeping. I turned our house into a factory to make the first 50 wraps. I signed up for every local handmade market that I could find, which didn't garner great sales results, but the feedback I received from people in real life was invaluable. Lastly, in a decision that felt reckless at the time because of the cost, I hired my favorite photographer to take photos of me wearing my son. I had a nice camera and could have ""made-do"" on my own, but I knew that having beautiful images would help compensate for the many other areas where the brand was weak.Image Credit: Courtesy of Solly BabyWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building the business, and how did you navigate them?


Growth is expensive: I had no capital other than the $4,000 loan for fabric, and finance is not my area of expertise, so I knew I would need a very cash flow-positive business model. In the first three years, it was very challenging to finance our growth, but I can see what a gift it was now to have that constraint. Because we had no factoring terms with our suppliers or credit lines, we'd have to pay a hefty deposit on our production when we submitted the purchase order. Then, we'd pay the remainder of the balance upon completion. This made growth slow, and we were constantly underselling. As demand for the product grew, we started placing everything on preorder on our website, which gave us enough to pay for the order. This made it so our customers were essentially funding our growth.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the business bring in at that point?Sales had been growing year over year in 2013, but we were still only grossing a few hundred thousand dollars a year and taking home less than $100,000. Daily sales were still very inconsistent, which made it difficult to have a lot of confidence in hiring employees or even believing that this was anything more than a side hustle. I was hitting a wall of exhaustion when my husband and I made the leap of faith to bring him into Solly Baby with me. He'd finished school and was working with another startup, but we both felt his time would be better spent if we focused our efforts together. This shift immediately led to new growth and vision. His help also freed me up to work more on the business rather than in the business. We then hired our first employee, Kortney, who took over customer service and fulfillment in a way that freed my husband and me up to focus on growth.Just weeks after hiring Kortney, and days before I had my third child in the spring of 2014, we released our spring collection, and the demand went through the roof. Sales went from anywhere between zero to $3,000 per day to $2,000 becoming our new daily baseline — and releases bringing in tens of thousands of dollars in a day. We hit $1 million in sales that November, and by the end of that year, we knew this was much more than a side hustle.


You've since turned your side hustle into a very successful business. What does revenue look like now?It's been amazing to experience the growth we have been able to achieve. To see this business grow from my house to an Etsy shop to reaching millions of mothers, parents and families is truly humbling. As we continued to build the team and find our footing in the market, some years, we saw revenue double year over year. Today, Solly Baby operates at $10 to 20 million in annual revenue.What's your favorite part about running Solly Baby? As a mother of four, connecting with, encouraging and providing products for postpartum mothers during a very transformational time of life has always been life-giving work for me. It will never get old to meet a mother or father who says, ""Your wraps changed my relationship with my baby."" Knowing that our products have the power to change the trajectory of a parent-child relationship is deeply rewarding.


Developing company culture and ethos was also very rewarding. I made our company motto ""small things with great love"" several years ago because I hold a deep belief that small things done thoughtfully create the biggest and best things. This is relevant to growing a business and equally relevant to raising children. Seeing this adopted and trickle down into every part of the company as CEO felt very meaningful.What does your routine look like these days? Are there any helpful habits you'd recommend to other entrepreneurs?Keeping a daily routine is my best advice. I am a big believer in getting up before your kids (unless you have an infant — then sleep as much as you can!), exercising, getting ready for the day and taking at least 30 minutes for spiritual or meditative practice.It was easy in the early days to completely neglect myself to meet the needs of my family and the business, but I strongly believe that we would've grown faster and with more intention had I taken better care of myself from the beginning. I was running on empty all of the time, and it just about broke me in the first two years. What's more is that the business was not stronger because of my ""sacrifices."" I became very depressed and anxious and finally shared this with my husband. We made a self-care plan together, and everything quickly improved in my life, personally and professionally.


What's your best advice for others hoping to start a successful business of their own? We're often encouraged to ""think big"" when it comes to business, but sometimes, thinking ""small"" is the perfect way to begin — mainly because it will get you to begin. I don't think I would have had the confidence to start a multi-million dollar, global company at the age of 25, but I didn't need to. I just needed enough confidence to make the first 50 wraps to help pay the rent and a sincere desire to bring mothers and babies closer through the product. That was all I needed to get the ball rolling, and then my confidence and vision expanded with the company. We kind of grew up together, Solly Baby and me.This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

37,"Why Notre Dame's Football Coach Tells His Team to ""Choose Hard""","Mar 18, 2024",William Salvi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/why-notre-dames-football-coach-tells-his-team-to-choose/471100,"
This is a special episode of The CEO Series for me because we took a trip to Notre Dame Stadium where I played football as a walk-on alongside my brother during the undefeated season of 2012. We went to my old stomping grounds to sit down with head coach Marcus Freeman to talk about leadership and how, in many ways, he is the CEO of their incredible program.Below are some highlights of that conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity. Watch the full video above.The coach as CEO""A CEO is in charge of a big company, and my company happens to be Notre Dame football. At the end of the day, you're responsible for every decision that affects the people in the program and the results that are on the field. So you don't make every decision, but you're responsible for every decision. That's important to make sure you understand. Throughout my coaching career, the greatest satisfaction came from seeing the players you were involved with have success.""

Now Her Food Company Is a Global Powerhouse.The celebration video that went viral after he was hired as head coach""It was a blur. But I remember walking out of that door and seeing the team going crazy — all I wanted to do was hug them. It wasn't about a speech. It was a chance to celebrate and be with your guys, right? I tell them all the time: I'm a teammate. I might be the captain, but I'm a teammate. I understand the things you're going through. I'm in this fight with you. And I think they respect that and they understand that. Walking out that door is a moment I'll never forget and one I'll cherish forever.""


The meaning of his mantra ""Choose Hard""""It all started a couple of years ago when I was in the Notre Dame weight room and was working out as our players were being pushed hard. And I remember thinking that you can choose to go through the motions or you can choose to go as hard as you can. And that's when I came up with this thought of 'Choose Hard.' We put up a sign you see when you walk into this building that says 'Choose Hard.' Because when you walk into Notre Dame football, you've got to have that mindset. We're going to choose hard today in practice, choose hard today in meetings, choose hard today in the weight room. And for the players, you're going to be challenged in the classroom, right? You're going to be in class with some of the most intelligent people in this world. And it's difficult, but ultimately you've chosen to come here so choose hard, accept it, and know that the rewards from choosing hard every single day can't be found anywhere else.""Related: He Built a Personal Finance App That Manages $8 Billion for Half a Million Customers. Here Is the CEO of M1's Hard-Earned Advice for Future Founders.Problem-solving philosophy""When a team isn't winning, a lot of people say, trust the process. My mantra is: fix the process. I spend a lot of time evaluating everything we were doing. Why aren't we playing better? What are we doing schematically? Is there something our players don't understand? Losses happen and it's a part of life. But they hurt. As a leader, you don't want to have too many. Fix it with urgency.""Related: The CEO of Catholic Prayer and Meditation App Hallow Says Founders Need to Be Part of Something Bigger Than Themselves


Retaining players in the age of the transfer portal ""Look, if you're the CEO of a company, you got to pay your employees, right? Now if they can go somewhere else and make a lot more money, no matter what type of company you're running, they're going to probably leave. So we have to make sure that our players can maximize the opportunities of name, image and likeness. That's important, but what else keeps them at Notre Dame? What else attracts them here? And you've got to believe it's your culture. You've got to believe it's the way they're treated. Do they enjoy being part of your program? That's so important. And that's a message for myself and our other coaches. Let's make sure that as hard as we push them, as demanding as we are, we are not demeaning. We want them to enjoy being a part of this team and all of the opportunities that the University of Notre Dame provides.""Check out more profiles of innovative and impactful leaders by visiting The CEO Series archives.

38,From $0 to $10 Million — Here's How to Build a Winning Prop Trading Team,"Mar 15, 2024",Blake Olson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-build-a-winning-prop-trading-team/470675,"
Some issues in prop trading are the same as those faced in any niche, but some are unique to this constantly evolving segment. When I look at the structure, staff and technology from 12 months ago, my company is almost unrecognizable.Without the right mindset, keeping a handle on growth can be a bit like juggling chainsaws.The pivotal role of technologyTechnology is the lifeblood of the trading industry. By definition, our business only exists online. The rapid evolution of tools and platforms can dramatically alter the landscape overnight. We've seen this firsthand.



Leaders in this sector must exhibit an exceptional degree of technological savvy and an ""anticipatory"" vision to foresee and adapt to these changes. The adoption of new technologies forces a culture of continuous learning and innovation within the team. There is no such thing as the status quo!Team members who are slow to pursue ongoing education, experiment with new tools and dedicate time to strategic thinking don't last long. The desire to adapt is required for growth and competitive advantage.


Related: Earn Through a Recession by Learning Stock Trading StrategiesHarnessing diversityThe global nature of trading today means teams contain a variety of cultural and professional backgrounds. Our current team is spread over five different countries. This diversity, while a tremendous asset, also presents unique leadership challenges.Effective leaders must promote a cohesive team environment where every member feels valued and understood regardless of background and location. Solutions to lessen the ""artificial isolation"" team members from other parts of the world can experience are essential. This involves using technology to facilitate communication across different time zones, fostering an inclusive culture and seeing it as a strength rather than an obstacle.One example is having occasional video conferences that are not business-specific. They allow time for team members to speak freely about their lives, making a connection that business-only video calls don't allow for. You'd be amazed at the personal details that have come out of these calls. Everyone enjoys these moments. (And yes, everyone's camera must be on!)


Invariably, we see innovation and closer collaboration as a welcome result.Balancing the dynamics of contractors and full-time employeesProp trading is no different than every other company out there. Our team faces the ""contractors and full-time employees"" issue. We all know companies that failed to handle this properly and paid dearly.This mix can enrich the team with flexibility and specialized skills. Still, it also requires careful management to ensure everyone is on the same page and working steadily toward the company's goals.During a growth phase, when certain roles expand while others vanish, it's vital to constantly ask the question, ""Is this best handled internally, or will we outgrow this need in 6 months?""


Leaders must integrate these contributors, ensure clear communication and set firm expectations. Verbalizing clear expectations saves a lot of headaches. This issue mirrors the geographic challenge just mentioned. Promoting an environment where contracts feel ""vested"" in the company vision.There's another concept in play here. The principle of ""fire fast, hire slow"". I don't mean this in a purely ruthless sense. But having the readiness to make tough decisions is a spark for growth.Ensure that every member's presence is not just warranted but beneficial for the collective goal. Again, this philosophy is not rooted in a lack of compassion but in a commitment to excellence and the team's long-term success.Upholding integrity as a core valuesThe temptation for quick gains in the prop industry can lead to ethical quandaries with clients and business entities alike. Integrity is non-negotiable.


Bad actors exist in every niche. Unfortunately, prop trading is not immune from this. This makes it even more important for leaders to adhere to the highest ethical standards themselves and to instill these values in their teams.This involves creating a culture where ethical behavior is recognized and rewarded and where team members feel comfortable voicing concerns. Customer service sees different behaviors from clients than the tech team on the back end.As a rule, whenever cash changes hands or profits are on the line, someone will create a way to skirt the rules. By prioritizing integrity, leaders build a team that not only achieves success but also does so respectfully and legally. And in line with the company's long-term vision.Adapting team composition for future challengesThe skill sets and mindsets that contributed to initial successes may not indicate future success. Leaders must be vigilant in assessing the team's capabilities and ready to make adjustments as needed.


This might involve seeking out new talents with specific expertise or redefining roles within the team to better align with strategic goals. The same talent pool that gets a company $0 to $1 million in annual revenue is unlikely to be the one in place from $10 million to $50 million. Spotting ""talent bottlenecks"" is an acquired skill. But it is very necessary.Related: Learn Candlestick Trading: This E-learning Bundle Is $25 This Week OnlyThe art of leading a trading team to successLeading any team to success is an art that requires a blend of strategic foresight, technological proficiency and evolving interpersonal skills.Short version: If I had to pick a trait that pinpoints someone likely to stick with you through growth and challenge, I'd likely go with a desire for continuous learning.


By embracing these principles, leaders can build resilient, adaptable teams capable of sustained growth and even friendship. The journey is demanding, but I've found the rewards of cultivating a high-performing, ethically grounded team immeasurable.

39,63 Small Business Ideas to Start in 2024,"Mar 15, 2024","The Staff of Entrepreneur Media, Inc.",https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/need-a-business-idea-here-are-55/201588,"
Many people dream of starting their own business. Running an enterprise in your home, garage or on the go means you can take more control over your professional goals, set more ambitious financial targets and achieve a more desirable work-life balance.But what if you're ready to start a business but don't know what type of services to provide? You've come to the right place if you need profitable business ideas. Below, find a detailed breakdown of 63 small business ideas — from financial services to physical labor and creative contracting — to help you chart a path forward.Some of these opportunities require more experience or credentials than others. Some can be started from home for cheap, while others require dedicated office space and capital investment. To ensure you choose the right business venture for yourself, it's crucial to consider a few factors before you pursue a sole proprietorship.



How do you determine the best small business idea?Consider your current skill set and credentials.For instance, if you already have a CPA license, venturing out as a freelance accountant (as detailed below) would be a natural avenue to explore. If you have experience as a writer, you might consider editorial services, or if you've spent years working in the food and beverage industry, you could explore catering or becoming a personal chef.As you explore your options, consider if you'll need to secure special licenses (for example, hairstylists and electricians) or if the work requires additional education and credentialing.Determine the goals of your small business.For some people, starting a small business means leaving their full-time gig and committing to the new endeavor. For others, a part-time business provides meaningful supplemental income and can be managed in addition to other work. Consider how much money you're hoping to earn from the business, how many clients or customers you'll need to be profitable and how many hours you'll need to work each week to make it feasible.Think about capital costs, as well as growth: Will launching the business require the purchase of equipment or other serious financial investment? Do you plan to hire employees? Will you expand to multiple locations? At the outset, it's a good idea to create a formal business plan.Study your location and identify what's most feasible there.Finding customers and clients is essential to any small business, so conduct a market analysis before you open shop. For instance, your boat cleaning business will be significantly more successful if you live near a coast, and your side hustle as an interpreter will likely be more profitable if you live in a diverse community.You should also research what businesses already exist. Is there a dearth of dependable landscapers in your market? Is there a glut of professional photographers in your town? Answering these questions will help you determine the viability of your idea.Decide if you want to run a business online or in person.The digital age has created many opportunities for entrepreneurs to run a business from behind a laptop, meaning their enterprise can go wherever they choose. That's not for everyone, though. If you want to run a brick-and-mortar shop at the heart of your community or are more comfortable interacting with customers and clients in person, launch a business that will allow you to achieve those goals.Financial and Business Service Ideas1. Accounting and Tax ServicesExperience, training or licensing may be needed


At some point, most people seek the advice of a good bookkeeper or accountant, whether to prepare for tax season, get advice for starting a business or simply plan for the future. If you're already a Certified Public Accountant, you can earn good money by going out on your own.If you're not already trained as an accountant or licensed by the state you live in, you'll want to explore the recommended educational prerequisites and plan to obtain the appropriate credentials. Most tax preparation franchises offer courses, seminars and training to get you ready to work for them.You'll also want to think about the types of services you'll provide:Do you want to simply do bookkeeping for small businesses?Or do you also want to prepare balance sheets, income statements and other financial reports?Other specializations can include tax accounting — a huge area of potential work.2. Business ConsultingHas expansion possibilitiesWith a consulting business, you can work with a wide range of businesses on a variety of business problems. You could help new entities get off the ground by creating business plans, conducting market research and organizing a management structure.Depending on your level of experience, you could also help large organizations through difficult transitions and periods of restructuring or outline a successful exit strategy by providing executive-level advice and guidance on an array of matters core to the business' mission.A good calendar app will likely come in handy as time-tracking is crucial to accurate billing.3. Financial Planning and AdvisingExperience, training or licensing may be neededFinancial advisors help millions of Americans save for things like retirement and college funds while also helping them grow their wealth through various investments. If your goal is to become a Certified Financial Planner (CFP), you'll have to complete coursework and ultimately pass an exam. This will earn you a certificate that shows potential clients you have expertise and credibility. Once you're certified, working as an independent financial advisor can provide a steady income.


4. Buying a FranchiseSome business experience neededThe benefits of buying a franchise are many: You'll have a proven business model, the market research is already done and the brand typically provides support to franchisees as part of the purchase. Plus, many franchises can be launched for less than $10,000, including:Dream VacationsCruise PlannersJazzercise Inc.To learn more about how to buy and launch a franchise, read Entrepreneur's basics of buying a franchise business.Related: Considering franchise ownership?

Notary Public ServicesExperience, training or licensing may be neededIn most states, a notary public is a state officer who is authorized to witness and attest to the legalities of certain documents by stamping a seal and signing. Most states require that you pass an exam and a background check, but it costs very little to become a notary. You can generate significant income from notary work by charging fees for services such as loan-signing notarizations.Manual Labor Business Ideas6. General ConstructionExperience, training or licensing may be neededIf you have experience working in construction, you may be ready to start your own handyman business and take on projects of your own. From building a fence to hanging drywall or framing an addition, many people need skilled laborers who can do quality work on time.If you have a network of skilled people whose work you trust, you could also subcontract some of the construction and spend more time finding clients and growing your business. Check with your state to determine what permits and licenses you need to get started.7. LandscapingExperience, training or licensing may be needed


Put your green thumb to work. Most people want their yards tidied up in the spring, their lawns mowed in the summer, their leaves removed in the fall, their shrubs trimmed and their trees cared for. Your landscaping business could also offer irrigation services, including the installation and repair of sprinkler lines, as well as blowing them out before winter.Garden work, such as planting annuals and perennials and vegetable garden preparation, can also be a lucrative business. There is plenty to do in the yard that has nothing to do with plants: stone wall restoration, fencing, artificial turf installation and more.Read This: Start Your Own Lawn Care or Landscaping Business by The Staff of Entrepreneur Media and Cheryl Kimball | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble8. House PaintingExperience, training or licensing may be neededRegardless of the season, you can make good money with a residential painting business — inside and out. Before you begin offering services, you'll want to work with professional painters and learn the basics:Masking a houseLaying a drop clothChoosing the appropriate paints and brushes for various indoor and outdoor climatesYou'll also need to invest in some basic equipment — ladders, brushes, trays and more. Once you're set up, you can begin marketing your services to customers through a variety of online platforms with relatively low upfront costs.9. CarpentryExperience, training or licensing may be neededWoodworking is in high demand these days, and if you're a talented carpenter, there are a variety of ways you can make money. Residential projects like cabinets, tables and shelves are often high on homeowners' lists and typically pay well. You can also make good money with boutique projects like gallery frames, hand-carved figurines and other work. In some cases, you can work for general contractors to frame doorways and support larger construction projects.10. Electrical WorkExperience, training or licensing may be neededBecoming an electrician is not easy — you must take classes, work as an apprentice and pass licensing exams before you can start your own business — but there's no shortage of work for electricians. Master electricians are always in demand for small and large projects, and you'll have the ability to hire apprentices, build a team and scale your business offerings.


11. Moving ServicesHas expansion possibilitiesWhen people move, they often want to hire someone to do the heavy lifting for them — literally. You can focus your work on local moves across town or to the town next door. As your business ramps up, you may also offer large-scale, long-distance moving services if you have the personnel and equipment to accommodate it. Advertise around town to convince the locals to let you take care of their move, provide excellent customer service and watch your business grow.Read This: Start Your Own Freelance Writing Business and More by Entrepreneur Press and George Sheldon | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & NobleCreative Work Business Ideas12. Content and Editorial ContractingHas expansion possibilitiesAlmost every business or organization needs good writers and editors, and if you have the skills to go out on your own, you'll likely find a bevy of work. From copyediting to developmental editing, ghostwriting and digital content production, freelance writers and editors can find clients in a host of industries, including marketing, communications, journalism and book publishing. To get started, you'll need to create a portfolio of work that exemplifies your skills for writing, content creation and/or editing–this will help you build relationships with potential clients.13. Graphic DesignExperience, training or licensing may be neededHave an eye for design? Logos, fliers, newsletters, information sheets and advertisements are just a few of the types of design materials that businesses hire independent designers to create for them. Websites and online advertising need graphic design services as well. You can offer clients a suite of services to take their project from beginning to end, including coordinating with content creators and print shops and getting products ready to mail and present.Read This: Start Your Own Graphic Design Business by Entrepreneur Press and George Sheldon | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble14. Web DevelopmentExperience, training or licensing may be neededMany in-person and online courses exist to teach you the language of coding and website creation. With some specialized training, you can master the basics of building a website from scratch — a service you can offer to many small businesses, whether they're looking for an ecommerce platform or just a landing page to describe their services. You may also find clients who will hire you to not only design their website but manage their online presence on a day-to-day basis.


15. Marketing or Public Relations AgencyHas expansion possibilitiesEvery business has a story to tell, but not everyone has the know-how to get their message into the world. With your marketing or public relations agency, you can help businesses identify new audiences, craft messages that resonate with new customers and produce newsletters and other products — potentially winning the media's interest along the way. You'll want experience working in this field before you set out on your own, as potential clients will want to hire someone who understands the world of marketing and public relations.Read This: Start Your Own Consulting Business by Entrepreneur Press and Eileen F. Sandlin | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble16. PhotographyExperience, training or licensing may be neededIndependent photographers can run successful businesses with one or more specialties. You can offer:Portraits or senior picturesWedding photographyEditorial shots for newspapers or magazinesTo get your photography business off the ground, you'll want to create an online portfolio of your work so potential clients can see your style and inquire with you. Being active on social media platforms is also a great strategy for growing your brand.Read This: Start Your Own Photography Business by Entrepreneur Press and Charlene Davis | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble17. VideographyExperience, training or licensing may be neededIf you can do quality work behind a camera and edit footage well, there are plenty of opportunities for videography work, from creating brand videos for organizations to filming events, weddings and interviews. Your clients could include outdoor brands, small nonprofits and big corporations, but you'll want to have some filming and editing training and experience creating quality content before you launch your business.18. Audio EditingExperience, training or licensing may be needed


Audio storytelling is a growing industry, with countless podcasts being streamed daily by listeners all over the world. If you have experience recording and editing audio, you could shop your services to media brands, businesses or individuals who might want to launch their own podcasts. And who knows? Maybe you can use your skills to launch and monetize a podcast of your own.19. Social Media ManagementSome experience neededAlthough many businesses want to enhance their social media presence, they often don't have the skills or internal bandwidth to grow their following and post engaging content.If you're skilled at brainstorming content plans and writing snappy copy — and you already spend many hours on social media — it might be worth launching your own social media marketing enterprise. Clients might have you create a content marketing plan, monitor and reply to comments and report growth statistics monthly.20. ArtHas expansion possibilitiesIf making art is already your hobby, you might be able to turn it into a profitable business. You can sell your work on sites like Etsy, enter your work in shows or ink contracts with clients who need illustrators or custom art as part of their brand assets. Other potential art business offerings include creating portraits, painting murals and teaching art classes.21. Music LessonsExperience, training or licensing may be neededTurn down the volume and listen up: Your music skills could be in high demand. There are a few ways to approach running your own music business. You can be mobile and teach in your clients' homes or run it out of your own space (a separate building or designated area of your home).Some people teach music lessons online by recording lessons on YouTube and offering subscriptions. To get started, try connecting with local music schools for part-time gigs. This will allow you to see if you like it and help you build a reputation with potential clients.Related: 10 Essential Tips For a Long and Lucrative Music Career


Repair and Maintenance Business Ideas22. Mechanic ShopExperience, training or licensing may be neededIf you've spent years working on your vehicles and know your way around an engine, it could be time to offer your services to customers. Depending on where you live, you may not need to obtain a mechanics license, but taking some formal classes and earning a certification will help build trust with customers.Many shops require licensing before hiring mechanics, so if you're looking to get some experience before launching your own business, you'll likely want to take some classes.23. Appliance RepairExperience, training or licensing may be neededEvery household has several appliances — from refrigerators to dishwashers to dryers — and appliances tend to break down, so appliance repair is one of the best business ideas for any area. You can work on your own or contract with appliance stores to cover their warranty service calls — or some of each.Start slow and build your customer base on recommendations and referrals from work well done. You could also develop relationships with contractors to be the go-to person to install appliances in newly constructed houses.24. Bicycle RepairSome experience neededAlmost every bike needs a good tune-up. This business tends to be seasonal in many parts of the country, but you can find ways around that. If you have the space, you could offer to store people's bicycles during the winter after you do a tune-up and any needed repairs on them.And if you keep Saturday shop hours, you could make your shop a meeting place for cycling enthusiasts. If you live in a bike-oriented place, you may be able to purchase and sell used bikes, making some money as a retailer on top of your repair business.25. Boat CleaningExperience, training or licensing may be needed


Boats hauled out of the water for the winter or even just for mid-season repairs will need their hulls cleaned. Depending on the type of boat, it might also be time for a major cleaning of everything else—the decks, the sleeping quarters, the head and the holds.Start by advertising on Nextdoor, Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace, reaching out to homes with boats sitting in their yard, or marketing your services to a local marina.26. Car Cleaning & DetailingHas expansion possibilitiesMaking a car shine inside and out isn't easy work, which is why many people don't want to do it themselves. Plus, because drive-thru car washes don't clean every corner, there's a market for car cleaning and detailing across the country. With a little investment in materials (soaps, scrubs, hoses, vacuums, etc.), you could make house calls or rent a garage space where customers can drop off their vehicles.27. Electronics RepairExperience, training or licensing may be neededWhether it's a laptop, a television, a tablet or a specialized radio, if you're handy with circuit boards, you could run a profitable business for customers whose electronics are on the fritz. You'll want to run the business out of your home or a storefront so people can bring equipment directly to you. Not unlike other repair shops, your business may evolve to the point where you're buying used electronics and selling them to your customers.28. Furniture RestorationExperience, training or licensing may be neededIf you have a knack for sewing and woodwork, upholstery and restoration might be a natural business idea. Many books and online videos can be helpful as you learn the trade, but nothing will be as helpful as finding some discarded furniture and tearing it apart before restuffing and constructing it.Often, furniture in need of upholstering will also require repairs—sanding, staining, or reinforcing damaged areas. Much of this work is relatively minor (you don't have to be a carpenter) and can add significant upsell value to your services.Read This: Spruce: A Step-by-Step Guide to Upholstery and Design by Amanda Brown |Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble


29. Rug CleaningExperience, training or licensing may be neededMost people don't have the time or space to do more for their rugs than a basic vacuum. As a rug cleaner, you will need to learn how to work with all kinds of carpet fabrics, from synthetic to wool. You should also decide whether you will take on valuable antique rugs and family heirlooms. If you do, you should consider getting specialized training in handling and properly cleaning these carpets.Learn how to get tough stains and odors out of carpets — such as dog and cat odors — and customers will seek your services out. You'll need a dedicated space for people to drop off their rugs, so plan for that as you set up your business.30. Jewelry Making and RepairExperience, training or licensing may be neededThere are many different ways of getting into the jewelry business and different types of materials you can work with. Manipulating metal will require specific tools since you need to heat the metal and use tools to cut and engrave, but you'll likely also work with glass, gemstones, and maybe even wood. The wider the variety of materials you can work with, , the broader the range of repair services you can provide to your customers, including stone polishing and setting.Read This: Start Your Own Fashion Accessories Business by Entrepreneur Press and Eileen F. Sandlin | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & NobleProperty and Real Estate Business Ideas31. Real EstateExperience, training or licensing may be neededEvery community needs trusted real estate agents. Whether your clients are buying or selling property — or just seeking real estate advice — there are many opportunities to launch your own business. But, first, you'll need to become a licensed agent, and the requirements vary by state. Typically, you'll have to complete coursework and pass an exam. Once you've done that, you can start offering services and building your business from scratch.32. Property ManagementExperience, training or licensing may be neededMany people manage properties as a side hustle. Maybe you have a vacation home that you use for short-term rentals or perhaps you have an additional property with a long-term lease. If you want to dive in full-time, you can acquire multiple properties and be a full-time landlord. In the case of rental units, your job will be to make sure the property is running smoothly, ensure tenants are paying rent and honoring their lease terms, and be available in case of any issues. You can also contract with individual property owners to serve as their property manager, lightening their load by taking care of the landlord duties for them.


33. Cleaning ServiceNo experience neededThere are many directions you can take this small business idea. If you want to work during hours when no one else does, you can focus your cleaning business on office clients. You can provide cleaning services to retail businesses and keep your customers within one or two blocks. Restaurants need daily thorough cleaning and can also be a great source of steady clients. But, if you're more interested in house cleaning, you can start with a small number of clients, and new customers will likely emerge via word of mouth.Read This: Start Your Own Cleaning Service by Entrepreneur Press and Jacquelyn Lynn |Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble34. Professional OrganizingHas expansion possibilitiesSpatial planning is not everyone's strength. If it's yours, you can make good money as a professional organizer for individuals and businesses. For individuals, you can choose either to do the organizing work — maybe a kids' playroom or a cluttered garage — or consult with the homeowner to help them better organize themselves.Businesses, too, don't always know how to organize their office and maximize the efficiency of their spaces. You can consult on ways to better arrange furniture, desks, conference areas, stockrooms and more.35. Home InspectionExperience, training or licensing may be neededTo be a successful inspector, first establish contacts with real estate agents who can recommend your services to customers. Home inspection can be an incredibly competitive market so you will need to constantly update your education and knowledge. For instance, Builders are constantly introducing new materials. If you only know about wood decks, you will not know how to inspect and assess the new materials on the market, such as composites that look like real wood. Also, stay apprised of all safety updates regarding materials and problems with things like off-gassing, carbon monoxide production and other chemical hazards.Read This: Start Your Own Home Inspection Service by Entrepreneur Press | Amazon |eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble36. Home Energy AuditingExperience, training or licensing may be neededHomeowners are always looking for ways to save on their utility bills. With some specialized training, you can help by conducting an audit of their homes and calculating how much they might save on heating, cooling and electrical use by implementing new technology or upgraded appliances.To grow your business, you can work directly with vendors to refer upgrades or gain a certification and learn how to do electrical work like installing solar panels and heat pumps yourself.Read This: Toward a Zero Energy Home: A Complete Guide to Energy Self-Sufficiency at Home by David Johnston and Scott Gibson | Amazon | Barnes & Noble37. Interior Decorating and DesignExperience, training or licensing may be neededIf you have an eye for design, market your interior decorating talents to building contractors. People purchasing new homes can often be overwhelmed with choices and possibilities. Create questionnaires for each major element and room in the house:How will the homeowner use the home?Are there children?Pets?Depending on how involved your client wants to be, you can also help them purchase furniture, art, plants and more. You can also work with businesses, such as hotels and restaurants, to design their spaces.Planning, Training and Coaching Business Ideas38. Event PlanningHas expansion possibilitiesThere are a variety of ways to launch an event-planning business, particularly if you have a professional background in planning large gatherings. First, you'll want to hone in on your niche, some of which include:Private parties at people's homesKids birthday partiesCorporate eventsIf you work with businesses, you must visit every potential event location you plan to work with. Tour each site and learn what's available, including capacity, AV equipment, chairs and tables and more. If you can nail a big party as an event planner, new clients will seek you out.Read This: Start Your Own Event Planning Business by The Staff at Entrepreneur Media and Cheryl Kimball | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble39. Wedding PlanningExperience, training or licensing may be neededYou will need to be up-to-date on wedding trends, dress styles, popular colors — and almost every other facet of the wedding industry. Offer your customers an à la carte menu of services, from helping them choose flowers, a wedding gown and bridesmaid dresses to picking the venue and hiring the caterer.Before you open your business, visit area wedding shops and see what kinds of services they provide. Wedding planners need to know every business detail to assure couples that they are in the right hands.40. Vacation PlanningExperience, training or licensing may be neededSome people take great joy in planning their vacations. However, if you're an experienced traveler and know how to save people money, you can still be very much in demand as a vacation planner for individuals or large groups. You can coordinate hotel and flight bookings, arrange transportation, provide daily itineraries and help your clients re-book in case of unforeseen travel crises. There's typically no required certification for this work, but there are courses you can take that will put you and your clients at ease.41. Private CoachingExperience, training or licensing may be neededActive children and adults alike often seek athletic instruction beyond what they've learned in group formats. If you're highly skilled in an athletic discipline, you can help take athletes to the next level.Common business options include:GolfTennisRunningBaseball pitchingSoccerIn terms of qualifications, you should already have some coaching experience and be able to offer high-level instruction. Depending on the community where you're coaching, you may need to have a license to run your business or a certification to use public amenities, like tennis courts, for profit.42. Personal TrainingExperience, training or licensing may be neededMany people are looking to improve their overall fitness, and working with a personal trainer is one way to achieve their goals. To get started, you'll need to obtain a certification — especially if you're working with a gym — which will help your clients trust that you know what you're doing and can help them avoid injury. You can advertise your business at gyms and other public places, and having a strong social media and web presence is always helpful.43. Nutritional AdvisingExperience, training or licensing may be neededWith so many different dieting trends and supplements in the world, a nutritionist can help people better understand the landscape of healthy eating and living. Although nutritionists don't offer medical nutritional counseling or treat illnesses (as a dietitian does), there is still a wide market for the work.First, determine what kind of nutrition service you want to provide — pediatric, sports, holistic or something else — and then work toward credentialing. At a minimum, you'll need to research the laws for becoming certified in your state and begin taking prerequisite courses to help you become licensed.44. Life CoachingExperience, training or licensing may be neededLife coaching has exploded in popularity over the past decade, as many people are looking to recreate or realign their personal goals. Life coaches do not provide clinical mental healthcare (a therapist does), but they help people create and use tools to move closer to their ultimate goals. To become a life coach, you'll first want to determine what kind of client you're looking for:People with professional hurdles to clearFolks struggling with romantic endeavorsBusy entrepreneurs looking to reclaim work/life balanceYou don't technically need certification, though many practitioners take courses and have credentials.45. Career CoachingExperience, training or licensing may be neededCareer coaches help people navigate professional transitions, establish business goals and make the most of their skills. As a career coach, you might help people write cover letters and resumes, find new opportunities, establish business plans and success strategies or hone their niche in a crowded market.Your background and specialty will determine what clientele you should work with:Recent graduatesPeople looking to start second careersSomeone who has been out of the workforce for yearsAlthough there is no standard license or certification, many career coaches have earned credentials or successful careers of their own.46. TutoringExperience, training or licensing may be neededIf you have a background in education, you can make significant supplemental income — or launch a full-fledged business — by offering tutoring services. Start by choosing the subject area that best fits your strengths. For instance, if you're a professional writer or English teacher, you could offer essay writing help. If you're skilled in math and sciences, you could help high schoolers with algebra or precalculus.You don't have to be a licensed teacher to offer tutoring services, but being a subject matter expert will make it easier to sell your services to potential customers.Hospitality Business Ideas47. Private Chef ServiceExperience, training or licensing may be neededIf you have experience working in restaurants or other areas of the food and beverage industry, you could tap into the growing private chef market. Whether potential customers are looking to accommodate specific dietary needs or an intimate event with friends, a positive experience should lead to client testimonials and referrals to help you grow your business.You'll want to make sure you have proper training — either via work experience or formal courses — because your reputation is on the line with every dish you create.48. Bed and Breakfast / AirbnbNo experience neededDo you have a room that has its own bathroom and is private from the rest of the living space? Or do you own a property that could function as a small lodging establishment near a tourist area, sports stadium or large venue? Maybe you own a charming home in the country. If so, turn your property into a bed and breakfast or Airbnb rental and welcome guests into a home away from home.Read This: Start Your Own Bed and Breakfast by Entrepreneur Press and Cheryl Kimball | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble49. CateringExperience, training or licensing may be neededAre you experienced with managing large-scale food operations? Consider branching out into catering to serve large events like weddings and corporate banquets. You'll need to make sure you have strong project- and personnel-management skills, because catering requires you to lead a team and deliver exceptional service for clients. You'll also need to obtain the proper licensing from the state in which you operate, similar to the requirements for opening a restaurant.50. Food TruckExperience, training or licensing may be neededDo you want to deliver a specific type of cuisine to the masses without running an entire restaurant? Build (or purchase) a food truck and take your product on the go. You'll have to obtain appropriate operating licenses, but once you've checked those boxes, you can start working at festivals, breweries and other community events. As your reputation grows, you'll likely book business by word-of-mouth.51. BreweryExperience, training or licensing may be neededHave you always wanted to run your own brewery? Maybe you've already been experimenting with brewing at home.? If so, opening a brewery could be an option. But first, you'll want to pursue training in brewing sciences and work as an apprentice to someone who knows the craft well. From there, you'll need to conduct a competitive market analysis to make sure there's room for another brewery in your area.Other Small Business Ideas52. Dog WalkingHas expansion possibilitiesIf you have a flexible schedule and can make multiple house calls, you can generate significant revenue as a dog walker. Dog walkers take pooches out for their daily constitutional one or more times a day, individually or in small groups.In some cities, like New York, dog walking alone can be a booming business. But, it's more common for dog walkers to offer additional services, including playing with and feeding pets, bringing in newspapers and mail and turning lights on and off.Read This: Start Your Own Pet Business and More by Entrepreneur Press and Eileen F. Sandlin | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble53. Pet Sitting or BoardingExperience, training or licensing may be neededMost people leave behind their pets when they travel. Although big daycare shelters exist, you can make decent money by offering a more personal pet-sitting service — either by staying at someone's house while they're out of town or by hosting their animal at your place.Starting a pet-sitting service requires almost nothing in startup costs. Your list of credentials should probably include personal pet ownership — if not currently, at least in the past — and other pet-related experience, including referrals from pet owners whose pets you have taken care of before.Read This: Start Your Own Pet Sitting Business and More by Entrepreneur Press and Cheryl Kimball | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble54. Pet GroomingExperience, training or licensing may be neededMost animals need a bath or fresh cut from time to time. Most pet owners aren't equipped to do a full grooming themselves. This means there's a target market for professional groomers who do house calls or have a space where people can drop their pets for a few hours.There are no required certifications, but most groomers begin by taking courses, which are widely available in most states.55. At-Home DaycareExperience, training or licensing may be neededChildcare needs continue to soar in the United States, and many people prefer for their child to be cared for in a home environment as opposed to a more institutional setting. These factors make the market ripe for a home-based childcare business. The regulations for a home-based child care vary by state, so you'll need to pursue appropriate certifications and training depending on where you live.Read This: Start Your Own Child-Care Service by The Staff of Entrepreneur Media and Jacquelyn Lynn | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble56. Making Gift BasketsHas expansion possibilitiesFinding a niche is the best way to start out in the gift basket business. Are you a dog-lover, horse enthusiast or exercise guru who could put together baskets that hold the things that people with this interest would like?Do you already create a product that a gift basket could be built around?You could create custom, place-based gift baskets that could be shipped across the country or sold in a local store, or you can collaborate with local makers to get your business idea off the ground.57. Hair Styling / Barber ShopExperience, training or licensing may be neededStyling hair or working as a barber is a popular business idea that can be lucrative if you have the right skills and online presence. Typically, a home-based hairstylist business or barber shop would be started by someone with a cosmetology career who wants to go out on their own. If you don't have experience, you can take courses and sharpen your skills by working in someone else's shop. You'll need to obtain the appropriate licenses before you can launch your own business.58. Nail TechnicianExperience, training or licensing may be neededIf you'd like to offer professional nail styling to clients, most states require that you complete cosmetology school — the number of hours varies depending on where you live. It can be smart to work with someone else before opening your own shop so you learn the skills and techniques you need to be successful.Once you've completed these steps, you can run your own small business from home or a dedicated storefront.59. Massage TherapistExperience, training or licensing may be neededMassage therapy can be a successful business, but you must have the proper education and training to not cause injury to your clients. At a minimum, you will want to become certified, which will help you practice safely and ultimately market your qualifications.Certification courses cover not only human anatomy and physiology and the ways massage affects both, but also how to establish your own successful massage business.60. Storage FacilityHas expansion possibilitiesPeople tend to acquire more things than they can reasonably store in their homes. If you have land, you could make meaningful income by storing large items like recreational vehicles, boats, trailers and campers. Or, if you want to dive deeper into the self-storage business, you could consider opening a storage facility, which would require an increase in overhead costs, appropriate licensing and market analysis.61. Independent Car Service / Ride-Sharing DriverDriving experience neededIf you drive for companies like Uber and Lyft, you lose a percentage of your wage to the company. However, there are still market demands for private drivers. If you have a reliable vehicle — or can afford to manage a fleet and other drivers — you can cater to high-end clients not interested in using ride-share apps for their transportation needs.Newer peer-to-peer car rental services like Turo (think Airbnb for cars) also allow potential business owners to rent out their vehicles to generate incremental income when not in use.62. Online Reselling BusinessNo experience neededDo you have items lurking around your household that you could sell? Or are you scouring Craigslist, eBay, Facebook Marketplace and thrift stores for deals on items you could flip?Here's a relatively straightforward online business idea: Auction or sell the items you find on one of online marketplaces.Reselling products online can provide a major source of supplemental income, especially if you're willing to refurbish items and sell them at a higher rate. Anyone can get into this type of business as long as they're willing to hustle.63. Interpreting or Translating ServicesExperience, training or licensing may be neededIn communities with international populations, dependable interpreters and translators are extremely valuable. If you already speak multiple languages, you could earn extra income as an interpreter if you pursue a certification, which typically involves about 40 hours of training.From there, you can determine what type of translation service clients you're seeking: business professionals, government officials, folks who need documents translated and more.How to Get StartedAddressing these foundational ""business checklist"" elements early on can set a strong course for growth and operational efficiency for your entrepreneurial endeavor.1. Create a Business PlanCreate a detailed business plan outlining your business goals, strategies for achieving them, market analysis, operational structure and financial projections. This document is crucial for guiding your strategy and securing business loans.2. Decide on Legal StructureChoose the appropriate legal structure for your business (e.g., sole proprietorship, LLC, partnership, corporation), and register your business according to local laws.Your chosen business structure affects your taxes, liability and business operations, so consult an attorney and a certified accountant before finalizing your decision.3. Keep Finances SeparateSet up a robust system for managing your finances, including budgeting, bookkeeping and financial forecasting. Consider your startup costs, ongoing expenses and how you will fund your business idea.Keeping personal and business finances separate is also highly advisable.Open a business bank account and use it for all business-related transactions.Obtain a business credit card for company expenses.Pay yourself a salary from your business account, which then goes into your personal account, rather than directly using business funds for personal expenses.Keep all receipts and document all financial transactions meticulously.4. Plan Operational NeedsOutline your business' operational needs, including staffing, location, equipment, technology and software needs. Consider how you will efficiently manage the production of goods or delivery of services.5. Develop a Brand and Marketing StrategyIf through social media platforms, affiliate marketing or search engine optimization, consider how you will establish a strong brand identity and develop a marketing plan to reach your target audience.This should include your branding elements (logo, color scheme) and your strategies for content creation, promotion and advertising.6. Operate Within the LawEnsure you know and comply with all relevant city and state laws, regulations and industry standards. This includes obtaining necessary licenses and permits, understanding labor laws if hiring employees and ensuring data protection and privacy.7. Build a Support NetworkSupport networks can provide invaluable advice, feedback and connections. Build a network of mentors, advisors and fellow entrepreneurs.This network might be close friends, former colleagues or paid mastermind groups.

    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

""I didn't see myself reflected in the fragrance industry,"" says Brianna Arps, founder and CEO of MOODEAUX, on why she decided to start building her business back in 2017. ""I remember watching these commercials with a half naked man running across beaches and other advertising gimmicks that didn't always make sense.""Arps started her career as an investigative journalist covering beauty, fashion and lifestyle beats. In 2018, she found out she was let go when she opened her company laptop to discover her email access had been revoked. ""The pressure to make a name for myself in this industry had consumed me for years,"" says Arps. ""I didn't realize that my self-worth became tightly entangled with my career until it was too late.""She recalls the panicked train ride back to her apartment on the day of her layoff. The panic evolved into depression, which worsened the longer she spent unemployed. She credits her self-care rituals — finding comfort and healing with fragrance — which helped her through this difficult time and also became the moment MOODEAUX was born.



""The layoff redirected me to what I was meant to do next, and that was to build MOODEAUX,"" Arps says. ""And of course I had doubts along the way. What qualifies me to build and run a business? I had to quiet that inner critic and say, 'I am going to qualify myself to do this and build this.'""For Arps, buying and wearing fragrances has always been an affirming act that brings joy, excitement and comfort with each spritz. MOODEAUX leans into educating consumers and creating scents to help ""flaunt how you feel."" As a child, Arps recalls trying all the fragrances her mother and grandmother had on their dressers. ""I've been into fragrance since forever thanks to the most important and best-smelling women I know: my mom, Cynthia, and my late grandma, Minnie. They took tremendous pride in creating routines centered around their entire well-being.""

Understand that small mistakes can lead to big setbacks in the future""MOODEAUX wasn't always our company name. It used to be 'Moode Beaute,' until my previous trademark attorney shared some bad news,"" says Arps. ""When we went to file for registration in late 2019, she discovered another entity with similar spelling had beaten us to the punch by a mere few days. I cried like a baby — primarily because, by that point, I spent thousands of dollars on branding we could never use.""


Arps continued to spend more time brainstorming and working with her trademark attorney, before finally settling on the name MOODEAUX. It was an important reminder for her to not neglect the legal matters of your business. She reminds founders to make sure you can claim trademark rights by filing for them in a timely manner, and hiring a trademark attorney with expertise you may not have. ""Small mistakes or oversights, like not trademarking your name early on, can lead to big setbacks and challenges in the future if you're not careful.""2. Get comfortable receiving lots of no's, the yes will come""Be prepared to get more no's than the yes you are waiting for,"" Arps says. ""Out of hundreds of conversations, meetings and applications on the road to get more funding for MOODEAUX, I received about 10 yeses."" Arps encourages founders to build up their internal fortitude, lean on patience and persistence, and prepare for the potentially long road ahead. She also acknowledges that most women of color have to work harder than their peers to get that yes. And each no helped her to reflect and redirect her energies to reaching out to individuals who would believe in her, celebrate her and support her vision for MOODEAUX.""I would meet with venture capital funds who would say no for now, and say, 'Come back to us when you launch in this retailer, then we will invest,'"" Arps says. ""Then we would launch in that retailer, then they would say, 'Okay, come back again when you hit your sales target.' The goalpost they set kept changing, moving again and again. It was like I would never be good enough for them, and I had to work hard not to internalize that.""Related: This Black Founder Was Gaslit By Her Doctor During Pregnancy. The Experience Drove Her to Create a Community for Expectant Moms.


3. Expand your thinking when it comes to fundingArps reminds founders that there are so many different ways to fund and scale your business. While traditional venture capital funds were impressed with the trajectory of MOODEAUX, some weren't convinced. ""I was tired of feeling like I was on that hamster wheel, and needed to think about different ways to fund the business,"" Arps says. ""I didn't need that splashy press release to say we were working with some big fund, I needed cash to scale. I needed money in the bank.""Arps focused on raising money in an unconventional way: through accelerators and competitions where grants are given out. ""Accelerators are a great way to also learn and help you level up your business,"" Arps says. ""You not only get a cash infusion but you are also learning. When you are finished, you are undeniable."" She also encourages founders to consider a small bank loan and to not be ashamed or afraid to ask friends and family to invest in your business.""I don't feel inclined to chase that fancy headline and that spotlight,"" says Arps. ""I'm always going to go where I am celebrated, where people embrace Black ambition and understand the trajectory of MOODEAUX, plus our ability to bring forth positive change within the fragrance industry.""

41,Struggling to Get a Bank Loan for Your Small Business? Try This Flexible Financing Option Instead.,"Mar 13, 2024",Joseph Camberato,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/cant-get-a-bank-loan-for-your-small-business-try-this/470462,"
Increasingly, small businesses are turning to private credit to fund business expansions or ongoing operational costs. Private credit accounted for roughly 30% of the credit market in 2021, growing from $400 billion in assets to over $1 trillion since 2012.This type of financing usually comes with flexible terms, customized solutions and fast access to capital. So, if your company needs funding but you don't want to apply for a traditional bank loan, here's how private credit works and how you can access it.Related: How Alternative Funding Solutions Can Help Your Business Navigate The Ongoing Financial Storm



What is private credit?The term private credit usually refers to non-bank loans issued to businesses — peer-to-peer lenders, online lenders and financing marketplaces are all examples of this. This financing option has been especially helpful for small businesses recently, considering banks aren't lending to businesses due to market conditions and their notorious risk-averse behavior.Private credit gives companies access to various short-term and long-term financing options. Your company can then use this financing to fund startup costs, a business expansion or working capital.


Benefits of private creditHere are the biggest benefits of private credit for small businesses:Fast access to capital: When you apply for a bank loan, the application process can take weeks to months to process. In comparison, loans from non-bank lenders typically take less than a week. Some lenders even offer same-day financing. This is a huge advantage for businesses that need to act quickly on a business opportunity.Flexible financing: Private credit is also more flexible when it comes to the collateral requirements and repayment terms.High approval rate: Banks prefer lending to larger, more established companies. Non-bank loans have a much higher rate of approval for small and medium-sized businesses.Custom solutions: Since non-bank lenders have experience working with small businesses, they can provide custom financing solutions to meet your company's needs. For example, some lenders offer asset-based financing where the loan is secured by the company's assets.Related: This Non-Traditional Financing Solution Lends Money to People Rejected By BanksHow small businesses can access private creditHere are the steps you'll take to evaluate your situation, find the right lender and successfully access financing.Determine your needs:Start by determining why you need financing and what you plan to use the funds for. For example, are you taking out a loan to cover daily expenses, like payroll or inventory? Or do you want to purchase new equipment to increase your production or improve efficiency?


Evaluating your current and future lending needs will help you determine the type of financing you're looking for. For example, if you have a good idea of how much you're looking to spend, taking out a loan might make sense. But if you're unsure how much money you'll need, you may want to opt for a line of credit.Prepare the necessary documentsIt's a good idea to gather the necessary paperwork before applying for private credit. The specific requirements will vary depending on your lenders, but most will want to see the following information:Business information: Not all lenders require a business plan, but you'll have to provide some basic information about your business. At the very least, you'll need to provide your company's name, address and employer identification number (EIN).Financial statements: You'll also need to provide financial statements like a profit and loss statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement. This information helps your lender understand the financial health of your business.Tax returns: Most lenders will want to see at least one year of personal and business tax returns. Tax returns help your lender evaluate your financial situation and your ability to repay the loan.Bank statements: You'll also need to provide at least six months of bank statements.Business documents: Your lender will also want to see your business's articles of incorporation and any relevant business licenses.Compare your offersIt's always a good idea to get pre-approved with several different lenders before selecting the one you want to go with. Applying with a minimum of three different lenders lets you compare the potential interest rates, fees and repayment terms. It also gives you more negotiation power because you're not putting yourself in a situation where you have to take the first offer that comes your way.


Of course, submitting multiple loan applications can become tedious and take up quite a bit of your time. If you need a quicker solution, consider using an online lending marketplace. When you use a lending marketplace, you'll apply once and receive offers from multiple lenders.Related: 4 Reasons Small Businesses Need Nonbank Lenders More Than EverIf you're looking for alternatives to bank loans, private credit is an excellent option. These loans are more accessible and give your company the resources it needs to continue growing.When you take out private credit, you may gain access to support that goes beyond the application process. But it's important to look for the right non-bank lenders. National Business Capital has been working in private credit for 15 years; We're already an expert in this market.

42,"If You Want to be Successful, Become a Better Speaker — Follow This 7-Step Process for Effective Speaking","Mar 13, 2024",Scott Deming,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-be-an-better-communicator-in-7-steps/470597,"
Back in the late 1980s, when I was in the early stages of establishing my advertising agency, an invitation came my way to speak at a Chamber of Commerce event in Upstate New York. I turned it down. At that moment, the idea of declining might have seemed counterintuitive, especially given my aspirations to grow my business.The reason? I was afraid. Fear held me back from seizing an opportunity that could have propelled my agency forward. Not long after that failed opportunity, a pivotal moment arrived during a staff meeting. A few days after the meeting, my Art Director approached me with feedback that was both unsettling and enlightening. He said that everyone had been confused about a particular topic I had discussed, yet no one felt comfortable confronting me about it.This incident served as a wake-up call, prompting me to confront my fears and recognize the crucial role effective communication plays in business success. It was clear that if I intended to thrive as a businessperson, especially in a leadership role, mastering the art of public speaking was not just an option — it was a necessity.



Fast forward to today, forty years later. I started and ran a very successful advertising agency for nearly twenty years. I have been speaking and training globally for over twenty years. I can say with 100% certainty that focusing on better presentation skills after that feedback from my employee was the most important career decision I've ever made.Related: The Complete, 20-Step Guide to Ace Public Speaking


You don't have to be a professional speaker to speak like a professionalThroughout my career, I've had the distinct privilege of coaching aspiring professional speakers as well as numerous executives, guiding them toward becoming not just better communicators but compelling presenters. Whether it's delivering a critical pitch to board members, leading a staff meeting, or captivating an audience at industry conferences, the power to communicate with both passion and precision is paramount. And by precision, I mean far more than just covering bullet points. It's about hitting those crucial, emotionally charged points that truly connect with your audience.Related: What is a Keynote Speaker and Why Are They Important?Improving presentation skills is an ongoing process that can significantly enhance a leader's effectiveness and ability to achieve organizational objectives. Here are seven steps to becoming a better presenter and a more effective communicator.Understand your audience: Begin by researching and understanding your audience. What are their interests, challenges, and expectations? Tailoring your message to the audience's needs and perspectives increases engagement and impact.Master your content: Know your material inside and out. This doesn't mean memorizing your presentation word for word but being comfortable with the content so you can adapt on the fly, answer questions, and engage in meaningful dialogue.Practice relentlessly: If possible, practice your presentation multiple times in various settings. This can include practicing in front of a mirror, with a trusted friend or colleague, or recording yourself to review your performance. The goal is to become comfortable with your delivery and refine your pacing, tone, and body language.Engage with storytelling: Incorporate storytelling into your presentations. Stories are powerful tools for making complex information understandable and memorable. Use personal anecdotes or hypothetical scenarios that resonate with your audience's experiences.Hone your nonverbal communication: Pay attention to your body language, eye contact, and use of space. Nonverbal cues can reinforce your message or, if not managed well, distract from it. Ensure your posture is confident, your gestures are purposeful, and you maintain eye contact with your audience to build a connection.Manage nervous energy: Learn techniques to manage anxiety and nervous energy. This can include deep breathing exercises, positive visualization, or a pre-presentation routine that helps you center yourself. Recognize that some nervousness is natural and can be channeled into dynamic energy that enhances your presentation.Seek feedback and continuously improve: After each presentation, seek constructive feedback from peers, mentors, or audience members. Reflect on what worked well and what could be improved. Consider working with a coach or joining organizations like Toastmasters International to gain insights and practice in a supportive environment.By following these steps and committing to continuous improvement, you'll become a better speaker or presenter and a more effective communicator, capable of inspiring and leading others with confidence and clarity.


Related: 10 Public Speaking Hacks I Learned From My TED TalkRemember, effective public speaking is essential in leadership — it's not just a skill. It's a necessity. Now, let's delve into the key benefits of mastering presentation skills for any leader.Influence and persuasion: Effective presentation skills enable leaders to influence their audience's attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Persuasive presentations can motivate teams, sway stakeholders, and drive organizational change. A leader who is a compelling presenter can better advocate for their vision, inspire action and garner support for initiatives.Clarity and direction: Leaders often need to communicate complex information, strategies, and visions to a diverse audience. Being a better presenter helps ensure that messages are delivered clearly and concisely, reducing misunderstandings and aligning the team with organizational goals. Clear presentations help demystify complex issues and provide a roadmap for what needs to be done.Credibility and trust: Presentation skills are directly tied to a leader's credibility. Leaders who present confidently and effectively are more likely to be perceived as knowledgeable and competent. This perception builds trust within the team and among stakeholders, which is essential for effective leadership and collaboration.Engagement and inspiration: Dynamic presentation skills help leaders engage their audience emotionally and intellectually. By being a better presenter, a leader can connect with their audience on a personal level, fostering a sense of community and shared purpose. This engagement is crucial for inspiring teams and driving them to embrace challenges and achieve goals.Adaptability and impact: Leaders must be able to tailor presentations to different audiences and situations. Effective presenters can adjust their message, tone, and delivery to suit the situation, whether they're motivating a team, pitching to investors, or speaking at a large conference. This adaptability maximizes the impact of their communication, ensuring that their messages resonate broadly and drive desired outcomes.In conclusion, becoming an exceptional presenter is a personal and professional evolution, marking a leader's commitment to excellence and influence. It's a path that amplifies a leader's effectiveness and elevates the entire organization. For leaders aiming to leave a lasting imprint on their teams, stakeholders, and industry, refining presentation skills is not just a strategy — it's a mission. As we've seen, the benefits are clear, transformative, and within reach for those ready to embrace the challenge and harness the power of truly impactful communication.

43,She Started a Side Hustle While Working 2 Jobs as a Line Cook for $22 an Hour Combined — Now It's an 8-Figure Brand You've Probably Seen on TV,"Mar 13, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/an-apron-side-hustle-turned-into-a-multimillion-dollar-brand/470978,"
For Ellen Bennett, founder of kitchenware brand Hedley & Bennett, food has been a life-long love. ""I'm half-Mexican and half-English, and so I grew up with this very unusual combination of eating tamales and caldo de pollo, and things that are very Mexican, alongside shepherd's pie and tea with my English grandpa,"" she tells Entrepreneur.But before Bennett built the apron business named for her English and Mexican families, she attended culinary school in Mexico City, where it was more affordable than in the U.S. She took modeling jobs and translation gigs to support herself there, then moved back to Los Angeles, where she was raised, to work at some of the city's best restaurants.Image Credit: Shayan Asgharnia. Ellen Bennett.



""I've always put one foot in front of the other towards the thing that I want to do, never stop and don't stare too long because then you'll get scared and won't do it,"" Bennett says. ""So I keep myself moving always and forever. And I feel like that has been one of the successful traits for me: I don't analyze — I just do.""In 2012, at 24, Bennett was doing a whole lot: She worked as a line cook at Providence, which boasts a two-star Michelin rating, and at Bäco Mercat, pulling in $22 an hour between the two jobs. In the mornings, she also worked as a personal chef for a family. ""It was around the clock,"" she recalls, adding that 14-hour days within the industry were par for the course.


Related: She Used $10,000 in Savings to Turn Her Side Hustle Into an 8-Figure Brand You've Probably Seen""If I can make the [equivalent] uniform piece of dignity [and] roll [that] into this world of cooking, maybe I change this whole industry.""Despite the ""hustle"" of her day-to-day, Bennett had a big idea, one that served as a ""funny through line"" from her life as a ""hardcore line cook"" to the ""other life"" she led — in Mexico City she'd often donned suits for work events, and as an avid runner with marathons under her belt, she knew a thing or two about athletic attire that could stand up to the rigors of the sport.""So I combined the two in my head,"" Bennett says, ""and I thought, Man, if I can make the [equivalent] uniform piece of dignity [and] roll [that] into this world of cooking, maybe I change this whole industry. Because we're getting our asses handed to us. We work so hard, [and] everybody looks like shit.""


A few weeks later, a chef at one of the restaurants where Bennett worked presented her with the perfect opportunity to start her side hustle. He said he was going to order aprons for everybody, and Bennett, who'd been thinking nonstop about chef coats and various aspects of the uniform, ""blurted out in Ellen Bennett fashion"" that she had an apron company.Image Credit: Courtesy of Hedley & Bennett. Related: At 23, She Started a Side Hustle for 'Quick Money.' Now the Business Brings in More Than $1 Million a Month — and Boasts Celebrity Fans.Of course, Bennett didn't have a business at that point, but she said she'd been working on an idea — ""and by working, I meant it was in my head,"" she admits. Still, she managed to convince the chef to place an order for 40 aprons, and with ""absolutely nothing other than willpower and chutzpah,"" she ""started the whole damn thing."" Bennett showed up anywhere she could find chefs who might be interested in her aprons — from farmers' markets to Eater LA events.


""I would walk up to people and just be like, 'Hey, I'm a cook at Providence. I work there, and I have an apron company. Can I show you what I'm working on?'"" Bennett says. ""So it was very much from a place of humility, but I also was shameless about talking to anyone. And I never hid behind a computer waiting for people to email me. I just stood in front of you, and if you had ears, I was going to talk to you.""""'Oh my god, Japanese denim? That's cool. American canvas? Hell yeah.'""Bennett didn't have a sewing background, but she'd always loved design, so her process in those early days ""was truly scrappy."" She'd sit down with chefs and listen to their pain points (which she knew all too well as an industry professional), drilling down on the finer yet crucial details that so often went ignored in the apron game — like durable fabric.Image Credit: Courtesy of Hedley & Bennett.


Quickly, Bennett leaned into ""elevating the core materials,"" much like how a Michelin-starred restaurant raises the bar for food. ""We're still just selling food,"" Bennett explains, ""but it's the best fish you've ever had in the world because we sourced it from the best place. So I applied that same logic."" And Bennett's aprons were an instant hit.Related: For Years, This Black Founder Learned an Uncommon But Essential Craft on the Side. Now His Creations Are Beloved By Celebrity Chefs — and Can Sell for More Than $1,000.""These chefs got really nerdy about it,"" Bennett says. ""They're like, 'Oh my god, Japanese denim? That's cool. American canvas? Hell yeah'. And then, instead of using plastic hardware, I'd be like, 'What if we use brass hardware?' And they'd be like, 'Yes, I love that.' So I essentially just collaborated and listened.""Now, Hedley & Bennett is an eight-figure brand, and if you've tuned in to any cooking show or show about cooking, you've no doubt seen it in action: 70% of chefs on the Food Network wear Hedley & Bennett aprons, and nearly every chef who appears on Top Chef and The Bear is donning one too, according to data provided by the brand. Hedley & Bennett also boasts partnerships with The Beatles, NASA and Crocs, among others, and has since expanded into general kitchenware, including knives, potholders and more.


""Even if you go out and raise $50 million, you still have to build community to get customers.""Although Bennett's apron idea resonated with other chefs immediately and has seen enormous growth in the past decade-plus, she stresses that Hedley & Bennett was far from an overnight success — and that, realistically, there's no such thing.The brand didn't have any outside investment. Instead, she grew Hedley & Bennett ""the old-school way,"" reinvesting every penny back into the business as she built ""brick by brick,"" ""street by street"" and ""customer by customer,"" securing that essential brand loyalty along the way. And the people she sold her aprons to in the beginning remain customers, Bennett notes: ""There's a love that exists that you can't buy from an Instagram ad.""""Even if you go out and raise $50 million, you still have to build community to get customers,"" Bennett says. ""You just happen to have more money in the bank. Are you willing to show up and talk to people? Are you willing to listen, pivot, adapt your product to them and what they actually need? Everyone goes through the same struggles. It's just how many resources you can throw at it. And because I had limited resources, I got a lot more creative than I would have if I had all the money in the world.""


Related: Using Social Media Alone to Build Your Brand's Online Community Means You Risk Losing It All. Here's Why.What's more, Hedley & Bennett's initial business-to-business (B2B) model meant a ""slow and steady"" approach that benefited from ""brutally honest chefs"" who didn't mince words when it came to letting Bennett know what was and wasn't working. The feedback was invaluable, but despite an influx of requests for additional products, Hedley & Bennett remained ""hyper-focused"" on putting out the perfect customizable apron — until the pandemic hit. We need to actually create a systemized streamlined menu of how we outfit these restaurants in a way that we can scale it, Bennett realized.So Hedley & Bennett incorporated a direct-to-consumer approach. Within one month, the brand went from shipping everything internally to shipping with third-party logistics (3PL). ""It was not clean or smooth or anything like that,"" Bennett says. ""It was just the right thing for the business, and the whole world couldn't meet in person. So it was like, 'How do we get it online as fast as possible?'""From there, Bennett considered all of the feedback they'd received — and which products it made sense to tackle next. ""We're like, 'Okay, well, what's the natural extension from aprons that's an essential, because we don't like making tchotchkes.'"" Bennett recalls. ""We're all about longevity, quality on things you need, not just like a lemon squeezer, which is fine, but you can squeeze a lemon with your hands, too."" That led the brand to knives.


Image Credit: Shelby Moore.""There's nothing wrong with taking longer to build something great.""Hedley & Bennett's journey has been lengthy and full of ""little peaks and valleys"" trending upward overall, but because she's ""such an action-oriented person,"" Bennett says she rarely dwells on what she didn't do along the way.Still, in the beginning, Bennett does wish she'd taken a step back to value herself and her contributions the way that other people did. ""I don't mean that in an ego-driven way,"" she says. ""It's not about being like I'm the coolest, I'm the best, but it's simply respecting yourself for the work that you did and saying, 'Not only did I build the table — I built the chair that I got to sit in at the table. I made this.'""

45,Are the Days of Good Customer Service Over? These 7 Hacks Can Bring it to Life at Your Company,"Mar 7, 2024",Micah Solomon,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-revamp-your-customer-service-with-these-7-hacks/470299,"
As a customer service trainer, speaker, and consultant, I am approached by all sorts of people who tell me all sorts of things. Some refrains are, ""Customer service is dead,"" ""Nobody provides customer service like they did back in the day,"" or even, ""Kids these days don't know how to give good customer service.""I don't buy into this negative strain of sentiment. I think what's going on is that customer expectations have grown higher and higher, and customer service levels haven't kept up. But to the extent that today's customers — your potential customers — feel this way about your competitors in the marketplace, there's an extraordinary opportunity for your business to get ahead of the curve and use exceptional customer service as a competitive advantage.Related: 4 Ways Brands Can Educate Their Customers and Win HeartsAs a start, consider this list of pointers.1. Stress a pro-customer purpose to all employeesEmployees need to know that you want them to step away from their functional tasks if a purpose-driven task requires a different use of their time at the moment.



The thing about above and beyond customer service is that it, by definition, requires extra effort. These extra efforts are elective; employees (no matter what their delusional bosses may believe) can contribute or withhold at their discretion. We all know people who keep their work level just above where HR would come in with a performance improvement plan and thus stay under the radar without contributing much at all.You need to get that additional, creative effort out of your employees, and a key factor in doing so is in stressing, from onboarding onward, the importance of a pro-customer purpose that takes you above and beyond your functional, checklist-style duties.2. Empower employees at every level of your organizationIf you get serious about employee empowerment, you'll move a lot further and a lot more quickly toward being an organization where purpose-driven employees contribute their elective efforts. Exceptional customer service requires room for interpretation, with your employees making those interpretations, deciding, and bringing to life what exceptional customer service really looks like in action.And if they lack empowerment — power, really — they'll remain hobbled, no matter how good their intentions.Related: Want a Customer Service Revolution? Start By Changing Your Culture3. Review and revamp your employee selection (hiring) criteria.Restaurateur Danny Meyer has written and spoken eloquently about the mix of skill and attitude criteria that can reveal an ideal new employee together. Personality traits are generally stable and unlikely to change once people reach their 20s, so it's valuable to look for a pro-customer orientation in every potential employee you consider, alongside whatever skills criteria you are also screening for.4. Celebrate your customer service accomplishments companywideI suggest you systematize this celebration along the lines of what has worked for years—decades, actually — for the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company. Twice a week, every Ritz-Carlton hotel and resort shares a ""wow story"" of over-and-above hospitality from one of its more than 100 properties. This works wonders in inspiring all the employees who hear these stories to contribute similarly wow-level customer service themselves.5. Adapt to the rapid pace of response that modern customers expectReview and, if necessary, update your response times to meet today's customer expectations: What was ""fast enough"" a couple of years ago is no longer.Related: 4 Keys to Satisfying 21st Century Customers6. Involve everyone in customer experience innovationGreat customer service should constantly be growing and adapting. Get people at all levels and all positions in your organization excited about contributing suggestions for innovation. At the very customer-centric insurance and financial behemoth USAA, employees have been responsible for over 1,000 patented innovations!These come from every corner of the company (one security guard alone is responsible for contributing 28 patented ideas!) Be sure to explain that multiple areas are available for (and need) innovation. While everyone thinks of innovation as product-based, it's only one of the three areas that are ripe for contributions:Product: what you sell or make; in spite of the name, this includes services as well as goods.Process: how you make your product or service and how you sell it.Business model: how your company is conceptualized and organized.7. Embrace the triangular model when considering technology, including AIIn the customer service triangle framework, the human agent occupies one vertex, the customer the next, and AI or other technology the third. These three entities should work interactionally rather than in an either-or manner. A customer who started interacting with your company via AI can switch to a human agent, for instance.


But after that handoff, AI will still be involved behind the scenes for the agent to serve the customer best. And the customer can also be expected to use AI themselves, even while they're speaking to the agent (most likely the world's biggest AI experiment, Google).

The allure of starting a home business has never been stronger, with many people either supplementing their 9-to-5 income or leaving their day jobs altogether to follow their creative entrepreneurial dreams. With the rise of easier-to-navigate ecommerce platforms and social media marketing, people are finding unprecedented opportunities to turn passion into profit.One in three Americans report having a side hustle, and it can be easy to see why with all of the tools available to make entrepreneurial aspirations a reality. Starting a home apparel printing business is just one option for the more creatively inclined.Though you may not have any idea of how to begin a home printing business, many people just like you begin with a little corner of their home, some equipment and a few good ideas to get started. With the right approach to design, quality materials and customer service, those who decide to begin home apparel printing businesses can enjoy wide profit margins, not to mention the satisfaction of being one's own boss.



Related: Learn How to Start a T-Shirt Merch Business as a Side HustleA solid side hustleSeveral aspects of the home apparel printing business make it an excellent side hustle option. Think about all of the places you go in a day — the grocery store, your kid's soccer game, PTA meetings or your day job. There is one constant among people and what they are wearing: customization.


People love clothing that shows off their personality, their favorite band or a quirky saying that endears them to a particular social group. There is never a shortage of people who will be willing to shell out for custom-designed apparel, whether it's fun t-shirts, team uniforms or accessories.In addition, startup costs for a home apparel printing business can be relatively low compared to other side hustle options. Many custom printing machines can be purchased at a relatively affordable price, flexible payment options are available, and materials are readily available either online or even at your local hobby shop. You can stock up on t-shirts, sweatshirts, tote bags or even hats and other accessories in bulk or take advantage of sales to get yourself started and enter the market without breaking the bank.This side hustle is also extremely flexible and great for busy parents, people with day jobs or even those with other side hustles because it can easily be integrated into your existing schedule. Operating out of one's home also adds further flexibility while reducing business overhead.A home apparel printing business is also extremely scalable. As demand and access to resources grow, side hustlers can expand their businesses as they see fit. This can include growing the online portion of one's business for more passive income, leveraging new community connections for larger custom apparel orders or offering new, unique printed products.

Research and planDo some digging into the market to see where you can add value that may currently be missing. There are multiple printing options available, and each has its pros and cons.One of the newest and most popular methods on the market, particularly for home-based businesses, is direct-to-film printing. Also known as DTF printing, it does not require pretreatment of the garment, the hot melt powder that is used bonds directly to any material, and you can print on bulkier items that would be otherwise impossible with other printing options. In addition, DTF transfers can be cut and stored for later use, meaning decorators can print their most popular designs in bulk for a more streamlined customization process.


The versatility of DTF printing contributes to it being the most popular choice for at-home printing businesses overall. The demand for customized apparel has led to DTF printing nearing a market value of $1.7 billion by 2026.2. Invest in the right equipmentOnce you complete your research and know what kind of approach you want to take, invest in the best equipment for the kind of printing you'd like to do. Keep an eye on quality, first and foremost, to get your side hustle off on the right foot.3. Design and creativityThink about starting a portfolio of designs for your business. For example, if you are catering to local sports teams, they may have ready-made designs. Or if you have a great idea for a unique apparel design, you can easily take it from idea to reality with design software.4. MarketingToday, marketing is multifaceted and multilayered. Set up social media accounts for your new business, network face-to-face within your community, and get people to wear your creations where they will be seen and noticed. Sit down and work out a comprehensive marketing plan that can help grow your business to new heights.


5. Be ready to pivotEven the smallest of side hustles need to grow and adapt. Within your apparel printing business, that may mean taking on larger commissions, going after group orders or hopping onto fashion trends when they emerge. The most successful side hustlers are the ones who can shift with the market.Related: 10 of the Most Profitable Side Hustles You Can Start With Little or No MoneyThose with an entrepreneurial spirit and a creative vision could thrive with a home-based apparel printing business.

47,This Revenue Hack Can Increase Your Small Business Earnings by up to 30%,"Mar 7, 2024",Adam Povlitz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/expand-your-small-business-income-by-investing-in-this/470329,"
We all know that the rise of the digital age has revolutionized organizations' operations, enabling them to explore new income avenues with minimal investment. This has never been truer for small businesses. For this group, embracing e-commerce platforms and online marketplaces can catapult them into new opportunities. The average revenue increase by investing in marketing for a small business can vary significantly depending on various factors such as the industry, target market, marketing strategies employed, and the effectiveness of the campaigns. However, businesses that invest in strong marketing efforts typically experience an average revenue growth of 30% — some significantly more.Investing more time and resources toward their online presence allows even the smallest businesses to tap into global customer bases that were once out of reach, boosting their revenue potential and keeping operations manageable. One size does not fit all, and strategies depend on your business industry. Here are some to consider.Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now to find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.Service bundlesDeveloping service bundles or packages can be a winning strategy to expand revenue without overextending operations. By combining existing core services with compatible offerings, businesses can provide added value to customers while increasing their revenue streams.



For example, a graphic design agency could bundle branding, website development, and social media management services, offering clients a comprehensive marketing package. This approach attracts new customers and promotes customer loyalty, as clients recognize the convenience and cost-effectiveness of bundled services.Subscription models and strategic partnershipsSubscription-based business models have become more prevalent in recent years, offering steady revenue streams and fostering customer loyalty (think Netflix and Amazon Prime). Small businesses can creatively implement subscription models tailored to their industry to secure recurring income.For instance, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company can offer tiered subscriptions with varying features and benefits, enticing customers to upgrade for additional services. By continually providing added value, brands can maintain a loyal customer base while expanding their revenue opportunities.


Collaborating with strategic partners can be a game-changer for small businesses seeking new revenue streams. By joining forces with like-minded organizations, they can leverage each other's resources, expertise, and customer bases. Partnerships offer a variety of collaborative opportunities, such as co-marketing initiatives, cross-selling promotions, and joint ventures, making them a popular alternative to outright selling (or merging) a business.Related: Want to Become a Franchisee? Run Through This Checklist First.Licensing and franchisingLicensing or franchising can be a viable option to expand revenue streams without spreading operations too thin. This approach allows businesses to generate additional income by granting others the rights to operate under their established brand and proven systems.Franchising provides a low-risk path to expansion, as the franchisees manage their financial and operational responsibilities. This strategy has proven successful in many different industries, from fast food to fitness studios to commercial cleaning.Tailoring strategies to address challengesWhile the principles of forging new revenue streams apply to businesses of all sizes, small businesses, in particular, often face unique challenges. Limited resources, tight budgets, and a smaller market segment necessitate careful planning and creative thinking.These businesses should focus on niche markets, identifying specific unmet customer needs to carve out a competitive edge and attract a loyal customer base.Related: Is Franchising Right For You? Ask Yourself These 9 Questions to Find Out.Five revenue-boosting examples for common business concepts:Consultation Services: A professional services firm, such as a law or accounting firm, can branch out by offering specialized consultation services in niche areas. For instance, a law firm specializing in intellectual property could provide consultation services for startups looking to protect their patents and copyrights.Rental Services: A small retailer can leverage underutilized inventory by offering rental services. For example, a high-end fashion boutique can rent designer dresses for special occasions, creating an additional revenue stream while maximizing the value of their inventory.Customization and Personalization: A small manufacturing company can differentiate itself by offering customized or personalized products. This could include engraving, monogramming, or customizable features that cater to individual customer preferences, allowing them to charge a premium price for customized offerings.Membership Programs: A fitness center or gym can introduce tiered membership programs that offer additional benefits to members. This can include exclusive access to specialized classes, personal training sessions, or discounted rates for affiliated services, generating recurring revenue through membership fees.Value-added Services: A small restaurant can expand its revenue by offering catering services for events and parties. Additionally, they can explore partnering with local businesses to offer bundled services like catering and venue rental, providing a seamless experience for customers and generating additional income streams.Developing additional revenue streams is a key strategy for businesses aiming for sustained growth and relevance in an evolving marketplace. Organizations can unlock new income sources by adopting digital platforms, creating service bundles, implementing subscription models, forming strategic partnerships, or exploring licensing opportunities.For small businesses, it's crucial to prioritize scalability and customer-centric strategies to maintain operational efficiency while pursuing revenue diversification. By pursuing innovative approaches, they can forge new revenue streams and position themselves for long-term success.

        Watercutter says she's always had an entrepreneurial spirit, but the side hustle proved challenging at the start. 
      


        Cash flow was one of the biggest hurdles; it took ""a lot of discipline and learning"" to push the business forward. 
      


        The brand's since gone viral on TikTok and began hitting seven-figure revenue months last year.

Katherine Watercutter.What was your day job when you started your side hustle, and why were you interested in entrepreneurship?



I was a sales representative for a distribution company working with kitchen and bath designers around Indiana (I studied interior architecture and design). I have always been an entrepreneur since I was young; you have to have that as a part of you to be willing to take risks.When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?


I got the idea for it in 2018 and started it in January 2019. There really was no inspiration — I thought it could make me quick money. But I was wrong about that.Related: He 'Accidentally Discovered' a Semi-Passive Side Hustle in College — Now He's on Track to Make More Than $500,000 This YearWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I started a Shopify store and created a website and an Instagram.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?One of the biggest challenges early on was cash flow. I didn't receive funding from outside investors and started with very little to invest. So there were a few times where I almost had to close the doors because of cash flow. It taught me a very valuable lesson early on because businesses often fail the first year when they run out of money. I navigated that by getting a line of credit from the bank and a business credit card, which helped with funds, but I also almost maxed those out. It took a lot of discipline, learning and watching the numbers to navigate this challenge until I saw more consistent growth and revenue.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?The side hustle didn't earn anything. It wasn't until a few years into making it my full-time job, dedicating 80-90 hours a week, that I actually started making money, and I didn't pay myself until about 2021. It is hard to say how long it took for consistent revenue because it wasn't until the spring or summer of 2020 that revenue took off — but later that year, it dropped again. It is safe to say that 2021 was the year that revenue was actually ""consistent"" enough to feel safe where debt was paid off, and things were headed in the right direction. So that would be a total of about three years (two years all-in on my business).

People in this day and age are impatient and sometimes quick to give up when they feel like they keep failing. There were a few times when I thought I hit ""rock bottom"" and exhausted all options, but I found a way around it. I felt like I was failing consistently for three years, and I know many would have given up by then, but business is all about problem-solving.Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a Month

50,Big Businesses Take Forever to Pay Their Small Suppliers. These Founders Did Something About It: 'Nobody Had Seen Anything Like This',"Mar 6, 2024",Frances Dodds,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/these-founders-help-small-suppliers-get-paid-quicker-from/470341,"
It should have been a celebratory lunch — the kind where you order french fries and cheesecake, then go home to nap and don't even feel bad about it.Instead, Stacey Abrams and Lara Hodgson were sitting in an Atlanta restaurant, dazed with disappointment, talking in circles, returning again and again to the same confounding question: How did we not know this?It was 2010, and three years earlier, the women had cofounded a company called Nourish, which made grab-and-go baby bottles filled with premeasured, purified water for easy formula mixing. The company had been finding its legs, one wobbly step at a time. Then, Whole Foods placed a huge order of their product.



""It was, like, orders of magnitude bigger than anything we'd done before,"" Hodgson says. They were ecstatic. This is what they should've been celebrating. But then they read the payment terms. ""We discovered that we weren't going to get paid for three to four months. I mean, no small business can handle that.""The women had run headlong into an unspoken rule: the bigger the buyer, the longer they take to pay. And it didn't even matter what the official payment schedule was. ""If your invoice says net 30 or net 60 or net 90 — that's just a suggestion,"" Hodgson says. ""We know now that the average net 30 invoice pays in 54 days. But back then, when we realized all this, I just remember thinking, like, Was I sick one day in business school? Why does no one talk about this?""Related: 10 Small Business Marketing Strategies That Actually WorkThey had more questions, too. Why was this the status quo? Why did no one seem to think it was a big deal? And why — in a country that calls small businesses the backbone of the economy — had no one bothered to create a better solution?Suddenly, they couldn't stop talking about it. They talked with each other, and then with other small business owners, and then with academics and investors. And eventually, they decided to do something about it.Later that year, the duo cofounded NowAccount, a novel business-to-business financing solution that lets small business owners get paid for invoices right away, with low, flat-rate fees, while building up their credit and outsourcing the time-consuming task of tracking down payments. Since its inception in 2010, Now has fast-tracked almost $1 billion in payments for nearly 1,000 businesses, and in the past two years, more than doubled in growth.But getting to this point took a long time: years of asking, and listening, and explaining, and insisting that something could and should be done.""We had to convince people we could solve the problem,"" Abrams says, ""because it sounded like magic.""


Hodgson and Abrams met at a leadership program in Atlanta — but they might not have connected so fast if Abrams hadn't fessed up to her audacious ambition.It was 2004, and they were both enrolled in a tough session: The facilitator had researched attendees ahead of time, and made it his mission to target their insecurities, in order to prompt deeper conversation about biases. Hodgson is an extrovert who loves to talk — so the facilitator didn't let her do that. ""At the end of the weekend, he told me he needed me to know what it felt like to have no voice,"" she says. ""I did not like that.""Abrams is an introvert, so the facilitator treated her the opposite way — constantly pressing her to speak. Eventually, he asked Abrams a direct question: ""What is one great ambition you've never wanted to say out loud?"" She paused, then said she wanted to be president of the United States. Across the room, Hodgson remembers thinking, I always said that as a little girl, and girls don't say that out loud! When they broke for lunch, Hodgson made a beeline for Abrams in the buffet line.Related: 9 Tips To Grow Your Small Business With Social Media MarketingThe women were assigned to the same study group. ""We found that while we had different approaches to problems,"" Abrams says, ""we almost always aligned on solutions."" They became friends, and a couple of years later, founded a consulting company together, making use of Hodgson's business connections and Abrams' knowledge of local tax law. Then they founded Nourish. And that brought them to that bleak lunch in 2010, agonizing over how to get the money for their Whole Foods order. They were searching, once again, for an answer.They'd scrambled to find conventional bridge-funding solutions — a bank loan or invoice factoring — but found the first inaccessible, and the second predatory. Bank loans are hard to get for small business owners without solid credit, or for anyone who doesn't feel comfortable with personal guarantees. Recourse-factoring companies, which buy invoices from small companies, charge variable fees, along with additional accruing fees for late payments (which the small businesses can't predict or control), and often use invasive tactics like collecting money from the business's bank account on a daily or weekly basis. Plus, if a payment falls through, the small business is on the hook for the full payment plus late fees, which leaves a liability on its balance sheet for months.The best option Hodgson and Abrams had found — ""a creative factoring agreement from a community bank"" — also came with personal guarantees. This was uncomfortable for both women. Hodgson had a new baby and worried about losing her house because of the loan, and Abrams had a mortgage and a lot of student debt. Plus, she was financially responsible for her parents and niece.To both women, this situation just felt wrong. They knew they couldn't be the first entrepreneurs to find themselves suddenly ""growing out of business.""""When you encounter a massive problem that's been around forever,"" Abrams says, ""you tend to think, I can't possibly be the first one to see it. So you assume what's happening is your fault, or that the problem would have been solved if it could have been. And you usually stop there. But instead of critiquing ourselves, Lara and I decided to ask: OK, but why hasn't it happened?""


Image Credit: Nicolás OrtegaWhen Abrams and Hodgson began talking about solutions, the first thing they thought of was simple: What if Whole Foods could pay them with a credit card? In this case, Nourish, the seller, would be charged the flat 3.5% transaction fee, and get paid right away. Then Whole Foods, the buyer, would pay down the balance on their own time with interest.But therein lies the dilemma: Whole Foods doesn't want to pay its suppliers right away — and certainly doesn't want to pay interest. And because it's a giant company, it doesn't have to. That's the way the capitalist cookie crumbles. Bigger companies set payment terms, and the smaller companies accept them — until they prove critical enough to negotiate.But what if Hodgson and Abrams created something for small businesses that was like being paid with a credit card?This is the idea that eventually became NowAccount: Small businesses would apply to be Now's clients, and pay an annual membership fee of $750. When clients received an invoice from a new buyer, Now would assess the buyer's risk, and if they approved, the client could start uploading invoices. Now would vet each invoice, then pay the client the full amount almost immediately, minus a flat fee based on the payment terms (ranging incrementally from 3% for a net 15 invoice, to 8% for a net 120 invoice). And Now would be reimbursed when the payment is made.Related: 5 Things Not to Do When You're Running a Small BusinessThis would shrink the payment schedule from a few months to just a few days. In the case of Nourish and Whole Foods, it would have looked something like this: If Whole Foods placed an order of, say, $50,000 worth of goods from Nourish, with 90-day payment terms, Nourish would take that invoice to NowAccount, who would confirm its validity with Whole Foods, and then pay Nourish $50,000 right away (minus the 7% fee for a net 90 invoice). Then Now would be reimbursed in, say, 117 days, or whenever Whole Foods actually paid.For a small business owner, the advantages of this setup are numerous: No added interest for late payments you can't control, no liability on your balance sheet, no unforgiving credit checks or invasive debt collection strategies, and no personal guarantees. Unlike factoring companies, which hold you responsible if a payment falls through, NowAccount absorbs the risk of every invoice it accepts. In this way, Now acts as a kind of insurance for their clients.Hodgson and Abrams knew their concept was groundbreaking.Unfortunately, at first, the people they needed to join them were not convinced. Part of the problem was that the concept didn't lend itself to pithy, 30-second elevator pitches. ""It's complicated to explain,"" Hodgson says. ""And because nobody had seen anything like this, when they heard 'get paid fast,' their brains immediately went to, 'Is it a loan? Is it a payday loan? Is it factoring?'""From the finance side, there was also some confusion about why this was even a problem. What's stopping any small business owner from going down to their local bank to get a loan at a lower annual interest rate, or negotiating better terms with their factoring company or buyer?


What financial institutions often overlook are the countless variable barriers for small business owners. Many are becoming entrepreneurs for the first time, figuring it out as they go, without a lot of financial education or resources.Patricia Wilson is a NowAccount client who worked in technology for 20 years before deciding to start her own consulting business, Online Media Interactive. When she started out, she says, ""Honestly, going after a bank loan didn't even occur to me. I was still trying to feel out what I wanted to do from a business perspective. And with traditional factoring companies, I was very intimidated by the aggressive nature of how they collect the money. I just wanted a way to have consistent income coming in.""Another Now client, Mike Riordan, is the founder of Freeze Sleeve, a cold/hot compression therapy he developed for his daughter, a pre-Olympic gymnast. Riordan had previously run a struggling construction company that tanked his credit, so he couldn't get a bank loan for Freeze Sleeve. And he was put off by the ""loan-shark mentality"" of factoring companies.""I think there's a kind of business amnesia that occurs in the financial sector,"" Abrams says. ""The people making these decisions forgot what it was like to be a small business owner."" Moreover, Hodgson thinks there's a misconception in the finance world that you can take funding solutions for large companies and ""miniaturize"" them. ""I tell people, 'Small businesses are not miniature large businesses. You can't just, like, shrink a solution,'"" she says. ""Think about it: If I'm a small business selling to, say, Walmart, and they're demanding net 90, that means they might actually pay in 120 days. So I'm essentially Walmart's free bank for 90-plus days. My cost of capital is way higher than Walmart's, so efficient economic theory suggests the best solution for Walmart is to borrow money really cheaply, pay me faster, and get a discount. But anyone who's tried that knows a large company will just take the discount and still pay you late.""Related: This Is the Unseen Advantage Your Small Business Might NeedIn fact, Hodgson tried this kind of dynamic discounting with one large retailer when they were running Nourish. She'd offer, say, a 2% discount on a net 30 invoice if they paid her in 10 days. But in the end, she says, the retailer just took the discount and still paid her late.""What am I going to do, sue them?"" she says. ""My legal bill would be way more than the 2%, so it's not worth it. I could threaten not to sell to them again, and they'd be like, 'OK, move over! There's a line of people who would gladly take your shelf space.' When you have an imbalance in power, efficient economic theory just doesn't work.""Dr. Richard Bliss, a professor of finance at Babson College and the national academic director for Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses, confirms this. ""It's the classic 'because they can,'"" he says. ""There's a huge power dynamic, and big companies just take advantage. I often hear stories from small business owners who are so excited they got this big contract, but they lose sight of the fact that they still have to make this positive from a financial standpoint. A lot of them don't have the rudimentary forecasting tools to plug in their new contract, look four months down the road to say, 'Holy smokes, we're gonna run out of money.' By the time they realize the predicament they're in, there are very few options.""Slowly but surely, investors began to hear Hodgson and Abrams' message. First came credit unions, then equity investors, and finally Goldman Sachs. Taking different types of funding presented some tension, Hodgson says, but she thinks it made the business more sustainable. ""Equity investors usually prioritize growth more than profitability, whereas lenders want you to be focused on profitability. So at times, I was like, Oh my gosh, I can't make everybody happy! But in hindsight, I think it forced a kind of discipline.""The thing about discipline is that it doesn't exactly lend itself to meteoric change. It's an act of faith that, eventually, the baby steps will get you somewhere.


""You know when your shoelaces are tied together, and you can't take a step that's longer than the shoelace or you fall on your face?"" Hodgson asks. ""That's the image that comes to mind about starting and scaling NowAccount. We had to go get capital and then get some customers, then we needed more capital and then more customers. And if I tried to do either of those too big, I'd fall on my face. So we just sort of trudged along, little by little.""NowAccount's investors were pulling on one shoelace, and clients were tugging on the other. Small business owners didn't need convincing that there was a problem. But they did need some convincing that these two nice Southern ladies weren't selling them some fanciful money ""magic,"" as Abrams says, ""or worse!""Related: Here's the Secret to Growing Your Small Business, According to Execs at UPS, Airbnb, Mastercard, and Other Big Brands""The first question we'd get from small business owners is, 'Why would you give us this money?'"" Abrams says. ""They were trying to understand: 'If this other financial institution wants to charge me 30% on my entire inventory, or this one wants my DNA swab, or to mortgage my house, why would I trust you?' Entrepreneurs are trained to believe no one is coming to help them, so we were trying to convince people we could untie their shoelaces when they'd gotten used to walking that way"" — restrained, cautious, and slower than they should have to.But once NowAccount started delivering on its promises, they started getting more applications than they could accept. This was partly because they needed more funding, and partly because they needed to mitigate risk. ""We wanted to serve more businesses, because that's why we existed,"" Hodgson says. ""But if we went too far, someone's going to take the dollar and run. So in the early days, it was a lot of learning, like, what are the signs? And analyzing data to tell us if certain industries or company profiles are more prone to risk.""Now learned to spot certain ""behavioral indicators."" For example, if someone has a Gmail account instead of a business email, it's worth a closer look. Maybe it's a fly-by-night operation, or maybe it's a new business that just hasn't set up its website yet. But with each invoice Now processed, its system became more informed. ""Every data point we have about a customer and who their buyer is, and when they pay, that just makes the system incrementally smarter,"" Hodgson says. ""So mistakes happen less and less as we grow.""And this practice of mitigating risk isn't just for Now's benefit. It's also become a crucial service for clients.Riordan, the founder of Freeze Sleeve, says the buyer-vetting that NowAccount does is invaluable. In addition to being able to sell to big companies that are ""horribly slow"" at paying, Riordan says, ""We also use NowAccount almost like our credit check people. Every time somebody wants to come on board, I send them over to Now, and they do their due diligence on the company. One time we had a cryotherapy business that wanted to go national with our products, and they gave us a very substantial order. But Now wouldn't approve them. We were frustrated because it was a big order, so we ended up doing it on our own. Well, guess what? That company went out of business and left us with a big hole.""Meeting with team members Archie Jones and John Hayes in 2015, in an antiques shop next to their office.Image Credit: Courtesy of Stacey AbramsNow was always intended to serve small businesses. But a few years in, something surprising happened. ""We got a call from Coca-Cola's chief procurement officer,"" Hodgson says, ""who was like, 'This seems to be a huge benefit to suppliers. Maybe we could partner to make sure more of them know about it.'""


Coca-Cola had been trying to diversify its supply chain to include more women and people of color, but its payment terms made it impossible for many of these businesses to work with them. ""They're going to take 90 days to pay, and if that's going to kill you, they can't give you the contract,"" Hodgson says.But with Now, Coca-Cola saw an opportunity: If there was a small business they wanted to buy from, but the supplier couldn't afford their payment terms, they'd send them to NowAccount. That way, the small business didn't have to worry about how long it would take to get paid, and Coca-Cola would know they had the capital to deliver. It was a win-win for everyone.Not long after, the city of Atlanta began a push to boost the local economy by connecting Atlanta-based corporations with local small business suppliers. Now was perfectly positioned to partner with the city to make these connections.Then, in 2020, the George Floyd protests happened, and corporations across the country started making public pledges to spend more with minority-owned businesses. At that point, Now realized it was sitting on a goldmine of data.Sure, there are plenty of business databases out there — but only Now has years' worth of invoice data, giving them visibility into which suppliers can deliver at what level.Related: 7 Strategies to Scale Your Small Business and Achieve Sustainable Growth""If you're a procurement person, and you've bought a database of businesses, and you're looking for one with a Latina founder, there are probably hundreds of them,"" Hodgson says. ""How do you pick? And most importantly, how do you know which of those hundreds can do a million-dollar contract versus a $5,000 contract? Because that matters. If I give you a contract that's too big and you don't have the staff to deliver, neither of us win.""What if they created a curated platform that helped big businesses find diverse suppliers capable of meeting their needs? It would be free for the small businesses to join, while the big businesses paid a membership fee. And that's how the next Now product — NowNetwork — was born.When Hodgson and Abrams talk about Now, people often ask: Why is it like this? Why don't these big businesses just pay their suppliers faster?Hodgson likes to tell a story about a conversation she once had with a Fortune 500 CFO. They were talking about NowAccount, and the CFO said, ""You know, this is fascinating, but I could probably just pay my suppliers immediately for cheaper than you can.""


""Well for sure you could,"" Hodgson replied. ""You're a Fortune 500 company and we're a startup. But you won't.""The CFO paused for a moment. ""You're right,"" she said. ""I won't because if I turn around and paid all my suppliers immediately, Wall Street would take me down.""What Hodgson and the CFO were acknowledging is how common it is for corporations to beef up their capital stacks by leaning on ""accounts payable"" — the money owed to suppliers but not yet paid.""Take any public company and look at their financials,"" Hodgson says, ""If you look at their short-term debt, like what they're borrowing from the bank, compared to their accounts payable — what they owe suppliers — their accounts payable are almost always two to three times what they owe the bank. Because there's a smart CFO who knows he can delay payments for free versus borrowing money at some cost greater than zero. If you yanked that away, they'd have to turn to more expensive capital, their net earnings would drop, and Wall Street would kill them.""This notion — that it's common for corporations to deliberately delay payments — is provocative. But each year, the consultancy firm The Hackett Group does an annual analysis of something called Days Payable Outstanding, or DPO. It's an accounting measure that calculates the number of days it takes for a company to pay suppliers. And it sheds light on the pattern.Of the top 1,000 publicly traded U.S. companies, for the decade running up to 2021 (when payment terms started to shorten due to pandemic supply chain pressures), ""DPO was consistently increasing — around 5% year after year — which is significant,"" says Shawn Townsend, a director in Hackett's finance transformation practice. ""On a compounding level, that adds up to a 32% increase [in how long suppliers are waiting to get paid]. And you would assume the same trends are happening to an even greater extent to smaller companies, because it's about leverage.""Townsend says DPO can't distinguish between long payment terms and late payments. But when asked if it's common for corporations to deliberately delay payments, he says, diplomatically, ""It does happen. We hear some companies saying, 'This month, we told the accounts payable people, pay a certain group of suppliers, don't pay the others.' The most critical suppliers are always the first to get paid. And then the other ones, you know, they just stop the payments until the following month. It's very anecdotal, obviously, because nobody's going to admit that.""But Now's data is not anecdotal. They have unprecedented visibility into exactly when the biggest companies in the U.S. say they'll pay, and when they actually do.Related: 5 SEO Tips to Grow Your Small Business""We know what the normal behavior is for certain companies and certain industries,"" Hodgson says. ""I was talking to someone at a major bank and they said, 'Well, we typically pay in X days.' And I said, 'No you don't.' They said, 'Well, that's our policy.' And I said, 'But that's not what you do! I know because I've been watching you pay invoices for over a year.'""


More recently, the Now team has been asking what they can do with all this information. ""Could we partner with someone like Hackett, or start doing our own reports?"" Hodgson wonders. ""This data could be incredibly interesting to investors, because if you're investing in a company, and they are continuously paying very late, there may be a weakness in its business model. Or if you're a small business who wants to sell to the airline industry, and they're saying they pay in 45 days but they really mean 60, that could be the difference between making a payroll and not. It won't change reality, but you can plan for reality. And that's what got Stacey and I into all of this trouble in the first place.""Image Credit: Nicolás OrtegaA lot has happened since that fateful lunch in 2010. Abrams kept working at NowAccount during her tenure in the Georgia House of Representatives, but left the company in 2016 to pursue those two runs for governor. (Or as she says, ""I had this other job I was interested in applying for, but my application was rejected."") After that, she and Hodgson decided that NowAccount and NowNetwork should be separate companies, which act as partners with service agreements. Hodgson will run NowAccount, and Abrams will run NowNetwork.Unlike Hodgson, who's had a long career in business, Abrams admits she never really wanted to be an entrepreneur. ""I liked paychecks,"" she says. ""It was a frightening idea to be solely reliant on my own efforts.""The thing that changed her mind, though, was meeting Hodgson.""We often believe we have to be the leaders,"" she says, ""but having a partner challenges you. It helps you grow, sharpens your mind, gives you a different perspective. Lara and I have always been curious about what the other person knows.""Curiosity, more than anything, is what brought the friends to this place. And it's what will guide them toward whatever's next. ""Curiosity is about more than simply seeking information,"" says Abrams. ""We want to know: Are we asking the right things?""Related: 7 Networking Groups Every Small Business Owner Should Be Involved In

51,Make Money Doing What You Love — 10 Key Tips on Monetizing Your Passion,"Mar 5, 2024",Billy Carson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/make-money-doing-what-you-love-how-to-monetize-your/470088,"
In a world where the pursuit of passion has become synonymous with living a fulfilling life, many find themselves at a crossroads, unsure of what truly ignites their inner fire. Finding your passion isn't just about discovering a hobby or a career path; it's about uncovering what makes you feel alive, gives your life purpose and aligns with your authentic self.This journey of discovery can be transformative, leading not only to personal fulfillment but also to potential career satisfaction and happiness. Here's how you can embark on this journey and find your passion in life.Related: 5 Leaders Share 5 Ways to Find Your Passion



Discovering your true passionReflect on what you love:Start by reflecting on activities, topics or causes that you love or have always been drawn to. Think about the times you've felt most alive or lost track of time because you were so engrossed in an activity. These moments can offer clues to your passions. Don't limit yourself to conventional ideas of what a passion should be. Your passion could be anything from painting to solving complex mathematical problems.


Explore new interests:Exploration is key to uncovering your passion. Try new activities, enroll in different classes, read books outside your usual interests, and step outside your comfort zone. This process of exploration can help you discover hidden talents or interests you never knew you had. Remember, it's okay to try something and decide it's not for you; each experience brings you closer to finding what truly excites you.Identify your values:Your passion is often closely tied to your core values and what you find meaningful in life. Identifying these values can help you pinpoint areas that are likely to hold your passion. For example, if you value helping others, you might find passion in teaching, counseling or volunteering. Make a list of your top values, and consider activities that align with them.


Seek feedback:Sometimes, others can see our strengths and interests more clearly than we can. Ask friends, family and colleagues what they think you're good at or what they could see you doing. Their observations can provide valuable insights and help you see patterns or interests you might have overlooked.Look for patterns:Reflect on your past experiences, and look for patterns in the activities you've enjoyed or excelled at. These patterns can be indicators of your passion. For example, if you've always enjoyed organizing events and bringing people together, your passion might lie in community building or event planning.


Embrace the journey:Finding your passion is a journey, not a destination. It requires patience, curiosity and an open mind. Be willing to experiment, fail and learn from your experiences. Each step on this journey is an opportunity for growth and self-discovery.Consider professional help:If you're struggling to find your passion, consider seeking the help of a career counselor or life coach. These professionals can offer guidance, tools and strategies to help you identify your interests, values and potential career paths.


Combine your skills and interests:Your passion might not be a single activity or field. Many people find their passion at the intersection of various interests and skills. Think about how you can combine different aspects of your interests and skills to create a unique niche or career path for yourself.Set realistic goals:Once you have an idea of what your passion might be, set small, achievable goals to pursue it further. Whether it's taking a course, starting a side project or dedicating time each week to practice, these goals can help you make steady progress towards integrating your passion into your life.


Stay flexible:Your passion can evolve over time, and what excites you today might change in the future. Stay open to this evolution and be willing to adapt. The key is to remain true to yourself and pursue what makes you feel fulfilled at any given time.Finding your passion is a deeply personal and rewarding journey that can enhance your sense of purpose and joy in life. By exploring your interests, values and experiences, you can uncover what truly makes you tick and find ways to incorporate that passion into your daily life.Remember, the pursuit of passion is not a one-size-fits-all path but a unique adventure that is yours to explore. Embrace the journey with an open heart and mind, and let your passion lead you to a more fulfilling and meaningful life.


Related: How to Realistically Make Money From Your PassionUnlocking wealth: 10 tips on monetizing your passionIn today's dynamic world, pursuing your passion is no longer just a lofty dream; it's a viable path to financial success. With the advent of the digital age, opportunities to monetize what you love doing have multiplied, enabling many to turn their hobbies into profitable ventures. Here are ten strategic tips to help you navigate the journey of making money from your passion.1. Identify your nicheThe first step in monetizing your passion is to clearly identify your niche. A niche is a specific segment of a market that you can serve better than others. The more specific your niche, the less competition you will face, and the more likely you are to stand out to a dedicated customer base. For instance, instead of just ""cooking,"" you could specialize in ""gluten-free baking for busy parents."" This specificity can make your offering more attractive.


2. Build a strong brandYour brand is not just your logo or your website; it's the total experience customers have with your business. It includes your story, your values and the emotions people associate with your work. Building a strong, authentic brand around your passion can create a loyal community of customers and advocates. Share your journey, challenges and successes to connect with your audience on a personal level.3. Create a business planEven the most passionate pursuits need a solid business plan. Your plan should outline your business model, market analysis, financial projections and marketing strategies. It doesn't have to be overly complicated, but it should give you a clear roadmap of how you intend to make money from your passion. This step can also help you identify potential challenges and opportunities for growth.


4. Leverage social mediaSocial media is a powerful tool for reaching and engaging with your target audience. Platforms like Instagram, YouTube and Pinterest are particularly effective for visual and creative fields, while LinkedIn and X can be great for more professional and service-oriented passions. Share valuable content that showcases your expertise, tells your story and builds your community.5. Diversify your income streamsRelying on a single income stream can be risky, especially in the early stages of your business. Look for ways to diversify your income. This could mean selling products, offering services, creating online courses or even affiliate marketing. For example, if you're passionate about photography, you could sell prints, offer photography workshops and create a photography course.


6. Offer exceptional valueTo stand out in a crowded market, you need to offer exceptional value to your customers. This could be through the quality of your products, the uniqueness of your services or the depth of your knowledge. Always aim to exceed expectations and provide something that people can't get anywhere else.7. Network and collaborateNetworking and collaboration can open up new opportunities to monetize your passion. Attend industry events, join online communities, and connect with other professionals in your field. Collaborations can also help you reach a wider audience, whether it's through guest blogging, social media takeovers or co-creating products.


8. Learn and adaptThe path to monetizing your passion is rarely a straight line. Be prepared to learn from your experiences, listen to feedback and adapt your strategies as needed. Stay updated with the latest trends in your industry, and don't be afraid to pivot your business model if necessary.9. Focus on quality customer serviceExcellent customer service can differentiate your business and turn customers into repeat buyers and brand advocates. Be responsive, solve problems quickly, and always strive to provide a positive experience. Personal touches, such as handwritten thank-you notes or personalized recommendations, can make a big difference.10. Stay passionate and persistentFinally, the most important tip is to stay passionate and persistent. Turning your passion into a profitable venture requires hard work, dedication and resilience. There will be challenges and setbacks, but it's your passion that will keep you going. Remember why you started, and don't lose sight of your love for what you do.Related: How to Turn Your Passion Into Your Dream JobMonetizing your passion is not just about making money; it's about creating a fulfilling life where work doesn't feel like work. By following these ten tips, you can take practical steps toward turning your passion into a sustainable income source. Remember, the journey of monetizing your passion is as rewarding as the destination. Embrace the process, learn from every experience, and celebrate your progress. Do not chase the money. Instead, chase your passion and the side effect will be money in your bank account because it only appears as the direct result of an energy exchange. Here's to turning your passion into your paycheck!

52,Embrace Change or Miss Out On Money — 5 Trends to Know in Venture Capital This Year,"Mar 5, 2024",Alexander Galitsky,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/5-trends-to-look-out-for-in-venture-capital-this-year/470158,"
There are a lot of words to describe 2023, but ""predictable"" isn't one of them. Factors that range from broader public funding to the surge in AI capabilities have caused tectonic shifts in the venture capital landscape. It's time to explore this new world and draw a map of new challenges and opportunities. These are the trends that will be the most influential in 2024.Related: You Need to Do These 5 Steps If You Want to Survive the Difficult Funding Market1. Quality will trump quantityStart-ups have more funding choices than ever. Venture capitalists must compete with cryptocurrency and crowdfunding when looking for start-up partners. According to recent surveys, only about one in 20 new firms depended on venture capital for their start.



VCs can only bet on a few companies, hoping one will succeed. Instead, VCs must be choosier, limiting themselves to the most innovative companies. There will be greater competition, especially at the pre-seed stage. Some firms that, at an earlier age, might have gone the VC route will go directly to the audience they want to serve.Venture capital investors must show firms why they are the right choice for a partnership. Show a history of good guidance and trust to help them choose you.


You, of course, need to be just as selective with your offers. Since there is more competition, there will likely be fewer opportunities to go around. You need to be sure you are picking the winners. Luckily, the other four trends on the list will help savvy VCs come out on top.2. Public web dataFinding quality companies that need a flush of outside funding can be challenging. The wealth of data now available can help VCs winnow through the stacks. Public web data can be used to build models to predict a product or company's potential. It can track a firm's rising or falling popularity.Data, including social media posts, job postings, satellite imagery, and more, can all contribute to a landscape picture. VCs no longer need to make their best guesses based on traditional assets like press releases and financial statements.Understanding how to gather and translate this data into a narrative and predictions for the future is vital.


3. Automation and new tech adoptionAutomation technology makes new firms more efficient than ever. And consumers are always happy to find solutions that make their lives easier.The result is a boom in service areas like fintech and office technology. Consider the changes during the pandemic shutdowns: people were limited to online baking and remote work or learning. Solutions that people were wary of before are now familiar. This can mean new opportunities that build on those technologies.Related: From Mundane to Magic: The Incredible Benefits of Automation for Small Business Owners4. Think zebras, not unicornsWho wouldn't love to find a unicorn? Everyone is looking for those companies that, with some innovation, can become a billion-dollar business. But that's the problem: everyone's hunting for unicorns. The competition is so steep it can contribute to unicorns being overvalued.


Instead, look for zebras. These companies are worth under a billion, but they show the potential for sustainable income for years. This sustainable nature means you can diversify your strategies and create more income.5. Greater diversificationKeeping profitable will mean looking into new areas globally and in a broader range of companies.The digital world means we are not limited geographically the way we once were. Communication with partners in every corner of the planet is now possible. Instead of being stuck in Silicon Valley, you can work with firms anywhere from São Paulo to Nairobi.Explore different niches. Learn all you can about new industries. By expanding your range of knowledge, you'll increase your ability to identify potential winners. Bonus if you are looking at new firms that have yet to attract the attention of other VCs.


Look at different firm sizes. There is room for unicorns when you find them, but also for zebras. A mix means more opportunities to see the ones that will be a big success.The venture capital sphere has seen significant changes in recent years. There is no reason to expect that 2025 will have any fewer surprises. The landscape is changing, and the successful investors will be the ones who embrace the change and move with it. Putting everything we've learned into play allows us to open our eyes to new possibilities and find new opportunities for success.

53,15 Weird and Wonderful Side Hustles You Never Knew Existed,"Mar 5, 2024",Amanda Breen and Frances Dodds,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/15-weird-and-wonderful-side-hustles-you-never-knew-existed/470122,"
If you've been hearing a lot about side hustles lately, you're not alone. The term has slipped into our common consciousness in recent years—so much so that Merriam-Webster added it to its dictionary in 2022. ""Side-hustle is a word on the move,"" the entry says. ""Although the precise definition of this term is still in a bit of flux, it appears to be centering on 'work performed for income supplementary to one's primary job.'"" ""In a bit of flux"" is right. Having a side hustle means many things to many people. Some rely on the extra cash to pay their bills, others want a fun hobby that makes a little money, and still others want to build an entirely new business or career.A 2023 Bankrate survey found that nearly 2 in 5 of all American adults now have side hustles, and more than half of all Gen Zers and millennials. Among these younger side-hustlers, 1 in 5 Gen Zers and 1 in 4 millennials hope to one day make their side gig their full-time job. Factors like the normalization of remote work and a general sense of economic instability have surely fueled this trend, but one thing is clear: It's not slowing down. As one side-hustler, Justin Cambra, told us: ""In today's world, stability is from multiple sources of income. I'm trying to generate as many revenue streams as possible."" Hopefully, the following ideas will help you do just that.Breed bugs.

54,Outsource or DIY? 6 Signs It's Time for Virtual Assistance for Your Business,"Mar 4, 2024",Murali Nethi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/6-signs-its-time-for-virtual-assistance-for-your-business/470028,"
So you've started your own company from home doing whatever you're passionate about, like making YouTube videos or selling handmade jewelry online. That's awesome! It can be satisfying to build something with your own two hands. But as customers and orders start piling in, you find you don't have enough hours to keep up.That's where outsourcing, or getting help from virtual assistants (VAs), comes in. As cool as it is being a one-person team at first, there comes a time when growth means getting additional support. But how do you know when that time has arrived? Here are a few signs it may be worth outsourcing some tasks rather than trying to do everything solo:1. You're working long hours — but not being efficientWe've all been there — it's midnight, and you've been glued to your laptop for hours doing social media posts, data entry, or customer service. While dedication is great, constant long days aren't sustainable and may lower your productivity. When you find yourself wasting time redoing work because you're overtired, it's a sign your efforts could be better spent focusing on higher-level tasks.

Tasks are piling upIf you open your to-do list and it feels never-ending, that's a hint you may need to offload some work. Are invoices, emails, orders, or other administrative things starting to stack up because you don't have time to keep up? Outsourcing mundane yet necessary tasks can help you get back on track.


3. You're spending too much time on low-value workAs business owners, our limited hours are best spent on work that drives growth and revenue, such as product design, marketing strategies, partnership deals, etc. But it's easy to get bogged down doing data entry, social media posting, or customer service replies that don't lever your unique talents. VAs allow you to delegate commodity tasks and focus on the work only you can do.Related: Wasted Employee Time Adds Up: Here's How to Fix It4. You're not able to commit fully to new opportunitiesIf a promising partnership or project comes your way, but you have to turn it down due to being too swamped already, that's an issue. Not taking worthwhile chances can limit your growth. By outsourcing mundane work, you free up precious time and mental bandwidth to seize any opportunities that come your way.5. Your work-life balance is sufferingWhile passion for your business is great, constantly working long hours isn't healthy or sustainable long-term. Are you missing out on family time, friend commitments, or hobbies and interests because you're chained to your laptop? Outsourcing gives back some of your personal life so you don't burn out.


Related: Too Many Responsibilities? This Simple Life Hack Will Help You Reclaim Your Life6. You can't take a vacation without panickingIf taking even a few days off causes you anxiety about falling behind, it's evident you need support. Business owners deserve downtime to rest and unwind so they can stay fresh. VA help means you don't have to work alone.So, in summary — if your time is increasingly spent on low-level, repetitive tasks at the expense of strategic work, it's likely a sign your business needs assistance to thrive. The good news is high-quality, cost-effective virtual help from places worldwide has made outsourcing more accessible than ever for solopreneurs and small businesses alike.But how do you know what exactly to outsource and how to find and manage virtual help? Here are a few guidelines:


Assess Your Workflow and Define Outsourceable Tasks — Take a step back to analyze how you currently spend your days. What repetitive jobs could a VA handle, such as data entry, customer service, and social media posting? Make a list of tangible, clearly outlined tasks that don't require your unique expertise.Consider Costs vs Your Hourly Rate — Calculate how much your own time is worth per hour based on your desired salary. VA labor rates are generally far lower, so determine if outsourcing could save you money in the long run.Research VA Companies and Online Marketplaces — Sites like Upwork, Fiverr, and LinkedIn provide profiles of hundreds of VAs worldwide with different specialties, languages, and rates. Read reviews to find out trustworthy freelancers.Be Ultra-Clear in Your Job Description — Whether you post on a marketplace or directly hire, leave no room for confusion by writing out very precisely what's required, including examples, templates, schedules, and style guidelines, if applicable. Clear communication upfront prevents misunderstandings down the line.Try out Candidates on a Small Scale. First — Before committing to an ongoing role, assign small, contained projects to vet candidates and see their skills, work ethic, and communication in action. Pay for these trials so they're treated as real work.Use Project Management Software — Whether it's Trello, Asana, or your own CRM, digitally tracking tasks helps ensure smooth delegation and collaboration. VAs should check in regularly through these tools rather than loose email threads.Maintain Open Communication — As the boss from afar, be available by phone or video call for any questions from VAs. Praise a job done well so they stay motivated while constructively addressing any issues. Maintaining good communication ensures quality control on their end, too.If you feel your business has outgrown solo DIY efforts and you're ready to bring on supportive help, consider signing up FREE for Hana Retail as your retail POS system today. It could be just what you need to gain back valuable time and focus on high-level growth without the hassle of finding and managing outsourced talent on your own.

56,9 Hidden Reasons Your Customers Will Leave You,"Feb 23, 2024",Murali Nethi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/9-hidden-reasons-your-customers-are-leaving-you/469516,"
Losing customers without understanding why can be incredibly frustrating and damaging for a business. As much as we like to think we know our customers and have our fingers on the pulse of their needs, there are often hidden reasons behind losing customers that catch us by surprise.I want to shed light on subtle but common issues that cause customers to walk away, even when they seem satisfied on the surface. I aim to help you identify potential pitfalls early so you can course-correct before significant revenue and trust erosion occurs.Related: 5 Reasons Why Your Business Is Losing Customers



1. Poor product quality or featuresDelivering a quality product that meets customers' needs is necessary. If your product is buggy, flawed, or lacks key features your market expects, customers will quickly lose patience and go elsewhere.You may believe your product is great because no one complains. But a lack of complaints doesn't equal delight. You must proactively solicit customer feedback through surveys, user testing, and analysis of support logs to understand product weaknesses and prevent defections. Don't assume no news is good news.


2. Weak onboarding/implementationOnboarding is a make-or-break moment. Customers never gain value if your initial product setup and training are complex and frustrating.Study your analytics data — if few trial users convert, your onboarding needs improvement. Tasks should be simple and intuitive. Invest in guides, checklists, videos, and live coaching to ensure customers successfully adopt your product from day one.Related: Are You Guilty of Poor Onboarding? The Consequences Are Worse Than You Think.3. No value realizationCustomers buy for expected outcomes — not features. If clients don't achieve promised outcomes within your advertised timeline, they'll question the ROI and stop using you.


Set proper expectations upfront about realistic timeframes and customer effort required. Then, confirm value achievement through executive business reviews or outcomes-focused check-ins at 30/60/90 days. A little reassurance goes a long way.4. Account neglectThe adage ""The squeaky wheel gets the grease"" applies to customer success. You likely focus most of your attention on your newest and largest accounts. But neglecting existing customers is risky — without care, they defect.Review account usage data and reach out to languishing accounts. Small gestures like an email check-in or contract renewal call remind customers you care and make it easy to ask questions. This helps you diagnose issues before it's too late.5. Poor communicationOut of sight doesn't mean top of mind. Infrequent or overly formal communication causes customers to disengage. They may forget about your product altogether or question the partnership.


Create customer touch plans mapping out regular communications across multiple channels - email, social media, newsletters, and events. Tailor messaging to each audience segment's needs using demos, testimonials, debates, and research. Consistent, valuable engagement keeps you visible.Related: 7 Leadership Communication Blunders That Could Make or Break Your Company6. Unclear pricingHidden fees, complex pricing metrics, and surprise renewals with price hikes destroy trust quickly. Customers want pricing predictability and transparency around what they pay for.Audit your pricing structure and customer-facing contracts for clarity — bundle value-added offerings like premium support or training into editions. You can also offer pricing calculators and pre-purchase price estimates. Proactively notify customers of renewals and model options. Fair, clear, and flexible pricing increases retention.


7. Poor issue resolutionCustomers understand software has bugs. What frustrates them is a lack of responsiveness when issues arise. If clients encounter repeated problems and support tickets drag on for weeks without meaningful updates, they'll quit you fast.Empower support teams to escalate, diagnose, and patch priority issues rapidly. For chronic troubles, appoint technical account managers as a single point of contact. They can explain workaround steps and set expectations while engineering improves the product.Proactively inform customers about resolution timeframes, actions taken, and new releases addressing their problems. Transparency and accountability retain trust despite setbacks.Related: 8 Reasons Why We Need Entrepreneurs Now More Than Ever


8. Feature bloat and complexityIn SaaS products especially, featuritis is a real problem. Adding niche capabilities bloats interfaces, complicates user journeys, and slows system performance over time. Customers cannot achieve their goals efficiently when the UI becomes cluttered and confusing.Conduct feature pruning every few release cycles, sunsetting low-value functionality. Prioritize enhancements, delivering core outcomes for 80%+ of your users. Field support teams are an excellent source of input on areas of recurring complexity.9. Ignoring churn signalsEarly warning signs like contract renegotiation requests, skipped payments, and declined credit cards hint customers may quit you. But do you act on those signals? Customers assume you don't care or notice unless their actions trigger consequences.Build reports to track key churn indicators and credit trends. Establish a workflow to rapidly intervene when signals appear - friendly check-ins, need assessments, discounts, or free extensions show customers they aren't invisible.


The good news is that diagnosing and addressing these retention risks is achievable, especially if you systematically map your workflows and touchpoints from a consumer perspective.

      Key Takeaways    



        Gooljar began arranging the flowers his roommate brought home from Trader Joe's in 2020.
      


        He grew the IRIS blossom Instagram account to more than 40,000 followers and has made over $500,000 in just a few years. 
      


        Gooljar is on a mission to keep growing and lift up other diverse creators along the way.
      












""I've always been an artist,"" Rob Gooljar, founder of IRIS blossom, says. ""I've always been a creative person. I've done a lot of mixed media, painting, drawing, music, photography, but my medium shifted to floral.""In 2020, Gooljar was struggling with depression while working toward his Ph.D. in urban, social and economic geography, and he credits his then-roommate Becca Whittier as ""the catalyst"" for his new creative outlet. Whittier would bring flowers home from Trader Joe's, and Gooljar would arrange them.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom



Arranging flowers became a passion, and Gooljar decided to start an Instagram to bring others along on his artistic journey, especially those who might feel excluded from an industry known for lacking diversity. The average florist in the U.S. is 47 years old, and most of them are women (77.2%) and white (77.3%), according to data from Zippia.With his social media platform, Gooljar put out the kind of representation he wanted to see: ""Hey, I'm a queer Black florist — kind of, not really. I'm just playing with flowers, but watch me, and let's see what happens.""


What happened was IRIS blossom, named for Gooljar's rescue pitbull Iris, turned into a successful business.Related: For Years, This Black Founder Learned an Uncommon But Essential Craft on the Side. Now His Creations Are Beloved By Celebrity Chefs — and Can Sell for More Than $1,000.People saw Gooljar's posts on the Instagram account, which grew from zero to more than 40,000 followers, and began asking to buy arrangements. In the past three-and-a-half years, the self-funded company has fulfilled thousands of orders and made more than $500,000 — but it's just the beginning.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossomGooljar is expanding IRIS blossom to South Florida, where he moved last year, while Whittier and two employees continue to helm the company's operations in Greater Charlotte. Meanwhile, he's working with another business partner, Jihann Hanchell, to get IRIS blossom's sister business, island IRIS, off the ground in Turks and Caicos. The idea there is to offer ""full-scale design"" for luxury events.""He was really kind, but looked at me and was like, 'Well, you're not going to get a business loan.'""Gooljar isn't entering into these floral ventures ""blindly,"" he notes. He also has a holding company and a consulting firm. Still, despite Gooljar's entrepreneurial savvy and IRIS's track record of success and growth, its journey hasn't been without some serious challenges. Two of the biggest barriers, according to Gooljar? Funding and space. And in the floral industry, those tend to go hand in hand.


""It's very hard for small businesses to exist in Charlotte without being pre-existing,"" Gooljar says. ""Pre-existing meaning that A, you come from money or B, you have somebody to help you. So we worked out of our two-bedroom apartment [when] we were doing events that were $15,000-$16,000, and we were doing it on our kitchen island that was six-and-a-half feet long. We had buckets all over the house.""IRIS blossom has been ""100% self-funded"" from the start and able to accomplish all it has thanks to its supportive clients, Gooljar says. The revenue earned goes back into the company's growth, a strategy that's helped it achieve its milestone of $500,000 in revenue in just a few years. But in the early days, Gooljar did try to secure a business loan — and was turned away.Related: This Black Founder Stayed True to His Triple 'Win' Strategy to Build a $1 Billion Business""I had a white banker in Charlotte, and he was really kind, but looked at me and was like, 'Well, you're not going to get a business loan because you have to be in business for a few years,'"" Gooljar recalls. ""And then I would ask, 'Well, how are people who are just starting a business getting a loan?' 'Oh, they probably have an online presence, or they probably just go into it with money, and then they can put up their own money.' That kind of quasi, not-really-plausible explanation about funding and gatekeeping funding.""


Affording space in Charlotte remained a significant obstacle. Eventually, Gooljar and Whittier moved into a three-bedroom apartment. But there still wasn't enough room for the rapidly growing business, and Gooljar didn't want to spend all the money they made on rent. At one point in their search for a reliable place to store their expensive, perishable materials, someone offered to rent them an Airstream travel trailer for thousands of dollars a month sans air conditioning or running water.Now, Gooljar lives and works out of a house in Florida.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom


""It's cool when people look at me, and they're wondering if my business is working out: All I can do is smile and say, 'You know, it is.'""Throughout his time building IRIS blossom, Gooljar says he's ""stepped on a few toes"" within the gatekept industry and has had to field some pointed questions: ""Well, who are you?"" ""Is your business going to last?"" ""How's your little business going?"" ""How's your flower thing going?""But none of that has deterred Gooljar, who comes from a ""very long line of people working hard.""""My grandma cut sugar cane for 40 years in Trinidad,"" Gooljar says. ""My parents came here with nothing and worked and tried their best. And I'm trying to change that tide. So yeah, it's cool when people look at me, and they're wondering if my business is working out: All I can do is smile and say, 'You know, it is, and I'm putting in the work for it.'""

Now She Has $25 Million in Funding — and Smart Advice for Fellow Black Women Founders.Gooljar admits that ""there's still a long way to go"" in transforming the industry into a more inclusive space, but he's happy to report that other diverse floral businesses popped up in Charlotte after his own — because ""there's room for everybody.""""I see some of the landscape changing, especially when I go into the floral cooler, and I see somebody else that's Black, or I go into the floral cooler, and I see somebody that's young, or I go in there, and I see somebody with pink hair or something,"" Gooljar says.""You have to face those obstacles and keep pushing because there's always going to be people who are preying on your downfall.""Next, Gooljar plans to implement a national subscription program for IRIS, a sort of ""color-by-numbers"" approach. He'll ship the flowers nationwide, and customers can follow along with his arrangements via video. ""I want people who don't feel creative in their current jobs or current lives to get that creative outlet just the same way that I needed that outlet,"" he says.In the long-term, Gooljar's goal is to collaborate with a tech company to make it possible for people to order IRIS flowers on an app ""like they do an Uber."" But even though Gooljar envisions IRIS as a wide-scale service allowing employees to run ""little mini IRIS blossoms out of their own homes,"" quality remains a top priority.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom

It's not always easy, and Gooljar admits there have been ""plenty of times"" he wanted to give up, but he's always kept going — never wavering in his belief that great things are on the other side.""You can ask anyone that I know, and they will tell you that they don't know anybody that grinds the way that I do,"" Gooljar says. ""And I'm not saying that you just have to throw yourself into everything all the time. But I think a big part of this is that you have to face those obstacles and keep pushing because there's always going to be people who are preying on your downfall. There are always going to be roadblocks. There are always going to be obstacles. There are always going to be things to climb, but you have to just keep going.""

        Nelson's first massive beanbag took three weeks to make and quickly caught people's attention. 
      


        Nelson sold the first beanbags to fellow college students, then branched out to boat shows, trade shows and more. 
      


        Once Lovesac had about 40 store locations, Nelson appeared on Richard Branson's reality TV show and secured a $1 million investment. 
      


        Growing the company from that point was filled with more twists and turns, but Lovesac continues to see rapid growth today with an estimated $700 million in annual sales.

It's 1995, and I'm 18, sitting on my parents' couch in Salt Lake City, Utah. One morning, I had an idea and thought, Wouldn't it be funny to make a giant beanbag chair — like the size of my entire living room floor? So, I got off the couch, drove down to the fabric store and bought enough fabric for something that massive. Then, I began sewing it together. It took three weeks to fill it up with soft stuff I cut up from around the house — but everywhere I took it, people loved it and begged me to make them one. Eventually, I did. It cost me $25 to register the name, and in October 1998, Lovesac officially began as a company.Related: The Side Hustle She Started in Her Princeton Dorm Room Led to a $510 Million Business: 'Don't Take No for an Answer'What were some of the first steps you took to get that side hustle off the ground?When I started college at the University of Utah, I lived in my parents' basement, which was the perfect place to roll out huge, long rolls of fabric. My buddies and I would make the Sacs in the basement and sell them at our college. We quickly became known as the ""Lovesac guys"" around campus, with even the frats and sororities buying a few Sacs for their houses. From there, we were a fixture at any event we could find — boat shows, home shows, car shows, Oktoberfest — and this is how we grew the company in those earliest days.Were there challenges that came with running the side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those?After two or three years of running Lovesac as a side hustle in college, it was apparent that it would not make any real money in its current form. In fact, it probably cost me money to keep it alive. Sure, we'd make a profit selling the product — but then the van would break. Or the foam shredder would break. Or the state would fine me and my buddies for some workplace violation. The bottom line is: Building a business is hard, and it can take a lot of money to make it to some kind of meaningful critical mass.


As we grew, I was working harder than ever. It was draining, but I couldn't help but give it one last shot at a trade show in Chicago, hoping to get to the next level. One of the biggest retailers in the U.S. placed an order for 12,000 Sacs, not knowing that it was just me and a buddy working out of a rundown building with a wood chipper as a foam shredder.Despite every inefficiency, we completed the order, but then we realized we had no other big customers to sell to. We went to the furniture stores, but they all laughed at us and said it was a stupid idea — so we decided to open our own store. The first Lovesac store opened on November 17, 2001.Image Credit: Courtesy of LovesacRelated: The 'Easy' Side Hustle He Started in College Hit More Than $1 Million in Revenue — and Taught Him 3 Business Lessons He Still Uses TodayWhen did you decide to take the business from side hustle to full-time venture?Our first store changed everything — this is when I pivoted the company to a full-time venture. Consumers were obsessed with Lovesac. They came in, bought Sacs, flopped down and hung out with friends. The product was the best sales pitch we could give. We were doing six figures in just the first few weeks, and I had never seen money like that. We promptly ran off to open the second store in Provo, Utah, then Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Southern California. Growth went ballistic.What were some of the biggest hurdles that came up over the years once you were running the business full-time? How did you overcome those?We had grown to 35-40 locations when I got recruited to be on Richard Branson's reality TV show, The Rebel Billionaire, in 2005. It was a national primetime show on Fox Network, and I won a $1 million investment! Of course, I was $2 million in debt, having built this growing retail chain, but what are you going to do? We took the winnings, paid off some debt and raised more money through venture capital. However, the venture capitalists wanted to bankrupt the company and start over cleanly through Chapter 11 reorganization. I was devastated. We had made it all this way, yet somehow, the only way forward was to begin again.


We moved the company to Stamford, Connecticut, downsized the staff to a skeleton crew and started over with just 12 locations and about 12 employees at our tiny new HQ on the East Coast. It was the right move in the long run. We learned, focused and built the company back up to 30, 40, then 50 locations. Some people might have coasted after that, but I got another wild idea. Ironically, this one happened because of a couch, too.In that first store, we had a couch in the corner to show the Sacs in a living room-type environment. We noticed that customers always asked to buy the couch, but it was too big to sell. So, the idea was, What if we could shrink down this couch the way we shrink down our Sacs? And that's how the concept of Sactionals was born.Related: This College Student Started a Side Hustle So He Didn't Have to Bartend Until 4 am. Now He's Earning $7,000 a Month — and Putting It to Good Use.In 2012, Lovesac was named the fastest-growing furniture company in the U.S. by Furniture Today — what made that rapid growth possible? How has the company approached scaling over the years?Around this time, I recognized that if we were going to really compete, we needed to pivot the business. With this in mind, I changed our focus to becoming a direct-to-consumer furniture brand with Sactionals as the primary driver. I took a risk and invested in local and then national TV advertising for the Sactionals, along with every emerging digital approach. Sactionals quickly became the fastest-selling couch solution in the United States. Lovesac expanded to nearly 80 locations, and then [we] took the company public in 2018 with $100 million in sales.After you go public, the sky's the limit. The company was worth $200-300 million overnight. It felt like a dream; I couldn't believe it. We grew to hundreds of locations by the 2020s. We have thousands of employees, and we've been named the fastest-growing furniture company in the U.S. numerous times. Our sales have multiplied and will likely grow to a billion dollars and beyond. The Sactionals gave us a new future. Their rapid adoption revealed that people love the idea of things being built to last a lifetime and designed to evolve with you throughout your life. We're proving that planned obsolescence was the wrong way to make a brand that lasts. We call this new approach to innovation Designed for Life, and it will inform everything we do from here on out.Image Credit: Courtesy of LovesacWhat is the company's current valuation? How much revenue does it bring in today?


Looking back at the past year, Lovesac's growth and performance results are a testament to the resilience of our brand and disruptive business model that has consistently delivered category outperformance and customer loyalty. Through a challenging year for our category, we've been able to maintain momentum with our commitment to product innovation, compelling marketing and a highly productive omnichannel footprint. These strategies continue to drive consumer demand and further distinguish our unique brand from a crowded market. Looking ahead, we believe that we are poised to continue investing in the future with an accelerated pace of expansion and innovation to further garner customer enthusiasm.Prior to reporting year-end results, Wall Street analysts estimate Lovesac's sales for the fiscal year that just ended to come in at around $700 million, with high single-digit adjusted EBITDA profitability. The company has fluctuated in multiples and market cap valuations over the past four years hovering in the $300-400 million range, peaking at over $1 billion in 2021 when the home category hit all-time highs during the pandemic.Related: The Side Hustle He Saw on YouTube Earned Him a Multi-Year Deal With Sony and Income Streams Generating Tens of ThousandsWhen you look to your company's future, what are you most excited about?At Lovesac, innovation is at the center of our design philosophy as we continue to prioritize developing breakthrough technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the furniture category. Challenging traditional definitions of comfort and home style is what has set the Lovesac brand apart since its inception, and over the past few years, we've been working with a variety of high-end fashion brands in the space to create something truly unique in the market. Anti Social Social Club, Jeremy Scott, alice + olivia and KidSuper are among the brands that have collaborated on covers and accoutrements for our two signature styles. We look forward to creating a blend of fashion-forward design and unparalleled comfort that speaks to the modern consumer.What are some of the biggest lessons you've learned over the course of your entrepreneurial journey?In my new memoir Let Me Save You 25 Years: Mistakes, Miracles, and Lessons from the Lovesac Story, I detail the ups and downs of my 25-year saga building the Lovesac business from its days as a college side hustle to a successful IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange and beyond. If you can learn from my mistakes, however, then perhaps your ambitions, big or small, can be realized in less than the 25-plus years it has taken me to finally learn something and get somewhere with mine.Here are some of the biggest lessons I've learned:


1. Heed what the experts have to say, but on occasion, you need to trust your gut.2. There comes a point before any major change in your career, business or personal life where you can greatly improve your odds for good outcomes by making a bold decision to ditch the safety net and fully commit.3. Play along the way, taking the time you need to keep yourself relaxed and sharp.4. You're no good to anyone as a miserable, uptight workaholic.Related: He Started a Side Hustle in His Dorm Room With 'a Bunch of Ingredients From Amazon and a Crockpot' — Now It's a $56 Million Brand in Walmarts NationwideDo you have any advice for others interested in starting a side hustle or business of their own?The entrepreneurial journey I've faced over the past quarter-century has been full of triumphant victories and humbling defeats, born from sweat, tears and relentless determination. With my new podcast series and memoir, I look forward to creating and fostering a sense of community through these channels and shining a light on real, raw stories from industry trailblazers on the movements they have built to bring valuable insights and knowledge to those that seek it.Growing Lovesac into what it is has taken my entire adult life and is the hardest thing I've ever done. I have so many memories and have built so many lifelong friends throughout this journey that make all the stumbles, roadblocks, sleepless nights and unrelenting stress worth it. My advice for anyone considering starting down the road of being a founder would be this: Get off the couch! Trust your instincts, and just keep going. That life-changing moment could be right around the corner, and the last thing you want to do is turn back just before you arrive.Entrepreneurship is a never-ending pursuit, but the journey is the gift. With an open mind, an honest heart, some ambition, time, help and a little bit of luck, all things are possible.

Netflix, Instagram, Slack. These three companies have one thing in common: Their initial business plan wasn't sustainable, and they became the formidable companies they are today because they chose to pivot in a new direction.Pivoting in startup culture is a strategic business decision to shift course to capitalize on a new need in the market that your product or service can meet with calculated changes. Doing so successfully requires high organizational adaptability and flexibility to achieve long-term success.In a business world that is constantly fluctuating, pulling the plug when things don't go as planned is an easy out. However, successful entrepreneurs and investors who truly understand their markets can see innovative ways to meet new opportunities by tweaking current business models.



Is it time to pivot in your business? Let's see when it makes sense, how to do it well and what it looks like in both success and failure.Related: Knowing When — and How — to Pivot Is Key to Your Business' Survival. Here's What You Need to Do.


Time to make a changeI have lost track of how many businesses I've seen with everything set up for success, only to have the market pull the rug out from under them. Even the most business-savvy and meticulously prepared ventures can be surprised by economic changes.From market shifts to new technological advancements to drastic economic hits, numerous external factors can force companies to consider pivoting their business model. Internal factors such as plummeting performance metrics or shifts in consumer behaviors may indicate it's time to change.The truth is that few successful businesses got to where they are today following the same strategic plan they started with. While always maintaining your core values — what makes your company unique — keeping your organization agile is essential. You should always prepare to make a necessary shift that will keep your company relevant and financially stable.Decision timeRecognizing the need to pivot and deciding to execute are two different things. There are many factors to consider, and several stakeholders will likely need to sign off. That's why conducting extensive market research, data analysis and forecasting is essential before deciding next steps.


Some businesses might be experiencing a rough patch that will even out with a few tweaks and perseverance. For others, a drastic overhaul of their business model may be necessary for survival. There's no instant solution or easy answer. A decision of this magnitude requires due diligence and belief in your team and product.A great example of pivoting based on informed decision-making is Netflix.Initially, it was a mail-order service for DVDs in the early 2000s. Even though it had a corner in the at-home entertainment market, it felt the strain of growing competition. While executives had their eyes on the current industry trends, they also saw an entirely new, untapped market to conquer.In 2007, it launched its streaming platform, where many of the same movies and shows they sent in the mail were now ready to enjoy on demand. They pioneered the streaming revolution and continued to adapt as they began developing new and original content.


Yes, many others eventually followed suit, but the point is that Netflix executives understood the market and their company so intimately they knew when it was time to pivot and executed it in a way that disrupted their industry and kept their company's profits rising.Related: What Tennis, Microsoft and Starting My Own Company Taught Me About the Mind's Role in Achieving SuccessSuccessful implementationThe next phase of the pivot is setting everything in motion. Implementation can be one of the most challenging aspects because your business will likely face scrutiny and backlash from all angles, including the inside.This is the phase where clear, effective communication becomes critical. You will feel resistance from your employees who are uncomfortable with change. Stakeholders who weren't involved in the decision will feel slighted. Industry pundits may think this change is outlandish. Your company's messaging and resolve must be unwavering regardless of who says what.


If you've done the proper research, considered all the options and scenarios and have buy-in from the appropriate parties, no other forces should change your stance unless there's a legitimate threat to your business's future.Communicating this shift from the point of empathy and care while respectfully sharing the need for a pivot and how it will work is essential to keeping the process steady. Pivoting your business is never easy, but planning and implementing the process effectively can be successful.There are no guaranteesNotice how I said it ""can"" be successful. Like your initial business plan, it could still fall flat even if laid out and executed perfectly.The unfortunate part of business is that there's always risk involved. Nothing is ever promised. Yes, pivoting could save your business from failing — or it could lead you down a path that seems promising but is yet another dead end. If that's the case, learn from it. It could mean the end of the line or another detour on the road to your company's true potential. Regardless, don't let a single failure go by without gaining insights for improvement or wisdom for what does and doesn't work.


Failure feels miserable, yes, but it's an incredible teacher. Even if your pivot is successful, that doesn't mean you won't have to stay on your toes, ready to adapt as the market changes again. No business is ever safe. Industries shift. Competition grows fierce.Never stop innovating. Don't get comfortable. Keep your eyes on the path forward, watching for whatever obstacle is next.Change isn't a bad thing. Pivoting isn't a sign of weakness or failure. The leaders who are open to change of direction tend to be most successful. They're the ones who are vigilant and ready to pounce on the next opportunity before anyone else knows it's there.Stay flexible, be ready to adapt and when the time is right, pivot well.

        Challenges in managing a client-first business and a passion for solving them with technology inspired Cohen-Shohet to found GlossGenius in 2015.

Danielle Cohen-Shohet.When did you start your side hustle in the self-care industry, and what inspired it?



My interest began when I did freelance makeup artistry out of my Princeton University dorm room. I've always had a passion for design and art, and for as long as I can remember, I have been entrepreneurial. I have a tendency to want to become an expert at something I do, so when I became interested in makeup, I took it much further than most and started a side hustle in college. During that time, my twin sister and I also pursued a digital receipts payments venture. Those were both enriching experiences; however, I had no idea at the time that I'd later take a leap and combine those interests to start a software payments company now worth over $510 million.Related: These Sisters Started a Side Hustle After a 'Light Bulb' Moment Standing in Line for Coffee — Now Their Business Has Done $100 Million in Total Sales


What were some of the first steps you took to get that side hustle off the ground? I learned voraciously, strived to be the best and just rolled up my sleeves to start. Back when I was in college, makeup artistry tutorials were just starting to be democratized on YouTube, so I dove into them and just got my hands dirty practicing. I drilled college classmates and friends for feedback and just kept getting better from there. It sounds simple, but these first steps helped me succeed faster.Were there any challenges that came with running the side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those? Anything that you can grow from will have challenges. While doing makeup artistry, I experienced first-hand the pain points that many of our GlossGenius business customers face today: time management, coordinating schedules and growing a client base without the proper infrastructure, just to name a few. I dove headfirst into solving these challenges with manual spreadsheets and tools that I would hack together, which sparked the idea for what would later become GlossGenius. I wanted to provide other business owners with best-in-class technology and infrastructure that would make it easier to run a business.


How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue? On average, how much revenue did it bring in? For me, it was originally more so about satisfying a creative interest than revenue. It took several months before I started to earn real revenue, and it was meaningful enough to cover a lot of living expenses while in college.Related: She Spent Her Honeymoon Working on a Side Hustle. It Raised $35 Million and Counts Celebrities Among Its Investors.When did you decide to transition into startup mode and found GlossGenius, and what motivated that move?


After understanding the problems facing service-based self-care businesses, I decided to start a software company that would solve many of these problems with technology. I had graduated college and started a career in finance at Goldman Sachs, but I kept thinking about how to help self-care entrepreneurs run better businesses. It was really hard to manage a client-first business when there were so many scattered, disconnected systems.I had taught myself how to code, so I felt as if I could do anything. After getting a couple of years of experience at Goldman, I took a leap and left to start GlossGenius. Given the industry experience, my technical background and the digital receipts payments company I had pursued with my twin sister — who is my partner and chief business officer at GlossGenius — it just felt obvious to put all of this into a software payments company focused on the self-care industry.Image Credit: Courtesy of GlossGenius. Danielle Cohen-Shohet and Leah Cohen-Shohet.How have you approached scaling the company? 


Before we could even think about scaling the company, we first focused on solving a real problem that is a critical part of our customers' lives. There is so much opportunity to empower entrepreneurs to run, manage and scale their own local businesses. Our platform impacts customers' livelihoods, and our solutions are an important part of their everyday lives. That focus was foundational to have in place before scaling.With that in place, one of the things I did early on was learn everything about the business: Building products, launching products, recruiting, marketing, closing partnerships, handling customer support tickets and much more. Having a deep knowledge of all parts of the business has been important to scaling the company as it has helped me understand what excellence looks like in all parts of the business. With that type of understanding, I could surround myself with fantastic people and leaders to take teams even further.Related: The Sweet Side Hustle She Started 'On a Whim' Turned Into a $20,000-a-Month Income Stream: 'It's Simple, It's Affordable and It's Fun'Because there are so many problems to solve for businesses, we also had to remain disciplined in solving the most important problems for customers first. So as we've scaled, we have continued to flex discipline and only pursue initiatives that create value for our customers. We say no often and are thoughtful about how we sequence what we pursue. We obsess over our customers' needs and absorb their feedback like a sponge, as it plays a key role in driving GlossGenius' growth and new products. Keeping the connection with our customers as we've scaled is something I'm really proud of.


When you look to GlossGenius's future, what are you most excited about? We are creating a gateway for entrepreneurship, giving self-care business owners the infrastructure to scale their businesses and empower more entrepreneurship. While we've already built a platform that is mission-critical to our customers, there is still so much for us to do to achieve our mission. With the responsibility of serving over 65,000 businesses and powering billions of dollars of transaction activity, we are working to make our software products more intuitive and magical for customers.The recent launch of our GeniusAI, a generative AI-powered tool, is a good example of this. This tool helps beauty and wellness practitioners draft ready-made, personalized email marketing campaigns, enabling users to simply enter a few notes and receive messages tailored to their goals and brand. In an industry that has traditionally lagged in technological adoption, it is exciting that we get to be the company that puts this in customers' hands. Another recent GlossGenius product launch is Genius Loans — fast, flexible financing that helps customers grow their businesses. Products like this underscore our support of customers with what they need, when they need it — well beyond what's typically expected from SaaS platforms.What are some of the biggest lessons you've learned over the course of your entrepreneurial journey? 


I've learned that true success means helping others succeed. I am fortunate to lead a company that's so tightly aligned with our customers' success. With the opportunity to build and lead GlossGenius, I've had a masterclass in learning the special framework of how to make decisions that build long-term value for customers.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill. It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.Do you have any advice for people interested in starting a side hustle or business of their own? Be fearless. Don't take no for an answer. And importantly, surround yourself with like-minded people. You might find this through a community like the one we've created for entrepreneurs with GlossGenius, or you might look to people closest to you. I've had many close supporters along the way, but my strongest collaborator is my twin sister, Leah. She has been a thought partner from day one and has played an invaluable role in expanding the company into what it is today. So surround yourself with people who get you.

Now His Creations Are Beloved By Celebrity Chefs — and Can Sell for More Than $1,000.","Feb 15, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/middleton-made-knives-founder-followed-passion-into-business/469753,"
Quintin Middleton, artisan and owner behind Middleton Made Knives, found his passion for blades at a young age, inspired by 1980s fantasy films like Star Wars and Conan the Barbarian. ""I wanted to imitate what I saw,"" he recalls, ""and [in] some of the scenes in the movies, they had this blacksmith forging the hero's sword, and I was just enamored by that.""As a child, Middleton would experiment with the craft by beating household items — like his mother's shower curtain rod — into knife handles. But it wasn't until 2003, when he was in college studying to be an aircraft mechanic, that Middleton would get to try his hand at the real deal. Middleton was working at a local knife and cigar shop to earn some extra cash when legendary bladesmith Jason Knight walked through the door.Image Credit: Courtesy of Middleton Made Knives



""He bought a few things and started telling me about himself and was saying, 'Oh, well, I make knives for a living,'"" Middleton says. ""And so [I] lit up, and I asked him, 'Hey, can you teach me? Can I come by your studio workshop one day?' And graciously, he allowed me to."" Middleton would go on to apprentice for Knight for about six years.Middleton stresses that ""to be really good with anything, it takes a lifetime,"" but after about a year of working with Knight, he said he was a ""competent knifemaker"" — and he saw the potential to build his own business around the skill ""from day one."" After college, Middleton worked as an industrial mechanic for Mercedes-Benz, but all the while, he kept ""making knives and learning and pushing and creating.""

It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.Eventually, Middleton's skill set extended to a variety of knives and swords. But he says he had a dream where ""the Holy Spirit told [him] to make chef knives,"" and ""it was like somebody pointing him in the direction [he] needed to go.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Middleton Made Knives""These are knives, yes, but they're not what a professional chef would want.""So Middleton began doing his research, attempting to replicate the chef's knives he saw in pictures and considering what a chef would need from the tool. Then, once he'd made a few knives, he called ""every top chef in Charleston, South Carolina like a telemarketer"" — and faced rejection after rejection. So he tried a different tactic: He contacted Craig Deihl, executive chef of Cypress and Artisan Meat Share, and asked if he could help develop the chef's knife.""He allowed me to come to his restaurant,"" Middleton says. ""I brought a few knives and laid them out and let his crew check them out. And I'm thinking, maybe I'm going to leave with a few hundred dollars. And somebody's going to buy something. Nobody bought anything. And I was so deflated. And so he told me, 'Okay, these are knives, yes, but they're not what a professional chef would want.'""Middleton asked why that was, and Deihl explained that Middleton's knives, honed from his hunting knife and sword background, were too heavy and thick for a chef's needs. Instead, the ideal chef's instrument would strike a balance between ""a needle and an ax,"" Middleton says.Like an ax, a chef's knife needs ""to be strong and very durable,"" but like a needle, ""it needs to be precise"" and go ""exactly where it needs to go,"" he explains. So that's what Middleton created.


Deihl told his friends about Middleton's chef's knives, and the business started to grow. ""It's almost like throwing a rock in a pond,"" Middleton says. ""I started a small ripple, and it rippled out to other people.""Related: This Is Why Word-of-Mouth Referrals Should Be Your Number One Metric of Success""That's my dream down the road — to create a manufacturing company that's in my town or near.""Middleton Made Knives officially launched in 2010, and in 2011, Middleton was interviewed by Entrepreneur and Garden & Gun, which ""created the big buzz"" that ""solidified him as a maker,"" he says.

Want to change how you run your business? Listen to Jeff Bezos. The former CEO of Amazon was recently interviewed by podcaster Lex Fridman and during the course of this more than two-hour conversation discussed everything from space travel to weight-lifting. But, as a business owner, there were three nuggets of advice that came out of the conversation that really stuck with me. And if you also run a business, you'll probably agree.""There are a thousand ways to be smart.""Bezos said this in the context of telling the story of why he decided to change majors from physics to computer science. A star student and a lover of science, Bezos entered college with the aspiration of becoming a theoretical physicist. But he quickly realized during college that there were some people who are just naturally gifted at some things, like a classmate who was able to figure out a physics problem in minutes, which took Bezos hours.

64,5 Phrases That Kill Your Chances of Receiving Funding,"Feb 13, 2024",Liam Gill,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-phrases-never-to-use-when-asking-for-money/469088,"
I've had the luxury of hearing thousands of startup pitches. This has provided me with a unique opportunity to spot pitching methods that work regardless of market conditions but also those that consistently fail no matter the stage of the company, experience of the founders or market conditions.A significant misconception for founders when fundraising is the belief that they must ""convince"" a VC to invest. The truth is that most VCs decide whether they are interested just minutes into a pitch when they hear the problem, solution, team and traction. After this, every action you take as a founder, every word you say, is simply an opportunity to give that investor a reason NOT to invest.With this in mind, let's look at some phrases that consistently give investors a reason not to invest and kill founders' chances of fundraising.



1. ""We can sell this company within five years.""Building a startup from an idea to a successful company is hard. It takes extreme dedication and hard work. While many founders believe that explaining to investors how they might be able to return their capital (and promising a short timeframe for that return) can be enticing, the truth is that when dealing with venture capitalists, they want to see your commitment to building your business to $1B+. When you start talking about selling the company in the short term, it demonstrates that:You are not 100% focused on the growth of the business.You are more interested in the money than the problem the company solves.The best startups have founders who deeply care about the problems they solve for their customers and not people who are simply trying to get rich.Claiming that you can sell a company in the short term is a major red flag for investors.Related: Should You Pitch Your Startup to Early-Stage Investors?2. ""We don't have any competition.""When an investor hears that you don't have any competition, they immediately become concerned. Nowadays, there is no business idea you can come up with that someone has not thought of before. So, if there is no competition, you must have an incredible reason. Often, unless there is a recent technological innovation or legal change, there is no reason why you won't have some competition.Many founders make the mistake of claiming there is no competition because they think about competition not as other solutions to the problem they are solving but as other companies offering the exact product/service. For example, when AirBnb pitched, they included Craigslist as a competitor. While Craigslist isn't in the business of allowing people to stay in strangers' homes instead of a hotel, the site can connect with others and arrange to stay with someone in a foreign city. Therefore, it is a viable solution to the problem AirBnb was solving and is a competitor. Thinking of competition in this manner will help you find the right competitors to list in your pitch deck.


Finally, reframing how you think of the competitors' slide in your deck is essential. Founders often believe that a lack of competitors is a good sign to investors; aside from raising concerns that you don't fully understand your market, having no competitors can signal to investors that there is no demand for your product. If nobody else is even trying to make money in your market, maybe there isn't a market to begin with. This slide is your chance to show that (i) there are competitors and (ii) how you are better.3. ""We need you to sign an NDA.""Venture Capitalists will not sign an NDA. As an investor, I can confidently say that the conversation ends when a founder asks for an NDA. Investors are hearing thousands of ideas a year and picking the top 5-10; no investor will sign an NDA that risks them being unable to work with dozens or hundreds of companies to hear your pitch.From the founder's perspective, you shouldn't be worried about sharing your ideas unless you have patent or IP considerations. The reality is that companies succeed based on their execution, not ideas. If you have a great idea, you should also believe that you are uniquely positioned to execute the concept in a manner nobody else can. If that isn't the case, you are unlikely to succeed anyway.Related: This Is How Overfunding Can Kill Your Startup


4. ""We just need money""Investors hate supporting companies that aren't already on a path towards success. When pitching your company, you should never talk about your company as a parked car waiting for gas (money) to get going. You should always pitch your company as a car racing toward the finish line; you could go much faster with more gas.Any indication that your company does not already have positive momentum and is relying on a capital injection to get moving drastically increases the risk associated with the business and ends most VC conversations.5. ""I don't need a cofounder,"" or ""We just met a few months ago.""Especially at the pre-seed stage, your team is your most investable asset. Anyone can copy your idea. Investors are looking for a team they believe can execute the idea. If you dismiss their concerns about the size of your team by arguing that you can do it alone or show that your team hasn't worked together long, you create doubts about your ability to execute. If there are deficiencies in your team, don't try to brush them off; instead, focus on how you will remedy them through strategic hires to ensure your company's success.Founders breaking up or giving up is the number one cause of startup failures. While this may seem like a trivial question to you. For investors, the long-term commitment and potential of the founding team are the primary considerations in any pre-seed or seed-stage investment.

65,How Artificial Intelligence is Influencing Venture Capital — 5 Guidelines for Achieving Success,"Feb 13, 2024",Alexander Galitsky,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-artificial-intelligence-is-influencing-venture-capital/469003,"
Artificial intelligence has caused nothing short of a tectonic shift in creation and innovation, affecting such diverse spheres as journalism, translation, contract law and scientific research. As AI abilities grow, its influence will revolutionize work processes in every niche and industry. Venture capital players should harness its power to give themselves that first-mover advantage.Five ways venture players can use this tool to their best advantage:1. Make better bets.According to venture capital expert Shikhar Ghosh, three out of four venture capital-funded ventures never make back their initial investment.



One of the things AI excels at is crunching voluminous amounts of data and finding the patterns that emerge. VCs can leverage this to help them choose the ventures that are most likely to succeed.Starting with the most promising startups makes you more likely to create a winning bet.Related: How Venture Capitalists Are Using AI To Invest More Effectively2. Cut costs.Start-ups have a delicate balance to maintain. You need a talented, hardworking team to make a venture a success. But, all those working hours get expensive quickly.Adding generative AI to the mix allows you to make the most of the people recruited to create a start-up success. Let AI do the jobs that AI works well at, and save your human capital for the areas where it is most valuable.You'll get more done, have team members with lower levels of burnout, and keep your costs low enough that profitability is a more straightforward goal.Related: Here's How AI Is Changing VC Funding3. Prove your hunches with analytics.Many venture capitalists will say their gut is their most powerful tool. They can see an opportunity and judge whether it will be a winner.AI allows you to analyze data to back up your assumptions. It can show you where you have made errors in judgment when you're wrong. This gives you a chance to finesse your plans and create something better.It can show the data and numbers that demonstrate why you are right. This is powerful in convincing everyone, from other investors to end customers, to give your new venture a chance to succeed.


Winning bias is natural. When you show people you have budding success, you create a fertile environment where it can blossom. A well-supported prediction of success becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.4. Harvest counter-intuitive insights.Every experience we've had, every case study and white paper we've read, and everyone we talk to influence our vision of the world.One of our most potent evolutionary advantages is the human mind's ability to synthesize this data into a worldview. But it comes at a cost. Whether we realize it or not, we are blinded by biases daily. And that can cause venture capitalists to miss information that doesn't fit within their worldview. That, in turn, leads to costly mistakes.AI is not bogged down with a lifetime of human experience. This allows it to make predictions and decisions that, from a human perspective, go against intuition.


Using this power to zig left when the rest of the market is zagging right can mean capturing the opportunities that no one has.Related: AI Is Becoming a Game-Changer in Startup Fundraising5. Learn more about market sentiment.Consumers, company leaders and others provide constant information about what they want. They post comments on articles, offhand insights on social networks, short videos, reviews and more.The problem is no one can take in this ever-running fire hose of data, let alone parse what it means.


AI does not have that limitation. It can take in more data faster than any human team could hope to. And it can synthesize what it learns into human-sized bites.Venture capitalists can use what they learn from their AI assistants to choose the opportunities most likely to fill a public need and become a success. Then, they can guide those startups in the right direction to make sure they wind up with a win.AI will soon be as integral to start-up culture as smartphones and laptops. It will be an accepted tool in planning every venture. The key is to leverage its power innovatively so you are ahead of the curve when others in the VC sphere begin to catch on.When we augment our very human capabilities with the things machines do better, we are stronger than we'd be relying on one or the other. Continue to trust your instincts. Use human connection to make good teams and better deals. Then, add the power of artificial intelligence to augment what you have.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Julie Berninger, Etsy shop owner and co-founder of Gold City Ventures with Cody Berman. What was your 9-5 job and/or primary source of income when you started your Etsy shop?I worked as a project manager for large tech companies. I have my masters in computer information systems and planned to work in the tech field forever.When did you start your Etsy side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?I listened to personal finance podcasts on my lunch break and commute to and from work. I was inspired by people who started Etsy and Amazon shops as side hustles. I was also inspired by the ""financial independence, early retirement"" (FIRE) movement, where people traded in office jobs for jobs with more lifestyle freedom. I loved my job, but I also loved to travel and wanted a bit more flexibility with how and where I worked.



Related: His Side Hustle Solved a Common Problem for Homeowners. Now the Business Brings in $3 Million a Month During Peak Season.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I picked a niche on Etsy that I knew very well: the bachelorette party niche because I was going to a bunch of bachelorette parties. I noticed how people were willing to pay for throwaway items for those events, and order quantities were high because so many people attended the event (usually groups of 15-20 women, with one person making the large purchase for the group). It seemed like a great niche for my shop. I started with temporary tattoos because I knew they would be easy to store in my tiny apartment in Silicon Valley. I didn't have room to sell larger pieces. I didn't have a budget for photography, but I put the tattoos on, went for neighborhood walks and took pictures in front of my neighbors' beautiful rose bushes. There are some gorgeously landscaped lawns in Silicon Valley!What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?


I was averaging around $15-$20 per order with the temporary tattoos, but I was stressed for time. I was squeezing in trips to the post office before and after work. I was also podcasting and interviewing eight guests per week about how they achieved financial independence. I met someone at a conference who sold printables on Etsy, and I was hooked. I switched my product line to selling bachelorette party scavenger hunts and was convinced digital products were the way to go going forward because they required less time. There is very little to no work done after the sale.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill. It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue, and at what point did the side hustle's income surpass that of your full-time job (if it did)?I made around $10,000 per year selling digital products as a side hustle on Etsy. My plan wasn't to leave my day job, though, since I loved working in tech. I didn't have a plan or the space in my life for selling on Etsy to become a full-time thing. Full-time entrepreneurship happened slowly over time. I was also a well-paid tech employee with a master's degree, so it felt very scary to take a leap — and it would have taken a while to replace my income. But I did make six figures total over a few years between Etsy and blogging about my personal finance journey. I eventually left my full-time job in 2021; by then, the money from my ventures replaced my full-time job.


When and how did that side hustle lead to Gold City Ventures? How does Gold City Ventures help aspiring side hustlers?The episodes on my podcast about my side hustles were always the favorite episodes with listeners. I recorded how I created and sold digital products on Etsy in YouTube videos first.I had my first kid in 2019, and I launched Gold City Ventures, my online course business, soon after with a business partner using those videos as the main curriculum. We've improved our curriculum over the years and now have the step-by-step course to start an Etsy shop for digital products.Over 15,000 students have bought the course, and some have achieved some amazing results. We've had students who make this their full-time job and have earned over $70,000 in one year on Etsy. It's been a lot of fun to help people start small businesses.


What I love about Etsy is that it brings the customers (90 million per year) to you, and digital products are a low-risk small business since it doesn't cost much to start, and you don't have to buy inventory; you are just spending your time. It's also good if someone only has a few hours extra per week and just wants a side hustle.Related: This Former Teacher Started a Side Hustle That Made More Than $22,000 in One Month: 'I Have Never Been More Fulfilled'How much average monthly revenue does Gold City Ventures bring in now?Gold City Ventures makes over $100,000 per month, and we've expanded to offer many additional services such as live coaching, a community and done-for-you templates.

70,4 Ways Small Business Owners Can Capitalize on Big Events,"Feb 5, 2024",Sharon Miller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-ways-small-business-owners-can-capitalize-on-big-events/469200,"
More than 100 million people are gearing up to watch the big game on Sunday. Between watch parties, wings, beverages, commercials, the halftime show and much more, excitement is widespread.Beyond entertainment, the game serves as a super opportunity for small businesses in the Las Vegas area to capitalize on increased spending, foot traffic and excitement from hopeful fans either looking to tie the record for most championships, continue a dynasty or just take in the world's biggest game.While Sunday's game only comes to one city per year, international sporting events, concert tours, conventions and other monumental events regularly provide much-welcomed boosts to local economies. Last year's big game in Phoenix saw an average 25.6% increase in spending at local restaurants and bars when compared to other weekends in February. Last summer, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift and Barbenheimer added an estimated $8.5 billion to the U.S. economy in Q3 2023, and the 2024 Summer Olympics could generate up to €10.7 billion in economic benefits in France later this year.



With a fresh calendar year of events kicking off, here are four strategies small business owners can use to capitalize on the excitement:Related: Super Bowl Provides Opportunity for Local Businesses to Score Big


Create themed goods and servicesMost people traveling for a big event want to immerse themselves in the excitement and return with personal keepsakes or gifts. This unique demand presents an opportunity for small business owners to get creative with trending themes.Last year, bakeries near movie theaters created pink Barbie-themed pastries, and restaurants tapped into the economic power of Swifties by decorating in accordance with an ""Era."" In Houston, bars prepped for the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament by blasting schools' fight songs to lure in patrons. In Boston, Chicago and New York, retailers ran discounts on marathon-themed merchandise. In Las Vegas, we expect to see casinos, hotels, bars and restaurants tweak their menus to offer championship-level meals and game-day cocktails.Whatever the event is, be well-versed on why people are jumping on flights to attend, get creative, and capitalize authentically on attendees' excitement.Offer targeted promotions and discountsWhile event tourism brings in fresh energy, staying in a city — let alone traveling to and attending a major event — can put a dent in your bank account. Having spent a small fortune just to get there, many event-goers will be looking for deals.


This bodes well for business owners, as there are opportunities to attract customers with clever discounts and promotions. A few major factors to consider when implementing a promotion are timing, target audience and reach. Consider partnering with other local businesses to maximize your reach. For example: ""Buy one, get one on themed merchandise at our retailer, receive a coupon to do the same with appetizers at the restaurant next door.""You should also time your promotions around the event. If you're a bar, hotel or retailer near the venue, offer a happy hour before, special rates the weekend of, or discounted items during the lead-up. Other service providers near the host city have opportunities, too. Personal trainers can offer discounted rates to people visiting town, or photographers can offer to take pictures of people outside the event. There are many ways to lure the influx of customers into your business without having to veer too far from your traditional promotional efforts.Related: Here's a Clever Marketing Tactic for Getting the Attention of Thousands of PeoplePlan complementary eventsThe signature event people are flocking to town for doesn't need to be the only thing they're looking forward to. By planning complementary events, your business can also be a destination where that out-of-town energy is spent.


In addition to improving sales, gatherings can help you build stronger relationships with your customers. Consider what the expected crowd is interested in, make an event out of it, and show your appreciation to all who showed up for a great time.You don't have to limit activities to the lead-up to the big event either. Like thousands of Swifties who ""Taylgated"" Taylor Swift's concerts during the show, many people who didn't or couldn't spend the money associated with being inside the venue still spent time traveling to the host city and soaking in all the energy and excitement. Consider providing fans with the next best thing and hosting a watch party or catering a tailgate. Depending on the event, some fans may look to keep the party going. If that's the case, perhaps a victory party for the winning fan base or a local cover band playing encores is in order.Mind the logisticsRegardless of how you market your business to eventgoers, you must be prepared to handle the altered business environment during a major event. Increased crowds can either be an opportunity or a burden for your business, so consider whether you'll benefit from having additional inventory, staffing or operational hours to ensure you'll seize the moment. Getting creative with temporary product names and designs is a great way to boost business, but be wary of running afoul of licensing and copyright laws as well.Events like this Sunday's only come to cities every so often, and moments like these can be some of the most exciting parts of the entrepreneurship journey. The benefits they could have on your business are endless, so enjoy them and strive to take full advantage.

      Key Takeaways    



        Paul and Cranston's Dos Hombres, which means ""two men'' in Spanish, launched in 2019. 
      


        The mezcal is crafted in Oaxaca by third-generation maestro mezcalero Gregorio Velasco. 
      


        The business partners use a leadership approach honed over years on the set of 'Breaking Bad.' 
      












""I saw a clear opening with mezcal,"" Aaron Paul, co-founder of Dos Hombres Mezcal with fellow actor Bryan Cranston, says. ""You ask anyone on the side of the road, 'Name your favorite mezcal,' [and] they're like, 'Oh, mezcal is…' But they can name a vodka, a tequila.""Cranston and Paul, who played Walter White and Jesse Pinkman on AMC's award-winning crime drama series Breaking Bad, became fast friends on set. So, when Paul suggested the duo start a mezcal brand of their own several years after the show wrapped, Cranston was all in.Image Credit: Paul Quitoriano for Dos Hombres Mezcal 



Dos Hombres, which means ""two men"" in Spanish, launched in 2019. The mezcal is crafted by third-generation maestro mezcalero Gregorio Velasco, who uses traditional production methods to blend Espadin agave hand-picked from the hillsides of the small village of San Luis del Rio in Oaxaca, Mexico. It boasts notes of apples, mango, local ""zapote"" fruits, wood and an ""almost imperceptible"" smoke on the finish.Constellation Brands announced a minority stake in Dos Hombres in 2021 through its venture capital group, though the company remains independently owned and continues to manage, market and produce its mezcal.

They're determined to make Dos Hombres the No. 1 mezcal, they say, and that means doing things a bit differently than some of the many other celebrity spirits brands.""Celebrities have an opportunity,"" Cranston says. ""They have the door open. You want to come in? It's up to you. And a lot of celebrities will come in — and then go away. You want me to go and work…?""""Wait, you're not just going to write me…a check?"" Paul quips.Related: How to Be Your Own Boss and Drink on the Job


Cranston notes that ""there are far more celebrity brands that have failed than have succeeded."" But, like their on-screen characters, the pair isn't afraid to get in the trenches and do what needs to be done. Until about six months ago, the co-founders ""were on emails constantly,"" and Paul ran the company's social media accounts.""I think actors, especially, we're used to stepping into something we don't know,"" Cranston says. ""Every time we take a job, 'I think it could be this, but I'm not sure.' I'm playing a podiatrist — 'Oh, I gotta go learn all about the feet.' So we're not daunted about stepping into something we don't know. We're like a dry sponge. So we go down to Oaxaca once a year and talk to our people.""Image Credit: Paul Quitoriano for Dos Hombres Mezcal ""We break bread with them. We talk to them, and we learn.""Dos Hombres has 50 employees in Mexico and 22 in the U.S., and Paul and Cranston have personally interviewed each person who was hired onto the team. They want to make sure that everyone understands the culture they've built: ""We work hard here, and then we go home,"" Cranston says. ""That's the greatest thing. Work hard, go home.""Paul and Cranston are ""very proud"" of the team members they've brought together — and seize every opportunity to learn from them.""We break bread with them,"" Cranston says. ""We talk to them, and we learn. Every time we're down there, it's like, 'Oh wait a minute, that's a new thing. Why are you doing this? Oh right. What happened there?' And then [we] learn about the mashing, the smoking, fermentation, the distillation, bottling.""Related: Comedy Legend Dan Aykroyd Doesn't Mess Around When It Comes to Vodka


Paul and Cranston's hands-on leadership approach to building their ideal company, team and culture is a straightforward but perhaps underrated one these days. And it carries over from their years on the set of Breaking Bad. Paul, who was 28 when the show debuted, says that Cranston taught him that ""when you're No. 1 on the call sheet, you set the tone.""""[Cranston is] the hardest worker in the room but also the most immature person you've ever met,"" Paul says. ""And I say that with love and respect because he does the job perfectly, but he has the best time doing it. He loves to pull pranks; [he] jokes.""Cranston says there were a couple of hundred people on set that they felt responsible for, and to help establish the kind of close-knit culture they envisioned, they started a bowling night with not just the crew but the crew's family, too. ""We'd take over the entire bowling alley and just play,"" he recalls.Image Credit: Paul Quitoriano for Dos Hombres Mezcal 


""Down in Mexico, they say, 'You kiss the spirit.'""The co-founders might not have anticipated going into business together during their early days on set. Cranston admits he had no idea Paul had such a ""business mind,"" though he was quickly impressed by his co-star's boundless ""energy"" and strong work ethic — and adds that ""he's not at all like Jesse Pinkman.""Needless to say, the real-life friends have a more functional business partnership than Jesse and Walt ever did. They also have a lot of fun with it: Just don't ask them to take any shots of mezcal if you run into them at the bar.""We go out a lot to all the bars and restaurants, and most of the younger kids go, 'Ah, let's do shots,'"" Cranston explains.""It's sacrilegious to do a shot of mezcal,"" Paul says. ""Down in Mexico, they say, 'You kiss the spirit.'""

Image Credit: Courtesy of Pan's Mushroom JerkyWhat was your full-time job and/or primary source of income prior to starting your side hustle? Did it change over the course of your side hustle journey?I earned an electrical engineering degree from the University of Illinois, and I spent most of my career at Motorola/Continental Automotive in Chicago.Along the way, I launched a tech startup with friends until we sold the business in 2016.



These full-time jobs allowed me to test the market, learn and iterate along the way. Finally in 2016, I was in a position to dedicate everything to Pan's, and I made the transition to work on the business full-time.Related: These Sisters Started a Side Hustle After a 'Light Bulb' Moment Standing in Line for Coffee — Now Their Business Has Done $100 Million in Total SalesWhen did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?I took a trip to visit family in 2006 in Malaysia, where I met a vegetarian cousin who had been making our family's mushroom snack for years. As vegetarians, they had trouble finding foods that not only tasted great but also had great texture. And they found that mushrooms were very satisfying and healthy.


This opened my eyes to an amazing culture with innovative foods that mimic the texture of meat. I fell in love with the product and its history, and I knew our family had a snack that needed to be shared with the world.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I first learned how to import the product from my family in Malaysia. I sampled the product as often as I could to test demand and gather consumer feedback. I quickly found out that many types of people, including non-vegetarians, loved it because it was a healthy snack that tasted great.I started selling on our website (which we powered through Shopify) and Amazon for direct business. I started to cold email, call and visit as many stores as I could to get more sales and distribution.


Meanwhile, I also did some product development and worked on transferring production to the United States. I rented small kitchen spaces, made products, tested, iterated and repeated that process frequently. I used the cash from online sales and sampling events to reinvest back into the business.Related: After This 26-Year-Old Got Hooked on ChatGPT, He Built a 'Simple' Side Hustle Around the Bot That Brings In $4,000 a MonthWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?It's hard to avoid the amount of capital it requires to get started from scratch. Luckily I had some 401k cash along with debt I could leverage to help get the business off the ground.


How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent weekly or monthly revenue?It took about two years.When did it surpass the income of your full-time job?After about year three, I started making enough income to match my previous full-time job.When did you decide to go all-in and transition from side hustle to full-time business?After wrapping up another startup venture in 2016, I decided to go all in on the business.Luckily at that time, all the trends were aligning. Mushrooms were trending; healthy, on-the-go snacking was still gaining popularity; and plant-based foods were booming. I felt confident that we had product-market fit and a quality product that would succeed.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill.

Having the mindset to grow and learn is essential. The right mindset will prepare you to embrace challenges as stepping stones to success.Learn and iterate as quickly and cheaply as possible! Push to learn and iterate quickly instead of waiting for everything to be perfect before moving forward.

Sabeena Ladha, founder and CEO of the ""good-for-you"" snack brand DEUX, has a ""pretty deep relationship with junk food."" That's ""kind of a funny thing to say,"" she admits, but her childhood in the small town of Euless, Texas, where her father ran a gas station and convenience store, kicked off the passion for snacks that would help shape her professional endeavors.""My parents worked 24/7,"" Ladha recalls. ""They're immigrants, so they had that hard work ethic built in them. So he was working 12-, 14-hour days, six, seven days a week, and on the weekends, my sisters and I would go to the gas station, and we would get to pick a snack. I always picked one salty and one sweet snack."" They weren't necessarily the most healthful choices, but at the time, those products weren't quite as ""villainized"" as they are today, she says.Image Credit: Courtesy of DEUX. Sabeena Ladha. 



Although Ladha ""looked healthy"" as a high school athlete who played basketball and ran track, she quips that her ""insides were made of partially hydrogenated oil and trans fats."" It wasn't until college that she dove into health and wellness, even starting a blog ""before it was cool"" to unpack juice cleanses and cryotherapy.Related: After Being Diagnosed With Cancer, She Created a Cookie That Would Help Her Eat Cleanly and Satisfy Her Sweet Tooth. Now, Her Products Are Sold in 25,000 Stores.


""Not everyone wants to eat a salad for every meal of the day, so how do you help people make slightly better decisions?""""[I was] trying to make the scary world of wellness a little bit more approachable for Sabeena in Texas,"" Ladha explains. ""Not everyone lives in Los Angeles and has access to 18 farmers markets on a Saturday. That's just not realistic. And not everyone wants to eat a salad for every meal of the day, so how do you help people make slightly better decisions?""Answering that question ultimately led Ladha to the ""healthy indulgences"" concept of DEUX. The hot-pink brand offers cookie doughs, dessert spreads and donut holes that are vegan, gluten- and preservative-free and contain ""functional ingredients"" like vitamin B12 to support sustained energy and L-Theanine to help with cognitive function and mental focus.Image Credit: Courtesy of DEUX


Ladha was ready to ""break the rules"" and innovate in the snack space, but she credits much of her success with the fact that she learned those rules before she broke them. Her previous experiences working on Frito-Lay at PepsiCo, managing a P&L at Diamond Foods, consulting at McKinsey & Company and launching brands in venture capital helped build a strong foundation for her entrepreneurial journey.Related: The Founders of This Paleo, Gluten-Free and Vegan Brand Say It Succeeded Because of Its Restrictions""[Experimenting with scale] required some capital because there's a lot of waste that comes with that.""Ladha started experimenting with chocolate chip cookie dough in her kitchen in June 2020, when the pandemic was well underway, and many people wanted to graduate from the ""sourdough and wine phase"" and indulge in healthier ways, she says. Today, all of DEUX's cookie doughs have a similar base, incorporating oats, nut butter, flaxseed and coconut sugar.


But one of the biggest challenges in those early days was figuring out how to scale DEUX's perfect recipe with a manufacturer. ""You would think it's [just] math, right?"" Ladha says. ""Like, you just scale up the recipe into making 3,000 pounds instead of one pound. And it really did not work like that. It got drier; it got a little bit more dense. It wasn't as sweet. So you have to then go through iterations, and that required some capital because there's a lot of waste that comes with that too.""Related: This Entrepreneur Believes Courage Is the Key Ingredient for SuccessInitially, Ladha didn't want to raise capital; she put $20,000 of her own money into the business and resolved to test the product first. Ladha was more than willing to pivot if the idea didn't gain traction, noting that she ""wanted an idea that would work"" rather than one that had to be ""force fit"" into the market. But DEUX was ""profitable on first ship,"" and once Ladha realized the serious potential there, she decided to raise.Image Credit: Courtesy of DEUX


To date, DEUX has raised about $6 million. The company's first fundraising round kicked off in January 2021, and Ladha says that capital — and the ability it gave DEUX to produce at a significantly higher volume — made it possible for her to appear on Shark Tank after its producers reached out. Ladha didn't land a deal on the show, but DEUX has continued to see tremendous growth in the years since.""[If you] take that kind of tech mentality and bring it to food, it will just help you understand if there's actually product-market fit.""DEUX has transitioned from an exclusively direct-to-consumer (DTC) brand to one with a significant retail presence in Target, Whole Foods, Sprouts Farmers Markets and more. DEUX hit 1,000,000 units sold last year and more than doubled its store count to 2,600 in 2023. And in the first half of 2024, DEUX will see that figure skyrocket again with the launch of donuts at major retailers nationwide, totaling more than 4,000 stores across its three product lines.Ladha says that retail will make up the ""lion's share"" of DEUX's revenue this year but stresses that DTC remains important for the brand for two reasons: data collection and marketing opportunities. The former helps the business understand who its customers are and which flavors resonate with them, and the latter has allowed it to explore brand collaborations, like its recent Buttercream Sugar Cookie with The Skinny Confidential.

It Failed, But He Pivoted to Build a $1.5 Billion Business.Now, Ladha is focused on making DEUX a household name — ""full stop."" She envisions it as a ""better-for-you Nestlé"" with a modern twist and says a not-so-""sexy"" ""tech mindset"" is helping it get there.""It sounds much cooler to be like, 'You know, I was just making this cookie dough for my friends and family, and then I went to a farmer's market, and Whole Foods discovered me, and now I'm at Whole Foods now nationally,'"" Ladha says. ""That's a cooler story, right? But if you can collect data and test and learn and take that kind of tech mentality and bring it to food, it will just help you understand if there's actually product-market fit.

74,Why Indonesia Is Becoming the Next Serious Player in Entrepreneurship,"Jan 30, 2024",Vlad Ayukaev,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-things-all-entrepreneurs-must-know-before-they-enter-the/465921,"
Indonesia is an island nation with a total population of nearly 300 million inhabitants and an ever-growing consumer class. It consists of 17,000 islands spread over an area of almost 2 million kilometers — all of which revolve around a strong central hub — namely, Java.As the most populous island of Indonesia, it has a significant influence on the nation's economy. And therefore, it can be considered the 'gateway' to the rest of the country.No city in Indonesia proves this point better than Jakarta. This Javan megacity is home to many multinational corporations, headquarters, and venture capital funds, which include prominent names such as Golden Gate Ventures, Sovereign's Capital, and Alpha JWC Ventures, among many others.



Indonesia provides a solid startup foundation for venture capital and technological innovation. And it presents the perfect environment to build and secure strong partnerships and investments. But even though there is great potential here, there are, of course, unique factors that every entrepreneur should consider beforehand. And 4 of the most important are as follows.Related: What Makes Indonesia the Fastest Rising E-commerce Country


1. Linguistics, culture and religionIndonesia is divided into many islands spread out over a large area. Because of this, there is great diversity throughout the nation. In total, there are 1,300 ethnic groups. And while Bahasa Indonesia is the country's first official language, each region can contain its own linguistic variations.Entrepreneurs must be ready to localize marketing materials and provide customer support in multiple languages to improve accessibility and engagement. This linguistic diversity also extends to cultural diversity. And so, sensitivity and respect must be carefully exercised for marketing strategies, product development and customer interactions.What's more, Indonesia is home to the world's largest Muslim population, which means that businesses here need to show religious respect and develop a deep understanding of Islamic beliefs, practices and traditions.Related: Why Tech is the Future of Education in Indonesia


2. Social dynamics and business practicesLocal connections and strong, well-maintained relationships are extremely important to succeed in the Indonesian market. However, this can be difficult to achieve when there is a general attitude of caution toward foreigners, especially in the context of trustworthiness.Islamic business culture strongly influences the market, which emphasizes the creation of value for the common good over and above profit. The focus here is on social responsibility, philanthropy, sustainable practices, ethical conduct, partnerships, Sharia-compliant finance and social entrepreneurship.Trust is earned in Indonesia. Never expected. And the best way to do that is to enter the market with 'good faith' intentions that align with the business culture.Related: Want to Earn Trust? Don't Break Any of These 4 Links in the Chain of Credibility.


3. ClimateIndonesia is known for its hot, humid, and rainy weather, with average yearly temperatures at around 24°C. Expats from other climates might find it difficult to adapt to life here, which can, in turn, affect their productivity.As a likely result of this warmer climate, Indonesia's pace of life is generally slower than other parts of the world. And that extends to business, too. There is a more relaxed approach to time management, which might initially frustrate entrepreneurs who are new to the market and eager to begin their business journeys.Adaptation is what is essential in Indonesia. Learn to make this way of life work for you.Related: Opportunities and Challenges for Entrepreneurs Thinking About Indonesia's Solar Energy Sector


4. Geography Because its many islands are spread over a vast area, logistics and supply chains can be very challenging for businesses that wish to expand beyond the Java-Bali region.Implementing more complex transport and delivery systems that combine air, sea and land vehicles might become very necessary.However, as stated earlier, Java is the key to the rest of Indonesia. Any desire to operate elsewhere in the country will likely require some form of interaction with it or through it, whether for legal, bureaucratic or practical reasons. Therefore, it is highly recommended that solid foundations be built on Java. No matter what one's business plans are for Indonesia as a whole. This is especially true for its capital, Jakarta.Related: Why Businesses with Remote Teams in Southeast Asia are ThrivingConclusionIn summary, entrepreneurs looking to enter the Indonesian market should prioritize establishing a strategic presence in Jakarta. Success in this diverse business environment requires adapting to local culture, building trust and navigating unique challenges. A systematic and culturally sensitive approach and strategic planning will be essential for tapping into Indonesia's opportunities.

75,"Aspiring Entrepreneur? Here's the Lucrative, Accessible Online Career You Need to Explore.","Jan 30, 2024",Matt Bontrager,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/the-surprising-path-to-six-or-seven-figures-in-bookkeeping/468243,"
The question is: Which industry is poised to meet the demand for this generational workforce that longs not only for financial freedom but also for that coveted location-freedom as well? The answer might surprise you.Across the country, the surge in demand for precision and transparency in financial management has been steadily growing. This is especially true with regard to the increasing development of AI technology and its integration into the world of financial software systems — and that could mean a significant opportunity looms large on the horizon. For individuals seeking to strike out on the entrepreneurial path, one that offers the potential of a healthy income and the perks of a '""laptop lifestyle,"" one profession, in particular, may be worth keeping a close eye on — bookkeeping.With a history dating back nearly 7,000 years, to the ancient landscapes of Mesopotamia, the tracking and categorization of financial records is not a novel concept, per se. However, the integration of robust (and often highly affordable) automated software systems has created a significant opportunity for aspiring entrepreneurs.



Put simply, the barrier to entry for those seeking to make a lateral career shift — or a complete overhaul of their current professional trajectory — has never been lower. With a little guidance, some training and a determination to put oneself out there, bookkeeping could quickly become the ultimate ""drag, drop and click"" side hustle.Thus, this article aims to offer a well-defined four-part roadmap for those seeking to scale their bookkeeping venture sustainably, beginning from the ground up. Through a blend of foundational knowledge, automation advancement, niche establishment and client relationship cultivation, aspiring bookkeepers can position themselves for success in the dynamic world of financial management.

Fortunately, bookkeeping — in its simplest form — does not involve itself with the complexities of taxes or tax law. Thus, the vocabulary and know-how required to be able to speak intelligently to clients' needs can be covered in a relatively short time.Courses, workshops and educational programs tailored for beginners provide comprehensive training in fundamental accounting principles, systems management and financial reporting. This curriculum will form the bedrock upon which entrepreneurs can build their expertise, fostering confidence and competence in handling the financial intricacies of their future clients.Harnessing the power of automationAI-automated software is arguably the single most transformative element to make an appearance in the world of bookkeeping, particularly for beginners seeking efficiency and accuracy. Choosing user-friendly platforms that automate routine tasks, such as data entry, categorization and reconciliation, can significantly reduce the learning curve and time spent per client, per task. This is what makes bookkeeping (as opposed to traditional accounting) so accessible to a generation of new financial professionals.


By embracing automation software such as Inuit Quickbooks, entrepreneurs free up time for strategic decision-making and client engagement, allowing them to focus on the growth and development of their burgeoning businesses. Moreover, the adaptive learning algorithms that drive such automations are what provide the flexibility to scale quickly, sustainably and with minimal overhead expense.Related: 8 Lucrative Careers You Can Start From Your Own CouchSpecializing in a nicheDistinguishing oneself within the competitive bookkeeping landscape involves identifying and specializing in a niche. Whether it be a particular industry or a specific clientele, carving out a niche allows entrepreneurs to tailor their services, becoming experts in the unique challenges and needs of their chosen market segment. This strategic focus not only enhances credibility but also attracts clients seeking specialized expertise, establishing a foundation for long-term success.One thing to keep in mind here is volume. There is often a direct correlation between the number of incoming and outgoing transactions inside of a given business and the need for bookkeeping services. The more complex an operation, the more a business owner will need help to make sense of the money trail.


For example, real estate investors are typically responsible for handling and distributing large sums of money to finance the various components of their operation. Be it for contracted services, licenses and government approvals, incoming cash flow from rent collections or any number of other variables, the movement of money is hardly stagnant.In this way, taking note of transaction volume and frequency can be a helpful indicator of which sectors will have a protracted need for your financial services.Building strong client relationshipsBeyond the numbers, the success of a bookkeeping business hinges on the strength of client relationships. Effective communication, transparency and reliability are the building blocks of a thriving client-provider dynamic. Regular check-ins, timely reporting and a proactive approach to problem-solving contribute to the trust clients place in their bookkeeping partners, fostering loyalty and generating valuable referrals.It would be a mistake to underestimate the value, perhaps especially so in a technical field like financial services, of consistent and clear communication.


In summation, scaling a bookkeeping business from a beginner's standpoint to a six or seven-figure venture is certainly possible in 2024. However, it requires a strategic vision with respect to technological integration and a holistic approach to client communication.Related: How AI Is Transforming the Accounting Industry — and What the Future Will Look LikeBy leveraging the power of emerging technology, specializing in a high-volume transaction niche and cultivating rich client relationships, entrepreneurs can position themselves for success in one of the world's most accessible online careers. Even in its fledgling stages, the integration of AI automated software serves as a critical component for future success, streamlining both the time to market for new entrepreneurs and the efficiency required in handling delicate financial reporting.Ideally, this blueprint will provide the jumping-off point for aspiring entrepreneurs seeking to master the art of bookkeeping and build a thriving and resilient business.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Elise Whang and Emily Erkel, co-founders of B2B marketplace platform LePrix, which offers a curated space for sourcing pre-owned luxury items from top suppliers around the world.LePrix has done more than $100 million in topline gross merchandise value since launch. It has raised $15 million to date and is the largest B2B pre-owned luxury platform globally, with over 150,000 units of pre-owned luxury at wholesale prices per month, according to the company.How did your corporate careers prepare you to launch the side hustle that would become LePrix? 



Whang: Early on in my legal career, I had the opportunity to meet entrepreneurs from mega-corporations who had built their businesses from scratch. Their journey was fascinating and inspiring to me; however, I quickly realized entrepreneurs are often over-glamorized. Lawyers see all the blemishes and the challenges and hardships business owners face as well. This experience helped me take the proverbial leap with my eyes wide open. Importantly, being a lawyer also trained me how to write thoughtfully, be persuasive and take measured risks. I also learned that what I enjoyed most about being a lawyer would carry over to being an entrepreneur — helping people and fixing problems.Erkel: My career in retail strategy consulting prepared me for the launch of LePrix in so many ways. Each project was a different opportunity to help a client overcome a challenge and succeed — whether it was launching a large Japanese fast-fashion retailer in the U.S., helping a women's specialty retailer go omnichannel or [helping] an iconic luxury brand house known for its handbags expand into other categories. The skills I learned to quickly identify the problem, be creative with the solution and help the retailer execute helped me learn the skills that every entrepreneur needs: strategy, execution, grit and adaptability.

It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.When did you start the side hustle that would become your company, and what was the inspiration behind it? Whang: When that first amazing business idea dawns on you, it is like a bright light bulb going off in your head. It first lit up when I was standing in line for coffee before work knowing I had to work over the weekend. What I really wanted to do over the weekend was go to my favorite consignment stores with my sisters, but these stores all closed at 7 p.m., and I could not get there. So why not bring all these wonderful designer consignment stores online? This first iteration of our business was consumer-facing, aiming to aggregate the best designer consignment stores online in one platform. This laid the groundwork for our present business model, focusing on business-to-business (B2B) pre-owned luxury wholesale.In the early days, I juggled my entrepreneurial pursuits with my demanding role as a lawyer. My side hustle typically unfolded between 8 p.m. to 2 or 3 a.m. and consumed weekends for several years. Fast forward — the light bulb went off again when we saw that our stores were buying from each other more and more on our platform. We realized they needed a way to source pre-owned authentic handbags and jewelry from other trusted businesses online. We then launched the first B2B pre-owned luxury wholesale auction houses from across the globe to retailers in the U.S., and it grew from there.


At which point did you decide to leave your corporate jobs to focus on LePrix full-time, and what motivated you to take the leap? Whang: I was eight months pregnant, happily married, with a great job as a lawyer. I was patting myself on the back for being the first female lawyer in our family. But I was also panicking that life was going by at warp speed, and if I didn't take the leap soon to work on this great business plan, it may never happen. In hindsight, I was probably going through a midlife crisis. We applied to an accelerator program and got in, but they required only full-time founders, which meant I had to quit my day job. I was scared about what our immigrant parents, who worked their behinds off to give us the American dream, would think. My husband asked me what I was going to do — and I said I wanted to take a bet on this business; otherwise, I'd regret it on my deathbed (I know, dramatic). I popped out my baby and then started my entrepreneurial journey. I haven't looked back since.Related: Being 'Lazy' Paid Off: Her Failed Side Hustle Led to a Business That Brings in Over $100 Million a YearErkel: At the time, I had been at a large specialty retailer, working with the leadership team on different strategies, from growing their new baby business to exploring ways to shorten lead time from design to delivery. It was an amazing experience and a great team, but part of me yearned to build something that was more aligned with my passion growing up. When I was younger, I was obsessed with fashion, especially luxury and vintage. When my co-founder and sister, Elise, approached me with the idea of launching this as a side hustle, my gut reaction was an immediate yes. Once we started gaining traction and growing quickly, I knew it was time to go full-time, but I was nervous. Innately, I am more risk averse, but the numbers (and Elise) are very convincing. Would I rather be a cog in a wheel or chart my own course and try something new and exciting that there was clearly a market demand for? The answer was clear.


What have been some of the biggest challenges you've faced over the course of your founding journey so far, and how have you overcome them? Whang: One of the significant challenges we faced was securing funding from venture capitalists (VCs). The reality of less than 5% of female founders successfully raising funds from VCs is real. Our company deviates from the conventional VC company profile; we're far from resembling the stereotypical characters depicted in the HBO show Silicon Valley (one of my favorite shows). Notably, our team is 60% BIPOC, with two female founders, and we take immense pride in this diversity. We have, however, successfully secured funds from private investors and early-stage VCs who wholeheartedly believe in our vision, the business, its potential and our team.Erkel: Another challenge was the pivot from B2C to B2B. It was clear that the way to help our stores was not selling but sourcing. For businesses, sourcing pre-owned luxury is difficult, risky and expensive because the wholesale industry for luxury resale is highly fragmented. As our B2B business continued to take off, Elise and I knew it was time to sunset our B2C business. It was a decision we thought very carefully about as the B2C business was not only our first baby, but we had also built a pretty successful business. However, the growth of the B2B business was immense, and with limited resources and time, we knew it was time to double down on B2B.Related: I Spent the Last 3 Years Building My Side Hustle Into a Full-Time Business. Here's What I Learned.What are you most excited about as you look to LePrix's future? Erkel: As the leader in the B2B pre-owned luxury industry, we are most excited to be the driving force making luxury resale accessible to retailers globally. We have the opportunity to change the industry, help retailers meet consumer demand and, most importantly, make a sustainable impact.What's your best advice for other side hustlers who hope to turn their gigs into full-time ventures?Whang: Don't quit your day job until you have some data or traction. DO build out a business model with your data and make an informed decision to take the leap. Don't obsess about hyper growth anymore, but DO build a profitable business — it's still a business. Don't kick yourself for failing. DO learn from your mistakes and quickly pivot.


Erkel: Don't be scared to take the leap. Life is short, and time is limited. If your side hustle shows traction and the only thing that is holding you back is fear, overcome it. Don't let fear dictate your life and stop you from moving forward. Life is more fulfilling if you're doing what you love.

A vibrant, customer-focused online presence can be created with virtual try-ons, live chat support and personalized product suggestions.


Successful use of this method requires a thorough website assessment. User-friendliness and rapid loading times let visitors relax and enjoy themselves. Explore incorporating AR and VR to give clients an engaging and personalized online purchasing experience. Finally, add elements that suit each customer's likes and habits to make purchasing more fun.Online security is crucial for any company in the digital age. Customers must trust you with their money while buying online. Any complete website review should prioritize security and usability. In this digital age, your company's legitimacy depends on internet trust.Elevating digital marketing beyond the basicsDigital marketing goes beyond raising brand recognition; it's all about creating audience-specific campaigns that connect. Oberlo predicts that digital advertising expenditure in the U.S. will reach $325 billion by 2025. This points to the growing significance of digital advertising in reaching consumers.Companies should look into influencer partnerships, interactive content and community-building projects in addition to the usual social media postings. These initiatives foster awareness and lay the foundation for a loyal customer base.


Firms should make a detailed content schedule with several formats to keep the material interesting and up-to-date, including blog posts, infographics and videos. To create a genuine connection with the audience, collaborate with influencers aligning with the company's values. In addition, make campaigns that customers can participate in through interactive polls and quizzes and promote user-generated material.For entrepreneurs, digital marketing is not just about promotion; it's an educational journey. Educate consumers about the advantages of digital financial solutions while advertising your services with engaging content. To build a genuine relationship with your audience, team up with influencers who have a firm grasp of the ins and outs of the financial industry.

It's about uncovering insights that can aid individuals in making decisions. Companies should consider investing in predictive analytics to understand customer preferences, anticipate market changes and automate routine tasks to free up time for analysis and decision-making. Regular training on understanding and using data analysis results is essential if your teams want to make the most of data-driven decision-making.


When it comes to the digital world, data is king. Investing in predictive analytics from a strategic standpoint will help you remain ahead of market trends. However, fostering an environment where your staff recognizes the value of data insights is equally important. Your whole company can benefit from consistent data interpretation training.Improving mobile experienceOptimizing websites for mobile devices has become a requirement rather than a luxury. However, more than simply relying on design is required. To truly enhance consumer engagement, organizations should consider developing their mobile apps. Offering discounts for mobile app users can significantly increase the likelihood of customers downloading and actively using these apps. Statista's data shows that in the first quarter of 2023, mobile devices generated almost 60% of web traffic worldwide.This emphasizes mobile optimization. Your clients utilize mobile devices for shopping, browsing and more besides communication. Usability testing on many mobile devices can assist organizations in guaranteeing this strategy works and customers like it. Assessing the viability of a customer-focused mobile app is vital. Use mobile-exclusive discounts or loyalty programs to encourage app-based customer interactions for a simple and customized experience.Recognize that mobile financial transactions are growing. Mobile optimization should be strategic, not just convenient. Create a mobile app to reach users directly. Users expect seamless mobile device experiences. Recognize that smartphones are an extension of your users' financial lives and adopt a mobile-first approach.

As per the estimates by Cybersecurity Ventures, cybercrime is projected to grow 15% year over year, incurring $10.5 trillion in economic losses by 2025.This number illustrates the risks of online commerce. Beyond conventional safeguards, firms should communicate their cybersecurity commitment through transparent policies and security updates.Businesses should train employees on cybersecurity threats regularly. To protect sensitive data, use encryption and multi-factor authentication. Newsletters and social media posts regarding cybersecurity processes soothe clients and build trust.


Trust is crucial to cybersecurity beyond technology. Communicate your cybersecurity commitment as an entrepreneur. Understand that one security violation can ruin trust. Train your personnel on cybersecurity as a precaution and part of your company's culture. Trust is cash, and cybersecurity is its vault.

In my journey to achieving $1M in ecommerce sales, I've navigated countless challenges and uncovered key strategies that truly drive success. In sharing these insights, my aim is to offer you a clear, hands-on guide — a blueprint that's been tested in the real world of online retail.We'll dive into identifying profitable niches, building a unique brand identity, harnessing data for marketing and effectively scaling your business.Related: Don't Be a Waiter — Be a Creator. 5 Ways to Create Opportunities for Yourself In 2024



1. Identify high-demand, low-competition nichesWithin the realm of dropshipping, the key was identifying the right niche. This required a strategic approach to understanding market demand, especially in areas underserved by larger players.I began by harnessing Google Keyword Planner to discover niche products within broader categories. For example, I focused on unique sub-niches like 'handcrafted gemstone earrings' or 'vintage-inspired brooches' in the jewelry sector. These were terms with considerable search volume but limited competition, indicating a potential market gap.


Next, I used SEMrush to conduct a competitive analysis. This involved studying what competitors were offering and, more importantly, what they weren't. I looked for patterns in overlooked products or customer needs not being fully addressed.This step was crucial in confirming the potential of the chosen niche.Related: This Former Stay-at-Home Mom Started a 'Zero Experience' Side Hustle That's Earned Over $500,000 — and She Doesn't Work More Than 1 Hour a Day2. Craft a unique brand propositionEstablishing a distinctive brand identity was essential for my ecommerce venture, particularly in the competitive jewelry space. This went beyond just a logo or a tagline; it was about creating an emotional connection with customers.


The first step was to define the brand's unique value proposition. I focused on what set my jewelry offerings apart — was it the artisanal craftsmanship, the ethical sourcing of materials, or perhaps a fusion of traditional and modern designs?This clear definition helped shape all aspects of branding, from the website design to social media presence.I utilized tools like Canva to design visually appealing graphics that resonated with my brand's aesthetic. Platforms like Shopify offered customizable templates for creating a cohesive and professional-looking online store that matched the brand's image.Social media plays a pivotal role in storytelling. Through platforms like Instagram and Pinterest, known for their visual appeal, I showcased the jewelry, shared stories behind the designs, and engaged with the audience. This built a community around the brand, enhancing customer loyalty.


But it wasn't just about online presence; customer experience was key. Every touchpoint, from product packaging to customer service, was aligned with the brand ethos. For instance, using eco-friendly packaging reinforced a commitment to sustainability, a core aspect of the brand.This insight underlines the importance of a well-crafted brand identity in e-commerce. It's not just about selling products; it's about selling an experience, a lifestyle.This approach was instrumental in differentiating my business in the crowded online jewelry market, contributing significantly to its growth and success.Related: 5 Steps to Building Your First Online Sales Funnel


3. Data-driven marketing tactics in ecommerceUtilizing data-driven marketing tactics was a game-changer. It started with collecting and analyzing customer data to inform every marketing decision.I used Google Analytics to track website traffic and customer behavior, understand which products were most popular, and identify patterns in browsing and purchasing. The real power lies in using this data for targeted marketing campaigns. For instance, I used Facebook Pixel on my e-commerce site to gather data on customer activities. This information was then used to create highly targeted Facebook ad campaigns.The ads were more relevant and effective by focusing on customers who showed interest in specific product categories. Email marketing was another crucial component. Using platforms like Mailchimp, I segmented the email list based on customer purchase history and engagement.This segmentation allowed for personalized email campaigns – customers who showed interest in a particular type of jewelry received emails tailored to those preferences, significantly improving open and click-through rates. Content marketing was also tailored based on customer interests. Blog posts and social media content were created around topics related to the most popular products, leveraging SEO to attract organic traffic.


These data-driven marketing tactics ensured that every dollar spent on advertising was targeted and effective. By focusing on what the data was telling me about customer preferences and behaviors, I was able to craft marketing strategies that resonated with the audience, leading to increased engagement and sales.Related: 4 Super Simple Side Hustles That Could Replace Your Regular Wage — Fast4. Sustainably scale your productAchieving $1M in e-commerce sales was not just about initial growth but also about sustainable scaling. This required strategic planning and execution in expanding the business. Key to this was diversifying the product range without deviating from the core brand identity.For example, while specializing in a particular type of jewelry, I gradually introduced related accessories that complemented the main product line. Infrastructure scalability was another focus. As the business grew, I transitioned to using Shopify Plus, which offered more robust features for handling increased transaction volumes and customer data.


This platform's scalability ensured the website remained efficient and customer-friendly, even with growing traffic. Additionally, I implemented automated systems for inventory management and order fulfillment. This not only saved time but also reduced the likelihood of errors. As part of this, I established strong relationships with reliable suppliers and shipping partners to ensure product quality and timely deliveries, which are critical for customer satisfaction and repeat business.Lastly, customer service scalability was crucial. As the business expanded, maintaining high-quality customer service was paramount. This involved setting up a dedicated support team and using CRM tools to manage customer interactions effectively. Scaling an e-commerce business balances expanding your reach and maintaining the quality of your products and services.Related: How to Elevate Your Online Sales with Cutting-Edge Product Photography

81,"He Had $2,000 and No Idea How to Run a Business. Here's How He Turned That Into Two Thriving Barber Shops.","Jan 24, 2024",Jason Feifer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-skull-combs-salon-found-small-business-success/468480,"
If you want to run a great business, then you need to learn from the greats. And they're all around you. They are the mom and pop shops in every town — the barber shops, the coffee shops, the bookstores, and the diners. But these aren't just small businesses. These are master classes in community building, customer service, and innovative marketing.Entrepreneur magazine has teamed up with Walmart Business to go on a nationwide trip to meet the entrepreneurs behind America's Favorite Mom & Pop ShopsTM to learn what it takes to build meaningful businesses that last.Our first stop is New Haven, Connecticut, home of prestigious universities, world-famous pizza and the rocking world of Skull & Combs. It is a barbershop, but it's so much more. Founder Jason Bunce started with just $2,000 in his pocket and no idea how to start a business. But with grit and determination, he built not just two thriving locations, but an incredible community.



Related: See the list our list of America's Favorite Mom and Pop ShopsSo what spurred his decision to start his own business? ""I wanted to really create something, and everywhere that I worked, and everybody that I worked for, it felt so difficult to create the best version of myself within their company,"" Jason told me. ""And I quickly realized that I had to create this brand because no one else could capture the same things that I had in mind.""


Related: The Three Biggest Small Business Questions AnsweredThe motto of Skull & Combs is ""Friends made, hair slayed."" Jason explained, ""We're a salon and barbershop that leads with our hearts. I built this place to accommodate the average person who just likes to get away at the barbershop and experience the salon — but then also piggyback that with really great hair.""He started his journey as a business owner when he was 35 years old. ""I just kind of hit the proverbial dead end."" He says he felt like it was do-or-die time to try his own thing. ""Discontent was the seed of change for me. I was just so frustrated with myself that I had to make a big change. It started with a reflection, and I just kind of reverse-engineered my life into accepting who I was and it led me to an artistic path. And here we are 10 years later with two shops.""A lot of hard work and just a little bit of luck helped Jason establish his business in New Haven. He was eventually able to buy the building from his landlord who was supportive of his goals. ""When I first signed the lease, I got very friendly and familiar with the landlord. He and his wife had owned the property since the '80s, and I mentioned to him, 'Hey, if you were ever interested in selling the property, I would really appreciate first right of refusal.'"" The landlord called 18 months later, but Jason was not yet in a financial position to get approved for a traditional mortgage. However, after a five-minute meeting, the landlord was so impressed with Jason's passion that he agreed to hold a privately held mortgage. ""I was elated,"" Jason says. ""I couldn't believe that he said yes.""


Looking back, I asked Jason what advice he would give himself at the start of his journey. ""Always follow your heart, lead with your passion,"" he says. It is easy to get thrown off by doubters and early business struggles, he says, ""But just stay true to yourself and stay committed to the goal and it will pay you back and reward you.""Related: 5 Successful Entrepreneurs Share Their Best Tips for Starting a Business TodayWalmart Business is excited to support entrepreneurs like Jason, which is why they set him up with a six-month Walmart Business+ membership. Benefits include free shipping, limited-time offers on products for business owners and 2 percent rewards back on purchases over $250. They also gifted him an eGift card for $1,000 to spend on whatever he needs at Walmart Business.I appreciated Jason sharing his story, including all of the hard stuff because that's what entrepreneurs need to hear. They need to see the challenges along with the growth because that's the real story of Skull & Combs and other mom and pop businesses like it. It's great to have a vision, but a vision by itself only gets you so far. When you share that vision, when you align your vision with other people's visions, that's when an idea turns into a lasting business.

82,5 Ways to Avoid Unfair Business Practices While Protecting Your Business and Customers,"Jan 22, 2024",Jeffrey Kaliel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/5-ways-to-steer-clear-of-unfair-business-practices/468111,"
While many businesses can find it tempting to cut corners, any short-term benefits come at a significant cost. Whether intentionally or not, companies looking to maintain a competitive edge in the global marketplace can engage in an array of trade practices that aren't just unfair but illegal. As a result, both the business and their customers suffer.Luckily, proactive entrepreneurs can easily avoid the pitfalls of unfair business practices. Companies can safeguard against costly lawsuits and ensure customer satisfaction through transparency and routine due diligence.Here are five tips on how to avoid unfair business practices that could land your business in hot water.Related: 3 Key Legal Issues Online Marketers Need to Know About1. Establish solid business practices from the jumpEstablish clear operational protocols to ensure your business is set up for success from the get-go. These guidelines should be built into the framework of your business and aligned with the laws set out by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Employees at all levels should be required to read and operate according to these protocols.



However, this initial setup and onboarding aren't enough. To maintain fair business practices, companies should regularly hold employee workshops covering applicable laws, including pertinent updates. This continued training ensures that fair business standards are top of mind for employees in every department and safeguards against poor practices, whether deliberate or unintentional.It also helps to review the trade practices of critical vendors. Ensuring that primary partners are on the same page can prevent tricky business situations and bolster consumer confidence.Related: What Is Marketing Compliance and Why Should You Care About It? Here's What You Need to Know.2. Don't take advantage of customersThough this tip may seem simple, it's perhaps the key lesson in avoiding unfair business practices. No profit should come at the expense of a vulnerable customer. Business practices that target vulnerable demographics like the elderly, infirm, or those who don't speak English as a first language can be deemed by the FTC to be unfair.


Whether you're engaging with customers via online marketing or telemarketing, it's critical to have a strategy in place that communicates effectively with potentially vulnerable customers. Ensure that your marketing strategy doesn't pressure customers into handing over financial information or that your marketing will be easily understood.

Unfortunately, it's all too common for businesses to engage in misrepresentation when advertising products. This could be either overpromising a product's benefits or failing to disclose information on a product.For instance, businesses should not exaggerate a product's abilities. Any marketing must show realistic product functions and results. On the other hand, companies must not hide any negative aspects of the product. All ingredients and components must be listed, and related risks must be disclosed, regardless of how this may impact customer perception.


Additionally, ensure that all reviews and testimonials are authentic. Customers deserve a realistic look at how others perceive your product or services, and fake satisfactory feedback is a misrepresentation. This also applies to celebrity endorsements. When falsified, these can lead to costly legal issues.Related: FTC Proposes Rule to Crack Down on Fake Reviews and Deceptive Marketing Tactics4. Don't make false promises or guarantees you can't fulfillWhen it comes to advertising, businesses must be able to deliver upon marketing commitments. This includes one-time sales, discounts and evergreen promises like return policies. Your company should be transparent about these types of interactions from the get-go so that you aren't misleading customers into purchasing products.Wording matters here: It's unfair to trick customers by burying exclusionary terms in the fine print of a return policy, for instance. Similarly, it can be dangerous territory to misrepresent sales or discounts in a way that forces a customer's hand. Using inaccurate ""limited time"" language or insinuating that your company is going out of business just to drive sales tends to qualify as unfair business practices.

Don't withhold necessary informationFinally, a fundamental way to protect your business and your customers is to share pertinent information that could potentially affect consumer behavior. As mentioned above, this can include ingredients or other product specifications that customers may consider harmful.But this can also be as simple as omission (which can often happen by accident!). For instance, failing to disclose that certain items are sold separately is an unfair business practice. Withholding information about the product's country of origin, its condition, or use cases can also fall under this category.This practice can also pertain to your business as a whole. If your business is filing for bankruptcy or facing other financial issues that could affect an order, this information should be disclosed. Similarly, share any breaches in cybersecurity with customers to ensure they understand any risks involved when engaging with your business.

In the summer of 2021, former stay-at-home mom Gina Van De Voorde was working remotely for a mental health facility — and the gig was ""ironically destroying [her] own mental health.""""I just hated the job,"" Van De Voorde tells Entrepreneur. ""I dreaded it every single day. And that's what kind of led me into looking for different side hustles or businesses to start.""Van De Voorde scoured YouTube for hours every day in search of inspiration until she found a tutorial for print-on-demand. Print-on-demand services allow side-hustlers and business owners to create and ship their products as orders come in — which means fewer costly minimums and less risk.

Despite having ""zero"" experience in ecommerce or graphic design, she was able to open her Etsy clothing shop that same day.


""Thankfully a lot of simple designs sell really well.""She opted to work with the print-on-demand platform Printify and create her designs on Canva.""I'm definitely still not a graphic designer by any means,"" Van De Voorde says. ""I still don't really even think I'm that good, but thankfully, a lot of simple designs sell really well. Text-based designs sell well.""For the first few months, Van De Voorde ""was just kind of guessing"" which designs would resonate with customers. The strategy wasn't all that effective in the beginning, she admits. But the more time Van De Voorde spent on Etsy, conducting research from 9-5 alongside her full-time job, the more she realized which styles and trends would sell.

""In the beginning, I was just testing a bunch of niches until I tested the Western niche that proved to be very successful. So that was pretty much my first niche that scaled really well.""


Van De Voorde also offers her designs on Shopify now but says it's ""totally different"" from selling on Etsy. With the latter, she doesn't have to worry about driving her own traffic, as it's ""more like a marketplace.""Related: How This Seller Makes $12,000 a Month of Passive Income on Etsy""As long as you're consistent, posting every day, you'll see success.""Van De Voorde's consistent trial-and-error approach paid off — big time.

And her best advice for other side-hustlers who hope to take a page from her book and run their own successful print-on-demand businesses? Don't assume it's some overnight ""get rich quick scheme.""""It's a lot of work upfront,"" Van De Voorde says. ""So just be prepared that you have to front-load the work in the beginning in order to get your shop off the ground — then you can kind of pull it back. But as long as you're consistent, posting every day, you'll see success.""

Macy's Inc. is making some major changes to its leadership and operations in 2024.The department-store chain is laying off around 2,350 corporate staff members — 13% of its corporate workforce — and closing five locations in an attempt to streamline costs and refocus resources on enhancing the consumer shopping journey, The Wall Street Journal reported.Related: Target to Cut Thousands of Jobs as It Seeks to Trim Costs by $2 Billion



Macy's overall workforce will see a 3.5% reduction, excluding seasonal hires, as the company looks to introduce more automation to its supply-chain operations and outsource some roles to third-party providers. Additionally, tiers of management will be reduced to improve efficiency.The department-store behemoth, also the parent company to Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, plans substantial investments in customer-facing areas. Soon, Macy's stores will feature more visual display managers to boost store aesthetics and digital improvements for a smoother online shopping experience, per the report.


This reorganization comes ahead of Tony Spring's ascension to CEO, succeeding Jeff Gennette next month. Macy's faces not just transitional leadership but also considerable pressure from activist investors who have publicized a $5.8 billion takeover offer.""The buyout group is undoubtedly interested in Macy's large real estate portfolio, which has attracted activists and potential buyers in the past,"" Morningstar analyst David Swartz said in a note reported by Reuters.According to JPMorgan analysts, Macy's total real estate value is estimated at approximately $8.5 billion, or $31 per share, including its Herald Square property worth about $3 billion, per the outlet.Related: The Full List of Major U.S. Companies Slashing Staff Next Year, from Nike to IntelWhile Macy's has not publicly addressed the buyout bid, more details on its new strategy are expected in the coming weeks, per WSJ.The changes will take effect on January 26 and include the sales of two furniture locations and store closures in Ballston Quarter, Arlington, Virginia; Bayfair Center, San Leandro, California; Kukui Grove Center, Lihue, Hawaii; Simi Valley Town Center, Simi Valley, California; and Governor's Square, Tallahassee, Florida.The wave of layoffs at Macy's is part of a broader trend witnessed in early 2024, with peers such as Google, Amazon, and Citigroup also streamlining their workforce. However, this occurs against a backdrop of a potential ""soft landing"" for the U.S. economy, as inflation shows signs of easing, and sectors like retail continue to demonstrate growth — albeit at a moderate pace compared to pre-Covid patterns, according to the outlet.

85,The 8 Best Free and Low-Cost SEO Tools for Small Businesses,"Jan 17, 2024",Jason Hennessey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/8-best-free-and-low-cost-seo-tools-for-small-businesses/466675,"
Small businesses face unique challenges when it comes to their marketing operations. For one, very few have dedicated personnel to manage marketing campaigns (there may be few team members wearing many hats). They might also have limited financial resources, making it difficult to subscribe to the latest and best marketing tools.But running a small business also has its advantages. There is often far less competition within a small niche market, and successful marketing campaigns are significantly less expensive. Similarly, amazing results can still be achieved even with a small repertoire of marketing tools.If you're looking to increase organic traffic to your business via Search Engine Optimization (SEO), here are some cost-effective software solutions to have in your toolkit.



Related: 5 Simple SEO Methods That Produce Major Traffic for Small Businesses1. Google Keyword PlannerGoogle Keyword Planner is Google's own SEO keyword research tool. Although Keyword Planner is primarily used to identify keywords to target with Google Ads, the same data can be used to inform your organic keyword strategy for your website.


Use Keyword Planner to find keywords your target audience may be searching for, validate the search volume and competition level for each and discover related keywords that can help you reach people interested in your products or services.Cost: FreeRelated: 5 Simple SEO Strategies to Improve Your Rankings2. Google Search ConsoleGoogle Search Console (GSC) is another Google-hosted SEO tool, but specific to your website performance and analytics. GSC measures your website traffic, identifies site issues and allows you to monitor your ranking keywords. Sign up for GSC using your Google account, add the code to your website, and start tracking. This data will allow you to make improvements to your website that can help increase your organic traffic.


Cost: Free3. Google AnalyticsGoogle Analytics is perhaps the most widely known SEO analytics tool, and for good reason. For one, it's fed by first-party data directly from Google, making it one of the most accurate analytics tools. Also, it allows you to implement conversion tracking to monitor what actions users take on your website, whether filling out a form, subscribing to a newsletter, purchasing a product, etc. You can also monitor traffic from other channels, not just Google, such as referral traffic, direct traffic or social media traffic.Cost: FreeRelated: 7 Ways Small Businesses Can Use SEO to Boost Customer Service and Growth


4. Yoast (WordPress only)With WordPress being the most popular Content Management System (CMS), it's only fitting to mention Yoast. Yoast is a WordPress-specific SEO plugin that allows businesses to add essential on-page elements to their sites, including meta titles, meta descriptions, keywords and internal links. Once activated, the Yoast plugin displays a score (red, yellow or green) to reflect the degree to which your website is optimized. Some alternatives to Yoast include RankMath and SEOPress.Cost: $99 per year5. SemrushSemrush is one of the best ""freemium"" SEO software options, with a wide range of keyword research functions, site auditing features, content optimization tools and more. Like Google Keyword Planner, you can research keywords relevant to your service or product and even discover the keywords your competitors are ranking for. You can audit your site for on-page and technical SEO issues and receive an easy-to-follow report on how to fix them. Semrush also includes backlink analysis, listing management and local SEO tools, which are not available via Keyword Planner or Google Analytics.Cost: free (limited); paid starts at $129.95 per month


6. SpyFuSpyFu is a small-business-friendly competitive keyword research tool. Its complete SEO marketing suite includes a Pay Per Click ad analyzer, robust historical data, competitive analysis tools, backlink outreach and even custom reporting. SpyFu is a close runner-up to Semrush, as it provides a range of helpful SEO features at an affordable price. However, Semrush is often the preferred option, given that it includes on-page, off-page, and technical SEO tools (the trifecta).Cost: free (limited); $16 per month (annual plan)7. AnswerThePublicAnswerThePublic is not explicitly an SEO tool but rather a ""search listening tool,"" but it made the list because it is supremely helpful when it comes to small business content strategy. And content is one of the most important drivers of organic traffic. AnswerThePublic allows you to search for a primary keyword and discover a ""web"" of questions and/or topics to turn into blog posts or web pages.For example, say you sell dog toys online; some topic ideas generated could include ""Are dog toys machine washable?"" or ""Which toys are safe for dogs?"" These might make interesting blog posts that appeal to the interests of your target audience.


Cost: FreeRelated: How to Create an Effective SEO Strategy in 20238. Screaming FrogScreaming Frog is an industry-leading website crawling and log analysis tool. Its purpose is to imitate a Google web crawler, ""crawl"" your website and identify any issues hindering its organic performance. Such issues might include broken links (404 pages), missing page titles, oversized images, unused JavaScript and many others. Addressing these issues can help you speed up your website, make it more discoverable by real search engines, and increase your organic rankings, leading to more site traffic. Screaming Frog is best paired with a keyword research tool like Semrush to ensure a holistic SEO strategy.Cost: free (limited); paid starts at $259 per year


So now what?In small business marketing, the challenges are unique, often stemming from limited resources and personnel juggling multiple roles. SEO can feel intimidating, especially to small business owners facing limited technical and financial resources. However, the advantages of operating in a niche market with lower competition and cost-effective campaigns are undeniable. To harness these benefits, businesses can leverage powerful yet budget-friendly SEO tools. Elevate your small business's online presence with these tools, turning challenges into opportunities for growth and visibility. So, dig in, get optimizing and start seeing the organic payoffs for your website.

There's a good reason — the brand increased its digital ad spend by $23 million in 2023, and as a result saw a 17% bump in digital business. Because 90% of online orders are placed for local pickup or delivery, most of those customers went straight to their local Ace.



It's no wonder that in 2024, Ace plans to increase digital marketing by another $25 million.Moves like this help Ace compete in a crowded hardware market. ""We're not the biggest, but we'll be the best,"" says Ace president and CEO John Venhuizen — and in Entrepreneur's ranking, Ace has accomplished that mission. This is Ace's ninth consecutive year as No. 1 in its category, and its fifth overall appearance in the Top 10. It was No. 7 on the ranking last year.Related: Focusing on These 2 Key Areas Helped Ace Hardware Capitalize on the Pandemic Sales SpikeWhile Ace invests heavily in increasing national brand awareness, its true power lies in its hyperlocal attitude.


Ace Hardware wants its franchisees to think and operate with a degree of uniqueness, catering to the neighborhoods they serve. As a result, no two stores have the same footprint or product selection, and many even have unique names. In Oakland, New Jersey, for example, you'll find Oakland Ace Hardware — the result of an independent hardware shop, Oakland Hardware, converting to a franchise. There are similar stores nationwide.The way Ace sees it, the brand is capitalizing on the people consumers trust — their neighbors. ""Who do you think is going to provide better service?"" Venhuizen asks. ""The local folks sitting next to their customers at the Rotary Club meeting, or a store manager under a corporation that gets all the profits far away?""That hyperlocal thinking also leads to local convenience. The brand had 5,813 units globally as of July 31, 2023 — an increase of 139 over the previous year's count — and 4,926 of those were in the U.S. This means that 75% of Americans live within 15 minutes of an Ace store, which Venhuizen says helps Ace fulfill orders faster than its competition — and with a more personal connection.Related: The 5 Best Retail Franchises You Can Buy Right Now


That personal touch extends even to the employees who make deliveries. ""More often than not,"" says Venhuizen, they'll ring the doorbell and say, 'Are there questions you have about this?'""That doesn't just impress customers; it also impresses future franchisees.

87,4 Tips for Starting an Online Business in 2024,"Jan 12, 2024",Georgi Todorov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-tips-for-starting-an-online-business-in-2024/467884,"
Annually, more than 5 million businesses embark on their entrepreneurial journey. However, statistics indicate that about 30% of these ventures face the challenge of sustainability, leading to failure within their first two years.To navigate these hurdles and set your business on a path to success in 2024, let's delve into four key tips that can help your online venture not just survive, but truly thrive.Related: 6 Ways to Jump-Start Your Online Business



1. Don't focus only on Google as a traffic sourceIt's a startling fact that 93% of online experiences kick off with a search engine. However, the current trend shows a decrease in traffic directed to websites by these search engines. The shift calls for a strategic pivot for online businesses.Embracing a multi-channel approach is not just recommended; it's essential. Almost 50% of all internet users will search for product-related videos before visiting a store, so think beyond Google's SERPs. Platforms like YouTube, Reddit and TikTok are goldmines for reaching diverse and engaged audiences.


The beauty of tapping into multiple traffic sources lies in the sustainability it brings to your business. When you spread your presence across various platforms, you're not just expanding your reach; you're also safeguarding your business against the unpredictability of online traffic trends.This strategy leads to a more robust, resilient and sustainable business model. It empowers you to adapt quickly to market changes, seize emerging opportunities and maintain a steady flow of traffic and potential customers. In the fast-paced world of online business, this adaptability and resilience are key to long-term success.2. Hire a remote team of freelancersIn the dynamic landscape of 2024's economy, the traditional notion of a full-time, in-office team is becoming less of a necessity and more of a choice. The shift towards hiring freelancers and building remote teams is not just a trend; it's a strategic move that aligns with the evolving nature of work and business needs.Hiring freelancers can be significantly more cost-effective than employing full-time staff. Without the need for expenses like office space, equipment and full-time salaries with benefits, businesses can reduce overhead costs. Freelancers are paid for the work they deliver, which means you're investing directly in output, not just hours spent.


The beauty of a remote workforce is the limitless access to talent. You're no longer confined to the local job market. This global reach means you can find the perfect fit for specific tasks or projects, ensuring high-quality output from experts worldwide.There are 73.3 million independent contractors in the United States as of 2023. Freelancing offers unparalleled flexibility. You can scale your workforce up or down based on current business needs without the complications of hiring and laying off full-time employees.Freelancers are motivated to deliver quality work within deadlines, as their reputation and future job prospects depend on it. This drive often translates into higher productivity and innovation, as they bring fresh perspectives and specialized skills to each project.In summary, incorporating freelancers into your business model offers flexibility, cost efficiency and access to specialized skills. It's a forward-thinking approach that aligns with the needs of a modern, agile business environment.


Related: 5 Data-Backed Benefits of Working With Freelancers to Grow Your Business3. Optimizing your taxesWhen venturing into the realm of online business in 2024, it's crucial to understand the significance of tax optimization. It's not about evading taxes but about making informed decisions on where to register your company for the most beneficial tax treatment. Every entrepreneur should pay their fair share, yet it's wise to explore legal avenues that can enhance your business's financial health.Countries like Cyprus and Bulgaria are known for their favorable tax regimes. With low corporate and private entrepreneur income tax rates, they present attractive options for business registration. Such low-tax jurisdictions can significantly reduce your tax burden, freeing up more capital for business growth and development.Estonia offers a unique approach to corporate earnings taxation. Here, generating profit doesn't automatically trigger an income tax liability. Tax is due only when profits are distributed to shareholders. This model provides flexibility and encourages reinvestment of profits back into the business.


Estonia's e-residency program is a game-changer, especially for digital entrepreneurs. With a population of just 1.3 million, Estonia boasts over 109,000 e-residents. This program allows entrepreneurs worldwide to easily set up and manage an Estonian company online. It's a testament to how digital innovation can facilitate global business operations.4. Save from business tools and softwareThe right tools can be the backbone of your operation. However, the cost of subscriptions can quickly add up, creating a significant monthly expense. As an entrepreneur in 2024, it's crucial to navigate this landscape smartly to ensure you're not only equipped with the best tools but also managing your finances efficiently.Many essential tools offer free versions that, while sometimes limited, can be incredibly useful for startups or small businesses. This approach allows you to access vital functionalities without the financial burden of a subscription.Lifetime deals are a goldmine for cost-conscious entrepreneurs. Paying a one-time fee for perpetual access to a tool can save you a fortune in the long run. Keep an eye on platforms that specialize in such deals for startups and digital tools. It's an upfront investment that pays off by eliminating recurring payments.


If a tool is essential for a particular project or a short period, consider subscribing just for the duration needed. This approach is particularly useful for high-cost tools that you don't require year-round. Use the tool for a month or two, get the job done, and then cancel the subscription. This way, you only pay for what you truly need.In conclusion, the mantra ""A dollar saved is a dollar earned"" resonates profoundly with the ethos of our 2024 online business strategies. These savings, much like earnings, are pivotal in strengthening the financial backbone of any online venture.Related: 5 Steps to Creating and Monetizing a Million-Dollar Online Business

88,"Tech-Savvy or Not, Here's Why Businesses Must Embrace Automation Now","Jan 10, 2024",Alidar Utemuratov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-harnessing-automation-can-be-your-companys-game-changer/467381,"
I know 70-year-olds who are more tech-oriented than I am — and I am the CEO of a fast-scaling tech company. I also know young people from IT companies who are not at all tech-savvy.So, when evaluating your team's readiness to adopt agile enterprise services through automation, focus on people's technical affinity, not their age. In my experience, hesitance is more about awareness and often begins at the top. Business leaders first need to accept that automation is the way of the future before it can be scaled for maximum impact.Embracing this tech is vital because agile methodologies not only enhance processes and workflows, but make a company's adaptability to change a competitive strength. Yet automation takes agile services a step further by allowing for rapid software deployment and continuous optimization with minimal oversight. Ironically, resistance to using automation to drive change is what can really cause disruption to a business. That is why I suggest it is better for small and medium-sized businesses to adopt agile enterprise automation services now rather than scrambling to catch up later when it has become industry standard — here is how:



Establish a baseline for change through metricsMetrics are concrete evidence of what works in an organization's processes and what can be improved with automation. Using KPIs and data on customer satisfaction and performance plots the baseline for change and offers a diagnostic of where sluggishness is inhibiting growth. For the owners and leaders of SMEs who may feel they do not always have the time or resources to prioritize optimization, see the problems identified by metrics and who might be affected as an exciting opportunity to bring everyone up to speed.That is always my approach: I get excited by what is possible. When evaluating any agile enterprise option, the first question should be, ""Where does the human factor bring risk?"" Then, find the services that will automate those processes. This may include centralizing task management so the right people are assigned to jobs, people are aware of who is responsible for what across functions, and deadlines are never missed. Automation can also track inventory levels and replenish stock, standardize contracts, and free up finance and accounting from manual processing that may produce costly errors.


For content creators, keeping up with trending topics, managing a content calendar, and scheduling posts is labor-intensive. Use analytics to track engagement and find out where automation will reduce friction. In all these areas, establishing a baseline will paint an unambiguous picture of where improvements can be made and help drive continuous improvement.Related: Automation Is Becoming a Business Imperative: Don't Wait Until It's Too LateDon't change what already worksA good rule of thumb for being smart with automation is: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. While automation promises great efficiencies and can set up companies for growth, do not even try to introduce it to areas that are already operating as a well-oiled machine. Instead, narrow the focus to where the organization is getting bogged down by duplication, repetition, unwieldy bureaucracy, and handling large volumes of data.We set up a system where decisions are automatically delegated for approval, and documentation is automatically generated. This was an area where we had noticed a significant slowdown, and by removing the unnecessary layers in the process, such as calling the manager and drawing up special reports, we created so much more efficiency.


However, we were also mindful that other areas of the business where the human touch is helpful were to be left alone. Building client relationships can never be outsourced to technology and certain aspects of customer service rely on empathetic human interaction. So, be clear about your business goals and consumer expectations to know which processes to target.Related: How to Ensure Tech Doesn't Overshadow Your Brand's Human TouchStrike the right balance to guarantee qualityIt is human to make mistakes, but sometimes those errors can go unnoticed and cause larger problems down the line. Automation provides consistency and accuracy while also identifying errors from sometimes complex streams of information. This comes back to the first point about metrics. When our inspection mechanisms are so precise, we have better visibility into how our teams are working and can accurately track the progress of the established baseline.Identifying risks and automating those processes will then allow leaders to make quality guarantees to their stakeholders. However, some human oversight of automation will still be required for quality assurance, especially whenever complexity, security, and regulatory compliance are involved. To strike the right balance, create a set of best practices by piloting and testing the automation of agile services in a controlled environment.


In the meantime, leaders should never lose sight of the purpose of automation in the first place as they create internal alignment around their new goals. People need to know that decision-making, innovation, and creativity all benefit from AI's capacity to synthesize complex data because it gives them the most relevant and accurate information to do all of those things better.Better late than never to become more agileAutomating processes normally undertaken by humans can be a daunting prospect for small and medium-sized businesses. That hesitance must be overcome because the reality is this tech transformation will not be slowing down for late adopters. To bring people on board for the change requires clear communication about how automation will make human control of repetitive tasks redundant — and make the business itself more agile and competitive. That should be good news for everyone, whether they are tech-savvy or a tech neophyte.

89,How I Boosted My Website's Revenue Tenfold in 5 Months,"Jan 9, 2024",Jim Campbell,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-i-boosted-my-websites-revenue-tenfold-in-5-months/466398,"
In July of this year, I purchased Honeymoons.com for mid-six figures. The acquisition was a strategic shift from managing multiple online businesses to focusing on one. While it was a gamble to move away from the portfolio model, the past five months have resulted in a 7x increase in traffic and a 10x increase in revenue for the site.Here's how I arrived at the decision to purchase a premium domain name and how the purchase has resulted in a much stronger overall business. Whether you are struggling to manage multiple businesses, seeking to grow organic search traffic or just starting to build your online business, I hope my lessons can help.Related: I Spent the Last 3 Years Building My Side Hustle Into a Full-Time Business. Here's What I Learned.



Pursuing a portfolioIn 2022, I was able to quit my full-time job managing a portfolio of websites for Thrasio and focus fully on my own portfolio. My strategy was to continue working on my main site, HoneymoonGoals.com, and build a portfolio of websites in correlated niches, such as engagement rings, weddings and Caribbean travel.Portfolio models are hot right now. Influencers like Codie Sanchez have built a massive following promoting buying and running multiple businesses (she owns more than two dozen). My previous employer, Thrasio, built a portfolio of Amazon businesses and became the fastest U.S. company to reach a $1B valuation. While the diversification of a portfolio makes sense, I uncovered some serious downsides to running multiple online businesses that led to my decision to purchase Honeymoons.com.


2 deadly problems with the portfolio model for organic search trafficThe main benefit of building a portfolio of websites is diversification. Running a single website can be risky. Google Core Updates can decimate organic traffic. Critical partners can shut down significant sources of revenue. A portfolio can provide safety through multiple sources of traffic and income streams.But a portfolio is hard to manage and harder to grow. After raising over $3 billion to create a portfolio of Amazon businesses, Thrasio is preparing to file for bankruptcy. The portfolio model is not quite as ""cookie-cutter"" as it seems.Websites that rely on organic search traffic, like mine, need to excel in two crucial areas: quality of content and authority. I discovered that a portfolio model makes this extremely difficult.Problem 1: Producing and maintaining top-quality contentI have a staff of freelance writers who are skilled at researching and formatting articles for SEO. However, instead of focusing on honeymoons, they needed to delve into engagement rings, weddings and Caribbean travel.


Google has been clear for decades that it wants websites to produce ""helpful, reliable, people-first content."" To rank at the top of Google results and stay there, you need to create the best content on that topic, which is the most helpful information online. Hiring experts to create this content in multiple niches is incredibly difficult.Problem 2: Being a genuine authorityGoogle evaluates websites on E-E-A-T, which stands for experience, expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness. These qualities are commonly called the ""authority"" of a website. Demonstrating true E-E-A-T is the fastest way to climb Google rankings and generate search traffic.One leading indicator of E-E-A-T is links to your website from other websites. For example, if the Wall Street Journal references you and your website as an expert in travel, that is a sign to Google that your website has authority in the travel niche. Splitting focus across multiple websites creates a serious issue for building this authority.Related: How I Turned My Love for Travel Into a $50k a Month Business


Going all-in on honeymoonsAfter a previous conversation, the owner of Honeymoons.com contacted me and told me he was accepting offers for the business. I realized that focusing on a single business with a premium domain name may solve the two biggest challenges of running a portfolio of businesses.The acquisition was a serious gamble. Five months later, here are the results:Massive improvements in quality and authority with an expert content teamSince acquiring Honeymoons.com, the content has drastically increased. The authoritative domain name has made it easier to attract top talent to contribute their travel expertise and experience to the website. We even hired a travel agent to assist visitors and edit content.Moving from multiple niches to one combined has produced better, more focused content. Writers and articles are able to level up their subsequent articles instead of plateauing. For example, the website has over 250 honeymoon destinations. As we add destinations and improve the quality of existing articles, the team is able to dive deep into evaluating a honeymoon destination, as opposed to moving to a different topic.


Recognized as an authority by leading websitesThe premium domain name, alongside my focus on honeymoons, has made it exceptionally easier to get mentions and links from leading websites and institutions.In the past five months, Honeymoons.com has been referenced by The Wall Street Journal, Yahoo.com, AskMen.com and many other popular websites. After trying for years to build these mentions with subpar domain names, I am certain that the premium domain name accelerated the increased trust needed to cite our content and opinions.700%+ increase in organic trafficThe combination of improved content and authority has skyrocketed the SEO traffic for Honeymoons.com.For transparency, I will use metrics from the popular SEO tool ahrefs. Before my acquisition, the website was receiving an average of 5,500 organic visitors per month. Currently, it receives nearly 44,500 monthly organic visitors.


Google is rewarding the investment into quality content and the recognition of Honeymoons.com as a leader in romantic travel.10x increase in revenueConcurrently, with an increase in traffic, the revenue of the website has increased substantially.The value of the monthly organic traffic to Honeymoons.com in June was $3,500, according to ahrefs. By December, the value of the organic traffic had jumped to $35,000 per month. Traffic value has increased faster than traffic volume, due to high-value search terms ranking, such as ""honeymoon packages,"" which would cost around $0.50 to acquire a user via CPC advertising.This increase is directly correlated to the improvement in content quality and the jump in authority, all made possible by focusing our efforts on building a premium domain name.

While it presents challenges, including high cost and strategic planning, the potential for a strong ROI makes it a worthy consideration for small to medium-sized business owners looking to elevate their digital presence.

Katherine O'Brien.When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?



My side hustle journey has been two-fold. I started my ice cream business, Cream Cruiser, in May of 2015 kind of on a whim. I was working a regular 9-5 but always knew that I wanted to create something that was my own.At the time, I was walking to my 9-5 job through the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, which, over the summer, was always filled with lots of visitors and corporate commuters such as myself. Some days, there would be so many people that you could hardly navigate through the crowds. I was constantly thinking to myself how amazing an ice cream cart would be on a hot, sunny day.


Also, at this time, the mobile food industry had really started to gain traction. I wasn't interested in starting an ice cream truck because of the investment. I wanted something smaller and simpler. After some research and phone calls, I found a small business that manufactured custom food bikes. And within minutes of speaking with them, I knew it was for me.I got the entire business up and running for under $10,000 and launched in just a few months. I started at a local farmers market, and it wasn't long until I got into catering weddings, corporate and college events, etc.Image Credit: Elizabeth Rodenhizer Photography


Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill. It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.I worked a full-time job and sold ice cream during the summer for over three years to be able to put every penny back into the business. Finally, in 2018, I quit my job to go all in on my ice cream business. At this time, I also expanded into wholesale and even private label.The second part of my side hustle journey came into play after a tough few years from 2020-2022. As a small business in the food and beverage and events industry, I felt like I could not keep my head above water and knew that something needed to change.As events were introduced back into our lives, my little catering business started to take off. All of a sudden, I got my fire back and had a great income stream that I had been missing over the past two years during the pandemic. Towards the end of 2022, I decided to stop focusing on the wholesale and private label and go back to doing what I loved, which was selling ice cream from a bike at events.


This led me to part two of my side hustle journey. I created Bike Business University to share my love of this ice cream bike business model with as many people as possible. It's simple, it's affordable, and it's fun! My goal is to make the bike business community just as big as the food truck community.Related: This Ballet Dancer Needed a Side Hustle When the Pandemic Stopped Performances. So She Spun Her Unique Skill Set Into a 6-Figure Business.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?The first thing I did was start my Ice Cream Bike Lady social media accounts. I began sharing my journey and what I loved about my ice cream catering business.  I was also using this time to learn more about digital marketing and how to teach others what I had learned over the years. I wanted to help them avoid some of the lessons I learned the hard way. Pretty quickly, I started connecting with people all over the country looking for a mentor to help them get started and, most importantly, hold them accountable for bringing their business to life. So, I continued listening to my audience and created what they were asking for.


Image Credit: Katherine O'BrienWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?Due to the challenges that came with the pandemic, for a while, I struggled with feeling like I had failed — that I didn't have what it took to scale my ice cream business to what I had originally envisioned when I first went full-time with it. But in reality, those challenges were the best thing that ever happened because they forced me to refocus my goals and brought Bike Business University into my life. It took me a while to be okay with the fact that change is healthy, and being an entrepreneur, it is incredibly important to adapt as needed.

Here's What I Learned.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue, and at what point did the side hustle's income surpass your full-time job?I launched Bike Business University before I had even created it. I had an idea of what the program would look like and had started developing the backend, but it was far from ready. I wanted to make sure it sold before I dove in 100%, so I did a pre-sale. Within the first week, I had sold over $10,000 in courses. I am very grateful that it did not slow down after that, and almost immediately, I replaced my full-time job's income.You've turned your side hustle into a full-time business. How much average monthly or annual revenue does it bring in now?Currently, I average $20,000 per month with Bike Business University. With the recent growth, I am projected to double that by the start of summer 2024.What's your advice for other side-hustlers who hope to turn their ventures into successful businesses?Start before you are ready, and trust yourself enough to know that if you're passionate about what you're doing, you will figure it out as you go. It's okay to make mistakes. It's okay to learn lessons the hard way. It's okay to adapt and make changes as you need to. Just keep going and keep growing.Related: 4 Things Entrepreneurs Don't Need, According to This Outdoor Adventurer and Creative Founder


Also, learn online skills. The internet and social media can be incredibly powerful when you understand the opportunities available. Nothing brings me more joy than selling ice cream out at events, but having an online side to my business has been a total game-changer for me — and provided me with an uncapped income that would not be possible solely from ice cream sales.

92,The Skills Gap Is Rapidly Widening — Here's What We Must Do To Close It.,"Jan 5, 2024",Claire Gribbin,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-skills-gap-is-rapidly-widening-heres-what-we-must/466554,"
Employers and other leaders, along with most employees, know all too well that it's a challenging time to be a worker. With the adoption of artificial intelligence and social media marketing particularly, the nature of productivity and what it means to be a skilled worker is transforming. Simply being attentive and hardworking used to pass muster, but today there is a plethora of digital skills that individuals must possess to be competitive. In fact, a 2022 report, ""How Skills Are Disrupting Work: The Transformational Power of Fast Growing, In-Demand Skills"" detailed that need for employees with skills in AI/machine learning, cloud computing, social media and product management was the highest ever in that year — and growing rapidly.The trouble is — an ever-widening skills gap prevents a large percentage of the unemployed and underemployed from being qualified for such jobs. For instance, that same report stated that over its preceding five years, the average U.S. employee had to either replace or upgrade 37% of skills in order to carry out the duties of their position. A 2023 study conducted by my own organization, Amazon Web Services (along with Gallup), found that 68% of employers in the United Kingdom are struggling to find staff members with the necessary digital knowledge. A more troubling figure still is that just 11% of workers in the U.K. possess the skills needed to obtain and retain these higher-tech jobs.When it comes to this skills gap, small and medium-size businesses find themselves in a unique position. While some leaders might feel daunted as they try to keep up with better-resourced and larger competitors, there are also advantages to being smaller and nimble. They can pivot quickly, testing out new pilot programs that arm smaller staffs with more certifications and training.

Here Are The Tell-Tale SignsHow upskilling creates revenueLargely trained in a time before AI and machine learning took over the conversation, today's workers are also struggling with the effects of the pandemic. How can they keep up? One answer is ""reskilling"" (aka ""upskilling""), in which employees set out to learn new skills either on their own or with the help of work-based programs. And not surprisingly, employers offering high-quality learning and development programs benefit from such an investment.


Owners will be cheered to note that this doesn't have to represent a massive time commitment: Training for specific tasks associated with higher digital skills can take as little as an hour, and offer an immediate return. To be most effective, however, such instruction needs to be outcome-driven, and approachable. For example, Amazon Web Services offers free training in many areas (including basic generative AI solutions) that's designed to be easy for non-technical people to follow.Offering such opportunities doesn't just mean more talented workers: That same Amazon Web Services study showed that revenue for companies engaged in training of this type was 168% higher than those with lower levels of digital skill advancement. Better still, employees with intermediate digital skills stand to earn 40% more annually than those with basic digital skills, while those in the advanced bracket earn a whopping 65% more. A 2023 white paper by authors representing MIT, Stanford University and the National Bureau of Economic Research confirmed this — that the promise of generative AI benefits less experienced workers the most. The goal is to level the playing field, allowing those with less experience to gain skills faster — upending inequality in productivity.Related: How to Keep Employees Engaged and Productive in the Age of AISmaller organizations usually have smaller workforces, which means that the value of every employee (as a percentage of overall productivity) is much higher in a small and medium-size business than in a larger company. Similarly, the benefits of an upskilling program will ripple faster in smaller organizations, whether that means having more highly skilled managers in place or simply spreading the word about upskilling's benefits.


Lastly, such programs can go a long way towards recruiting talent. Smaller enterprises, pretty much inevitably, will wind up duking it out with much larger and resource-rich ones with which they simply can't compete when it comes to salaries. In a PwC study on HR and recruiting, however, 51% of respondents reported a willingness to give up higher salaries for personal flexibility and training opportunities.Related: Employees With Advanced Digital Skills Contribute $507.9 Billion To India's GDP: AWS ReportInvesting in the futureAt first blush, the cost of helping your workforce garner needed skills might seem hefty — even out of reach for some — but they don't have to be.

For example, the Amazon Web Services Skill Builder offers free on-demand labs and hands-on learning for a variety of skill levels.

Sweet Loren's


In this ongoing series, we are sharing advice, tips and insights from real entrepreneurs who are out there doing business battle on a daily basis. (Answers have been edited and condensed for clarity.)Who are you and what's your business?My name is Loren Castle and I am a born and bred New Yorker. My company Sweet Loren's creates delicious, better-for-you baked goods. We're sold in over 25,000 supermarkets. What makes our cookie dough special is not only the incredible homemade taste, but the fact that it is convenient and easy to bake, and all of the products are gluten-free and plant-based, made with only simple clean ingredients, and free of the top 14 common allergens.



What inspired you to create this business?I was inspired to start Sweet Loren's after surviving cancer in my early twenties. I found myself searching for ways to satisfy my sweet tooth with ingredients I actually felt good about. Great-tasting, clean food became essential to my health, well-being and recovery so I took cooking and nutrition classes so I could take care of myself and make delicious, healthier food. But, as someone with a big sweet tooth, there was nothing on the market that tasted great and was made of simple ingredients. So, I started to make my own cookie recipes. When family, friends, and strangers at parties couldn't get enough of my cookies, that's when I knew there was a bigger need than myself and I was inspired to start Sweet Loren's.


Related: This Founder's Platform Is Unlocking the Secrets of Living Longer Through Personalized NutritionWere there any moments when you knew you were on to something?I've had many ""aha"" moments over time. My first was when I created my original chocolate chip cookie recipe (after hundreds of failed attempts), alone in my kitchen saying in my head, ""This is a perfect cookie."" My picky younger sister was the next ""aha"" moment when I saw her gobble the whole cookie down. I knew we could win over even the pickiest of eaters. I then won a charity baking contest for the Lower East Side Girls Club and the judge was a famous pastry chef (Gina DePalma who sadly since passed from cancer) came up to me and said ""you need to do something with this."" That was another ""aha"" moment from someone outside my family that I looked up to that validated the need for a concept like Sweet Loren's that stood for using stricter, cleaner, better-for-you ingredients — and could still compete on taste.How did you find your way onto store shelves?


I got a meeting with a buyer at the Columbus Circle Whole Foods Market in NYC, probably the busiest Whole Foods in the country. I didn't have a packaged selling product yet, but I brought several flavors of cookies I freshly baked that morning. He called me the next day and told me he and his team had never tasted something so good and wanted my cookie dough as soon as possible! I got into Publix stores after my second meeting with them - that is what launched Sweet Loren's not only nationwide, but into mass conventional grocery stores. The next major milestone was getting into all Kroger supermarkets. I told the buyer we had warehouses across the country, a full team, and our factory could handle any volume (none of which we had exactly yet!), but I knew if he gave me the chance, I wouldn't mess it up. That's when I hired Yvette, our VP of Sales (still with me seven years later!) and she helped make sure our execution in these stores was the best it could be.What has been your biggest challenge and how did you pivot to overcome it?My biggest challenge was getting those who weren't gluten free, dairy free, or clean eaters to try our product. Some people assumed it wouldn't taste good and would be chalky, crumbly, or resemble saw dust like most other gluten-free products. We overcame this obstacle by tweaking our packaging so that ""gluten-free"" and ""dairy-free"" are small callouts on the bottom of the package versus being very big on the packaging; something you might only see if you're looking for specific allergen claims on the pack. We also made sure our logo and picture of the cookie were incredibly appetizing — showing how delicious our products are and how you can rely on the Sweet Loren's brand for great tasting food. Period.Related: How Three Friends Built an Award-Winning Space for Indie Winemakers to Thrive on the VineWhat advice would you give entrepreneurs looking for funding?If you can bootstrap it, I highly recommend it! Be in control of your own future and be on your own timeline. I recommend being as scrappy as possible to get your product as far along as possible before bringing in investors. And when it comes time when you need investment to keep up with demand, I'd make sure to spend time building a three-year plan so you are focused and know exactly what you're going to do with the money. It will help you answer questions confidently, stay focused once you do have the money, and get the most out of your money while raising. I would recommend starting with friends, family, or angel investors; these are people who trust you, love the product or purpose of the business, and just want the best for you. If you're ready to raise more money and have more accountability and advisory help, start to network for the best funds that specialize in what you do so they can be helpful beyond just writing a check.What is something many aspiring business owners think they need that they really don't?A lot of money, a lot of marketing, and a big team. You can do a lot with a little when your product, story, and packaging are truly amazing. There are scrappy ways to market and stand out, and if you hire really talented people and create great systems, you'll be surprised how few people you might actually need to bring on. Not taking a lot of money was actually the best thing for me and my business. It helped me stay on top of every dollar spent; focus on margin; make sure we were staying focused on our plan; only hire the best we could find; and not get distracted by shiny objects like fun new projects that weren't in our plan or budget. I grew my business based on two product SKUs, not 100, which helped us stay focused and profitable over time.

This quote inspires me daily. I have it on my bookshelf in my bedroom. Take the shot if you want something. Even if it doesn't work out, you will learn from it and do better the next time. We just got into Sprouts and H-E-B supermarkets — it has taken seven years of meetings and not giving up. Now, finally a yes! Don't take no for an answer; keep taking those shots and keep showing up with a positive attitude and positive data on your product. One day you'll be big enough or powerful enough that they can't ignore you, and you will get your yes.

95,How This Type of Business Model Could Spur Purpose and Growth For Small Businesses,"Jan 4, 2024",Zoe Schlag,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-this-type-of-business-model-could-spur-purpose-and/466176,"
At a time when a mere 32% of workers admit to being engaged and a staggering 70% are on the verge of resignation, employee-owned firms boast up to four times the retention rate of other enterprises. For many employees at employee-owned enterprises, a significant perk manifests in the form of higher take-home pay and overall better wages.As a result, employee ownership has a venerable history of impact and wealth creation for workers. In comparison to their peers at non-employee-owned firms, workers at employee-owned enterprises tend to earn 33% more, according to the National Center for Employee Ownership (NCEO). The impact is further magnified for minority workers, whose earnings can soar up to 12 times the median wealth of their counterparts nationwide. Employees from historically disadvantaged cohorts fare equally well. A 2021 report from the Aspen Institute found that the wages of single and married women at employee-owned companies experience substantial boosts of 24% and 17%, respectively, while employees of color enjoy a 30% wage increment over their non-employee-owner counterparts.When you add flexible work schedules, generous retirement plans and childcare benefits to the mix, an ""ownership flywheel"" effect occurs. Employees who hold a stake in the company's success are more poised to make pivotal contributions and drive enhanced performance. These actions, in turn, foster more resilient businesses that are better positioned to navigate downturns. This resilience was evident in the aftermath of the economic downturn triggered by the global pandemic, as employee-owned firms at essential businesses laid off staff at one-quarter the rate of their non-employee-owned competitors. This buoyancy was undoubtedly propelled by employees' aspirations to preserve their investment in their business and the ability to take a long-term view of the business.



Related: Stronger Together: Why You Should Consider Employee Ownership For Your BusinessNavigating the transition to an employee ownership cultureWhether you're a small business leader deliberating over succession planning and employee engagement strategies or an owner with a vision to establish and lead a values-driven enterprise for decades, you may want to delve deeper into employee ownership. For numerous companies, this setup is a mechanism to protect and bolster the purpose, culture and vision of the business you've built while engaging and incentivizing your workforce.


As you begin your research, remember that a successful employee ownership plan hinges upon the following three key factors.Factor #1: The right approachEvery enterprise will exhibit different dynamics that will influence how to optimally set up an employee ownership structure, ranging from the business model and industry dynamics to the current leadership and the company culture. Therefore, it's imperative that the form of employee ownership you establish is customized to those dynamics.Increasingly, owners understand that an employee ownership structure can morph into a competitive advantage for the business. Not only are they highly adaptable to the unique circumstances of each business, but they also permit you to tailor your program based on the results you aim to incentivize and reward. In this manner, your transition to employee ownership is constructed to support all your business's key stakeholders and leverage the performance advantages that are intrinsic to the employee-owned business model.For legacy-minded business owners looking to preserve what makes their business unique as they transition out of the business, Employee Ownership Trusts (EOTs) present a remarkable opportunity to design an exit strategy that both nurtures worker wealth and safeguards essential facets of the company's mission. For example, the recent transition by Utah's Clegg Auto highlights how this model can be embraced to reap significant advantages for employees and business performance alike. This innovative approach allowed for a shared reward system and enabled responsible succession planning, ensuring the continuity of company values and mission — not to mention doubled profits within a year of the transition.


Related: 4 Ways You Can Create a Culture of OwnershipFactor #2: The right financing modelYour employee ownership financing strategy should be orchestrated to bolster your employee ownership objectives. Here's a case in point: A crucial element of a successful employee ownership transition is for employees to understand and experience the material benefits of employee ownership. If employees are barred from meaningfully taking part in the company outperformance due to the capital structure of the buyout, you risk grave repercussions on employee morale, company culture and retention.WinCo Foods is a shining example of a company that got it right. The discount grocery chain transitioned to an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) in 1986 and has experienced sustained growth due in large part to employee retention. The company says ""being an employee owner means having a stable present while building your future. Our employees enjoy industry competitive wages and the long-term investment that comes from company ownership.""Engaging with capital providers who are well-versed and seasoned in structuring employee ownership buyouts is a prudent strategy to ensure that your transaction structure incorporates best practices to optimally support businesses and tap into the performance gains of employee ownership.


Factor #3: The right rollout campaignAfter ensuring the design of your employee ownership plan is truly bespoke and the transition will be financed by a capital structure that is aligned to your employee ownership goals, you need to unveil everything with intention. For some enterprises, implementing an employee ownership transition may simply be a natural progression of its pre-existing company culture. For others, it may signify a meaningful transformation in how the business operates and behaves.Either way, you want to ensure that your workforce is equipped to align around the core objectives, values and purpose of the transition and fully understand their role in the new business ownership structure. Everything from how you choose to communicate the transition, at what point, and what kind of resources you provide to your employees to fully understand the new structure and their role will impact the success of your employee ownership transition.Related: The Critical Thing Entrepreneurs Rarely Consider... Until It's Too LateBecause this is so critical, many business owners will choose to work with an organization that can help you successfully roll out and implement your employee-ownership program. This reduces the risk that your organization, its culture, and the trust you've built among your employees is bruised due to a rushed or poorly planned rollout.


Transitioning to an employee ownership model isn't merely a shift in business structure — it's an investment in your company's future and a catalyst for a culture of shared success. As a business owner, adopting this model fosters a self-perpetuating cycle of engagement, accountability and enhanced performance that sets your business apart in the competitive market. With every success, the collective ownership spirit is invigorated among employees and drives further growth.

      Key Takeaways    



        Blake Geffen was inspired to start Vivrelle while wedding planning, identifying a gap in the market for accessible, high-end accessory rentals.
      


        Geffen says passion is the cornerstone of a successful side hustle, proving that a labor of love can lead to fulfilling and lucrative business ventures.
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Blake Geffen, founder of luxury accessory rental company Vivrelle.Courtesy of Vivrelle. Blake Geffen.Why were you interested in entrepreneurship, and what does being an entrepreneur mean to you? 



Before founding Vivrelle, I spent the majority of my career in public relations, and I was always so inspired by the founders and CEOs that I worked with as clients. Now, being on the other side, I hope to be an inspiration for anyone I work with! Being an entrepreneur means being an inspiring and personable leader while being extremely passionate about the brand I am building and the team I am working with. Both of these elements continue to keep me motivated, no matter what challenges arise.When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?


The idea for Vivrelle actually came to life when I was planning my wedding in 2017. As I was planning for different bridal events and occasions, I wanted to accessorize each outfit uniquely and in a way that reflected my style, but I found it nearly impossible to find high-end, quality options that didn't break the bank. That's when I realized there was a hugely untapped market for borrowed luxury accessories. I bounced the idea of creating an exclusive membership club that gives access to highly coveted accessories off my fiancé (and now husband/business partner!). We started building Vivrelle from the ground up, both leading up to our wedding and on our honeymoon, and we officially launched the company in September 2018.Related: The 'Easy' Side Hustle He Started in College Hit More Than $1 Million in Revenue — and Taught Him 3 Business Lessons He Still Uses TodayWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?As mentioned, we spent our honeymoon, specifically our time in the Maldives, putting our business plan together. We still joke that we skipped the bellinis on our honeymoon and instead made a full-blown business plan. We then came back, and at the time, I was still working in public relations, so I was using the small amounts of free time I had to build the brand I was so passionate about. On weekends, we would spend our time pitching potential investors and garnering relationships with vendors and partners to help us create a website, tapping friends to help with marketing, etc. We used every waking minute to build our vision for Vivrelle and bring it to life.


What were some of the biggest challenges that came with the side hustle, and how did you overcome them?One of the biggest challenges, which came in the beginning, was showing potential investors that they had reason to believe in us and this model. Before we launched, we said if we could get 50 members to sign up the first month, we would be on to something, and we far surpassed our goal! With my background in PR, we leveraged influencer marketing to help get us off the ground. As purveyors of fashion and lifestyle, we knew they could help bring our message to life quickly, so we prioritized working with ones known for their personal style and overall lifestyle to highlight how Vivrelle helps them elevate their every day.Related: 3 Secrets to Starting a High-Income Side Hustle in 2024, According to People Whose Gigs Make More Than $20,000 a MonthHow long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly and/or yearly revenue from your side hustle? We feel very fortunate that, with hard work, we surpassed our initial projections in month one and have continued to see consistent growth month over month.We continue to grow triple digits year over year and proudly raised $35 million in our Series B round with investors including celebrities Morgan Stewart, Nina Dobrev and Lily Collins. We've continued growing and expanding, and we're excited to reveal what we've focused on since our fundraise.What do you enjoy most about running your business?There is so much to love about running Vivrelle. One of the things I enjoy the most is meeting members on streets, airports, restaurants and hearing about how Vivrelle has brought them joy or improved their day-to-day lives. We have a showroom location in Manhattan, and I love going in and hearing which bags members are loving most, how they are styling and using them for special occasions, vacations and everything in between.

I've always loved luxury fashion and experimenting with my style, so starting Vivrelle felt like a natural evolution of this passion. As a CEO and mother of three, every day certainly looks different and throws new challenges my way, but I'm always excited to tackle whatever we face because I care so much about this space and the brand we've built.

      Key Takeaways    



        Seaman was inspired to start his Etsy side gig after attending a craft show with his mom. 
      


        His hand-stamped metal gifts took off online — all the way to over $1 million in revenue. 
      


        Seaman sold that business and is now innovating in the payment processing space with Swipesum.  
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Swipesum co-founder and CEO Michael Seaman.

Today, Seaman translates what he learned from that venture to Swipesum, a company ""combining industry knowledge, AI and proprietary software to create a transparent payments strategy for companies and enterprises.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Swipesum. Michael Seaman.Could you tell me about the Etsy side hustle you started in college? Was that your first side hustle, and what inspired it? 



Growing up in an entrepreneurial household, where my mom, Daphne, was a talented artist and my father, Chris, a serial entrepreneur, I was immersed in the dynamics of creative and business endeavors from an early age. This environment was normal to me and fostered a deep-rooted entrepreneurial spirit by nature.I went to Samford University on a track and field scholarship, which meant I didn't have a regular job during college. However, as a young college student, I wanted more financial freedom to enjoy life's little luxuries, like going out with friends and having date money.In my sophomore year at Samford, while home for the holidays, I attended a craft show with my mom. Despite having no crafting experience, I was struck by the bustling activity and thriving business at each booth. I saw the opportunity for date money! This sparked an idea. If I could master a feasible craft in my spare time, I could join and possibly surpass these other craft vendors selling online.Related: I Started a Software Company at 19 Years Old. Here Are 5 Valuable Lessons I've Learned So Far.Determined to find a suitable craft, I googled ""crafts for men."" I stumbled upon hand-stamped metal gifts while searching online and thought it looked easy enough. My ""aha moment"" was when I discovered traditional anniversary gifts, such as copper for the seventh anniversary and tin for the 10th anniversary. Pairing hand-stamped metal with ecommerce presented a lucrative opportunity. These materials were affordable and had a significant emotional value attached to them, so I could mark them up. I began creating custom gifts for these special milestones and selling them online.As I developed my website, I became aware of Etsy, which was not as widely recognized as it is today. Recognizing Etsy's potential and its investment in becoming a household name, I launched ""Snappin Studio"" on the platform. This decision proved to be pivotal.


My venture into the world of ecommerce and crafts was a success. I quickly profited $3,500 and bought a motorcycle. During my college years, Snappin Studio flourished on Etsy, selling over 35,000 gifts. With an average order value of $30, I generated over $1 million in revenue, a testament to the power of combining a simple yet unique business idea within the booming ecommerce industry. This experience was financially rewarding and an invaluable lesson in the power of innovation, timing and understanding market trends.At the side hustle's height, how much was it earning on a monthly/yearly basis? How long did it take to see those numbers? Is that business still active?At the peak of my side hustle with Snappin Studio, the holiday season was a particularly prosperous time. In the first year, reaching monthly revenues of $5,000 was a cause for celebration. However, as the business matured into its third year, we experienced a significant surge, hitting $50,000 in monthly gross revenues. This growth trajectory was remarkable; we had a lot of fun, but it took all of my time away from being able to spend the earnings!Our presence on Etsy was so dominant that I didn't need to divert my focus to expanding a separate ecommerce website. Etsy's platform provided the necessary exposure and growth opportunities, making Snappin Studio the go-to destination for hand-stamped gifts. It's fascinating to see how the landscape has evolved since then; as of 2023, there are now thousands of sellers offering similar products on Etsy.Related: I Spent the Last 3 Years Building My Side Hustle Into a Full-Time Business. Here's What I Learned.During those peak times, I employed many of my track teammates, who would gather in my apartment to stamp, paint and ship these little copper gifts. I paid them $25 per hour, which was quite lucrative for student-athletes at the time. This endeavor enabled me to accumulate more cash than I had ever imagined without a conventional job.Upon graduating from college, I decided to sell the business. The buyer was a teammate who had recently completed his MBA. He saw potential in the business and aimed to scale it further, treating it as a full-time commitment. Under his stewardship, the business underwent a rebranding and a shift in its product offerings. He managed it for a couple of years before eventually passing the baton to another buyer.Could you give me a brief overview of your professional path after college and how it led to your current venture, Swipesum? What does Swipesum do?


Post-graduation from Samford University, where I had a successful stint in pole vaulting and earned a place in their Athletics Hall of Fame, I had Olympic dreams and a little money to chase them. These aspirations took me to the Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, California. Unfortunately, my Olympic aspirations did not materialize, and my post-collegiate vaulting career was brief.Finding myself at a professional crossroads, with the proceeds from the sale of my Etsy shop dwindling, I turned my attention to the corporate world. I had always been drawn to sales and marketing, believing these skills would be crucial for any future entrepreneurial endeavor. A family friend's success in developing software for the payment processing industry piqued my interest, leading me to secure a position in Worldpay's outside sales team. My time at Worldpay was marked by rapid growth; within a year, I was handling integrated partnerships and managing larger accounts, eventually becoming a top performer on the West Coast.Despite my success, I yearned for greater challenges and responsibilities. After being overlooked for a promotion at Worldpay, I transitioned to MNTN, focusing on digital advertising, and then to Monotype, managing West Coast Enterprise sales. Concurrently, I had been informally advising friends, family and professional contacts on navigating the complexities of payment processing rates, which are confusing on purpose.Related: With as Little as $500, These Entrepreneurs Created Multimillion-Dollar Businesses. Learn Their Secrets.This experience highlighted a significant gap in the market and the idea for Swipesum: the need for a more transparent, customer-centric approach to buying merchant services. That's when the concept of Swipesum.com crystallized. I envisioned a platform that would revolutionize the payment processing industry by empowering merchants in negotiations, simplifying the selection process among the myriad payment solutions and offering unparalleled customer support.In 2016, with the collaboration of my brother Stephen, Swipesum was born. Our mission was clear: transforming the merchant services industry with a blend of innovative software and expert consultancy. We aimed to alleviate the common pain points associated with sourcing solutions, negotiating rates or switching payment providers.Since its inception, Swipesum has experienced exponential growth. Our team has expanded to over 20 dedicated professionals. Our efforts have been recognized with a coveted spot on the Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing privately held companies in the U.S. Our journey at Swipesum is a testament to the power of identifying market needs, leveraging technology and providing a service that truly adds value to our client's businesses.Did any early lessons learned with the Etsy side hustle translate to or help build Swipesum? How so?


1. Customer delight over simple satisfaction: In my Etsy venture, I learned that customers sought more than just a product; they wanted an experience that made them proud of their purchase, especially since these were gifts for others. We devoted extra time to engaging with customers, soliciting reviews and addressing any dissatisfaction. This emphasis on customer interaction and encouraging social media engagement significantly contributed to our growth and success on Etsy. At Swipesum, we applied this ethos to an industry typically marred by poor customer service. We have implemented white glove customer support, a feature consistently noted in our reviews. Our approach ensures that each account is managed by someone deeply familiar with the client's business, eliminating wait times and frustrations commonly associated with payment processing services.2. Teamwork and a strong company culture: My athletic background and experience working with team members underscored the importance of a strong team culture. At Swipesum, we have cultivated a company culture akin to that of an Olympic team. Each member of our team is elite in their respective fields, contributing to a lean yet highly effective team. This culture is central to our recruitment process and sets the expectations for roles within the company. It fosters unity and a collective drive towards achieving our clients' goals, which is a cornerstone of our success.3. Emphasis on profitability: The contrast between running a small Etsy shop and a venture-backed startup like Swipesum is stark, especially in terms of available capital. At Swipesum, we have been judicious in raising funds, focusing on strategic growth while maintaining a keen eye on profitability. This approach stems from my early experiences with Etsy, where financial mindfulness was crucial. This focus has kept us grounded and revenue-driven from day one at Swipesum, ensuring that we do not deviate from financial prudence even in the face of rapid growth.Related: 9 Out-of-the-Box Side Hustles to Try in 2023As you look ahead, how do you hope to continue growing Swipesum? What excites you the most about its future? I am beyond optimistic about the cutting-edge technologies we are developing at Swipesum. One of our groundbreaking innovations is the launch of Staitment, which utilizes AI to audit merchant statements. A job that typically takes 2-3 days for a small business or is a year-long project for a large business we can complete it in seconds. This tool is not just a tool for our current merchants, aiding them in identifying savings and optimizing payment processes, but it has also attracted a significant number of large-scale customers. These clients often grapple with extensive data sets that make timely and realistic auditing of their company's payment processing reports challenging. Staitment addresses this need efficiently and is finally recognized by merchants with large volumes.Additionally, we are enthusiastic about our proprietary payment gateway and the use of network tokens. This technology promises to enhance revenue while reducing costs for our card-not-present clients, a crucial segment in today's digital transaction space.At Swipesum, our passion for our work is relentless. Witnessing our clients' projects evolve from initial audits and consultations to success stories is immensely fulfilling.


Related: To Find Billion-Dollar Success, This Founder Learned to Think in 3sWhat's your advice for other side-hustlers or emerging entrepreneurs who hope to turn their ventures into successful full-time businesses?Your side hustle likely started as a passion project, but to turn it into a successful full-time business, you need a realistic and viable business model. Talk to everyone you can and find one. Understand your market, identify a unique value proposition and don't be afraid to pivot if necessary.Second, prioritize customer experience, as this strategy always wins and is often overlooked. In my journey from running an Etsy shop to leading Swipesum, I learned that truly understanding and exceeding customer expectations is key. Happy customers are your best advocates. They provide valuable feedback and help your business grow through word-of-mouth.Third, focus on financial discipline. While venture funding can be alluring, it's crucial to maintain a lean operation and ensure profitability. This approach has been instrumental at Swipesum. We've been careful about fundraising and maintained a strong emphasis on revenue generation from day one.Fourth, build a strong team culture. The right team will propel your venture forward; the wrong team will help you burn a lot of cash. Look for people who share your vision and values, and create an environment where they can thrive.Lastly, never stop learning. The entrepreneurial journey is a continuous learning curve. Stay informed about industry trends, listen to customer feedback and be willing to adapt. Remember, the most successful businesses are those that evolve with their market.

101,"5 Ways AI Can Help Small Businesses Boost Holiday Sales, According to an Expert From Google","Dec 19, 2023",Selin Song,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-boost-sales-for-your-small-business-this-holiday/466111,"
With the holidays just around the corner, retail and ecommerce sales in the U.S. are expected to grow, presenting shoppers with a variety of choices and businesses with plenty of opportunities to reach their customers. In 2022, shoppers spent more than $1 trillion on holiday purchases at retailers, breaking previous records. Also in 2022, more people said they would likely shop on Small Business Saturday than Black Friday, showing their support for independent retailers. This is all great news for small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) — if they're prepared to capitalize on the opportunity.In my role as head of Google Customer Solutions, an organization serving millions of customers worldwide, one of the frequent questions small business owners ask me is how to best prepare for the holiday shopping season. My answer, which applies to businesses that sell online or from a physical storefront: Take advantage of digital tools to reach your business objectives. Four in five small businesses say digital ads help them compete with larger businesses, and 82% agree digital ads reach prospective customers more efficiently than offline ads.AI-powered tools are making it even easier for SMBs, especially those without large marketing teams or advertising budgets, to compete with the most sophisticated advertisers, giving millions of businesses access to local and global markets. These tools, whether it be campaign types or new capabilities, can help SMBs find potential customers, design eye-catching creatives faster, gather insights on ad campaign performance and make budget allocation decisions with confidence.



There's still time for SMBs to achieve their business objectives and grow this holiday season by upleveling their marketing with AI. Here are five tips to get started:1. Make your business discoverable onlineBefore promoting your business, ensure customers can easily find you by updating your business details, hours of operation, website, location and contact information on search engines and review sites. Having up-to-date information about your business and even your available inventory is critical to helping you reach potential customers online, wherever they are. As you begin working with more AI-powered marketing products, you'll understand just how important the inputs you share about your business are to finding success — it's not just set it and forget it.


2. Create more compelling creative materialsAI can make your creative assets more compelling. Yet asset creation remains a top challenge when developing and optimizing a marketing campaign. With new tools, such as Adobe Firefly and Adobe Express, Affable.ai or Omni, you can instantly produce text, image and video assets or make your existing ones more dynamic. This includes capabilities like converting text from ads into professional-sounding narration or auto-generating video from static image assets. Experimenting with these creative tools will help you take your campaign to new heights more efficiently.3. Use AI to connect with customers anywhereBy leveraging AI-powered campaigns, merchants with an online presence can promote their products directly to shoppers across different channels where customers may begin their shopping journey. According to data from Casely, an online tech accessories retailer, investing in Performance Max, an AI-powered campaign that works across all Google inventory, helped drive a 169% revenue increase in just eight weeks. Start by inputting your business goals and creative assets, then let the AI do the heavy lifting.4. Take the guesswork out of budget allocationIt's important for SMBs to stretch their advertising budget as far as possible and put resources into the campaigns that perform best. Planning is another essential part of managing AI-powered campaigns. Using tools like Performance Planner, you can easily create a month-by-month plan and see forecasts of different budget scenarios on a weekly basis during the peak shopping season to take the guesswork out of how to make your budget work hardest.5. Maximize your performanceHaving the tools to measure traffic and engagement is critical. It's important to understand what's working well and what could be improved. Doing this effectively requires analyzing the right data, which can be daunting for some businesses. AI-powered measurement tools like Salesforce's Einstein Copilot or Twilio Flex can automate this process, helping SMBs make better decisions. They can also process, analyze and synthesize huge amounts of data to help SMBs anticipate and respond to future customer behavior — invaluable information to help prepare for the holiday shopping season year after year.


Now more than ever, AI is leveling the playing field and creating new opportunities for small businesses to grow and thrive. Whatever your plans are this holiday season, business owner or customer (or both), remember that small businesses are the beating heart of our local economies. They create jobs in our communities and diversify our choices of goods and services. Supporting them year-round, especially during the holidays, creates positive ripple effects that benefit us all.

See where Jersey Mike's ranks when our 45th Annual Franchise 500 list is released on January 16, 2024.It was 1975, and Peter Cancro was 17 and in love. The object of his affection was a small mom-and-pop deli in the beach town of Point Pleasant, New Jersey, called Mike's Subs.Peter had worked there since he was 14 — at first wrapping subs, then waiting for the day he'd earn the right to slice meats. ""Only certain people would slice,"" he recalls, ""because that was, like, where you had to really nail it."" Alongside his colleague buddies, he was always talking to the tourists who flocked to the ocean. There's no way to know for sure, but Cancro thinks the deli had to be the highest-volume sub shop in the country, even back then. On an average summer day it went through ""850 giant loaves a day,"" Cancro says, ""or $130,000 in sales a week, in today's dollars."" He was always serving people, always memorizing their orders. Always tracking the details.



Then one night, Cancro heard from his mother that the shop's owners were planning to sell. What happened next is a story Cancro has long relished telling. His mother asked him, ""Why don't you buy it?"" With that question in his head, he started heading upstairs to bed. By the time he got to the top of the stairs, he thought, Why not me?Related: Continued Expansion and Fair Wages Help Jersey Mike's Stay a Cut Above the CompetitionCancro was still in high school (and planning to attend The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with notions of becoming a lawyer), but he skipped classes to research the financials and look for backers. Desperate, one Sunday after 9 p.m., he knocked on the door of his former football coach — who was, helpfully, also a banker — and asked for a loan to meet the brothers' $125,000 asking price. The coach said yes. The deal went through. Peter Cancro became the owner of a mom-and-pop deli, while still living with his mom.This is the origin story of Jersey Mike's Subs, told and retold in media and marketing. Often, the story quickly flashes forward to the present day — where Cancro's little store is now a franchising behemoth. How big? Big enough that Danny DeVito appears in its national commercials, and it has 2,535 locations with plans to open around 350 locations this year — on track for its annual target of 15% unit growth. In January 2020, the average unit volume was $850,000; today, it's more than $1.3 million. And this year, Jersey Mike's was No. 3 on Entrepreneur's Franchise 500 list.So, pretty big.But a love story that skips from infatuation to happy ending is like a sub made only of bread: It's potentially delicious, and comforting in a fluffy, carb-y kind of way, but it lacks real substance. So what is the rest of the story — the meat and veggies of it? How did a local deli, in what Cancro says was an undeniably poor location (""No parking. You don't see the sign. You go by it and never see it."") become one of America's most successful food franchises?


The answer is, you find a way to scale that mom-and-pop mentality — to stay small, even when you're getting huge.Grooming by Kayla Jo Berley at Art Department using Tarte CosmeticsImage Credit: Bobby FisherMore then a decade went by before Jersey Mike's expanded. For years, while Cancro prepared subs, customers told him they were taking the sandwiches back home — sometimes across the country, sometimes across the Atlantic, even into the Soviet Union. Then, in 1987, some of those customers started taking the brand home with them too, by becoming some of his first franchisees.Cancro and his crew were hands-on with the newcomers, teaching everything they'd learned from the original store. ""I'd be behind the slicer,"" Cancro says. They'd also cook up excitement by going door to door around the community to offer free subs, or by supporting local community organizations. Then, when the store would get hectic, Cancro would become a coach. ""I'd take the franchisee: 'Alright, listen, go over here during the rush,'"" he says.Charitable giving was an important part of Cancro's vision from the start. Growing up in Point Pleasant Beach, he'd been impressed by two men who respectively owned an ice cream store and a local lobster shanty in the area. ""They gave unconditionally to the youth, to the first aid, to the community,"" Cancro recalls. ""Watching that in high school, I said, 'Well, that's what we're gonna do.' So we started our mission statement to give and make a difference. 'The power of the sub sandwich,' we called it. People know us for that now, as much as they know the product. They say, 'We hear what you're doing for the kids. We hear what you're doing for the community.'""It's that same ability to build communities within Jersey Mike's that Cancro credits for the company's success. To grow beyond a single mom-and-pop store, Cancro believes in building what he calls a ""nucleus."" This is the ""stay small while getting large"" insight at the heart of his company's growth. The nucleus, to him, is a small collection of shops in the same area, which work together to build training teams and master multi-unit operations. At first, this will likely develop near the original location, but later, new regions can develop their own nuclei.Related: 6 Tips to Drive Sustainable Business GrowthWhy is this useful? Because this way, no one Jersey Mike's location feels like a tiny part of a giant system. Instead, each store has a nearby community of support. In addition to ongoing help from the corporate training team, it's comforting for a mom-and-pop to know there are a couple seasoned franchise aunt-and-uncles and grandma-and-grandpas down the road.


And even once a franchisee is well-established, the franchisor should still be there to help them grow. For instance, whether a franchisee is opening their first location or their fifth, it's essential to take leasing and site selection seriously. To this day, Jersey Mike's helps franchisees pick locations, starting with their basic criteria: ""You've got to see it. You've got to be able to get to it. You have to be able to park,"" Cancro explains. (Which is to say, it should be nothing like the original Jersey Mike's.) But on top of that, before signing a lease, you need to know every single potential expense, down to, say, the HVAC or the grease trap. ""You include everything, because if you don't, you'll be $30,000 short,"" he says. ""You've got to be truthful in your numbers."" Only then can you ""open to win,"" as Cancro puts it — meaning, open for the least amount of money and with everything turnkey. Otherwise, oversights and surprises can submarine your sub shop.Then comes the rest: The franchisor develops a training manual, divided into modules, that explains every detail learned from years of mom-and-pop operation — including specifics like how long it should take to slice something. And then, of course, managing other owners is a whole new skill set for a franchisor to master. ""What are you going to do when the franchisee says, 'No — I'm doing it this way'?"" Cancro says. It's no longer just the owner's business. ""If you have a problem, you gotta go in and work with the people and come up with: What do we need to do? Are they doing everything correctly?"" By leading multiple shops, franchisors learn to apply their knowledge to new challenges. ""You've got to be able to turn it around.""By the end of the '80s, Jersey Mike's had about 30 shops — no longer just in New Jersey but also in Tennessee and Ohio and beyond, each region building its own nuclei along the way. ""It really started happening,"" Cancro recalls. ""We hit really well.""Then the world outside the Mike's community brought trouble.Image Credit: Bobby FisherAs the '90s began, Jersey Mike's was all-in on expansion. ""Everything we made was going into paying our people and into marketing, and just trying to create our business,"" he remembers. ""We spent everything we had, plus, plus."" But then, banks began to fail. A recession began. ""When the banks fell, and no new stores were coming, we were like, 'Uh-oh. Where's our capital? Where's our money coming from?' We didn't have a small business equity line of credit or anything to draw on.""Even though the existing shops continued to succeed, they couldn't grow — and Cancro could no longer afford his staff of six at company headquarters. He had to lay them all off. ""I was there alone, above one store,"" he remembers. ""You find out how many bills you can pay when you don't have any payroll.""Related: 10 Growth Strategies Every Business Owner Should Know


To Cancro, this underscored the importance of having a financial support system. When aspiring franchisors ask him for advice today — especially if they're in the food business — he now tells them: ""Go to some of the restaurant shows and find out about who is offering capital to restaurants or to fast-casual or quick-serve. Most banks will say, 'Get away from me.' But there are lenders out there that charge a few more points and will do restaurants."" Though there's still value, of course, in trying to work with a local bank when you're starting out: ""They know you. They know your brand.""Even as franchisors grow, they still need to keep in mind that it won't only be their franchisees taking on the expenses of each new franchise. ""You can't just franchise and hope it does well,"" he says. ""It's a people expense for the training, nurturing, mentoring, coaching, opening the store, ongoing training and assistance, ongoing site visits. That all costs a lot of money for the franchisor.""To succeed requires a community.Jersey Mike's avoided bankruptcy and survived the recession. Within a year and a half, Cancro was able to rehire his headquarters team. As bank failures make headlines today and talk of another recession looms, though, Cancro admits he's unsure what lessons to take from his experience. ""I wish I had capital lined up for '91 and didn't spend all my money, thinking that it was just going to keep coming in,"" he says. That said, he doesn't exactly regret spending all his money on expansion either. ""It helped our growth. So would I do it over again? Yes.""Image Credit: Bobby FisherJersey Mike's growth happened fast. It hit 100 units within its first 10 years. ""We were too busy to even stop and congratulate ourselves,"" he says. When he doubled that, Cancro recalls talking with Truett Cathy, the late founder of Chick-fil-A, who told him, Peter, you're at 200 stores. There's no stopping you now.But there certainly were things that could slow them down. By that point, Jersey Mike's had a formula for expansion, and most of the time it worked. Since they first started franchising (and even to this day), when arriving in a new region, the company tends to target suburban areas with a higher-educated, middle-plus-income population. (""Our product is not cheap,"" Cancro notes.) This made sense in a stable economy, but it set the brand up for some bumps — like in the early aughts, when the tech bubble burst. This deeply hurt local economies that Jersey Mike's had bet big on, such as the Research Triangle in North Carolina. ""That was another tough time for us,"" Cancro says. ""But we slowly came out of it.""Related: Why Franchising May Be the Low-Risk, High-Reward Investment You're Looking For


The brand continued to grow, and the more it did, the more customers in new regions seemed hungry for its arrival. Still, there is no numerical critical mass that makes a franchise infallible. The way Cancro sees it, the bigger you are, the more you need to be able to rely on the team you're building. ""When you get up to 100 or 200 stores, you've got enough capital and enough people, and you really figure things out,"" Cancro says. ""Hopefully you have the right people coming in. The franchisees, the owners — they help you grow.""Jersey Mike's team is still full of zealous trainers (and Cancro himself will take any chance he can to hop behind a slicer). ""A lot of chains out there are, like, five, 10 days training,"" says Cancro. ""Ours is 2.5 months [and] three people to open up a Jersey Mike's."" The staff makes the subs in real time — ""it's not like a burger where the buzzer goes off and you flip it"" — so the new owners have a learning curve. It still takes at least a month to get on the slicer.In owners, managers, and younger staff, Cancro and his team seek — as much as anything — energy: ""The pace, the speed, the sense of urgency."" The training enables them to work swiftly from opening day, encouraged by the two-week presence of at least two Jersey Mike's corporate staffers overseeing operations and lending a hand. ""We do not leave until they're really good.""This, too, comes out of that ""nucleus"" way of thinking — that no Jersey Mike's location should feel like it's out there on its own. It's always part of something that feels small.On top of the support they get from corporate, Jersey Mike's owners around the country have taken it upon themselves to build training facilities for their staffs to learn in. ""And then at the training stores, you have managers, assistant managers — they become your army ambassadors to be able to help open the stores,"" Cancro says. And just how committed to training is this company? Well, that original Jersey Mike's location is still standing — and still in the original location, with no parking and little visibility. But it's no longer open for business. Now it's a training facility for franchisees and their managers and assistant managers.Image Credit: Bobby FisherToday, 48 years on, Peter Cancro is older but still in love, sitting in the conference room of that training facility — though this half of the space wasn't part of the original shop, but an adjoining hairdresser's. Next door, on the other side, there's a pizza-and-subs spot that local high schoolers stop by during their lunch period, revving their engines and honking and joking. Several of Cancro's own high school colleague buddies from the original Mike's went off and became teachers or state troopers. ""You know what happens the first month after they retire?"" asks Cancro. ""They get a check. I retire, I get nothing."" Of course, life is easier now. ""I don't drive to Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio, to Nashville, to Atlanta and home. I fly. I stay in better hotels,"" he says, with a laugh.Related: We Crunched 5 Years of Franchise Industry Data. Here Are 4 Big Trends You Should Know About.


But there's still business to be done. In March, Jersey Mike's raised $21 million for local charities, which included one full day of sales on the company's annual Day of Giving. His owners are looking to open more shops — though in some cases they've maxed out the number of Mike's that their region can reasonably contain. So Cancro is looking into buying a new concept — likely coffee, chicken, or Mexican — that his franchisees can bring to their communities instead. And he keeps in mind the specter of other sandwich franchise collapses — like Quiznos and Blimpie, which both went from thousands of restaurants to just a few hundred. Cancro says he hasn't studied the reasons for those collapses (analysts tend to chalk them up to issues with capital, company ownership, and poor relations with franchisees), but that doesn't stop him from using their stories to affirm his success strategy: ""Maybe they didn't pay attention to the details.""Cancro still has that restless energy he looks for in others. The bigger the company gets, the more people they can feed, the more good they can do, and the more energized Cancro becomes. You can sense it in the questions he's still asking, driving his lifelong love affair into its next chapter: ""What are we doing? How are we serving? How are we raising up together?""

103,How Cryptocurrency Transformed My Small Business — And How It Can Do the Same For You,"Dec 18, 2023",Henri Al Helaly,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-cryptocurrency-transformed-my-small-business/466024,"
In the dynamic landscape of modern business, cryptocurrency emerges not just as a trend but as a revolutionary force reshaping entrepreneurship. My journey into the world of digital currencies as an entrepreneur has revealed its immense potential for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This article reflects my personal experiences, aiming to demystify how cryptocurrency can be a potent tool for entrepreneurs and SMEs.My encounter with cryptocurrency began as an exploratory step, driven by the increasing prominence of Bitcoin in the business world. As a small business owner, the prospect of reducing transaction fees and penetrating a tech-savvy market was too compelling to ignore. This step began a journey that would profoundly reshape my business operations.Understanding the intricacies of blockchain and various digital currencies was a challenging yet vital part of my journey. I devoted countless hours to self-education, attended seminars, and actively engaged in cryptocurrency forums. The knowledge gained was invaluable, especially for an SME looking to navigate the complex yet promising world of digital currencies.

Cybersecurity is a major concern for SMEs, and integrating digital currencies necessitated an even greater focus on protecting digital assets. Collaborating with security experts, I enhanced our cybersecurity protocols, ensuring a safe transaction environment for my customers and business.


One of the most significant advantages of adopting cryptocurrency was the ease of tapping into global markets. This aspect of digital currencies is particularly transformative for SMEs, as it allows for seamless international transactions, devoid of the complexities and fees associated with traditional banking systems.Revolutionizing revenue streamsThe integration of cryptocurrency opened my eyes to innovative revenue models. For example, the concept of microtransactions, once impractical due to high transaction fees, became a viable and profitable avenue. This approach diversified our revenue and provided valuable insights into new consumer behaviors and pricing strategies.Navigating the regulatory maze while embracing a crypto-friendly identityOne of the more intricate challenges was adapting to the regulatory landscape of cryptocurrency. As an entrepreneur, staying informed and compliant was crucial to avoid legal pitfalls. This aspect is vital for SMEs to mitigate risks and ensure business sustainabilityAs cryptocurrency became more ingrained in our business model, it was clear that we were not just adopting a new payment method but also embracing a new business culture. We rebranded to highlight our crypto-friendly approach, resonating with a growing demographic fascinated by digital currencies. This move was operational and strategic, positioning us as pioneers in our industry.


Personal insights and future perspectivesReflecting on my journey, the insights for entrepreneurs and SMEs venturing into cryptocurrency are manifold:Invest in Education: A deep understanding of cryptocurrency is fundamental to its effective integration into your business.Focus on Security: Strengthening your digital infrastructure is crucial for protecting your business and your clients.Explore Global Markets: Utilize cryptocurrency to engage with international customers and partners effortlessly.Innovate in Revenue Generation: Leverage the unique capabilities of digital currencies to create new and diverse revenue streams.Stay Regulatory Savvy: Keep abreast of the evolving legal landscape to ensure your business remains compliant and ahead of the curve.Adopt a Crypto-Centric Brand: Integrate cryptocurrency into your brand identity to connect with a broader, more diverse audience.The future of cryptocurrency in business looks bright, with limitless potential for innovation. The possibilities are endless, from the automation of contracts through smart contracts to the tokenization of assets. As an entrepreneur, being at the forefront of this change means leveraging digital currencies to redefine business models and remain competitive in an increasingly digital world.Related: How Crypto Education Can Boost the FinTech IndustryConclusionEmbarking on the journey with cryptocurrency has been more than just integrating a new financial tool; it's been a voyage of continuous adaptation, learning, and innovation. This path has fundamentally shifted my approach to business, providing a fresh perspective on financial transactions and operational efficiencies.


For fellow entrepreneurs and SMEs, venturing into cryptocurrency is not merely a trend to follow. It represents a proactive step towards adapting to the ever-evolving global economy, where digital transactions are becoming the norm. Embracing these changes opens up new growth opportunities, expands into new markets, and helps stay relevant in a digitally advanced age.My experience with cryptocurrency has been transformative, underscoring its potential as a powerful tool for business innovation and growth. For entrepreneurs seeking to stay ahead, exploring and embracing the potential of cryptocurrency is not just an option but a strategic imperative for sustainable success.

104,Should You Hire a PR Firm or a Boutique PR Firm? (And What's the Difference?),"Dec 18, 2023",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/should-you-hire-a-pr-firm-or-a-boutique-pr-firm-and/465675,"
More and more businesses are recognizing the value of public relations to put them — and keep them — on the map of today's highly competitive, highly saturated marketplace.The marketing strategies that businesses used to rely on before the digital age — like prominent Yellow Page listings, newspaper ads and distributed flyers announcing store openings — are no longer effective and cutting-edge promotional tools. Such priorities as social media presence, brand buzz and cross-platform messaging have replaced these traditional approaches.Experts in financial consulting, fashion merchandising or home health services aren't expected to be experts in these newer means and modes of company publicity. That's what PR and branding pros are for. And that's why businesses of all sizes are increasingly realizing that they can benefit immensely from forming B2B partnerships with specialists in these new spaces and places.



Related: 4 Reasons Your PR Campaign Isn't Driving Sales — and How to Fix ThemWhy hire a PR firm?Here are some of the top reasons businesses contract with a PR specialist as part of their overall business plan:


To increase brand awareness and break into new marketsTo strategize ways to stand out from the competition and make an impressionable mark in your industryTo take advantage of market trends and customize campaigns to target influencers and audiencesTo manage all media/community relations and deliver content marketing assetsTo provide crisis management when neededTo leverage the power of outside expertise to accomplish internal goalsIf you're at a place in your business's evolution where you recognize it's time to bring in PR expertise, should you go the boutique route … or not?Related: Why You Need A PR Agency and How to Choose One WiselyBoutique vs. not boutiqueIn the world of PR, there's not always a tremendous difference between the two types of firms, but there are significant differences.Staff size: Boutique firms tend to have a smaller staff but one with a higher degree of experience in particular domains. All-round PR firms have more bodies in seats to handle a large client list, but some may lack specialization and in-depth knowledge.


Overhead considerations: A smaller boutique operation obviously equates to lower overhead expenses (which are inevitably passed on to clients to some degree in any business model). Larger umbrella firms, on the contrary, charge more, but those heftier invoices can also come with access to more resources and a wider reach in the industry.Portfolio volume: Boutique firms purposely limit their client list to a curated selection of business types and sizes, usually SMBs (small to medium-sized businesses). They don't promise they can be everything to everybody because they likely don't have that capacity. Full-service firms will undoubtedly have larger capacity, and for proponents of the ""bigger is better"" theory, that's an important deciding factor. Just keep in mind that bulkier portfolios also carry larger retainers, sometimes with longer-term commitments.Level of care: A smaller, more intimate PR firm usually takes pains to deliver a more intimate experience characterized by a white glove approach and 24/7 care and accessibility. They might not want to answer your call on a Sunday, but to retain your business and keep you happy, they will! Larger firms aren't as dependent on each individual client to stay in business, and because they have larger staffs, they have greater turnover. Both types can dispense utter professionalism and skill, but the boutique firm's agency background often equips them with a more personalized touch.Advantages and disadvantagesWhen it comes right down to it, any PR outfit has the same objectives, purpose and mission: to broaden your presence in your market and spread the good word about your quality brand and business. So the distinction mainly comes down to a difference in scale.


Full-service agencies have the bandwidth to take on more clients simultaneously and manage larger projects and campaigns across numerous industries. They also have more employees to see to clients' needs and sometimes top-level talent on staff, like a copywriter who pens Super Bowl ads (and commands a top-level salary!).However, because boutique firms have highly seasoned and versatile specialists on a more compact team, you can get more bang for your buck when it comes to industry-specific expertise. Boutique firms can be more flexible in contract terms, more agile in tailoring services and more affordable for clients with budgetary constraints. And yet, they may face limitations in terms of scalability, so that needs to be considered.It all depends on your preferencesBoth boutique and non-boutique firms can cover the full range of expected services — media outreach, content marketing, product launches and event coordination, to name a few. Whereas the full-service firm takes a more panoramic view over a vaster amount of space, the boutique firm adopts a niche focus and caters to highly individualized client results.If you like the idea of taking on an established entity with a macro vision and far-reaching feelers to make a nationwide or even worldwide dent, a generalist firm might be for you. Likewise, if you'd prefer to work with multiple individuals across multiple departments. However, at a boutique firm, you're far more likely to work with the same small team from project start to finish.


Either way, it's a good idea to research the firm's track record and customer testimonials. In doing so, assess the firm's capabilities, competencies and specialties. Before signing on the dotted line, ask how the firm visualizes relations with clients, how they prioritize client tasks and how much attention you can expect to receive per month. How accessible will they be, and how do they divvy up responsibilities between them and you?Ultimately, the decision of who to hire hinges on your particular business needs at this particular time. If a reputable boutique PR agency can meet those needs effectively and affordably, why not start smaller in size and narrower in focus? You can always go bigger and broader if you decide to cast a wider net in a larger pool!

105,The Long Game vs. The Short Game — How Small Business Owners Can Master Authentic Customer Relationships,"Dec 15, 2023",Alykhan Jetha,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-small-business-owners-can-master-authentic-customer/466329,"
One of the biggest discoveries I made early in my entrepreneurial journey was the importance of building genuine relationships. It was one of the reasons I developed Daylite, a CRM and project management tool, which became the cornerstone solution of my business. I had initially designed it for myself, with the primary goal of being able to store key information about people I was meeting along my business journey.Networking with authenticityDuring those early days of my entrepreneurial experience, I understood the critical difference between networking and sales. So many people conflate the two, yet networking – when done right - is rooted in the authentic desire to build a relationship with another human being. Customer acquisition can be the desirable outcome of successful networking, yet it should not be the core focus and the means to an end.When I joined a global organization for entrepreneurs called EO (Entrepreneurs' Organization), I knew I would be meeting many people I could do business with. And yet, I appreciated EO's key non-solicitation policy. This organization focuses on peer-to-peer learning and support in its purest form. And this focus aligns perfectly with my philosophy: growing our businesses by connecting with others authentically, learning from each other and offering support — not by soliciting for business. This ethos of creating value and mutual respect is central to how I approach networking.



Networking is truly about building genuine relationships: about truly getting to know people, understanding their challenges and offering help, regardless of any immediate financial gain. Mixing networking and sales activities simply leads to inauthentic interactions. People can sense when they're being treated as potential sales targets instead of as individuals with whom one might form a genuine connection.Related: The 10 Commandments of Networking You Must Know to Build Authentic Connections


Connection beyond the initial saleIn sales, authenticity and transparency are also vital. Building a human connection with our clients should not end with the proverbial handshake. At my company, our customers value the relationship we've nurtured over time beyond a simple transaction. Much of that starts with a transparent sales process and expands into the investments we regularly make in education and support, which keeps us alongside them throughout their business journey.We leverage the product we sell for our own customer relationship management processes. Daylite helps us remember key customer information, which is crucial for building long-term relationships. Remembering personal details, preferences or past conversations isn't just a courtesy; it's a fundamental aspect of forming a lasting bond. These small details can significantly affect how people perceive our interest and commitment to the relationship. In turn, enhancing customer experience leads to a notable impact on sales revenues.Related: Want to Succeed as an Entrepreneur? Discover the Key to Building Long-Lasting ConnectionsPlaying the long gameThis all boils down to the key difference between the long and short games in business. The long game is about networking and relationship-building, while the short game focuses on making an immediate sale. Both have their place in any business but require different approaches and mindsets. Networking is about being a resource to others, helping without the immediate expectation of a return. This contrasts with the sales side, which tends to be centered around a transactional approach and mindset.



  When talking to my teams about authenticity and bringing value to a prospective or current customer, I always emphasize the importance of being a resource to others. Simply put, the greatest value we can offer someone in a business relationship is help, support, sharing knowledge, truly caring about their business goals, and being there when needed, without the immediate expectation of a return. This approach fosters a sense of community and mutual support, which is invaluable in business.Success isn't just about the number of sales or the size of our businesses. It's about the relationships we build, the network we nurture, and our impact on others. The balance between networking and sales is delicate but essential. Understanding this balance can make the difference between fleeting transactions and meaningful, lasting business relationships for solopreneurs and small business owners. The journey towards mastering this balance is a path to better sales and a more fulfilling and sustainable business model.

106,7 Passive Income Ideas to Make Money and Build Wealth in 2024,"Dec 13, 2023",Chris D. Bentley,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/7-internet-based-home-businesses-to-start-in-2024/466068,"
It is no secret that many people are struggling to get through these current economic times, but with just a laptop, webcam, strong internet connection and some effort, you can earn some extra money working from home. Creating and owning an Internet home business is not new, but most people overlook that these types of businesses have no real overhead. You don't have to have a fancy office or employees. Your desk or kitchen table and a strong internet connection are all that is needed.Related: 4 Super Simple Side Hustles That Could Replace Your Regular Wage — Fast1. Build a sales funnel website and landing pageThere are so many small to medium-sized businesses out there that don't have sales funnel websites or landing pages. These websites capture customer information when they click on a company website or ad. They're also used on social media ads to incentivize customers to enter their information, such as a coupon, discount code or free eBook.



The customer and their information then get added to a company email list for future email blasts or email drip campaigns. The upside is that once you build a great sales funnel, it's easy to duplicate for other clients. The key will be pitching it to business owners to purchase.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill.

2. Monetize your social media accounts with videoSocial media platforms YouTube, Instagram and TikTok pay creators to create video content through Reels, Shorts and TikTok. Each platform is different, and the same goes for how to get accepted as a creator, but if you're great with video and have a niche, you could be raking in the money.The narrower the topic, the better the audience will be. Example: Watching you describe and play video games versus watching you describe and play Dungeons and Dragons. The upside is you'll have consistent income if you post every couple of days. The key will be creating enough content for viewers to consume and posting consistently.Related: He Started a Side Hustle in His Dorm Room With 'a Bunch of Ingredients From Amazon and a Crockpot' — Now It's a $56 Million Brand in Walmarts Nationwide3. Monetize a podcastHaving a podcast is nothing new. According to Exploding Topics, over three million podcasts are out there as of September 2023. After recording and publishing the podcast, the trick is to turn around and chop up the video to make Reels, Shorts and TikToks. The downside is you'll need to record multiple podcast episodes to keep people returning for more. The key is interviewing popular people with a large following as guests.

Retail and online arbitrageThis one will take some overhead for the correct software, and you'll need money to purchase the inventory of products to sell, but it's easily a great way to earn some cash. Sites like Amazon FBA and eBay are where you sell the products. The downside is you'll need to source the products to sell on the sites, which takes time. The key is investing in the correct software to ensure a big enough margin to make sense purchasing the item to sell.5. Create and monetize a popular local news Instagram pageMost people's attention is on Instagram, so why not create a business with it? It's pretty simple: create a new Instagram channel and post local news from your town or city — news on car accidents, crime, sports, recent restaurant locations, events, etc. People will share and subscribe to your posts because it has local news and is not biased television news.Once you get enough subscribers, you can start charging local businesses to post on the page. You can monetize stories, reels and posts. The larger the subscriber base, the more you can charge. Don't overdo it; no one likes ads or being sold to. Building your audience will take time. The key is to find and post unbiased local news worthy of someone stopping scrolling to view it.

Video editingVideo is one of the most popular ways to communicate and market today, and it is used on multiple social media platforms to earn money. Many creators don't have the time or just aren't skilled at video editing. This is where you come in. Start direct messaging (DM-ing) influencers with published videos and offer video editing services.A great way to get their attention is by editing one of their current videos for free and sending it to them. If your video edits are great, you'll get their business. The downside is video editing is time-consuming. The key is having multiple influencers that want your editing services so you no longer need to spend time directly messaging more influencers and can focus just on editing video.7. Create online coursesDo you have knowledge or a skill that can be taught to others through video? It can be anything from selling luxury homes, onboarding new staff as a Human Resources (HR) Director, or baking an award-winning apple pie. People will purchase online courses if you can capture the audience's attention and produce multiple videos in a series on the subject.


These video courses can also be chopped up as teaser clips, reels, shorts and TikToks. The key is storyboarding and scripting the content beforehand for a seamless video series. The downside is that it will be a time-consuming project if you wish to publish a quality product.

107,Year-End Checklist — How Small Business Owners Can Finish 2023 Strong,"Dec 12, 2023",Sharon Miller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-small-business-owners-can-finish-2023-strong/466124,"
As fall creeps into winter, the countdown to 2024 is on. While you shouldn't lose sight of your 2023 goals and closing Q4 with momentum, the end of the year is the perfect time to review the state of your business and reflect on the relationships and elements of your business that matter most to your success. Additionally, getting a jump on 2024 planning before the hustle and the bustle of the holidays can help you hit the ground running in January with clear priorities — while also making the holidays a bit less stressful.As 2023 comes to a close, I recommend focusing reflection and planning into three areas: reviewing and updating your business plan, exploring new resources and trends, and taking care of your team.Related: The How-To: Ending The Year On A Business High



Updating your business planConsistently reviewing and re-evaluating your business plan is critical to ensuring you're operating in a grounded, realistic business environment — and because December is National Write a Business Plan Month, there's clearly no better time for it.When updating your business plan, there are a few best practices to keep in mind. First and foremost, you should review your business' performance from this year compared to years past — check sales results and marketing strategies to look for common trends and build a forecast for next year. Your budget should be top of mind, so it's critical to update cash flow projections, fixed costs, salaries or any money you use for operations and growth.


Getting honest feedback is another critical component of updating your plan. Speak with customers, peers or teammates on how your business meets market needs, and evaluate how you can increase sales. Assess your customer service strategy and loyalty programs to ensure your customers are coming back for more and are eager to bring you their business.Once you've addressed the highest-level needs, your business plan should tackle other fixtures of your business structure. Many small businesses are struggling with staffing right now — according to a recent Bank of America survey, 46% of small business owners say labor shortages are currently impacting their business. With that in mind, it may be time to re-evaluate your hiring or retention processes. Whether it's sourcing candidates through different methods, setting a clear employee pipeline and growth timeline, or creating an internship program, entrepreneurs can explore various ways to bring candidates to the interview table.Related: 8 Reasons to Update Your Business Plan Right NowTake advantage of all the resources at your disposalIn an increasingly tech-driven world, entrepreneurs should use the end of the year as a time to explore new resources and make sure they're taking advantage of all the tools at their disposal.


Effective marketing falls under this umbrella. With more digital tools and capabilities than ever before, entrepreneurs can open their businesses up to new local and regional consumer bases through wide-reaching marketing strategies. Grassroots marketing is always an effective way to reach consumers on a more personal level, and broader digital marketing strategies can give your business the edge it needs to take the next step. Whether you consider kicking off a new digital newsletter or getting crafty with a new look for your brand, entrepreneurs should embrace new ways of marketing and advertising their business to customers.Another resource that almost all business owners need at some point is capital, and Bank of America's recent survey showed that 77% of small business owners plan to obtain funding for their business in the year ahead. However, many entrepreneurs struggle to navigate this space, and as a result, more than 70% of small business owners rely on their own savings, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. As you head into 2024, consider your potential cash flow needs and plan ahead — half the battle of securing capital is preparation and understanding your options.Traditional bank loans are a tried-and-true method but might not be right for your business needs. Federal grants can serve as a shot in the arm for small business finances, as unlike loans, you don't have to pay them back. Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) can also be helpful sources of capital, as such loans often have lower interest rates and focus on helping underserved entrepreneurs. Bank of America also offers multiple resources for entrepreneurs eager to learn more about gaining capital, including our Access to Capital Directory.As important as monetary resources are, expanding your business education is just as vital. Whether you're a novice or a seasoned small business expert, plenty of educational resources are readily available to sharpen your skills and learn the ins and outs of the business world. For starters, the Small Business Administration (SBA) offers plenty of informative online resources for entrepreneurs, ranging from planning solutions to mentoring services. We also provide multiple educational resources as well: Bank of America's Small Business Resources site can help entrepreneurs find valuable tools and information to optimize their business, and the Bank of America Institute for Women's Entrepreneurship at Cornell provides women entrepreneurs in particular an opportunity to earn a certificate in business through a free online program, granting them the ability to gain an edge in their small business endeavors.

Consider scheduling year-end meetings with your employees to check in on their work and aspirations at your company; it's essential for them to see a legitimate career path at your business with ample opportunity for growth and advancement in the coming year.Gift-giving isn't limited to friends and family, either — if your business and budget allow, consider giving back to your employees. A little show of appreciation can go a long way towards group morale and effort, whether through a holiday bonus, some extra time off, an employee recognition program, a work dinner or even something as simple as personalized thank you notes. A business is only as strong as its team, and no matter how you choose to do it, you should make sure your teammates understand how highly you value them as the year comes to a close.Once you've checked all three of these to-dos off your year-end list, there's a small but important final piece of advice I believe all small business owners should adhere to: Take the time to celebrate your own accomplishments. Owning and operating a small business has grown in difficulty in recent years, and it's important to remember your ""why"" and focus on the positives you can take away from another year in the books. Whether it was a standard or record-setting business year, take the time to be proud of yourself and enjoy the fruits of your labor, and cheers to an even more successful year on the horizon.

108,The Shocking Claim You've Seen About Organized Shoplifting Isn't True. Here's Why Everyone Believed It.,"Dec 11, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/nrf-retracts-45-billion-organized-shoplifting-statistic/466747,"
The National Retail Federation (NRF) just retracted a startling statistic that's been making headlines for nearly two years.In its initial report, the NRF claimed that half of the retail industry's $94.5 billion in losses in 2021 were due to organized theft, resulting in an astounding $45 billion in losses. Now, the organization admits it was overstating the impact of organized shoplifting on the retail industry, CBS News reported.Related: 'Increasingly Serious' Retail Crime Is Hitting Another Beloved U.S. Retailer Hard — and Its CEO Reveals a Bleak Trajectory



The issue began with the misrepresentation of an inaccurate figure drawn from Senate testimony by Ben Dugan, the President of the National Coalition of Law Enforcement and Retail.Spokeswoman for the NRF, Mary McGinty, told The New York Times that the mistake occurred when an analyst from an outside advisory firm, which helped produce the report, linked to Dugan's quote in the 2021 survey.


Dugan incorrectly cited the $45 billion figure, which was pulled from a 2016 National Retail Security Survey referring to the overall cost of shrink in 2015. Retail ""shrink"" is an industry term for merchandise losses from various sources, such as improper scanning, vendor fraud, and fraudulent returns.Trevor Wagener, the chief economist at the Computer & Communications Industry Association, told the outlet that organized shoplifting is likely responsible for just 5% of shrinkage from 2016 to 2020.New data from the Council on Criminal Justice shows a 16% increase in shoplifting reports across two dozen cities from 2019 to early 2023. This suggests a shift in criminal activity, though when New York City's data is extracted, an opposite trend of a 7% decrease across the other areas emerges.The NRF has retracted the false claim and amended its report, but it continues to assert the severe and pervasive nature of organized retail crime against businesses of all sizes. Some retail giants, like Target and Walgreens, have cited the spike in retail crime as a factor in their decisions to shutter stores.

Investment bank William Blair sees these actions as potential distractions from underlying business issues, per CBS. Retail analyst Neil Saunders backs that perspective, too, arguing that while crime is undeniably an issue, the actual scale remains elusive due to a lack of concrete data. Saunders calls for a better-defined quantification of the problem rather than the prevalent rhetoric.

109,5 Pieces of Bad Advice That Could Derail Your Business — Sidestep Disaster By Doing This Instead.,"Dec 8, 2023",Pedro Sostre,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-pieces-of-bad-advice-that-could-derail-your-business/463085,"
It is reported that nine out of ten startups fail. That's a staggering, frightening and depressing 90%. Yet, while the reasons for this are many, even though the number is high, don't let it discourage you. Most people who get into business are misguided by well-meaning advice that sets them up to fail.As a serial entrepreneur and CEO of Builderall, an all-in-one marketing platform that has supported over 2 million companies, I've seen thousands of well-intentioned entrepreneurs set themselves up for failure by following common myths and bad advice. They hear success stories from companies like Uber and try to model their business the same way. But what worked for a mega-funded startup won't work for a small business.I once sat in the audience while a dynamic speaker explained how Zillow had achieved its amazing growth over the years. Her talk was compelling, insightful and full of actionable insights. While the audience sat there captivated and taking notes, I could already see them dreaming about what they could do with all their newfound business success.



Then it hit me.None of this advice would work for the business owners in this room. The advice was excellent — but it was excellent for Zillow, a venture-backed company with $87 million in funding. Perhaps more importantly, a company that has recorded a net loss in income each year since 2012, including a loss of $528 million in 2021.


None of it applied to the entrepreneurs and small business owners in the room who couldn't afford to burn hundreds of millions in capital to fuel rapid experiments and blitzscaling.Over the past ten years, I've lost count of how many times I've been approached by wide-eyed entrepreneurs in that same position. They were excited about some great advice they had recently heard from a reputable source, and I just knew that it would spell disaster for their business.In this article, I'll share the top pieces of bad small business advice I often hear and what you should do instead if you want to set your company up for sustainable growth.Related: 25 Entrepreneurs Share the Worst Advice They Ever Received


1. Bad advice: Raise money to start your businessRaising startup capital seems like an essential rite of passage for any new entrepreneur. But here's the reality — you probably don't need it. In fact, it can sink you.One of the biggest myths is that you need outside funding to start and grow a business. I've started multiple successful companies with $0 of outside capital. Too often, entrepreneurs think they need hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars to launch their ideas. But here's the reality — raising capital doesn't make financial sense for all businesses.The venture capitalist business model requires massive returns — in some cases, as high as 100 times their investment. Most investors can't back a company aiming for $50 million in value because, realistically, they could never get the return on investment that they seek.Because VC investors require their return on investment to be so high, by asking for VC money, you're signaling that you plan to build a business that will meet their exit expectations.


There are tons of great businesses that generate between $10 to $50 million per year — and they make their owners very rich. Just understand that a profitable, $20 million per year business isn't aligned with VC goals and can set you up for failure.Additionally, when you take startup capital, you're committing to a journey that will continue to dilute your ownership while you strive for the potentially unattainable billionaire unicorn status. Your chances of building wealth are statistically much higher if you create a profitable small business that generates significant free cash flow while you retain majority ownership.The right approach is to validate your assumptions and business model with the least amount of resources possible. If you put the same amount of effort into bootstrapping that you would put into fundraising, it will likely pay off in the long run. Also, you can always raise money later — once you have proven product-market fit and a path to scale.2. Bad advice: Split the business 50/50 with a cofounderDon't get me wrong, a strong business partner can be invaluable, but structuring your partnership correctly is critical. Novice entrepreneurs often think bringing on a ""cofounder"" means splitting everything 50/50.


However, not all contributions are created equal. Before signing any partnership agreements, evaluate what each person brings to the table across criteria like the original business idea, startup capital, industry expertise, marketing abilities, etc. Then, allocate equity and roles accordingly.I've seen lopsided splits like 85/15% work fine when properly structured. Having the right partner is fantastic, but avoid leaving equity and control on the table by defaulting to equal splits.Deciding how to split equity can be uncomfortable, but if you're not comfortable working through this with your cofounder, you may have bigger problems. Having this difficult conversation now may give you some insight into how you'll work through difficult situations in the future.Related: How to Write a Business Plan


3. Bad advice: Create a formal business planWriting a beautifully crafted, 30-page business plan is part of the fun for many entrepreneurs. It's where you let your dreams of target audience and sales projections run wild. But in reality, those lengthy documents are rarely useful. You don't need to write a novel; you just need to be able to communicate the business clearly.Rather than getting bogged down in lengthy pages of written content, create a simple deck with 8 to 10 slides that cover the core elements: Problem to be solved, target customers, your solution, business model, go-to-market strategy and key financial projections. This should be enough to convey the critical information needed to evaluate, refine and communicate your business.Keep in mind that this document should change over time. There is no such thing as a bulletproof business plan, so as you learn more about the market, you can continue to revise and expand on your original.4. Bad advice: Focus on your product firstEven though this is number four on the list, it's probably the one I see most often. Most founders love thinking about their product and telling everyone they meet about it. They spend months (sometimes even years) designing how it looks, how it will work, and what it will feel like, all before a potential customer has even had the chance to use it.


They want to make sure it's perfect before they release it to the public. This is a massive mistake.We all know the famous line from the movie Field of Dreams, ""If you build it, he will come."" But this Hollywood-crafted platitude shouldn't be applied to the world of business today. In fact, focusing too much on your product in the early days is likely a waste of time. Most companies that reach $10 million a year in revenue are selling a product substantially different from what they started with.Instead of worrying about your product, focus on the problem you are trying to solve and the audience you are solving it for. One framework I've used for working through this is the Jobs to be Done theory by the late Havard professor Clay Christensen. In it, we are encouraged to look less at our product and hone in on what the customer hopes to accomplish by using our product. The theory states, ""When we buy a product, we essentially ""hire"" it to help us do a job. If it does the job well, the next time we're confronted with the same job, we tend to hire that product again.""5. Bad advice: Hire a C-level or exec assistant as your first hireOur final myth is about who your first hires should be.


Too often, the advice is to hire a C-level team member. If you're a non-technical founder, the advice is to hire a CTO; if you're on the tech side, the advice is to hire a CMO. The problem with hiring for this role is that C-level employees are usually great at strategy and managing teams of people. This is useless when you're just starting out, and there is no team to manage.What I've seen to be successful in the early stages is hiring someone who is hungry to work, hands-on and passionate about the business. In the early days of a business, one passionate developer who spends his days writing code is much more effective than a CTO managing a small team of devs. And it will save you tons of money. On the growth side, a jack-of-all-trades marketer who can write copy, create ads and jump on a sales call will bring more value for the money than a CMO who needs to hire a full team or an agency to accomplish the same tasks.Conversely, I see a lot of advice that says to work with an executive assistant or chief of staff as your first hire. In theory, this frees you up to focus on business growth.However, in those early days, you need every dollar to go towards impacting growth and revenue directly. Hiring administrative support roles early on creates more costs without driving revenue. As the founder, you may need to wear many hats in the beginning. But adding team members that don't contribute to the bottom line can become a financial drain when you're least equipped to handle it.


Instead, your first hires should directly generate revenue — whether it's sales, marketing or development. These roles will provide a positive ROI from day one. I like to hire people better than me at critical functions to grow the business, even if I'm really good at it myself. That way, they not only pay for themselves but accelerate top-line revenue faster than I could alone.Adding ""doers"" who just cost money before ""makers"" who drive revenue is a common rookie mistake. Prioritize hiring people who directly impact growth, revenue and cash flow from day one.Final thoughtsThe path to small business success isn't following generic advice — it's rigorously testing assumptions and then focusing limited resources on what will have the greatest impact based on your unique business model and goals. With the right strategic foundation in place, you can build a profitable, sustainable company without chasing arbitrary startup milestones. These lessons from my experience help you avoid some of the most common pitfalls I see derail countless entrepreneurs.
