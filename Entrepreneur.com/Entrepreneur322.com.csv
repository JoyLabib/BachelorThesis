February was nothing short of spectacular for Bitcoin. On the back of BlackRock and its constituents, we've seen the fabled Bitcoin ETF smash previous ETF inflow records, surprising even the biggest BTC advocates.For the first time in Bitcoin's brief history, Wall Street and all its clients now have unfiltered access to the best-performing asset of the past decade in a world where outsized returns are increasingly difficult to come by. What's more, Bitcoin's scarcity, in combination with its convexity to the upside, makes it very difficult to acquire during upswings. Essentially, when prices appreciate, potential sellers are less inclined to reduce exposure, creating even stronger upward tailwinds.Related: Infographic: Bitcoin Enters its 15th Year



The perfect recipe at the perfect timeA lesser explored aspect of what increased Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency adoption is how it'll impact our relationship, both socially and politically, with money. The best way to describe this is to imagine a dystopian world without fiat currencies as a result of another World War. In such a world, it becomes rather simple to define wealth; namely, those with legitimate, tangible assets become wealthy overnight while those who have, now valueless, paper money would not.However, the whole reason fiat money was created is because bartering was, and remains to this day, often arduous and impractical due to market inefficiencies. More specifically, in a transaction between Person A and Person B, Person A must ensure that Person B values their 'money' similarly to themselves, which in this case could be gold or apples, for instance. What's more, various parties will value all money differently, making it difficult to truly assess how wealthy any individual might actually be.Fiat money was created to be the financial bridge that solved market inefficiency. However, in our highly divided world, we have endless forms of fiat currencies. This was reasonable when fiat money was backed by a legitimate asset like gold, but that is no longer the case. Instead, modern money's value is worth whatever its issuing government says it's worth. Ultimately whether or not that's the case depends on whether the broader population agrees. This, in combination with rising geopolitical tensions, started to weigh on the long-term viability of fiat money being a safe store of value given how volatile our relationship as a society with government has changed over time. Argentina and El Salvador are perfect examples of this.


Bitcoin is the best modern solution or proxy for 'money' that exists today, and Wall Street knows it. On top of this, Bitcoin is the closest thing to a more practical version of gold. It's verifiably scarce, no one controls whether or not its holder has it, and it's 'relatively' easy to trade in exchange for a good or service.Related: Are NFTs Back? Why NFTs Will Make a Comeback in 2024Bitcoin's hot girl summer?While I remain incredibly bullish on Bitcoin, especially as we approach the upcoming halving event, I also maintain that corrections are probable and necessary as we progress toward all-time highs. That said, additional market factors and technicals, on top of increased accessibility to Bitcoin, make a strong argument for price appreciation throughout the rest of 2024.The biggest difference between this current and previous bull runs is that because of the Bitcoin ETF, countless institutions are now active players in the space. Presently, daily ETF inflows are more than 12x the network's natural supply. What's more, portfolio managers (PMs) at asset management firms rapidly acquire Bitcoin but aren't doing so to trade the market heavily. And why would they? Given Bitcoin's track record, nearly all long-term portfolios can and should have exposure to the world's greatest-performing asset. Beyond that, this transformative technology has a market cap smaller than many of the world's largest companies — it's still very early!


Additionally, retail investors have yet to return to the market despite reaching new highs. For context, Coinbase was the #1 application in the iOS App Store during the last cycle's peak. Presently, Coinbase remains outside the top 100. As a result, the upward pressure we've seen has been relatively uninterrupted except for Grayscale's GBTC outflows. However, price action should get whippy as retail and additional leverage enter the system.Lastly, over-the-counter (OTC) desks are running low on inventory, which is applying even more upward pressure on prices, given that firms are now being forced to pull supply from the market. With 80% of Bitcoin's supply classified as 'dormant,' there are only a handful of routes to acquire the asset. HODL on tight!Related: How Cryptocurrency Transformed My Small Business — And How It Can Do the Same For YouConclusionBefore I forget to mention, none of the above should be considered investment advice, and should you wish to get involved with cryptocurrencies, only do so once you've done the appropriate research simply because asset prices can be volatile.


However, we're at what could potentially be the single most transformative revolution of our lifetime. If you're reading this, understand that you're early and that there will almost certainly be ups and downs, sometimes more downs, on our pathway to a freer, more financially inclusive world. In the meantime, brace yourself for the turbulence ahead!

1,This Data Security Consultant Explains Why Businesses Should Embrace Web3 — But Do It Cautiously,"Mar 6, 2024",Ralph Tkatchuk,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/businesses-should-embrace-web3-but-do-it-cautiously/469900,"
After much initial skepticism and doubt, Web3 has emerged as a real source of value, paving the way for a new generation of decentralized applications (dApps) built on blockchain. These dApps provide fantastic opportunities for forward-thinking companies to transform their business operations and enhance their efficiency.A 2023 survey of 600 enterprise decision-makers in the U.S., U.K. and China found that nearly 90% of them deploy blockchain technology in some capacity, with 87% saying they planned to invest in blockchain in the next year. This reflects businesses' fear of being left behind as blockchain developments accelerate globally. According to Deloitte, 73% of financial executives believe their organization will lose an opportunity for competitive advantage if they don't adopt blockchain and digital assets.Advocates of Web3 laud the decentralized web's greater resilience and security compared to its predecessor, as blockchain ensures that every transaction is public and verifiable, improving record-keeping and data integrity.



However, despite the promise of blockchain's greater security, the increasing adoption of Web3 technologies has not eradicated security risks, merely changed them: The 2023 Web3 Security Landscape report by Salus shows that cyberattacks on the Web3 industry resulted in losses in excess of $1.7 billion last year, highlighting the extensive range of threats within the decentralized world.Related: Confused About Web3? Steve Aoki Dissects His Business to Show How You Can Make Money.


New security challengesWeb3 avoids some of the security headaches of Web 2.0 but introduces several new ones, almost all unique to the industry.Some of the biggest attacks of the year included the $200 million attack on the cloud-based blockchain services provider Mixin Network; the $197 million attack on Euler Finance; the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group attack on both the Poloniex cryptocurrency exchange and Atomic Waller, stealing more than $126 million from the former and more than $100 million from the latter.The majority of Web2 attacks target users. Most threats faced by the Web3 industry, however, take advantage of code vulnerabilities of decentralized applications and protocols. Access control issues accounted for 39% of all Web3 attacks, whereas flash loan protocols, where flash loans are used to maximize the impact of another form of attack like the exploitation of smart contract bugs or the manipulation of cryptocurrency asset prices on an exchange, contributed to more than 16% of attacks.User-targeted attacks, as mentioned, are ""less popular"" in Web3. Phishing attacks, which use social engineering tricks to manipulate unsuspecting users into exposing data, spreading malware infections or giving access to restricted systems accounted for a mere 4% of all attacks.


Besides software vulnerabilities, retail investors continue to fall for exit scams and ""rugpulls:"" fraudulent crypto projects that convince the community to back them before fleeing with the funds they've raised.Mitigation is possibleReassuringly, there are concrete steps that businesses can take to reduce the likelihood of falling victim to each of these threats. With appropriate caution and due diligence, there is no reason to pass up the many potential benefits of Web3.Related: 5 Essential Tips for Starting a Successful Web 3.0 VentureEnhance authenticationIntroducing more robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, like decentralized identifiers (DIDs), access tokens or biometric and multi-factor authentication, will mitigate many security threats such as access control-based vulnerabilities and phishing attacks. Companies should make sure they always adhere to the principle of least privilege, a crucial step for remaining secure online across both Web2 and Web3.


Increase complexityAs in real life, cyber attackers like to get in and out quickly to avoid detection, so increasing the complexity of participation in Web3 projects will make attacks less likely. DeFi protocols offering flash loans can safeguard themselves against threats by introducing minimum borrowing amounts and time limits, as well as additional fees to raise the costs for attackers. In a similar vein, attacks on oracles can be reduced in a number of ways, such as by avoiding the use of markets with shallow liquidity for price predictions, and by increasing manipulation costs for attackers through the use of TWAP (time-weighted average price) mechanisms.Hardware wallets — the use of physical technology to store private cryptographic keys online until they are needed — can also help to avoid hacks. Short of physically stealing the hardware wallet itself, which resembles a USB drive, they are virtually impossible for cybercriminals to access.Implement checksAs with Web2, businesses should regularly update their access permissions to avoid chinks in their security armor. In addition, they should conduct thorough audits of all smart contract code, as this often falls prey to re-entry vulnerabilities. They should also adhere to the check-effect-interaction model.Perform due diligenceOrganizations can employ penetration testing to find and exploit their own vulnerabilities before attackers do. Extensive employee education is also crucial to enable individuals to identify and avoid phishing attacks and other threats.


Finally, make sure to research new projects and their teams carefully to ensure that they have a reliable track record, thus avoiding falling victim to rugpull scams. Prioritize projects that have undergone transparent security assessments by reputable auditors.Related: How to Own Your Online Narrative — Even When the Internet Owns YouEmbrace Web3, but do it cautiouslyThe high exposure to scams in Web3 is one of the major obstacles preventing mass adoption of decentralized technologies. However, though the amount of total losses in 2023 was very high, it was lower than the number for 2022. This suggests that the landscape's overall safety is improving, as more companies adopt the necessary precautionary measures.As Salus points out, $1.7 billion in losses is still an alarming number, and one that emphasizes the importance of improving security and educating users about the risks of Web3. The inherent vulnerabilities of the technology are distributed across multiple areas, demanding a multi-pronged approach to security, which can be enhanced by prioritizing those platforms and protocols that implement the strongest security measures.


My main takeaway from the report is that businesses need not shy away from embracing Web3 and all of the potential it offers. However, their adoption of the technology should be accompanied by extensive checks and research, and adherence to the same strict standards of security as they employ in their legacy technology systems.

      Key Takeaways    



        Bitcoin is barreling back toward its all-time high of $69,000.
      


        The last time the crypto reached current levels, interest rates were near zero.
      


        Now a supply-demand imbalance is eclipsing the outlook of higher-for-longer interest rates.
      



















Chelsea Jia Feng/BI via Business Insider
Bitcoin's latest rally has taken it close to its all-time high of $69,000.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Bitcoin is in a prolonged rebound to levels last seen when interest rates were near zero and pixelated artwork was regularly selling for millions.On Monday, bitcoin spiked by more than 5% to breach $66,000 for the first time in nearly three years. It's within reach of its all-time high of $69,000. Ether, solana, dogecoin, and other tokens are also staging rallies. In February, the value of the cryptocurrency market returned to $2 trillion for the first time since April 2022.



This retesting of highs comes against the headwinds of interest rates potentially remaining higher for longer. Markets have pushed back their rate-cut forecasts as inflation persists and the economy shows little sign of weakening.The last time around, the rally was driven by low-interest rates that encouraged speculative behavior. When the Federal Reserve started hiking rates to curtail high inflation, the momentum ran out, and Bitcoin plunged to $16,000 less than a year after hitting records.


Now cryptocurrencies are climbing with rates still elevated and without a clear path lower.What gives?""Even though Fed rate-cut expectations have been pushed back, the threat of rate hikes is off the table for now,"" Blue Chip Daily's chief technical strategist, Larry Tentarelli, told Business Insider, adding, ""So bitcoin has been rallying.""There's also a supply-demand imbalance that appears to be outweighing policy concerns.


A slate of bitcoin-ETF approvals has fueled demand and retail interest, while markets are bracing for the bitcoin halving event that will lower the reward for miners and cut the volume issued daily in half.Halving happens once about every four years, with occurrences in 2020, 2016, and 2012. In the 12 months after the previous three halvings, bitcoin climbed by 8,069%, 284%, and 559%. The event puts pressure on supply as it slows the rate at which new bitcoins enter the market, and this year's halving will come at a time when demand is sharply rising.Tentarelli and other market pros have pointed to the emergence of bitcoin ETFs as a ""tremendous"" driver of crypto demand, as the products allow more investors to gain exposure without buying tokens outright.CoinShares data released Monday indicates that last week digital investment products saw the second-biggest weekly inflows on record, at $1.84 billion. Ninety-four percent of those inflows moved into bitcoin products. Trading volumes in the investment products hit a record of more than $30 billion in the same stretch.


ETFs from the likes of Wall Street titans like BlackRock and Fidelity invest directly in bitcoin and are snapping up more and more of the available supply.A report from CoinDesk in February, the month after the ETF approvals, said the 11 funds owned 192,000 bitcoins. That figure is separate from the 420,000 owned by Grayscale, which converted its bitcoin trust into an ETF, and from the nearly 200,000 owned by MicroStrategy.Standard Chartered has predicted that ETF inflows could help push bitcoin's price to $200,000. Fundstrat's Tom Lee holds an even more bullish prediction, saying the crypto could reach $500,000.""There's a finite supply and now we have a potentially huge increase in demand"" with spot bitcoin ETF approval, Lee said in a recent interview, ""so I think in five years something around half a million would be potentially achievable.""

3,Are NFTs Back? Why NFTs Will Make a Comeback in 2024,"Feb 28, 2024",Ariel Shapira,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/why-nfts-will-make-a-comeback-in-2024/469664,"
In the last crypto industry bull run, we saw growing curiosity and experimentation from major financial institutions, a surge in numerous altcoins (non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies) that are now ecosystem staples, major DeFi (decentralized finance) developments, positive regulatory actions, and of course, Bitcoin's value reaching an all-time high. But in that whirlwind period, we can't forget the unparalleled hype and interest surrounding something called non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.For those who were absent, NFTs are a unique digital identifier recorded on the blockchain to certify ownership and authenticity of an asset—often, but not exclusively, a digital piece of art. NFTs rode the bull market wave to prominence with numerous high-profile digital art collections like the Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks becoming iconic cultural phenomena, consistently fetching upwards of six figures a piece in the process.One NFT, ""Everydays: The First 5000 Days"" by Beeple, sold for an astounding $69 million in March 2021. Before the NFT bubble popped, the NFT market rose to $41 billion in 2021, approaching the conventional art market's valuation of around $50 billion in 2020.



Related: What Is NFT Art? Everything You Need To KnowA fall from graceBut the NFT market crashed hard as the crypto industry suffered from ever-frequent scams, hacks, and high-profile exchange collapses. These scandals, which were typically the result of criminal intent, negligence, or poor risk management, stained the industry to the point that it delegitimized blockchain technology entirely.


The scandals forced the industry to acknowledge and address its flaws. As a consequence, many saw NFTs as the poster child of crypto's problems: Built on hype, seedy, and lacking utility.As the price of Bitcoin and most other altcoins plummeted, NFTs were singled out as just another blockchain-enabled scam. NFT buyers were mocked relentlessly on social media as some demonstrated how they could simply hover over any NFT image listed on a marketplace and then ""right click, save as."" Perceived ownership be damned. Meanwhile, the prices of their expensive digital art were freefalling harder than Bitcoin and Ethereum.NFT or ""play2earn"" gaming, another brainchild of the last bull market, also suffered greatly despite claiming to provide actual use cases by integrating digital assets into gameplay. Critics of the NFT gaming sector widely described these games as underdeveloped, uninteresting, unplayable, and unsustainable business models. Some even went as far as to call the games centers of undercover gambling.As the crypto industry underwent a cleanse that aimed to weed out scams, provide real-world utility, align with regulators, and emphasize product over hype, we began to see an industry on the mend. With prices gradually rising and other positive industry developments taking shape, NFTs have been quietly excluded from many of these conversations until now.


Related: Why Another Bitcoin Boom Could Be the Key to Institutional Adoption. Should You Buy In?NFTs: Back with a vengeance?The tea leaf readings are consistently trending toward an inevitable crypto bull run. Citing the recent SEC ruling to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs from 11 firms, including BlackRock, and the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving event in April, crypto enthusiasts are finally hoping for an end to the debilitating crypto winter.The overall crypto industry positivity bodes well for a depleted NFT market as the two sectors are intrinsically linked, with the latter being more dependent on the former. A stronger, more financially robust crypto economy means there is more capital to spend on NFTs, which still enjoy a loud and loyal community despite their downtrodden standing.But this time, an NFT revival isn't solely dependent on the crypto industry's wellbeing. Momentum has been building over the last couple of months, showing that interest in NFTs remains, with several vital shifts driving this renewed interest.


Both macro and micro-trends within the NFT space could propel them back into the mainstream but with a more mature flavor. On a macro level, we are seeing a shift from expensive, small-quantity NFT ""members clubs"" to more affordable assets produced in larger quantities and a greater focus on direct value creation over speculation — a common past critique of NFTs that limited their accessibility. Furthermore, major brands like Nike and Starbucks are experimenting with mass-market NFTs as a way to build and grow brand loyalty through digital collectibles.On a more micro level, the buzz around generative AI-created art provides a tool for developers to experiment and produce innovative and unique NFTs. For example, AI blockchain infrastructure startup ChainGPT has a user-friendly NFT generator that completely automates the entire generating and minting process, reducing the chance of a verification error or another mistake associated with manual NFT creation from occurring.Aside from AI, though, we can expect to see other exciting and innovative use cases for NFTs that go beyond what we've witnessed so far. This is already playing out in the fashion industry, where NFTs serve as proof of authenticity for luxury goods, and in the music industry, where it's becoming commonplace for artists to tokenize royalties of songs as NFTs.Just as the broader crypto industry matured during the down market, the same can be said for NFTs. With new projects, new use cases, and the power of AI, NFTs will likely play an impactful yet more modest role within a stronger and more stable crypto industry. While they may not be as prominent or as hyped, they will serve as a gateway to the world of digital assets for many simply by exposing them to the concept of digital ownership.

4,Why Blockchain Technology Hasn't Dominated the Supply Chain... Yet,"Feb 19, 2024",Asim Rais Siddiqui,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-blockchain-hasnt-dominated-the-supply-chain-yet/469395,"
Blockchain technology has garnered constant debate ever since its inception, and the interest does not look like it will die out anytime soon. A piece of technology that holds the power to revolutionize existing systems, with experts back in 2017 predicting that the transformative powers of blockchain will be the perfect fit for supply chain management.However, as we look at the supply chain landscape over the past couple of years, the results are very different from what was anticipated, and the question lingers — why hasn't blockchain taken over the supply chain yet?Let's go over why this is the case.Related: Disrupting Supply Chain With BlockchainThe promise of blockchain in supply chainImagine a supply chain where every step is recorded in a ledger that can't be altered and is accessible to all authorized parties. With this kind of transparency, businesses can expect to see a great reduction in fraud, improved efficiency, and streamlined operations.



With 2.8% of the world's population already on blockchain, the technology holds great potential for revolutionizing supply chains. Blockchain is a favorite among experts due to some of its core attributes. These include:DecentralizationA major reason for blockchain's popularity is its decentralized nature, a breath of fresh air from traditional hierarchical structures. Since the launch of Bitcoin, the world has been moving towards decentralization, and it could mean big things for the supply chain realm.Let's think about a network where all participants, from suppliers to manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, share equal authority, and no single entity holds disproportionate power. This balance of power may help cultivate trust among stakeholders, as each party can keep track of all transactions.Related: Decentralization Can Be Your Friend


TransparencyThe transparency that comes with blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize supply-chain networks. It ensures that every authorized party has access to the same real-time data, eradicating any data asymmetry.This may especially be crucial in industries where accountability is important, like the pharmaceutical industry, where drugs can be life-saving or life-threatening. Knowing the authenticity of medication and keeping track of its expiration can help hold the right people accountable in case something goes wrong. Not to mention that it also increases customer confidence in the product.UnchangeabilityAccording to the KPMG Global Fraud Survey, more than half of the frauds committed were aided by the business' own technology, with 24% of the frauds having used these technologies to create false or misleading information in accounting records.One of the biggest advantages blockchain brings to supply chains is the inability to alter or erase any data that has been recorded on the network. This means that records of transactions, shipments and certifications are permanently etched into the digital ledger, which brings a new level of integrity to the supply chain.


SecurityWith supply chain cyberattacks in the United States affecting 1743 entities in 2022 alone, security breaches and data leaks have been rampant in supply chains for years and are only on the rise. The security mechanisms of blockchain offer a potential solution to this extremely troubling problem.Within a blockchain, transactions are secured using cryptography, and once validated, they are linked to the previous transaction, creating an unbroken chain. This makes altering old records an extremely difficult task. Apart from that, the business data will be spread across the network instead of being stored in a single location, making any centralized data breaches futile.Related: How to Mitigate Cybersecurity Risks Associated With Supply Chain Partners and VendorsChallenges faced by blockchain in supply chainWhile blockchain technology in the supply chain shows incredible promise, the path to seamless integration is treacherous and fraught with Herculean challenges. Let's look at some of the challenges you might encounter:


1. Unfamiliarity with the chain. Understanding and successfully implementing blockchain is not everyone's cup of tea, especially if you're a supply chain professional accustomed to traditional systems. Blockchain consists of several technical intricacies, like consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, and cryptographic hashing, which require time and patience to learn. The learning curve can also be steep and often requires specialized training and expertise.2. Scalability issues. The lack of scalability is one of the biggest hurdles facing blockchains today. This is mainly due to the blockchain's consensus mechanism, which requires all participants in the network to agree on which transactions are valid. So the bigger the supply chain, the more difficult it will be to scale it with blockchain because, as transactions increase, the network's performance can degrade, leading to delays and congestion.3. Regulations and legal hurdles. The regulations and legalities that come with integrating blockchain can be daunting to many. There are many intricacies when it comes to data privacy and cross-border transactions in particular. The lack of knowledge available regarding these makes many business owners hesitate for fear that something might go wrong and they might encounter a legal pitfall instead.4. Costs and resources. I believe the most obvious reason why blockchain isn't as common in supply chains as people believed it would be is the heavy investment required to integrate it. Implementing and maintaining blockchain requires building the infrastructure for the chain, hiring blockchain experts, and incurring operational costs as well. This alone is enough to deter any small businesses considering investing in integrating blockchain into their supply chains.


Related: Mass Adoption of Blockchain Technology by Entrepreneurs? Major Challenges Are Involved.The future of blockchain in supply chainAlthough these challenges are unnerving enough to scare away many keen entrepreneurs, some solutions are emerging to address them. These hybrid solutions involve integration with IoT devices, AI algorithms, and cloud platforms to reduce scalability and complexity concerns, making blockchain integration less complex and more desirable.

6,How Web 3.0 is Shaping the Next Digital Frontier,"Jan 12, 2024",Anis Uzzaman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-web-30-is-shaping-the-next-digital-frontier/467588,"
While we've seen excitement about Web 3.0 as the next phase of the Internet, it's important to understand the key factors that will make it materialize. Several important concepts related to Web 3.0 include decentralization (distributed computing), blockchain, cryptocurrency and the Metaverse. While there may be challenges, let's look at Web 3.0 opportunities and anticipate what lies ahead.Analyzing Web 3.0 as an investor and entrepreneur, it's crucial to review major themes and the industry's challenges in building more momentum.Related: 3 Ways Web 3.0 Will Change Digital Ownership



1. ScalabilityMost experts believe that blockchain cannot simultaneously achieve security, decentralization and scalability. This is known as the blockchain trilemma. It is a situation that developers encounter when building blockchains, requiring them to sacrifice one aspect as a trade-off to accommodate the other two.A specific consideration related to scalability is the blockchain size, which can grow quickly as more transactions are added. Bitcoin, for example, can process 7 transactions per second, while Ethereum can process 20 transactions per second. Meanwhile, Visa can handle 24,400 transactions per second.


Related: Web 3.0 Is Coming, and Here's What That Really Means for You2. InteroperabilityThe term interoperability references the capability of blockchains to transfer data and communicate with each other. Web 3.0 projects related to interoperability include Injective, Cosmos and Polkadot, which build blockchain ecosystems that allow interoperability. The process of achieving interoperability is complicated – but not impossible – and I expect more projects to launch soon.3. CentralizationOne factor to consider is that Web 3.0 protocols typically evolve slowly and rely heavily on centralized platforms to iterate on new functionality. Several cryptocurrency wallets — including Phantom and Metamask — are offered as browser extensions. This introduces potentially complex security challenges.Both Metamask, a cryptocurrency wallet with more than 10 million monthly active users, and OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, rely on centralized infrastructure companies like Infura (a backend Infrastructure-as-a-service provider) to operate.


4. DevelopmentRemember that the Web 3.0 development cycle may be time-consuming for protocol developers. Increasing the number of blockchains with various purposes creates challenges for developers. Blockchain developers must have relevant skills based on the blockchain network they are working on.Related: If You Have No Clue What Web3 Is, You're Not Alone. Here's a Breakdown of the Future of the Internet.5. AccessibilityCurrent Web 3.0 activities make it fairly easy for Web 2.0 users to shift to their platforms. Remember that people cannot embrace what they cannot figure out. If Web 3.0 is less accessible than Web 2.0, people may be unable to interact with many Web 3.0 projects.Web 2.0 applications, including Instagram and Facebook, are user-friendly and easily accessible compared to many Web 3.0 applications. Google, YouTube, Facebook and other Web 2.0 platforms offer strong UI/UX for their users. However, several Web 3.0 products are grappling with the trade-offs between security and convenience. When Web 3.0 is more user-friendly, the less likely it is to be secure. Recently, there has been a noticeable rise in crypto-jacking cases. Therefore, I believe that security-related obstacles on Web 3.0 need to be solved for them to be more accessible for mainstream business.


Web 3.0 success storiesSeveral compelling success stories have been in the news that highlight the business opportunities in Web 3.0.Nike: It conducted a thorough study of the Web 3.0 space before entering the market. In 2021, the company acquired RTFKT, a Web 3.0 firm specializing in fashion collectibles to bring on board a team of Web 3.0 native experts. Before launching its own SWOOSH marketplace in 2022, Nike gained significant knowledge and insights, which helped the company be more successful.Reddit: The company's entry into Web 3.0 has been a phenomenal success, surpassing OpenSea's wallet count in the blink of an eye. Reddit combined its Web 2.0 elements into the Web 3.0 onboarding process and handled everything natively — including wallet creation, digital collectible customization, and payments. The brand offers a low barrier to entry with a mint price range of US$10-100, making it affordable for most users.Gucci: Gucci is another notable brand that made significant strides in the NFT space. Gucci joined the SuperRare DAO by investing in RARE tokens and leveraged the Vault Art Space by hosting NFT exhibitions. The brand's first exhibition, The Next 100 Years of Gucci, showcased a range of NFT artwork that reflects the brand's rich heritage.Related: The Pros and Cons of Big Brands Launching Web3 ProjectsGucci is set apart from competitors due to its approach to creating unique digital assets. I admire what Gucci did to meet customer expectations. Among other actions, the company associated NFTs with physical benefits to incentivize consumers to purchase more tokens.Looking ahead at the future of Web 3.0Whether Web 3.0 becomes a resounding success or it morphs into Web 4.0, I believe industry players must embrace several fundamental challenges to succeed.


Study the regulatory maze, which means staying up-to-date with frequently changing regulations across different geographies.Attract talented workers, including professionals well-versed in blockchain and decentralized technologies.Allow extra time in the business process, due to a complex compliance landscape that may slow down processes.Understand that decentralized complexity typically adds another layer of difficulty to company operations.Work to build trust among investors and users. This is particularly challenging given recent events including the FTX collapse.Embrace the Web 3.0 ethos of community-driven decision-making, decentralization, and transparency.I expect that business leaders, including startups, corporations, and investors, who understand these challenges will help Web 3.0 evolve into the next phase of a productive, technology-advanced Internet landscape.

7,Bitcoin ETF: Wall Street's crypto craze,"Jan 11, 2024",Jeffrey Neal Johnson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/bitcoin-etf-wall-streets-crypto-craze/468238,"
The meteoric rise of Bitcoin (BTC) has captured imaginations and sparked investor interest worldwide. However, the complexities of directly owning and managing this digital asset present a formidable obstacle for many. That will change with the new Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These innovative financial instruments are bridging the gap between the burgeoning cryptocurrency space and the familiar terrain of traditional finance. The debut of spot Bitcoin ETFsHistory was made on January 11th, 2024, as the first spot Bitcoin ETFs began trading. The anticipation surrounding this landmark event sent Bitcoin's price soaring, highlighting the potential impact these new investment vehicles can have on the market. While the initial excitement has settled, the long-term implications for Bitcoin and traditional finance remain intriguing.



Owning Bitcoin without the cryptocurrency hassleForget the tech headaches and digital vaults. Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) offer a smooth, familiar path to invest in this volatile asset. Imagine secure vaults, meticulously managed by established financial institutions, holding the actual Bitcoin you're buying. There is no need for private keys, unfamiliar exchanges, or specialized platforms. Buy and sell shares in these ETFs on the NYSE or Nasdaq, just like your favorite stock.This approach provides several benefits. You can invest in Bitcoin with the same simplicity as traditional stocks. You can avoid the complexities of the technology and rely on the security of reputable institutions that manage your underlying asset. Liquidity is strong on major exchanges so you can buy and sell Bitcoin quickly and easily at market prices. Bitcoin can also be used to diversify your portfolio and potentially offset the risks of traditional assets.


However, remember that Bitcoin's inherent volatility still runs deep through these ETFs. Just like with Bitcoin, you will want to brace yourself for significant price fluctuations and carefully consider your risk tolerance before taking the plunge. Fees vary between Bitcoin ETFs, so compare them before choosing your investment vehicle.Two flavors of Bitcoin exposureNot all Bitcoin ETFs are created equal. Understanding the two primary types is crucial for making informed investment decisions:
Spot Bitcoin ETFs: These assets hold actual Bitcoin in secure vaults, aiming to mimic its price movements as closely as possible. Think of it as owning part of a massive Bitcoin vault, experiencing its gains and losses without the burden of managing it yourself.
Bitcoin Futures ETFs: These instruments do not own the Bitcoin itself but track the price of Bitcoin futures contracts. Imagine these contracts as agreements to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price in the future. While slightly more intricate, they offer an alternative avenue for Bitcoin exposure.
Opening doors to the crypto frontierFor many investors, the allure of Bitcoin’s potential returns is undeniable. However, the complexities of directly owning and managing this digital asset can act as a formidable barrier. This is where Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) come in, offering a compelling solution that bridges the gap between cryptocurrency and the familiar terrain of traditional finance.Effortless accessibilityUnlike the steep learning curve of setting up cryptocurrency wallets and navigating unfamiliar exchanges, Bitcoin ETFs grant easy access through your existing brokerage account. You don’t have to learn the technical jargon and specialized platforms. With the new Bitcoin ETFs, buying and selling Bitcoin becomes as straightforward as any other stock trade.


Enhanced securityConcerns about cryptocurrency security are well-founded, with stories of exchange hacks and lost private keys consistently in the news. Bitcoin ETFs, however, leverage the robust infrastructure and established regulations of traditional financial institutions. Your underlying Bitcoin is held in secure custodians, offering greater peace of mind than the sometimes uncertain world of independent crypto exchanges.Increased liquidityThe occasional illiquidity experienced when buying or selling Bitcoin directly can be frustrating. Bitcoin ETFs, however, trade on major stock exchanges, providing the same level of liquidity you've come to expect from traditional assets. This ensures smooth buying and selling at market prices, reducing the worry of getting stuck in an illiquid position.A word of caution before you buyWhile the potential of Bitcoin ETFs is undeniable, a prudent investor approaches any new asset class with a clear-eyed awareness of its challenges. Before investing in Bitcoin ETFs, here are some crucial considerations to consider:Volatility vortexBitcoin's price movements are infamous for their dramatic swings, and this inherent volatility extends directly to its ETF counterparts. Prepare for a potentially bumpy ride with significant fluctuations that may test your risk tolerance. Be sure your investment strategy aligns with the stomach for potentially sharp price changes.


Fee fiestaDifferent Bitcoin ETFs levy varying expense ratios, representing a silent yet persistent drag on your returns. Diligent research is vital to identifying ETFs with competitive fees that minimize this erosion of your potential gains. Don't let the allure of a catchy ticker symbol overshadow the importance of cost-effective investment vehicles.Underlying intricaciesThe critical distinction between spot and futures ETFs requires careful consideration. Spot ETFs directly hold Bitcoin, mimicking its price movements, while futures ETFs track Bitcoin futures contracts, introducing an element of derivative exposure. Understanding these differences is crucial for aligning your investment strategy with your desired level of risk and potential return.Regulatory murmursWhile currently approved, the regulatory landscape surrounding Bitcoin ETFs remains in flux. Be mindful of potential future changes that could impact these instruments' structure, taxation, or even legality. Staying informed and adaptable is essential for navigating the evolving regulatory landscape.The advent of Bitcoin ETFs represents a transformative step in bridging the gap between the complex world of cryptocurrencies and traditional financial markets. They offer an accessible and familiar pathway for investors, combining the potential high returns of Bitcoin with the security and simplicity of established financial mechanisms. However, investors must approach with caution, mindful of the inherent volatility of Bitcoin and the evolving regulatory landscape. As this innovative investment vehicle gains traction, it underscores the dynamic nature of financial markets and the growing influence of digital assets in shaping the future of investment.

10,Bitcoin Is Halving Soon — Will It Cause the New Bull Run?,"Oct 27, 2023",Vladimir Gorbunov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/bitcoin-halving-is-soon-is-now-the-best-time-to-invest/463940,"
Less than a year is left before the Bitcoin halving — an event when the reward for mining a Bitcoin block will be cut in half. Historically, the halving has been followed by a major bull run in the crypto market. Should we expect the crypto summer soon — and what other factors may push the Bitcoin price up?Related: Bitcoin Is Back, Apparently. Here's What's Fueling the Surge.What is Bitcoin halving?Bitcoin supply is limited. No more than 21 million coins will ever exist, and the new ones are only issued to reward miners for running the network. Currently, the size of this reward is 6.25 coins per block — and every four years, it is reduced by half. The 2024 halving, expected in April, will lower the reward to 3.125 BTC.



Bitcoin was designed to be scarce: its limited supply protects it from inflation. With the growing demand for the asset, its price must steadily grow — which is exactly what's happening with Bitcoin over the years.Related: Why the Next Crypto Bull Run Will Be Like Nothing We've Ever Experienced


Three halvings, three ralliesHistorically, the halving has been followed by a bull run, and Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs within 1–1.5 years after the event. Bitcoin gained 30X following its 2016 halving and 6.5X after the one in 2020. More importantly, the Bitcoin halving makes the entire market soar: in 2020–2021, hundreds of altcoins surged by 1,000%+.Should we expect the same from the next halving?Will Bitcoin halving trigger a new rally?Pantera Capital, the world's largest crypto hedge fund, argues that Bitcoin will grow to $148,000 in the new market cycle. The firm emphasizes: ""Bitcoin has historically bottomed 477 days prior to the halving, climbed leading into it, and then exploded to the upside afterward."" This means that the latest bottom should have been hit in late 2022. If we look at the BTC price chart, we do see the local minimum of $15,490 in November. Bitcoin has historically reached the new ATH within 480 days after the halving.Other analysts agree that we've already passed the lows of the current cycle. By December 2022, 65% of the pre-halving period was over — the mark usually followed by a few months of a sideways price movement, which eventually ended up in growth.


Bitcoin did recover from the local minimum – but failed to keep above $30K this August.Some forecasts are, however, more restrained. For instance, MacroMicro, an analytical platform that consolidates global economic data, emphasizes the role of macroeconomic factors that may impact the prospective Bitcoin rally.Three latest post-halving bull runs coincided with a substantial increase in money supply by the USA, EU, China and Japan central banks. In contrast, these financial authorities have been doing the opposite during the last year — rising rates to tackle inflation. The chances that they'll ease the liquidity in the following months seem low.The more the money supply grows, the greater BTC price increases.Related: Tesla Reports $170 Million Loss in Failed Bitcoin InvestmentWhat else can pump Bitcoin?One more factor favoring the Bitcoin price might be the approval of Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds).An ETF is a fund that holds a portfolio of certain assets, and its shares are traded on an exchange. The owner of an ETF invests in the fund's portfolio by purchasing a share of it rather than buying the assets themselves.In the case of a Bitcoin ETF, the fund owns Bitcoin, and investors can purchase the shares of this fund on an exchange. The value of these shares is tied to the Bitcoin price. For institutional investors, it is easy to embrace the first cryptocurrency — ETFs don't require buying and trading Bitcoin itself, which lets them avoid legal risks. For retail investors, ETFs are an opportunity to quickly diversify their portfolio with cryptocurrency without buying it directly.


Bitcoin ETFs are currently allowed in Canada and some other countries. While the USA is considered potentially the largest market for this kind of asset, the SEC has not approved any Bitcoin ETFs in America yet. But if it does, the first cryptocurrency may experience a large spike in trading volume — and, consequently, price.Related: 5 Ways to Maintain and Expand Your Wealth During the Cryptocurrency DipHow should I prepare for the bull run?Sooner or later, the market will enter the growth phase of the cycle. Led by Bitcoin, it will also make other coins grow by 100%, 500%, and even 1,000% or more.This is where picking the right coins to invest in is key. A sure way is doing your research and building up a balanced portfolio — when the market skyrockets, the chance of making gains is high, irrespective of what particular assets are included.


Another way is to leverage the portfolio composed by professional cryptocurrency researchers using AI tools trained to find the most promising coins. Those portfolios are publicly available as index tokens representing the combined value of multiple coins from different domains of the crypto market.Some of the index tokens are focused on halving — their purpose is to identify the coins that may demonstrate the most impressive growth in the next bull run. For instance, Bitdriven is an index token representing the value of Bitcoin, Top-10 crypto coins by market cap and many other altcoins from Web3, DeFi and other segments that promise to make gains from 10X to 15X after April 2024.The data from different years demonstrates that Bitcoin gains less and less value in terms of Xs after each bull run. Whether you leverage index tokens or not, picking the right altcoins will be the key to making your best returns in 2024.

11,How to Revolutionize Your Supply Chain by Harnessing the Power of Smart Technologies,"Sep 20, 2023",Taiwo Sotikare,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-smart-technologies-are-revolutionizing-supply-chain/458494,"
Supply chain management plays a pivotal role in the success of any enterprise. Entrepreneurs and business owners are constantly seeking innovative ways to optimize their supply chains, reduce operational costs and enhance overall efficiency.This is where the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart technologies step in to revolutionize the field of supply chain management.Related: Supply Chain Management: The Game-Changing Innovations That Are Shaping the Industry



The role of IoT in supply chain managementIoT refers to the interconnected network of physical devices, vehicles, buildings and other objects embedded with sensors, software and network connectivity that enables them to collect and exchange data. When integrated into supply chain operations, IoT can bring about a transformational shift in the way businesses manage their logistics and distribution processes.1. Real-time tracking and visibility:


In the context of supply chain management, real-time tracking and visibility are game-changers. IoT devices, such as GPS sensors and RFID tags, provide continuous data streams that allow entrepreneurs to monitor their goods at every stage of the supply chain journey. This means they can pinpoint the exact location of products, monitor their condition and track their movement from manufacturer to distributor to retailer.The benefits are twofold. First, this level of visibility significantly reduces the risk of theft and losses since any anomalies or deviations from the planned route can trigger immediate alerts. Second, it offers valuable insights into the overall efficiency of the supply chain. By analyzing data on delivery times, transportation routes and storage conditions, entrepreneurs can identify areas for improvement, optimize routes and ensure that goods reach their destination faster and in better condition.2. Inventory management:IoT sensors are capable of automating inventory management with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. These sensors can monitor inventory levels in real time and send automatic alerts when stock is running low or when products are approaching their expiration date.


This proactive approach to inventory management has numerous advantages. It prevents stockouts, ensuring that businesses never run out of essential supplies, which can be especially critical for just-in-time manufacturing processes. It also helps in reducing overstock situations, which can tie up capital and storage space. Ultimately, this level of control not only optimizes storage space but also improves cash flow management by reducing excess inventory costs.3. Predictive maintenance:Within the IoT ecosystem, smart technologies can predict when machinery and equipment are likely to fail. IoT sensors on machines can continuously monitor their performance, collecting data on factors such as temperature, vibration and energy consumption. By analyzing this data, predictive maintenance algorithms can identify patterns that indicate when a machine is deviating from its normal operating conditions, suggesting a potential breakdown.This predictive capability is a game-changer for supply chain operations. Instead of relying on scheduled maintenance, which can be costly and lead to unnecessary downtime, businesses can address maintenance needs proactively. This minimizes downtime, reduces repair costs and ensures smooth operations. In essence, it keeps the supply chain running like a well-oiled machine.


4. Reduced costs:IoT-enabled supply chains are inherently more efficient. The real-time data provided by IoT devices allows businesses to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies quickly. For example, if goods are consistently delayed at a particular warehouse or if delivery routes are suboptimal, these issues can be promptly addressed.By optimizing processes and streamlining operations, businesses can significantly reduce costs in various aspects of the supply chain, including transportation, warehousing and labor. For instance, they can minimize fuel consumption by optimizing delivery routes, reduce warehousing costs by better managing inventory levels and enhance labor productivity by automating routine tasks. This cost reduction not only improves profitability but also enables businesses to remain competitive in a rapidly changing market.Related: IoT: Introduction And Disruption Of Supply Chain Management


The power of data analyticsIoT generates an immense amount of data, but its true potential is unlocked through data analytics. Entrepreneurs can harness this data to gain valuable insights into consumer behavior, demand patterns and supply chain performance. By leveraging advanced analytics tools and machine learning algorithms, businesses can make data-driven decisions that enhance their competitiveness.Smart technologies beyond IoTIn addition to IoT, several other smart technologies are making waves in supply chain management:1. Blockchain:Blockchain technology is revolutionizing supply chain management by offering secure and transparent tracking of products and transactions throughout the entire supply chain journey. Here's how it works:


Secure and immutable records: Every transaction or movement of products is recorded in a secure and immutable blockchain ledger. This means that once data is entered, it cannot be altered or tampered with. This inherent security ensures the authenticity of records, reducing the risk of fraudulent or deceptive practices.End-to-end transparency: Blockchain provides an unbroken, transparent chain of custody for products. Entrepreneurs can trace the origin of each product, monitor its movement from manufacturer to distributor to retailer and even verify its authenticity. This level of transparency not only reduces the risk of counterfeit goods but also enhances trust among consumers.Smart contracts: Blockchain allows for the implementation of smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with predefined rules. These contracts can automate various supply chain processes, such as payments, quality inspections and compliance checks. This automation reduces administrative overhead and ensures that contractual obligations are met promptly.2. Artificial Intelligence (AI):AI-driven algorithms are a powerful tool for optimizing supply chain processes. Here's how AI can transform supply chain management:Demand prediction: AI algorithms can analyze historical data, market trends and various external factors to predict demand accurately. This enables businesses to adjust their production and inventory levels accordingly, reducing the risk of overstocking or stockouts.Process automation: AI can automate routine and repetitive tasks, such as data entry, order processing and inventory management. This not only reduces labor costs but also minimizes the potential for human errors, improving overall efficiency.Enhanced decision-making: AI can analyze vast amounts of data in real time to make informed decisions. For instance, it can optimize delivery routes based on real-time traffic data or recommend the most cost-effective suppliers. This data-driven decision-making leads to more efficient supply chain operations.Personalized customer service: AI-powered chatbots and customer service platforms can personalize recommendations and resolve customer issues more efficiently. This enhances the customer experience and fosters brand loyalty.3. Robotic Process Automation (RPA):Robotic Process Automation involves the use of robots and automation technologies to streamline various aspects of supply chain management. Here's how RPA is making a significant impact:Warehouse operations: Robots can automate tasks within warehouses, such as picking and packing products. They work with precision and consistency, reducing the potential for errors and increasing order accuracy. This not only speeds up order fulfillment but also reduces labor costs.Repetitive Task Automation: RPA can handle repetitive and rule-based tasks, such as data entry, invoice processing and tracking shipments. By automating these tasks, businesses can free up human resources for more strategic activities.Enhanced efficiency: RPA can operate around the clock, ensuring that supply chain operations continue without interruptions. This enhances overall efficiency and reduces lead times.Cost reduction: By automating routine tasks, RPA reduces labor costs and the potential for errors that can lead to additional expenses. It also optimizes resource utilization, ensuring that operations are cost-effective.Related: How AI Can Revolutionize Our Broken Supply Chain

Even the most novice degens know that the only rule that applies to cryptocurrency markets is that there are no rules. Not even the world's brightest minds can outpace the mayhem that is the world of digital assets. One minute, Michael Saylor and Microstrategy could be live on CNBC discussing their latest billion-dollar Bitcoin purchase, and the next, Jim Cramer could be telling America that he'd never touch Bitcoin with a ten-foot pole, only a couple of weeks after calling it digital gold — it's crazy.The market has been rather uninteresting due to asset prices traveling sideways for the better part of this year. Nevertheless, hope in the vision of the Federal Reserve's mythical ""soft"" landing, combined with the upcoming Bitcoin halving, has the Web3 community salivating at the prospect of many life-changing opportunities that could be within reach soon. With greed in the air, it would be foolish to ignore the difference in the landscape as the market sentiment shifts.Whether it's the likes of BlackRock looking to issue ETFs to commercialize crypto exposure, corporate adoption, multiple IPOs, the rise of artificial intelligence or the attempted onslaught of regulation, there hasn't ever been this much discourse around the digital asset class. That's exactly why you need to know three key things to capitalize on what's to come.



Related: Breaking the Bank: America's Multi-Trillion Dollar Banking Problem1. Dumb money following smart money is still dumbOne of the most common mistakes prospective investors make, regardless of the target market, is outsourcing critical thinking skills instead of developing their own. Most investors would rather follow someone else's investment decisions instead of doing their own analysis.


That's not to say that there is anything wrong with seeking the guidance of someone with more experience; however, it's important to remember that finances, goals, and risk appetite vary from person to person. Blindly following anyone's advice, no matter who they are, is a surefire way to make losing trades. Instead, cultivate the ability to ascertain the fair market value of an asset so that you can capitalize on whatever arbitrage opportunities exist within a given market.During times of prosperity, it's quite common for novice investors to fall victim to scams. Whether it's a personal security issue gone wrong that leads to a complete loss of funds or being fooled into investing heavily in a meme coin pump-and-dump, it's important to remember that there's no such thing as easy money. Being equipped with the tools to properly evaluate the viability of an investment on its merit alone is the biggest key to financial freedom.2. Crypto's tiny!As I write this article, the crypto market capitalization (i.e., the total size) is hovering around $1 trillion. By all accounts, this is an outrageously large number for an asset class still unacknowledged by some of the nation's elite. However, it pales compared to the vast majority of other asset classes. For context, the US stock market cap is about $47 trillion, while Apple ($AAPL) alone, with a market cap of $3 trillion, is roughly 3x larger than the entirety of crypto.Should crypto's mission to update our archaic financial system as well as financially connect the most economically ostracized parts of the world succeed, the potential upside is undeniable. For example, the recent progress we've seen in developing a Bitcoin spot ETF will drastically increase opportunities for the everyday person to gain crypto exposure without having to take on the operational risk of self-custody.


There is an astronomical disparity in the global sentiment towards digital assets. Namely, we've seen more liberated financial markets overseas, like the United Emirates or various countries in Latin America, embrace crypto with open arms while many Americans remain emotionally scarred by the narratives that have been weaponized against them to discourage participation.According to a study done by the Pew Research Center, 75% of Americans are not confident in the safety and reliability of crypto. This stark contrast sets the stage for rapid price swings. It brings to light the potentially misaligned incentives that might've come into play amidst a weakening dollar and ever-changing geopolitical landscape.Related: 4 Tips for Companies Looking to Enter the Crypto Market3. UtilityPerhaps the most significant change that has occurred over the last market cycle is the influx of use cases that have finally come to fruition. The overwhelming success and adoption of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the world of art and ticketing and the likes of Gucci, El-Salvador and the world's most prestigious brands and countries deeming cryptocurrency legitimate currency, Web3 is no longer possible; it's happening.


Various breakthroughs in decentralized technologies have largely addressed the initial limitations of many decentralized protocols. The emergence of proof-of-stake and its many derivatives have enabled builders to put decentralized technologies in the hands of consumers and drastically expand their applications. And while most degens have been of the opinion that the world of distributed ledgers is 'winner takes all,' it now seems that the broader Web3 community is interested in finding ways to build bridges to bolster collaboration, an essential ingredient for mass adoption.ConclusionWe are on the precipice of what could be the greatest transfer of wealth that has ever happened in human history. The essence of blockchain is to create an equitable world where no one would ever fall victim to the abuse of power.Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, dreamed about a more financially free world where everyone can participate. And while he could not, in his wildest dreams, envision how it would all play out, he must be happy to see both the financial and lifestyle benefits of his technology becoming reality for so many people worldwide.

13,Why Crypto is Back for Banks and Financial Institutions (and Why You Should Take Notice),"Sep 19, 2023",Ariel Shapira,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/crypto-is-back-heres-why/458813,"
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has to make some big decisions soon.Though now delayed, the SEC decision surrounding the spot Bitcoin ETF filing from BlackRock has everyone even remotely involved with crypto on the edge of their seats, and for good reason. BlackRock has more assets under management than most countries' entire GDPs, and having the world's largest asset manager entering the crypto game will send reverberations across the entire landscape. More importantly, an SEC approval would signal to other leading traditional financial institutions that crypto is back on the menu as an investment and product option.But if the crypto and blockchain community has learned anything, it's that nothing is promised. Despite BlackRock's near-flawless ETF approval rate and surprise courtroom wins for Grayscale and Ripple Labs against the SEC — truly, anything can happen.



So, let's say we expect the unexpected, and the SEC rejects BlackRock's ETF filing. It's unlikely that this will dampen crypto's institutional ambitions and strides to continue partnering with traditional financial infrastructures. You can even see this change in trajectory throughout the industry's bear market, where the projects still left standing have shifted gears towards sustainable growth and technical, practical use cases.Related: Bear With Me: 3 Ways To Capitalize During the Crypto Winter


Beyond the ETFWith shifting developments come shifting trends, and the institutional blockchain space is no exception. But with that in mind, it is vital to remember that people behind the institutions guide their decisions and strategies amid these trend shifts. Of course, it's not a good idea to hop on every trend in any field, and the traditional financial space is usually well aware of that.But what should the human force behind these traditional institutions be prepared for in the blockchain space apart from the incoming SEC decision and ETF filings? The directions point towards the rise of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).If you're outside of the blockchain bubble, tokenized RWAs have been steadily climbing the ranks as a viable, long-term way to utilize blockchain technology. Essentially, tokenizing a real-world asset involves creating a virtual investment vehicle that's linked to a tangible item. That tangible item can range from precious metals, art, collectibles, and real estate.In practice, tokenized RWAs open up the gates to a few differing uses. Let's say you buy a house — an immutable record of your ownership can be put on the blockchain instead of receiving a deed. But tokenizing RWAs also allows assets to be fractionalized, meaning multiple people can own or invest in a fraction of a single physical asset.

Now, the focus on fractionalizing tokenized RWAs targets market-resistant asset classes where investor appeal is perennial. By doing so, fractionalization also allows assets with a high-cost barrier to become more accessible to everyday investors, such as fine art or precious metals. The average person might not want to own a portion of one single pair of rare sneakers, but owning part of a Warhol could be more enticing.Tokenized and fractionalized RWAs show what can happen when crypto and blockchain technology work in tandem with traditional finance and not in opposition to it. They also demonstrate a viable path forward for institutions beyond whatever happens with the slew of crypto ETFs sitting on the SEC's docket.However, creating digital assets for institutional use isn't a simple plug-and-play task. There are real technological, security, and regulatory hurdles to clear in bringing RWAs on-chain and making them available for the public to interact with. Yes, many countries and international regulators are moving towards some type of regulatory clarity with regard to blockchain and cryptocurrency. But that means the people working for traditional financial institutions have to be firmly aware of what they're getting into.


That kind of infrastructure creation to ensure traditional financial institutions are offering digital assets safely and in line with regulatory requirements can be daunting. However, some crypto-native companies aim to help carry the weight. GK8, for instance, tailors its product line for institutional use—covering everything from custody and enterprise-level security to tokenization.Related: When in Doubt, Don't: 4 Lessons to Learn from the Crypto ImplosionGK8 serves as an example of how traditional institutions can lean on crypto-native companies for their expertise and prowess in navigating the sector's ever-evolving threats. Many crypto companies have spent years perfecting and battle-testing their products in anticipation of institutional use, which is what makes them stand out.Crypto and blockchain products coming back down to earth has translated into heightened authentic interest from massive institutions that can take mass adoption to a new level. But with so many competing paths and uncertainties hanging in the air, it's hard to tell what exact next steps institutions will take. Either way, preparation, knowledge, and trust are essential to foster an effective and efficient working relationship between the traditional and decentralized finance spaces.

14,Banks Are About to Bring 1 Billion New Users to the Crypto Market — Here's How,"Sep 11, 2023",Vladimir Gorbunov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/traditional-banks-are-set-to-change-the-crypto-market/457775,"
As cryptocurrency increasingly permeates our daily lives, traditional banks that don't embrace digital coins risk staying on the sidelines. When crypto makes it to major bank apps, increased availability of digital assets will push them further to unprecedented popularity.It costs millions and years to build dedicated crypto infrastructure. Businesses that offer white-label and custom solutions to banks will make a fortune.Related: 5 Tips for Using Cryptocurrency in Your Small Business



Does a disruption have a future?Over the past 60 years, nothing has disrupted traditional finance more than the advent of cryptocurrencies. Digital assets are taking over some of the functions of national central banks, including currency issuance. There's now a whole new crypto economy with services based on the blockchain, such as lending, insurance, deposits, data analytics and money transfers.Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, the number of cryptocurrency users has grown from zero to 420 million users. The most significant growth occurred in the last 2-3 years, fueled by the latest bull run. Moreover, for today's youth, cryptocurrency is an entire manifesto and a protest against traditional finance.


However, as the crypto winter goes on, one question remains pertinent – does the crypto market have a future? And if yes, what will become its next growth engine?Related: With Web3, We Can Build The World We Want To Live InWhy traditional banks will embrace crypto and drive its growthI strongly believe that banks will sponsor the new boost of the crypto market — and drive the adoption of digital assets. Here's why.The crypto space is now a thing without a reverse gear. It's a trillion-dollar market with a strong user base that can't be ignored. Traditional financial institutions and businesses are demonstrating an increasing interest in digital assets.Cryptocurrencies have brought in myriads of services that can only be used with digital tokens on your balance.Central banks of 64 countries are already testing digital national currencies that usher in the departure from traditional money. Sixty-six more are on their way.The day is approaching when cryptocurrencies will become as mainstream as fiat money. To keep up with this evolution, banks will implement the infrastructure allowing their customers to buy, sell, and store digital assets.


Related: Crypto vs. Banking: Which Is a Better Choice?When banks adopt digital assets, the number of crypto users may skyrocketI don't think banks will become anything like crypto exchanges. Due to regulatory and convenience reasons, banks will only support buying, storing, exchanging and sending a few major cryptocurrencies.But when even a few cryptos massively appear in the bank apps, the number of cryptocurrency users might dramatically increase due to simplified access to digital assets. Buying Bitcoin, sending it to your friends, receiving a cryptocurrency payment or withdrawing income from its price growth will become easier.We already see this happening. Huge institutions like Deutsche Bank, Raiffeisen Bank and many others are already obtaining their crypto licenses. Neobanks (Revolut) and payment platforms (PayPal) have already embraced crypto and demonstrated it was financially feasible. And this is only the beginning.


Banks need dedicated infrastructure to enable cryptocurrency featuresThe main difficulty in integrating crypto solutions is that the digital asset infrastructure is radically different from that of traditional banks:Crypto storage requires tailor-made crypto wallets. It is impossible to keep digital coins in a regular bank account.Cryptocurrencies are based on different blockchains, with a special technical solution for each.It is necessary to integrate a cryptocurrency exchange API to enable crypto swaps.AML standards for cryptocurrencies are very different from those that banks usually stick to.Issuance, hedging, charging fees, and other procedures in crypto are also different.Large banks are likely to develop their solutions for digital assets, which is a huge challenge for medium and small institutions. The latter don't have the money, time and expertise to build their own infrastructure – it costs millions of dollars and years to build. However, there is a solution.Sell shovels in a gold rush!We see a huge niche opening for B2B crypto projects, and it is to become highly competitive. Companies that provide crypto bank infrastructure through plug-ins or white labels will become just as popular as traditional banking integrators.There will possibly be tens of thousands of partnerships of this kind. We expect that in the coming years, the crypto market will grow to 1 billion users, and the total market cap will surge to a few trillion USD thanks to, among other things, crypto adoption by traditional banks.


While label solutions for crypto banking experience a huge customer flowDespite its immense potential, there's still not much competition in this niche. However, given that the demand for B2B solutions is already high, banks have to stand in lines for 4-5 months now to get their crypto infrastructure.We say this from experience: Vault, our crypto bank infrastructure provider, will enable at least 150 institutions with cryptocurrency features in the coming year. We started in 2017 based on the Choise.com ecosystem (formerly Crypterium) and provide the battle-tested infrastructure that has already processed millions of transitions for 1M+ users.Vault allows financial institutions to embed crypto infrastructure 10X faster and 10-15X cheaper than independent development would take. Customers only pay onboarding and monthly fees and then share a percentage from using an already-made solution.Cryptocurrencies are taking over the world at an unprecedented speed. In such circumstances, banks are only left to embrace the new kind of assets. And the faster they mobilize to integrate cryptocurrency infrastructure, the more likely they are not only to succeed but even survive in the long run.

This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Grimes says her earnings from selling NFTs outpace what she's earned over the course of her music career.The artist, whose given name is Claire Boucher, reflected on her venture into crypto and non-fungible tokens in a wide-ranging interview with Wired's Steven Levy.



She launched ""WarNymph,"" a collection of 10 NFTs made in collaboration with her brother, Mac Boucher, in 2021.

Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and former CEO of crypto exchange FTX — and a vegan — is surviving on ""only bread and water"" in jail while he awaits a pending trial according to his attorneys.On Tuesday, Bankman-Fried entered a plea of not guilty in response to an amended indictment that charged him with fraud and money laundering conspiracy, marking his first appearance in court since his bail was revoked on August 11th. The one-time billionaire is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.Bankman-Fried's legal team told the court that the detention center has failed to accommodate their client's vegan dietary requirements, as well as ensure the distribution of his prescribed Adderall medication.



""He's literally now subsisting on bread and water, which are the only things he's served that he can eat, and sometimes peanut butter,"" Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried's lawyer argued, per CNN.

18,How Web 3.0 Will Open Up New Frontiers in Public Relations,"Aug 17, 2023",Brian Yeung,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-web-30-will-revolutionize-the-public-relations-industry/457379,"
The rise of Web 3.0 is set to transform all industries. Public relations (PR) is no exception. With the emergence of decentralized technologies like blockchain, Web 3.0 brings new possibilities for PR professionals to connect with their audiences in ways previously thought impossible.Blockchain technology, for instance, can enable PR practitioners to create secure and transparent channels of communication that protect user privacy by giving individuals greater control over their personal data. This can build deeper trust between brands and their audiences, leading to more meaningful relationships.Meanwhile, Web 3.0 technologies such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) offer a unique way to engage audiences by creating digital assets that have value and scarcity, which can be used to incentivize participation and reward engagement. NFTs can be used to create unique digital experiences and reward audiences for their engagement and loyalty.



Some companies have started testing the waters of incorporating Web 3.0 technologies into their communications campaigns. Established businesses started developing digital assets on the metaverse or creating corporate NFTs.What are the top strategies for PR professionals to harness Web 3.0 technologies in their communications campaigns?Related: 3 Tips to Take Advantage of the Future Web 3.0 Decentralized Infrastructure1. Leverage NFTs to create a unique audience experienceOne of the primary attractions of NFTs is their capacity to tell brand stories in innovative ways. Public relations professionals can incorporate stories into NFTs and deliver them through collectible assets. NFT-compatible PR campaigns give consumers access to brand content, exclusive events, digital assets and special offers. Brands can now collaborate with their customers more closely than ever, rewarding them for their loyalty and attention.Nike, for example, has acquired virtual goods company RTFKT which specializes in digital sneakers. By leveraging RTFKT's virtual sneaker drops on its Web 3.0 marketplace, Nike creates new digital collectibles Air Force Ones that are positioned as more than just NFTs; but virtual creations. This approach fosters a sense of belonging and personalized interaction, strengthening the bond between Nike and its dedicated fanbase.2. Build a niche community on the metaverseBrands can leverage the metaverse to build a niche community by tapping into its unique privacy features. As consumers become increasingly privacy-conscious, the metaverse's decentralized nature and anonymity options offer a safe and secure space for users to engage with others who share similar interests. By creating a branded presence within the metaverse that prioritizes user privacy, brands can cultivate a loyal following among niche communities.


Teaming up with People of Crypto Lab (POC), major metaverse platform, The Sandbox, has co-launched launched the Valley of Belonging, a safe and vibrant space that celebrates diversity and inclusivity. The immersive experience allows platform members to participate in an LGBTQIA+ Pride Parade and explore various activities and meet diverse personalities. This initiative showcases the potential of the metaverse in fostering social change and creating a welcoming environment for marginalized communities.Related: The World Of Web3: A Beginner's Guide To A Space That's Set To Change The World As The Internet Once Did3. Integrate metaverse into your online and offline presenceM2O2O (metaverse to online to offline) is a strategic approach that aims to create a seamless user experience across different platforms. It involves using the metaverse as a starting point and transitioning to online and offline platforms. This approach can be used to create immersive experiences that allow users to engage with brands and products in a more personalized way. By connecting the metaverse to online and offline experiences, brands can create a cohesive and memorable user experience that fosters loyalty and engagement.Last year, Coca-Cola's ""Share a Coke"" summer campaign in Mainland China, Taiwan, Macau and Hong Kong showcased a remarkable fusion of audience connectivity in both the Web 3.0 domain and the physical realm. The campaign transformed Coke bottles into connection points for friends. It also featured a ""Metaverse Music Festival"" where users customized avatars and engaged in music battles and a WeChat-embedded game with social sharing elements. The campaign bridged the virtual and physical realms, creating memorable moments for Coca-Cola fans.


The emergence of Web 3.0 technologies marks a new era of engagement for PR professionals. With the inclusion of NFTs, metaverse and other cutting-edge Web 3.0 technologies, brands now have the tools to create unprecedented experiences and forge deeper connections with their audiences.As the new age of Web 3.0 continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative applications that will revolutionize the way brands engage with their customers.The future of PR is here, and it's time for us to embrace it and unlock the full potential of Web 3.0. With limitless possibilities and new frontiers to explore, the only question remains: Is the sky still a limit?Related: Boost Your Business's Online Presence By Leveraging These Web3 Marketing Trends and Tactics

19,A Judge Just Ordered Sam Bankman-Fried to Go To Jail. 'He Tried to Tamper with Witnesses at Least Twice.',"Aug 11, 2023",Jonathan Small,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/a-judge-just-ordered-sam-bankman-fried-to-go-to-jail/457346,"
There will be no more home-cooked meals for Sam Bankman-Fried.The fallen crypto king has been holed up at his parents' home in Palo Alto since pleading not guilty to fraud charges stemming from FTX's collapse. But this afternoon in a Manhattan courtroom, a judge revoked Bankman-Fried's bail, ordering him to go directly to jail before his trial scheduled to begin on October 2.""My conclusion is there is probable cause to believe the defendant tried to tamper with witnesses at least twice,"" said Judge Lewis A. Kaplan during his ruling.



According to CNBC, court marshals took Bankman-Fried into custody after the hearing. He removed his jacket, tie, and shoes and emptied his pockets. A reporter for CNBC, who was in the courtroom, said that Bankman Fried's mother had her face buried in her hands during the ruling.Related: When in Doubt, Don't: 4 Lessons to Learn from the Crypto Implosion


Accused of witness tamperingProsecutors alleged that Bankman-Fried shared emails from his former girlfriend, Caroline Ellison, with The New York Times to intimidate her before his trial in October. They also said that Bankman-Fried leaked information to other journalists, including Michael Lewis, who is writing a book about FTX.Last January, prosecutors argued that Bankman-Fried was sending messages to a former FTX executive who was a potential witness in the case, according to the Times. They also said Bankman-Fried was using VPN to access the internet and sending encrypted messages on Signal.Judge Lewis responded by banning Bankman-Fried from contacting current or former employees. But, the order was not obeyed, and Bankman-Friend will now have to prep for his trial from a jail cell.At press time, it was not clear where Bankman-Friend would be held. Prosecutors requested a jail in Putnam, New York, so he could access a laptop with internet. But the nearest jail to the courthouse is the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, which has limited internet access for prisoners.

20,What Do Crypto and AI Get-Rich-Quick Schemes Have in Common? FOMO and Flimsy Due Diligence,"Aug 11, 2023",Alan Rosca,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/ai-fraud-is-coming-heres-what-to-look-out-for/455995,"
During the heyday of the crypto and blockchain industry, many investors looking at highly publicized fortunes seemingly made overnight started experiencing the Fear Of Missing Out and decided to try and get a piece of the supposedly fabulous wealth that was being created.Unscrupulous promoters and companies were watching. They started offering dubious investments, targeting unsophisticated investors. Cryptocurrency and blockchain investment opportunities were sometimes little more than wishful thinking, while their promoters and sponsors had no history, qualifications or past accomplishments to speak of. Some turned out to be outright frauds. While many crypto and blockchain startups that sought to raise money from investors were good–faith entrepreneurial initiatives driven by ethical individuals, many others were not.Crypto-fraudsters developed sophisticated ways to placate legitimate questions by investors: lack of industry background by a startup's founder? It's a new industry, so no one has much experience with it. Lack of prior performance? Same answer. Extraordinarily high rates of return? It's a booming industry, and everybody seems to be making multiples of their investment. No auditor or outside law firm? It's a new field, and those old-school auditors and lawyers are staying away because they don't understand how it works. Are regulators asking questions? Same answer as before: new industry, those stodgy regulators don't understand how it works. Complete lack of transparency? This is how all players in this new industry do it, so that's the norm. Founder playing computer games while asking investors for money? That's proof he's brilliant and able to multi-task. Easy-to-replicate drawings of monkeys of dubious artistic value offered for hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece? Every other celebrity is getting one, so they must be worth a lot of money.

Meta slashed 21,000 roles in a multi-round cost-saving initiative that concluded in May.But the company has reportedly rehired a number of those employees who were let go, per several sources familiar with the matter, Insider reported earlier this week.Hiring was paused to bolster Meta co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's ""year of efficiency,"" but it's ""quietly picked up in certain areas"" as the company enjoys an upward swing, according to the report.Related: Meta, Google Execs Receive Big Bonuses Amid Layoffs | EntrepreneurThe report also revealed that the company rehired ""dozens"" of employees to work in engineering and technical roles, but an exact number was not immediately available.Meta stock was plunging last year, but surprisingly strong second-quarter results in July saw shares spike to their highest since early 2022, soaring 11% that month for the company's ninth consecutive month of gains, CNBC reported.The layoffs of late 2023 and early 2023 contributed to the rise — but so did other significant events.Meta's TikTok-like Instagram Reels are fast-growing among users and advertisers, thanks to AI, Reuters reported.Related: Laid-Off Meta Employee Says the 'Fake Work' Stories Are TrueAdditionally, Meta's Twitter rival Threads saw early adoption, hitting 100 million users within the week, though that user base has since dwindled.Meta Platforms Inc is up more than 70% year over year.

22,The Tale of Two Crypto Super Bowls — How Startups Can Thrive in a Bear Market,"Jul 5, 2023",Vladimir Gorbunov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/the-tale-of-two-super-bowls-how-crypto-startups-can/454581,"
While you might expect anything to grow in the winter, it is not the same with the cryptocurrency market. Startups do, surprisingly, start, and some even flourish. In this article, we will address your pressing question: to launch your dream project during the seemingly barren crypto winters or to wait for a bull.A crypto tale of two super bowlsThere was, of course, a time of superabundant flourish for all of crypto — 2022 was one. Super Bowl 2022 saw a slew of ads from crypto companies. In fact, Super Bowl 2022 was nicknamed the ""Crypto Bowl."" The reason for this was not difficult to figure out: it was the crypto bull market. There was a rising demand in the market powered by the increasing popularity of NFTs, meme tokens and the metaverse.Fast forward to 2023, the market crashed — no thanks to Luna, FTX and the stiff crypto regulations that followed. There have been no Super Bowl crypto commercials this year, except for one misleading ad from an NFT-based game. The market's image in 2023 starkly contrasted with what it was in 2022. Retail and institutional investors who embraced crypto last year didn't want to touch it this time with a ten-foot pole. Crypto startups that once thrived struggled to stay afloat, while potential startups looking to enter the market now faced a dilemma: to launch or not to launch? 



Related: Bear With Me: 3 Ways To Capitalize During the Crypto WinterThe dilemma of crypto wintersThere is no right or wrong answer to the question: to launch or not? However, this article will provide perspectives to help potential founders decide. But first, we will have to flashback to 2009 – the origin of Bitcoin.


In the beginning, there was no market — When Satoshi Nakamoto created the first cryptocurrency, there was no crypto market. All the anonymous creator had was an idea that could solve global economic issues by democratizing finance. They were unsure of what to expect. Why would anyone believe, accept, and use a digital currency? Despite this and other valid concerns, Satoshi Nakamoto went ahead to create Bitcoin. And from that one currency, 25,794 coins and tokens (per data from CoinMarketCap) have been birthed.Early currencies that followed Bitcoin, such as Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple, stuck to the plot of innovating within the established democratized financial system. But this wasn't the case with many of the thousands of projects afterward. These projects, especially after the 2017 crypto boom, went off script. From ICOs and IDOs to meme coins and NFTs, the crypto industry became a center for speculation. Users were not concerned about use cases; they kept hopping from project to project, looking to make quick profits. This is why new founders face the dilemma of crypto winters. Should they risk their new project failing because of the high fear index of the market, or should they just wait to ride on the wave of market hype, albeit temporarily?Related: How should investors weather this 'crypto winter'Startups vs. crypto winters: The present dynamicsDuring bear markets, investors would rather stick with the few resilient projects they know and trust. New projects, even with viable utilities, may not get their attention if they do not see any quick way to profit from them.


This is why the founders of meme coins do not bother about offering utility. PEPE, for example, had no utility yet surged by about 7000% within days, reflecting how greed, not value, drives the crypto market.But this is not to say that no utility-based projects have successfully launched during crypto winter. UniSwap is one such project. The decentralized crypto exchange launched in 2018 amid a rough bear market. But as of October 2022, the parent company, Uniswap Labs was worth $1.66 billion, controlled 64% of all DEX volumes, and the $UNI token had a market cap of over $5 billion. Users were able to see the project beyond temporary gains.Solving the dilemmaI believe crypto winter is the best period to launch a crypto company or product. It is a period marked by less noise and less hype. A period to test the loyalty and sentiments of users or investors. However, the founder who wants to be successful during this period needs to fulfill two duties: (1) Have a viable product, and (2) Control the narrative.Viable blockchain solutions stand a high chance of surviving crypto winters. Though the market is looking for the next cash machine, a utility-focused project would never capture the market's attention.


Owning your story as a crypto startupOften, founders who successfully navigate the crypto winter are those that control their narrative. They are those that do not let the market stamp them with the ""get-rich-quick"" tag. These projects continue to present themselves as utility-based and community-centric, even when the market wants otherwise.Any founder can capture the attention of the market during bear markets. In fact, a bear market is a period where investors' attention isn't divided among the many projects displaying profitability simultaneously. So it is the best moment for startups to emerge provided that they are coming with unique crypto solutions. Once that's settled, it becomes easy to sell their story to the market.Hence, by focusing on viable products with utility and controlling the narrative, emerging crypto startups can increase their chances of success in an unpredictable crypto market.

23,Stores Across the Country Hit With Wave of Bomb Threats From Scammers Demanding Bitcoin and Gift Cards,"Jun 26, 2023",Sam Silverman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/bomb-threats-plague-target-kroger-walmart-and-more-stores/454805,"
Scammers are coming for large retailers across the county.Since earlier this year, stores like Target, Walmart, Kroger, Whole Foods Market and more have been the target of bomb threats from callers threatening to detonate alleged bombs in the stores if they don't receive payment of Bitcoin, gift cards or money, authorities told the Wall Street Journal. Stores from New Mexico to Wisconsin have been affected by such threats, and local law enforcement agencies are investigating the incidents.Bomb threats demanding ransoms are ""unusual,"" according to the outlet, and appear to be a new form of extortion targeting retailers.RELATED: California Woman Arrested For $60 Million Postal Service ScamIn one instance, a caller demanded $5,000 in Bitcoin from a Whole Foods Market employee in a Chicago suburb, stating they had placed a pipe bomb in the store, the WSJ reported. A Kroger in New Mexico received a call demanding it wire money, and if employees called the police a bomb would go off. In both cases, authorities were notified and evacuated the buildings but found no suspicious items.



Although the FBI is working with local and state law enforcement officials, police say the scammers have been hard to track down as they're calling from blocked numbers. It's unclear if the calls are connected by a larger organized effort. Law enforcement officials noted that the targeted stores seem to only be threatened once, with no repeat callers.Officials advise people to take the calls seriously, not to give away any payments and to try to extract as much information as possible from the callers.RELATED: I'm a Business News Editor, and Even I Fell Victim to an Online Scam That Cost Me $300Although the calls started earlier this year, they increased in the spring, according to Doug Baker, vice president of industry relations at the food trade group FMI. ""It's disruptive,"" Baker told the WSJ, ""If I'm a retailer…I've gotta close stores and have to call law enforcement. And send customers out.""


Many of the targeted stores have issued memos informing staffers of bomb threat protocols and are cooperating with law enforcement in the investigation.

You don't have to be 13 years old to join the metaverse anymore.Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, intends to reduce the suggested age for using its Quest headset from 13 to 10, the company announced in a blog post on Friday — a shift that could spark new privacy and safety concerns among parents and watchdogs around the world, The New York Times reported.Related: Why Your Business Needs to Prepare for the Metaverse | Entrepreneur



Per the outlet, the company is in talks with regulators about its plans to mitigate concerns over the potential risks to young users, according to two people with knowledge of Meta's conversations. And preteens will need parental approval to set up their accounts, the company said.The move follows Meta's decision earlier this year to let people under 18 use its virtual reality-based social network Horizon Worlds, and the company's expanding inclusion of a younger demographic comes amid increasing scrutiny of technology's exploitation of adolescents' privacy — and its ill effects on their mental health.


One study of nearly 7,000 adolescents in the U.S. between the ages 12 and 15 revealed that those who spent more than three hours per day on social media had twice the risk of symptoms of depression and anxiety as non-users, according to an advisory from the surgeon general reported by CNN.Related: The Metaverse Is Dead. ChatGPT Killed Zuckerberg's Obsession.Josh Golin, the executive director of Fairplay, a nonprofit children's advocacy group, told the NYT that Meta's decision was ""based solely on business imperatives,"" adding, ""It's beyond the pale and clearly driven by the fact that they are trying to compete for a market, not driven by kids' needs.""

25,Can Crypto Go Green? Examining the Environmental Implications of Cryptocurrencies,"Jun 15, 2023",Vladimir Gorbunov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/can-crypto-go-green-examining-the-sustainable-implications/453068,"
Since 2009, cryptocurrencies have been an innovation to watch and a subject of several debates. One such debate is its impact on our environment.Now more than ever before, the sanity of this debate cannot be questioned as the world continues to battle with challenges posed by climate change. Scientists fear that 2050 climate change could displace millions of people from their homes if no drastic measures are taken.Therefore, there is a need to explore the current environmental impact of cryptocurrencies and how it influences the emergence of eco-friendly crypto projects.



While fossil fuels have dominated environmental discussions, in the last few years, cryptocurrencies have begun to enter the fray. So much one might wonder if the concerns are exaggerated or might hold some truth.Related: 7 Things to Know Before Investing in Cryptocurrencies


Bitcoin's environmental challenge: Weighing the costs of financial freedomWhile Bitcoin is a powerful tool for decentralization and financial freedom, its critics point to its significant carbon footprint as a major flaw. BTC's footprint is a product of the energy-intensive mining that mints it. Bitcoin mining is powered by the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus, which requires miners to solve complex math problems through powerful computers that utilize large amounts of energy.Many argue that Bitcoin mining is becoming increasingly energy efficient, but a peer-reviewed study highlighted by TIME casts aspersions on these claims. Rather than the opposite, the study showed that Bitcoin's use of renewable energy fell from 42% in 2020 to 25% in 2021. It also suggested that the regulatory crackdown in China, known for its abundant hydropower resources, may have played a role in this decline.However, this study suggests that the environmental concerns surrounding Bitcoin mining appear to be more regulatory-based. Bitcoin miners have demonstrated their willingness to shift entirely to renewable energy sources, despite how expensive they are. The Bitcoin Mining Council reports that 60% of mining operations utilize renewable energy. On the other hand, the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance estimates this figure to be around 40%. Regardless of the variations, these statistics emphasize miners' dedication to embracing renewable energy. Nonetheless, the big question remains: will governments provide the necessary support?Related: Potential Consequences Of Bitcoin Mining Centralization


Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake: A game-changer for environmental sustainabilityIn its famous upgrade known as The Merge, Ethereum transitioned from PoW to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus and aimed to reduce its energy consumption by more than 99%. Ethereum's goal was to create a more energy-efficient and eco-friendly environment. Now, over six months after, it is important to see if it succeeded.We must trace Ethereum's energy consumption before The Merge to do this. Data obtained from the Cambridge Digital Assets Programme revealed that between 2015 and the PoS transition, Ethereum's electricity consumed approximately 58.26 TWh. To put this into perspective, Switzerland's annual electricity consumption is 54.88 TWh.However, following the transition to PoS, Ethereum's power demand decreased significantly from 2.44 GW to a mere 224 kW, that's a 99.991% decrease. Mission accomplished! This achievement is even more monumental considering that the Ethereum blockchain powers thousands of other crypto projects. It benefited the Ethereum network and influenced the rise of eco-friendly crypto projects throughout the broader crypto ecosystem.Towards cultivating a sustainable crypto ecosystemWe can question the environmental safety of cryptocurrencies if we focus on Bitcoin alone. However, if we extend our viewpoint to other cryptocurrencies, we'd see that the crypto ecosystem is not lacking in sustainability. With Ethereum leading the march, 2023 saw several eco-friendly cryptocurrencies gaining attention.


One notable example is the Chia Network with its proof-of-space-and-time protocol. Transactions are validated through a process called farming, utilizing tech structures such as cloud computing and data storage platforms like AWS. Chia's unique farming process allows it to consume only about 0.12% of Bitcoin's annualized energy.Similarly, Algorand has emerged as a key player in promoting a greener environment. Touted as the first pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) fundamental blockchain, Algorand took proactive steps in 2021 to offset its carbon footprint and monitor emissions through its partnership with ClimateTrade. This collaboration, coupled with Algorand's PoS consensus, positions it as a more energy-efficient alternative to Bitcoin. In fact, a single Algorand transaction consumes just 0.000008 kWh of electricity compared to Bitcoin's 1,206.52 kWh.These examples, alongside projects like Solana and Avalanche, align with the objectives of the Crypto Climate Accord. This Accord, a coalition of industry stakeholders, aims to transition the cryptocurrency sector to 100% renewable energy by 2025. Through these collective efforts, the industry moves closer to achieving a greener and more sustainable crypto landscape.Related: Breaking the Bank: America's Multi-Trillion Dollar Banking Problem


Putting money in eco-conscious cryptoAs crypto projects ""clean"" the earth by reducing its carbon footprint, it is also sanitizing its image in the eyes of investors. The environmental impact of cryptocurrencies can be a huge turnoff for investors, especially in this era of environmental, social, and corporate governance. (Recall that in 2021, Tesla halted Bitcoin payments citing environmental reasons.)The European Central Bank stated that significant carbon footprints from cryptocurrencies could affect their valuation in countries or regions where green policies thrive. They further highlighted that if EU authorities are considering banning fossil fuel cars by 2035, it is unlikely that cryptocurrencies would be spared (that is if they still impact the environment significantly). This is even a notable aspect of the European Parliament's Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) Regulation.So where does this leave us?Although Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, has faced criticism for its significant carbon footprint resulting from energy-intensive mining, the industry is moving towards more sustainable alternatives. So, while there are valid concerns about the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies, the ecosystem is evolving to address these issues. The shift towards sustainable practices, exemplified by Ethereum's transition to PoS and the emergence of eco-friendly crypto projects, demonstrates a positive pathway.Governments also need to play their part in minimizing the costs of renewable energy. Through state efforts and by supporting projects that actively reduce their carbon footprint, the crypto ecosystem has the potential to contribute to a more sustainable future.

    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

90% of corporations now view sustainability as a crucial part of their organization's strategy. But turning recognition of the importance of sustainability into concrete action is often easier said than done. Notably, only 60% of organizations actually have a sustainability strategy in place — representing a 30% gap between the number that view this as important and the number that are actually taking action.As part of the effort to get more companies to adopt eco-conscious initiatives, carbon credits have become an increasingly important part of the modern sustainability narrative. But challenges to the effective adoption and use of carbon credits remain. However, with digital carbon spurring a new wave of green entrepreneurship, this is poised to change.Read on to learn more about digital carbon credits and how they could potentially play a role in your own efforts to go green.Related: Digital Ads Are Fueling a Climate Disaster. Take These Steps to Offset The Industry's Hidden Toll on Our Planet.So, what are carbon credits?First, it's important to understand what carbon credits are and what their role looks like in the current corporate environment. Carbon credits are designed to offset the greenhouse gas emissions of corporations and nations.



There are two main types of carbon credits. The first is often referred to as a ""permit to pollute"" or ""regulatory compliance credits,"" in which a company essentially buys carbon credits equivalent to the amount that they went over the allowed rate. As Investopedia explains, companies are granted a specific number of credits, with each credit allowing for the emission of one ton of carbon dioxide.These credits are designed to decline over time, and companies can sell or trade their excess credits. Essentially, the idea is that having credits to ""cap"" carbon emissions will create a financial incentive for businesses to lower their emissions.For example, a country might require companies to limit their greenhouse emissions to 50,000 tons per year. A business that previously produced 70,000 tons of emissions per year must either buy carbon credits or find a way to lower its emissions. Even for smaller businesses, these guidelines can serve as a good way to consider how you can lower your emissions over time.The other type of credit (known as ""voluntary offset credits"") is obtained when a company offsets its own emissions through its voluntary participation in an environmental project. An organization that invests in a project in areas such as renewable energy or forestry can then obtain carbon offset credits as a way of quantifying their environmental impact.


Related: Sustainability In Business: Why Change Is Needed NowHow digital carbon enhances the existing carbon credit marketCurrently, the standard market for creating, selling and trading carbon credits leaves a lot of room for interpretation. ""Permit to pollute"" credits are government issued — but in many parts of the world, participation in these carbon credit exchanges is relatively limited.For example, the United States only has two state-based emissions trading programs. These are the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which is limited to power sector emissions in several Northeastern states, and California's AB-32 Cap-and-Trade Program.Because of this, most businesses only participate in the carbon offsets voluntary market — obtaining carbon credits by investing in sustainability projects. However, offset credits aren't regulated by the government, which can create challenges for selling, trading and verifying carbon offsets. How can your business manage carbon credits effectively without a clear system in place?


This is where digital carbon can help level the playing field, improving accessibility and streamlining processes. As a report from Changeblock reveals, digital carbon offers digital credits representing proportional ownership of climate-backed tokens. A central digital platform enables these tokens to be gathered as a single asset that is easily traded. Rather than needing to buy individual tokens from different sellers or marketplaces, digital carbon credits can represent one ton's worth of emissions from several offsetting projects.With blockchain management, each digital carbon credit comes with a comprehensive data packet detailing the transaction. This includes details on emissions reductions quantity and pricing. In some cases, it could even provide transparent access to raw data from sensors such as gas chromatography devices, scales, pressure monitoring systems and more to verify the amount of carbon offset associated with each digital credit.This actionable insight and the accessibility of a digital platform help bring offset carbon credits to a significantly broader audience, incentivizing more organizations and individuals to participate in climate change initiatives. Digital carbon credits open up this concept to the masses — so even if you're ""too small"" for a traditional carbon credit program, you can still access digital credits.Key advantages of digital carbonDigital carbon offers several noteworthy benefits that, when properly implemented, allow carbon credits to become more effective in driving the transition to a global net-zero economy.


By using a digital platform as a central location for tracking and trading carbon credits, these processes will naturally become more efficient and transparent. For organizations that are seeking to sell, trade or verify their carbon credits, this provides a much-needed layer of trust in what is still a largely unregulated industry.A digital platform also enhances the potential for organizations to offset emissions on a global scale by being able to support and gain carbon credits for sustainability projects anywhere. This also makes carbon credits more easily accessible to individuals and organizations that might not have the capabilities to undertake carbon reduction projects on their own. For example, you could partner with another sustainability organization, donating whatever money or resources you can, rather than needing to spearhead a sustainability project on your own.In many ways, digital carbon is set to support a significant expansion in new sustainability-focused partnerships worldwide by making it easier for companies of all sizes to invest in environmental projects of varied scope and focus.Related: 3 Ways You Can Bring Sustainability to Your Workplace


Creating the future of sustainabilityDemand for carbon credits is only expected to increase in the coming years. As businesses and governments seek to curb their impact on the environment, the ability to effectively create, track and trade carbon and other environmental credits will become even more important.With the growing wave of digital carbon initiatives, much-needed transparency and efficiency can make these efforts more effective than ever before. As you consider how your own business can become more environmentally friendly, don't overlook the potential value of digital carbon.

29,Why the Industrial Approach to the Metaverse Is Resonating,"May 22, 2023",StackCommerce,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/why-the-industrial-approach-to-the-metaverse-is-resonating/452445,"
We've heard a lot about the metaverse in recent years, but what if there were more interesting and practical approaches to this concept than what's written about Zuckerberg's Meta? The company formerly known as Facebook's social approach to the metaverse isn't the only way to take advantage of the next generation of the internet. Some of the most promising applications have come from the world of industry. According to a report from Capgemini Research Institute, 93 percent of consumers are curious about the metaverse. The report breaks down how they're curious about using it to sample products and experiences and even visit and explore places virtually.Retail brands are taking notice of this curiosity. Effective virtual shopping experiences like the Dyson Demo VR let customers test, try, and learn about Dyson products in an immersive digital environment. Putting visualization and simulation technologies used by Dyson engineers in the hands of consumers, this demo exemplifies the connectivity and commercial potential of 3D metaverse marketing.



In addition to creating virtual experiences for customers, companies are focused on interactive applications for employees themselves, which help fuse this new-age internet with the physical world. For a real-world augmentation example showing how the metaverse can enhance employee experience, look at the rise of the Virtual IPO. When the company Unity went public in 2020, its Listing Day celebration was shown on Unity Interactive Streaming, offering interactive and immersive features for those tuning into the New York Stock Exchange-based event — a first for employees of a company going public and the metaverse.The technology has since been made available to the NYSE for other companies to use, with dozens of virtual IPOs in the books and several hundred thousand virtual bell rings. You can check out a showcase of how Unity Interactive Streaming supports virtual IPOs at this webinar on May 31st: sign up while spots are still available.


Many industries are also working to bring the new version of the Internet to life with the help of digital twins. These accurate, real-time representations of physical assets and systems are game-changers for manufacturing, construction, architecture, and other infrastructure-related industries.For example, award-winning architecture firm SHoP Architects used digital twins to forecast and solve challenges when constructing The Brooklyn Tower — a 93-story NYC skyscraper. Not only do live construction data and 3D renderings help align architecture with development, but they also set up building owners for better management and maintenance in the future.These examples of real-world digital applications are already helping businesses and individuals operate faster and more efficiently.Could these examples, and many others, change your views on what the metaverse is? Metaverse skeptics: might you learn something about how VR consumer demos, real-world augmentation, and digital twins already empower people and, therefore, is the metaverse?

Fallen FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, aka SBF, thinks the court was too heavy-handed with the charges levied against him in December.On Monday SBF's legal team asked Manhattan federal court to dismiss 10 of the 13 criminal charges against him, including the foreign bribery charge, campaign finance charge, and a bank fraud charge, according to the New York Times.Bankman-Fried was accused of misappropriating billions of dollars in customer funds in a fraud scheme between his FTX cryptocurrency exchange and his Alameda Research crypto trading firm. FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022 after a bank run exposed an $8 billion hole in the company's accounts. SBF was arrested in the Bahamas and extradited to the United States in December.

Robyn Phelps/Insider via Business Insider
The Metaverse, once the hottest idea in tech, is headed to the industry's graveyard of failed fads.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. The Metaverse, the once-buzzy technology that promised to allow users to hang out awkwardly in a disorientating video-game-like world, has died after being abandoned by the business world. It was three years old.The capital-M Metaverse, a descendant of the 1982 movie ""Tron"" and the 2003 video game ""Second Life,"" was born in 2021 when Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg changed the name of his trillion-dollar company to Meta. After a much-heralded debut, the Metaverse became the obsession of the tech world and a quick hack to win over Wall Street investors. The hype could not save the Metaverse, however, and a lack of coherent vision for the product ultimately led to its decline. Once the tech industry turned to a new, more promising trend — generative AI — the fate of the Metaverse was sealed.



The Metaverse is now headed to the tech industry's graveyard of failed ideas. But the short life and ignominious death of the Metaverse offers a glaring indictment of the tech industry that birthed it.Grand promiseFrom the moment of its delivery, Zuckerberg claimed that the Metaverse would be the future of the internet. The glitzy, spurious promotional video that accompanied Zuckerberg's name-change announcement described a future where we'd be able to interact seamlessly in virtual worlds: Users would ""make eye contact"" and ""feel like you're right in the room together."" The Metaverse offered people the chance to engage in an ""immersive"" experience, he claimed.


These grandiose promises heaped sky-high expectations on the Metaverse. The media swooned over the newborn concept: The Verge published a nearly 5,000-word-long interview with Zuckerberg immediately following the announcement — in which the writer called it ""an expansive, immersive vision of the internet."" Glowing profiles of the Metaverse seemed to set it on a laudatory path, but the actual technology failed to deliver on this promise throughout its short life. A wonky virtual-reality interview with the CBS host Gayle King, where low-quality cartoon avatars of both King and Zuckerberg awkwardly motioned to each other, was a stark contrast to the futuristic vistas shown in Meta's splashy introductory video.The Metaverse also suffered from an acute identity crisis. A functional business proposition requires a few things to thrive and grow: a clear use case, a target audience, and the willingness of customers to adopt the product. Zuckerberg waxed poetic about the Metaverse as ""a vision that spans many companies'' and ""the successor to the mobile internet,"" but he failed to articulate the basic business problems that the Metaverse would address. The concept of virtual worlds where users interact with each other using digital avatars is an old one, going back as far as the late 1990s with massively multiplayer online role-player games, such as ""Meridian 59,"" ""Ultimate Online,"" and ""EverQuest."" And while the Metaverse supposedly built on these ideas with new technology, Zuckerberg's one actual product — the VR platform Horizon Worlds, which required the use of an incredibly clunky Oculus headset — failed to suggest anything approaching a road map or a genuine vision. In spite of the Metaverse's arrested conceptual development, a pliant press published statements about the future of the technology that were somewhere between unrealistic and outright irresponsible. The CNBC host Jim Cramer nodded approvingly when Zuckerberg claimed that 1 billion people would use the Metaverse and spend hundreds of dollars there, despite the Meta CEO's inability to say what people would receive in exchange for their cash or why anyone would want to strap a clunky headset to their face to attend a low-quality, cartoon concert.A high-flying lifeThe inability to define the Metaverse in any meaningful way didn't get in the way of its ascension to the top of the business world. In the months following the Meta announcement, it seemed that every company had a Metaverse product on offer, despite it not being obvious what it was or why they should.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella would say at the company's 2021 Ignite Conference that he couldn't ""overstate how much of a breakthrough"" the Metaverse was for his company, the industry, and the world. Roblox, an online game platform that has existed since 2004, rode the Metaverse hype wave to an initial public offering and a $41 billion valuation. Of course, the cryptocurrency industry took the ball and ran with it: The people behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT company conned the press into believing that uploading someone's digital monkey pictures into VR would be the key to ""master the Metaverse."" Other crypto pumpers even successfully convinced people that digital land in the Metaverse would be the next frontier of real-estate investment. Even businesses that seemed to have little to do with tech jumped on board. Walmart joined the Metaverse. Disney joined the Metaverse.


Despite Zuckerberg's obsession with the Metaverse, the tech never lived up to the hype. FacebookCompanies' rush to get into the game led Wall Street investors, consultants, and analysts to try to one up each other's projections for the Metaverse's growth. The consulting firm Gartner claimed that 25% of people would spend at least one hour a day in the Metaverse by 2026. The Wall Street Journal said the Metaverse would change the way we work forever. The global consulting firm McKinsey predicted that the Metaverse could generate up to ""$5 trillion in value,"" adding that around 95% of business leaders expected the Metaverse to ""positively impact their industry"" within five to 10 years. Not to be outdone, Citi put out a massive report that declared the Metaverse would be a $13 trillion opportunity.A brutal downfallIn spite of all this hype, the Metaverse did not lead a healthy life. Every single business idea or rosy market projection was built on the vague promises of a single CEO. And when people were actually offered the opportunity to try it out, nobody actually used the Metaverse.


Decentraland, the most well-funded, decentralized, crypto-based Metaverse product (effectively a wonky online world you can ""walk"" around), only had around 38 daily active users in its ""$1.3 billion ecosystem."" Decentraland would dispute this number, claiming that it had 8,000 daily active users — but that's still only a fraction of the number of people playing large online games like ""Fortnite."" Meta's much-heralded efforts similarly struggled: By October 2022, Mashable reported that Horizon Worlds had less than 200,000 monthly active users — dramatically short of the 500,000 target Meta had set for the end of 2022. The Wall Street Journal reported that only about 9% of user-created worlds were visited by more than 50 players, and The Verge said that it was so buggy that even Meta employees eschewed it. Despite the might of a then-trillion-dollar company, Meta could not convince people to use the product it had staked its future on.The Metaverse fell seriously ill as the economy slowed and the hype around generative AI grew. Microsoft shuttered its virtual-workspace platform AltSpaceVR in January 2023, laid off the 100 members of its ""industrial metaverse team,"" and made a series of cuts to its HoloLens team. Disney shuttered its Metaverse division in March, and Walmart followed suit by ending its Roblox-based Metaverse projects. The billions of dollars invested and the breathless hype around a half-baked concept led to thousands — if not tens of thousands — of people losing their jobs.But the Metaverse was officially pulled off life support when it became clear that Zuckerberg and the company that launched the craze had moved on to greener financial pastures. Zuckerberg declared in a March update that Meta's ""single largest investment is advancing AI and building it into every one of our products."" Meta's chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, told CNBC in April that he, along with Mark Zuckerberg and the company's chief product officer, Chris Cox, were now spending most of their time on AI. The company has even stopped pitching the Metaverse to advertisers, despite spending more than $100 billion in research and development on its mission to be ""Metaverse first."" While Zuckerberg may suggest that developing games for the Quest headsets is some sort of investment, the writing is on the wall: Meta is done with the Metaverse.Did anyone learn their lesson?While the idea of virtual worlds or collective online experiences may live on in some form, the Capital-M Metaverse is dead. It was preceded in death by a long line of tech fads like Web3 and Google Glass. It is survived by newfangled ideas like the aforementioned generative AI and the self-driving car. Despite this long lineage of disappointment, let's be clear: The death of the Metaverse should be remembered as arguably one of the most historic failures in tech history.


I do not believe that Mark Zuckerberg ever had any real interest in ""the Metaverse,"" because he never seemed to define it beyond a slightly tweaked Facebook with avatars and cumbersome hardware. It was the means to an increased share price, rather than any real vision for the future of human interaction. And Zuckerberg used his outsize wealth and power to get the whole of the tech industry and a good portion of the American business world into line behind this half-baked idea.The fact that Mark Zuckerberg has clearly stepped away from the Metaverse is a damning indictment of everyone who followed him, and anyone who still considers him a visionary tech leader. It should also be the cause for some serious reflection among the venture-capital community, which recklessly followed Zuckerberg into blowing billions of dollars on a hype cycle founded on the flimsiest possible press-release language. In a just world, Mark Zuckerberg should be fired as CEO of Meta (in the real world, this is actually impossible).Zuckerberg misled everyone, burned tens of billions of dollars, convinced an industry of followers to submit to his quixotic obsession, and then killed it the second that another idea started to interest Wall Street. There is no reason that a man who has overseen the layoffs of tens of thousands of people should run a major company. There is no future for Meta with Mark Zuckerberg at the helm: It will stagnate, and then it will die and follow the Metaverse into the proverbial grave.Ed Zitron is the CEO of EZPR, a national tech and business public-relations agency.

32,The Metaverse Has Definitely Lost Steam — But Is It Dead?,"May 7, 2023",Nathan Sinnott,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/the-metaverse-has-definitely-lost-steam-but-is-it-dead/447691,"
The Metaverse: an immersive virtual world where we can interact with each other using smartphones, PCs, special glasses or VR headsets. A digital world that up until recently enjoyed huge buzz and excitement surrounding the opportunities it might have presented for businesses and consumers alike.The Metaverse arrived with a variety of investment and money-making opportunities, where users could purchase a wide variety of digital goods and services for their avatars and their own virtual experiences. Ranging from brand-name accessories to cars in virtual stores and even being able to buy virtual land. The NBA's Brooklyn Nets made sports history as the first pro sports team to broadcast a game in the metaverse, which they coined the ""Netaverse.""Big early bets have been made on the Metaverse, too. Meta has spent eye-watering levels of money on its metaverse play. Reality Labs, the division inside Meta that houses Metaverse projects, recorded cumulative losses of nearly $24 billion across 2021 and 2022.



Related: What Is the Metaverse and Why Is It Important to Entrepreneurs?Not as popular as expectedBut, as fast as the hype built around the Metaverse though (much the same time as Mark Zuckerberg made huge announcements about Facebook's future being connected to an immersive 3D world and rebranding the company to Meta), interest equally waned. Evidence of this can be seen by looking at Google search traffic for the Metaverse, which dwindled significantly over recent months, taking it back to pre-announcement levels.


Over the span of a few years, tech and entertainment giants invested heavily in building this virtual world, only to discover that most of us haven't got much of an appetite for the Metaverse. It looks like we are much more attached to reality than tech leaders first thought. Statistics across retail and air travel confirm we are moving back into the real world following Covid-19 lockdowns. Most people still don't yet understand what the Metaverse is, how it works or what it means for them, which could be categorized as a fairly significant failure considering the huge investments and media coverage this space has received.Meta has been actively slimming down its virtual world operations. Disney and Microsoft are both closing their Metaverse departments. Apple looks to have all but given up on its virtual reality headset, while Tinder has announced that it will abandon its plans for virtual world dating.What was once a potentially exciting business and investment opportunity has become a terribly expensive gamble that looks to have all but failed so far. The Metaverse is looking to be turning into a great corporate collapse, at least in the immediate term, with billions of dollars of investment at risk and reputations being impacted.Tech innovators and leaders tend to think in terms of the hype cycle: the roller coaster journey from concept to widespread adoption. For now, it looks like huge sums of investor money have been spent on a technology whose potential has yet to be realized — and may never be.


More recently, Mark Zuckerberg made an announcement to the market about Meta's renewed focus on AI, which could likely be a sign that he's silently killing off the Metaverse project and walking away from the vast investments he's made in this tech. And while Zuckerberg has pointed out that the Metaverse is a long-term investment for Meta — and he has promised to dial down the Metaverse rhetoric — this gamble is looking more and more like an example of corporate hubris.Related: Why Your Business Needs to Prepare for the MetaverseThe metaverse is out and AI is inGenerative AI has stolen the Metaverse's thunder. The real-world application of OpenAI's ChatGPT is hard to compete with at the moment, and rightly so. It has immediate and very real and meaningful uses that can be hugely helpful to individuals and to businesses. It's having a meaningful impact on bottom lines across the world and isn't speculative like the Metaverse.AI also goes well beyond ChatGPT. It can be categorized into four areas at the moment:


Automated intelligence: Automates manual routine and non-routine tasks.Assisted intelligence: Assists people to perform particular tasks faster and sometimes better.Augmented intelligence: Helps people make better decisions.Autonomous intelligence: Automates decision-making processes without the need for human input.Whether it be machine learning, smart applications and appliances, digital assistants or autonomous vehicles, AI has very real scope across the global economy right now and also into the future, helping it avoid the tag of being a fad. As a result, it's viewed as a safer and less risky investment bet.What needs to change for the Metaverse to recover?For the Metaverse to have any chance of success at some point in the future, consumer education must be front and center. Dissolve the mystery surrounding the virtual world and its applications to both consumers and businesses.The enormity of the challenge must not be underestimated. At its best, from a user experience perspective, the Metaverse requires hyper-realistic 3D display technology that would be offered through a normal pair of glasses. This virtual world is quite simply too early in its journey right now to have any real impact, hence it's viewed as a dangerously speculative and risky investment at present.The Metaverse is not about to simply die on the vine overnight. With time, we will stop being asked to spend our time in virtual worlds using kooky avatars to simply chat with friends or hang out on some digital land we purchased. Virtual spaces will become far more natural and realistic — with time. And that's the critical ingredient: time.


I think that with its evolution, we will see it more broadly adopted, perhaps in a more narrow and focused manner — likely for short bursts, i.e. truly immersive experiences such as product launches, concerts, meetings, education and training, socializing and much more, rather than the inaccurate or unrealistic concept that we will somehow spend much of our waking days inside a virtual world.Related: 5 Metaverse Trends That Will Shape the Next DecadeIs the Metaverse dead?An investment in the Metaverse is only as valuable as the demand for the technologies involved. When the hype was at its peak, there was an argument to be made about the value of an investment (albeit a risky one) in the virtual world, but when that hype dries up and the punters leave, that investment fast becomes worthless.While Meta has confirmed that it remains a long-term focus, and big corporates such as Siemans, Proctor and Gamble and others are using Metaverse technology for various applications related to their businesses, no one has yet brought that magical application or experience to the table as yet, probably because the hardware devices required to achieve this don't yet exist.


So is the Metaverse dead? I don't think so. Not yet anyway. It's too early to make that call. It's not that the real world is back and the online world is in the past, but rather that the two will run in parallel. It is not that the online universe is going to disappear, but rather that it may have reached its limit — for now. If you have an appetite for significant risk-based investing, a passion for bleeding edge technology and making bets that are wildly speculative, then there's probably an angle for you to explore in the Metaverse, but get advice and tread very carefully.

You don't have to be a media professional to notice the barrage of commentary in the press regarding digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. And at least of late, it certainly appears tilted to the negative. It's human nature to be afraid of change and evolution: We all like to be mollycoddled — warm, undisturbed in our cribs and averse to change and innovation.The actual market data in the crypto space, however, suggests that trends are anything but negative, with Bloomberg recently publishing an article postulating a $100,000 Bitcoin valuation as the year progresses.Most of you have heard about the collapse of FTX or LUNA by now — fairly new and multi-billion-dollar enterprises seemingly falling out of the sky. And this is at least partially to be expected in such a new sector: The digital realm is largely unregulated globally at the moment, although that dynamic is in the process of transforming, as major governments assess digital currency and associated legislation.

Presumably, hundreds of thousands of Sams worldwide have a bone to pick with Mark Zuckerberg and Meta over its newest A.I. technology, SAM. (Or at least me).Meta unveiled its Segment Anything Model ""SAM"" on Wednesday. The new technology has the ability to identify individual objects in images through what Meta says is the largest segmentation dataset of its kind. The tool can ""segment"" different items within pictures using a dataset of over 1 billion masks, or various objects, on 11 million licensed and privacy-respecting images, they said in a blog post.However, they said SAM has been able to identify images it hasn't encountered in its training as well.



Today we're releasing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) — a step toward the first foundation model for image segmentation.SAM is capable of one-click segmentation of any object from any photo or video + zero-shot transfer to other segmentation tasks https://t.co/qYUoePrWVi pic.twitter.com/zX4Rxb5Yfo— Meta AI (@MetaAI) April 5, 2023By clicking on objects in images or filling in the text prompts, SAM can identify them for you. For example, in one demonstration SAM drew boxes around several cats in a photo after the word ""cat"" was entered into the prompt.


Meta has already been utilizing technologies similar to SAM internally for tagging photos, moderating content, and suggesting posts to users. With the release of SAM, Meta hopes to increase access to similar broadscale and adaptable technologies, researchers said in a report.RELATED: AI Could Replace Up to 300 Million Workers Around the World. But the Most At-Risk Professions Aren't What You'd Expect.The SAM model and dataset are available for download under a non-commercial license, and while users can upload their own images, people must agree to use the tool for research purposes only.It's unclear if Meta checked with the Sams of the world before unveiling the new technology's moniker, however, I, Sam Silverman, did not sign off on this. Here's hoping we Sams don't become the next Siri.

38,Why Another Bitcoin Boom Could Be the Key to Institutional Adoption. Should You Buy In?,"Apr 3, 2023",Ariel Shapira,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/why-another-bitcoin-boom-could-be-the-key-to-institutional/448272,"
As bitcoin rises amid the banking turmoil, armchair economists, politicians, Twitter heads and blockchain industry leaders have their takes on the factors behind the original cryptocurrency's recent jump. Between March 10 and March 22, the price of BTC shot up 45% from $19,700 to over $28,600.It's hard to ignore the fact that this (somewhat) unexpected jump coincides with the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature collapses and Credit Suisse's restructuring under its former competitor, USB. Though not nearly on the magnitude of Lehman Brothers and the like, we're experiencing the first major banking crisis since 2008. Since bitcoin's entire purpose is to offer an alternative to banks, it will be instructive to observe crypto markets in the coming months. That's even before considering inflation, which in theory, is supposed to drive bitcoin adoption as a safe haven asset.And there is precedent to bitcoin breaking from broader markets. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, bitcoin dropped from over $9,000 on March 6 to $4,826 by March 12. The drop coincided with a stock market crash that led some to announce the end of bitcoin.



How could a ""safe haven"" asset react to market shocks the same way stocks do? Of course, the price eventually returned to its pre-COVID levels by July of that year and then began steadily taking off in late 2020 before reaching $61,195.3 on March 13, 2021.Related: 3 Blockchain Stocks to Play the Bitcoin Rally


It's still a little premature to say that bitcoin is on a similar trajectory. A few influences contributed to the rise in BTC's value during the COVID era, most notably the stimulus checks that pumped cash into the economy. Other factors such as the NFT boom, play2earn and the bitcoin halving event helped expand crypto's mainstream footprint.We're in a very different financial environment today. Most notably, the era of ""free money"" has infamously crashed and burned with the collapse of FTX, 3AC and others. VCs are tightening their budgets, as are companies more broadly. We're simply not at a time at which serious startups are going to find it easy to raise money, let alone random NFT projects.Still, other factors at play beyond inflation could drive a crypto renaissance. Firstly, we're a year away from the next bitcoin halving event. During the halving events, the rewards for mining bitcoin are cut in half, which in theory, is supposed to cut supply in half. Assuming demand remains constant or rises, that's supposed to drive up prices. There is still debate about whether the halving events are priced in, but some have argued that the previous halving event also played a role in the last bull run.Related: 5 Things to Expect from Crypto in 2023


But there's a more significant factor looming over the industry here. A recent study by four economists suggests that around 190 U.S. banks are also at risk of collapsing amid uninsured bank runs. Of course, not all of them will, and this likely isn't the doomsday scenario that will drive what bitcoin ers call ""hyperbitcoinization"" — a sort of bitcoin utopia in which people transact in bitcoin and central banks add bitcoin to their balance sheets. Still, it could lead to retail investors upping the bitcoin in their portfolios and banks starting to offer crypto services.Investors are already eager to diversify their portfolios with traditional asset classes and bitcoin. It would be wise for banks to seize on that opportunity, especially now. That's especially true, considering banks have vast experience dealing with regulatory bodies to take this on more effectively than crypto-native platforms.But for some financial institutions, especially the smaller and more localized ones that don't have the resources to build their own solutions to mirror those used by decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, overcoming the technological barriers can be discouraging.There are, however, actors working on getting banks and traditional institutions, large and small, up to speed. Self-custody platform GK8, for example, actively helps institutions manage digital assets securely while also supporting staking and other DeFi services.


There's an entire industry of tech solutions to assist banks in onboarding crypto because the institutional demand is there. Regardless of the overall health of TradFi or the market cap of the crypto industry, banks have already been inching toward integrating bitcoin and other digital assets into their balance sheets. And regardless of whether bitcoin enters into a bull market now or later, that demand will continue to rise.

39,How NFT Marketplaces Will Onboard the Next Mass Wave of Users to Crypto,"Mar 30, 2023",Masha Vyazemskaya,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-nft-marketplaces-will-onboard-the-next-mass-wave-of/447981,"
Is there life beyond the bear? While crypto Twitter and mainstream media are expressing varying levels of hope and skepticism, a lot of teams are working hard to bring the future of Web3 closer. And this time — it's not only crypto, folks.This is the main difference between this ""crypto winter"" and the one of 2018-2020, when Ethereum was available for less than 200 dollars. Drastic decreases in prices and market capitalization caused a lot of debates on the legitimacy of the industry from traditional outsiders but couldn't scare off the Web3-native believers who just continued building. Whether it's because of the precedent they set or anticipation of the bigger market, traditional players doubled down on the bear builder party this time.Related: How Crypto, Blockchain and Web3 Institutions Can Accelerate Mass AdoptionNFTs to lead the wayThe spotlight here is once again on NFTs. Not intimidated by the market conditions, quite a few future-oriented brands have been releasing pilot NFT projects to test the waters (McFarlane, Fox, Starbucks) or working on robust digital asset-based community campaigns behind closed doors. It's obvious to anybody that it's not a race for quick gain, but a well-thought-out long-term game.""Why now?"" you're probably wondering. First and foremost, the technology, UX and education frameworks have finally reached the level that significantly lowers the entry barrier to the NFT ecosystem. Arguably, for the first time ever, Web3 is close to being ready to onboard millions of mass users.



""How does it look in practice?"" you might ask. Loyalty programs, community engagements and unlockable content are among the brands' favorites. Big companies are starting to consider NFTs as a base for a variety of activities, giving an inspiring hint at what the next bull run can look like.Such a spike in credibility and the prospects of mass adoption can't help influence the current shape of the industry and the trajectory of its development. To date, the heart of the Web3 movement has been NFT marketplaces — platforms with different levels of decentralization where users can mint (create), display, buy and sell their collectibles. For quite a few brands, these marketplaces have been the entry point into the NFT world.


With this trend clearly unfolding, we can't but ask ourselves: What role will NFT marketplaces play in this big movement? Will they stay the same or evolve to boost mass adoption in collaboration with brands?Related: Make Your Brand a Household Name Using the Power of NFTsRethinking NFT marketplacesWhat is the first thing that comes to mind when you think about an online marketplace? Quite likely, the likes of Amazon will be there: a one-stop-shop environment where users can find literally anything they want. Offered goods vary in price, but one thing stays the same: High-end brands have very limited representation there. You might find an expensive perfume or a pair of glasses, but that's about it. And who would go shop for Chanel bags on Amazon anyway?This analogy is key to understanding the brand's strategy as they come into Web3 with their massive user bases. Does this traditional marketplace model appeal to brands? I'd argue not. Since NFTs are shaping up to power next-gen gamified loyalty programs for communities, one-size-fits-all does not look like a good match.


Brands dipping their toes into NFT are looking to offer a safe, uniquely branded experience for their customers — with controllable monetization on top.Adoption issues and solutionsWhen directing users to a third-party NFT marketplace, there are several problems a brand can encounter:Safety and IP protection: Unfortunately, there are malicious players on the market, and NFT marketplaces do not always do a timely job eliminating collection copycats to make sure that a new user does not purchase a wrong NFT by accident.Monetization: With the recent market development and ""race to the bottom,"" the trend moves towards not respecting creator royalties, which could serve as a major revenue stream for popular collections. On top of that, using a third-party NFT marketplace always means paying fees that can be changed at any point of time. In other words, not controlling your revenue stream fully.This is where the Shopify model is entering the scene. Unlike traditional Web2 marketplaces, NFT marketplaces can take different forms — and verticalized, custom community marketplaces are a very promising route.Creating and fully controlling its own community marketplace allows a brand to enforce royalties, set custom fees and ensure the proven authenticity of digital collectibles with a branded look and feel, all in the spirit of decentralization.On top of that, NFT community marketplaces can be powered by shared orderbooks, meaning that buy and sell orders can be aggregated from other marketplaces from the start to help bootstrap the liquidity.All that said, on-brand community NFT marketplaces can truly become the gateway to onboard the next mass wave of users to crypto in a safer and more accessible way. Will this be the case in the next bull run? Time will tell.

40,What the Rise and Fall of Crypto Can Teach Us About Managing Distributed Teams,"Mar 27, 2023",Cory Hymel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/what-the-rise-and-fall-of-crypto-can-teach-us-about/447687,"
The crypto industry has had a very exciting and tumultuous run over the past decade. Major corporations were founded using blockchain technology, and the promise of Web3 created a market currently valued at $2.86 billion.While many look at the 2022 crypto bust as a strictly monetary pit of doom, there are some very interesting distributed team management lessons to take away from the industry's six-year bull run. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) presented a new way to organize teams, new blockchain tools sprung up to enable greater collaboration, and the crypto boom proved that caffeine-fueled nerds can execute common ideas in ways that even Wall Street had trouble understanding.Despite the misfallings of the Web3 market, you shouldn't write these accomplishments off as Web3 fairy dust. Business leaders and innovation-minded entrepreneurs should take note of the outlined workflows and processes that supported the Web3 growth of the last six years. Whether you believe in the underlying technology or not, these lessons provide insights on what entrepreneurs can replicate in the ever-evolving dynamics of team management.



Related: How DAOS Are Changing LeadershipWhat is a DAO?One of the most interesting things to come out of the crypto boom — in terms of team management — is the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). A DAO is a democratized organizational structure running on the blockchain network. It is a collective of like-minded people with a shared financial account, working on a shared goal. It is similar to a digital cooperative, but instead of having select leaders on the board, every member has voting rights. DAOs can have equal governance for each member or weighted votes depending on how many tokens each member holds.


This type of organization presented a new way to organize and manage distributed teams around the world. It utilizes an automated and democratic system that blockchain technology can provide. Let's dive into some of the management lessons from crypto and Web3 companies, especially DAOs, that can be applied outside the blockchain industry.Managing fractional workersDAOs succeeded in bringing together thousands (even hundreds of thousands) of anonymous people to achieve a common goal. While this isn't a realistic or necessary goal for traditional organizations, business leaders can learn a lot about managing fractional workers in the future of work.Web3 startups led the industry's growth vs. established enterprises because they were able to scale up and down easily to rapidly meet the demands of the market. Outside of the Web3 industry, every business is contending more and more with disruptive technologies. You can't expect your competition to give you six months to build a new team in order to capitalize on a new trend, you need to be able to act quickly.Project-based or fractional hiring is a way to rapidly scale to meet new demands while also attracting top talent that is interested in working on a challenging project and doesn't want to get tied into a long-term agreement.


Related: How DAOs Can Transform the Business WorldLeveraging peer-to-peer recognitionPeer-to-peer (P2P) recognition is super important in distributed and remote teams for helping to build culture and accountability and act as an incentive driver beyond monetary compensation.Web3 companies did this really well because all data and transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain and can be accessed by everyone. This ensured all recognition was public, inclusive and decentralized. P2P recognition could also be tied into incentive programs, which leveraged social and monetary recognition. Blockchains and smart contracts go hand-in-hand in promoting transparency and efficiency in governance and management that elicits trust from its members and community. However, every organization can endeavor to become more transparent with their employees and with the public.Non-Web3 companies should endeavor to create a similarly transparent and public P2P recognition program. One study found that when an employee is recognized once per month, their employee engagement increases by 43%.


Offering shared ownershipEngaging employees and making them feel that they have some ownership in the project is another big driver in the future of work. DAOs achieved this because every member of the DAO was literally invested in the organization. Many companies also experimented with NFTs as a way to unlock benefits or as a reward containing a unique value that is aligned with the brand's vision, mission and strategy.Companies can align their incentives for teams by looking at both the interests of team members and the goals and objectives of the organization. Examples of this can be profit sharing, equity ownership or performance-based incentive or benefit.However, monetary incentives aren't the only way to offer shared ownership. They aren't even the most important.It is more important for today's workers to feel like they have a voice and some stake in the game. Including employees in the decision-making process (especially during product ideation) and ensuring there is transparency in decision-making goes a long way toward making employees feel included and engaged.


Distributed decision-makingBeyond engagement and ownership, distributed decision-making is simply better decision-making. Good leadership involves giving up sole ownership over decisions and valuing inputs from team members, which can lead to better decisions. This concept is built into the structure of a DAO as it directly applies the inputs and votes of all members in the decision-making process.Even without DAO, businesses can adopt DAO-inspired procedures such as decentralized and democratic governance that can create a culture of collaboration that empowers distributed teams to be more effective and productive. Distributed decision-making allows you to scale and react faster by leveraging diverse backgrounds and inputs, A/B testing ideas quickly and getting feedback from larger groups.Consider adopting a democratized organization, either by gathering smaller teams with like-minded members to achieve certain goals or even company-wide, to forward a singular mission or objective and include team members who believe in the same principles.Related: 4 Reasons Decentralized Business Management Is Booming


We aren't recommending your organization make the switch to becoming fully decentralized. One of the big things that we see coming in the future for organizational management is the idea of hybrid DAOs, where there's a melding between traditional business structure supplemented with DAO mechanics.While the massive growth of the crypto and Web3 industry changed considerably last year, the principles used to reach those heights are valuable for any organization. Blockchain technology isn't going anywhere, and companies will have to deal with a much more automated, agile and transparent marketplace full of disruptors going forward. Whether your venture uses blockchain or not, these principles will help you compete in an increasingly decentralized world.

41,5 Reasons Why Crypto Projects Need PR in a Bear Market,"Mar 24, 2023",Valeriya Minaeva,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/5-reasons-why-crypto-projects-need-pr-in-a-downturn/447639,"
In economic downturns, companies will cut costs, tighten the belt and retreat. It's ingrained in human DNA, because those who didn't adapt didn't survive. But with both the personal and the economic, merely shrinking or hiding is not enough.The data is in. Research proves that those who maintain — or even increase — their PR spends do best in such times. They are also best positioned for the better times, too. Some of the biggest changes in crypto have come in bear markets. For those positioned to take advantage, there are opportunities in the lean times.Related: How To Utilize PR During A Recession



1. Don't cut your signal when sailing in choppy watersFor those responding to such moments as if truly a crisis or emergency, the last thing you want to do is reduce ties to the world. Cutting PR at such times is a little like being stranded and ignoring the radio or flare sitting next to you. PR pros are a lifeline — a crucial resource to be tapped, not saved for another time.It is at such times that evolutionary pressures come most into play, such as the ""survival of the fittest."" This includes the concept of ""adaptation."" It may not be enough to sit still until the storm passes, relying on previously amassed ""fitness."" It's a time when selective pressures are brought to bear, sorting the reactive and dynamic from the complacent. And that process can be a brutal one, rewarding only a few.


2. Ensure the glass is seen as half fullIt may also be a time when it becomes necessary, due to market pressures, to relay bad news to audiences. This could be about enforced price increases, reductions in headcount, lengthening delivery times and so on.Delivering such messages is fraught with reputational risk, including giving the accidental impression of going out of business. PR pros can help navigate with strategies and storylines that deliver difficult messages within broader contexts that emphasize a more optimistic long-term positioning.Difficult messaging can be delivered within the context of milestones, positioning the information within a wider context of development and progress. As ever, care should be taken to avoid the insincere and the contrived. But such well-crafted campaigns in such times can ensure that the ""glass"" is at least seen as half full.Related: Why Maintaining a Strong Media Presence is Key to Succeeding in an Economic Downturn


3. The opportunity to boost ""share of voice"" Much more than crisis management and sweetening difficult pills, PR can unlock opportunities in such times. Bear markets and recessions trigger cuts in PR and marketing budgets, which reduces industry noise. For those happy not to cut, this is an opportunity to stand out, with far less effort than usual.The added association for your audience is that, unlike your competitors, you are transmitting the message of going strong. It's an opportunity to leave a lasting impression, overtake competing narratives and establish your project as an industry leader. As others cut their PR efforts, journalists will also be on the lookout for content.Like the ""cash is king"" strategy of those investors who avoid taking positions when prices are high and conserve their cash for market dips, PR likewise can go a lot further at such times. At such quieter times, without changing a thing in PR spend or strategy, a project or company's share of voice (SOV) instantly grows as competitors cut costs. Such times are opportunities for those more willing, or better positioned, to adopt proactive tactics.4. Brand loyalty fends off the bearCrypto projects in a bear market are susceptible to losing a section of supporters who are apt to sell their currency and disappear. This causes many problems, not least low liquidity. To retain supporters, long-term brand loyalty must be established.


Creating and maintaining a community of supporters is one of the best strategies for weathering downturns. One need only look at Ethereum's online community. Even when token value has plummeted or the developer team missed crucial deadlines, the community remained strong. Hiring a PR team to build and maintain such a community may be vital to surviving bear markets, as well as optimizing at other times.Ensuring your brand is protected means being smart about budgetary changes and being open to variations in the usual strategy. PR is actually a budget-friendly strategy for maintaining relevance during downturns. While PR and marketing are often grouped together, the distinction becomes crucial at such times. PR can yield earned media, for example, rather than the paid media of marketing. Sacrificing PR at such times means going silent to your audience, potentially also sacrificing essential lifelines of trust and brand loyalty.Unlike with advertising, earned media is an evergreen investment, potentially living on far past the bear market, perhaps for years on end. Those who maintain PR at such times tend to not just survive the downturns, but come out stronger than competitors when the good times return.Related: How Great Entrepreneurs Find Ways to Win During Economic Downturns


5. The data is clearThough it may seem counterintuitive, the companies that maintain their PR investment during downturns, even those who increase it, tend to be the winners. There's also plenty of research to prove it.Those cutting costs more than competitors have the lowest probability (just 21%) of pulling ahead of rivals when times improve, according to a recession study published in a 2010 Harvard Business Review article. The same study shows that 9% of companies actually come out stronger than ever from such times.In another study (Field & Binet, 2008), researchers found that cutting budgets may help safeguard short-term profits, but it comes at a post-recession cost to brand and profits. Once again, they found that it's those increasing investments that are best positioned to achieve long-term profitability, gaining a larger share of voice against their competitors.A measured and balanced approachIt's easy to attract attention in a bull market, but bear markets sort the wheat from the chaff. The right PR professionals are skilled in securing vital coverage at such times. This is the time when the audience needs to hear from projects the most.


The decision to reduce, maintain or increase PR efforts during such times should be based on a careful analysis of the project's financial situation, market position and long-term goals. An adaptive, measured approach that balances resources with the need to maintain a strong brand presence is proven to be the best strategy in tough times.

Interpol announced this evening the arrest of Kwon Do-hyeong, also known as Do Kwon, a disgraced crypto fugitive.Crypto fugitive Do Kwon arrested in Montenegro, says interior minister https://t.co/pl9PshdPNb— Financial Times (@FT) March 23, 2023 Do Kwon is the founder of TerraUSD stablecoin and Luna, two digital currencies that lost an estimated $40 billion last year.Interpol apprehended Kwon, 31, and another person of interest at an airport in Montenegro. According to the Interior Ministry there, the two were using forged documents to travel to Dubai.



 As the Minister of Interior @filip_adzic, announced earlier today, two citizens, Kwon Do Hyeong and Hon Chang Joon, were apprehended and brought to the Basic State Prosecutor's Office in Podgorica, on criminal charges for the criminal offense of document forgery under (1/3) pic.twitter.com/iS0rRs2Fwv— mupCG (@MupCg) March 23, 2023""He was arrested at the airport with counterfeit documentation and is wanted by several countries, including the USA, South Korea, and Singapore,"" Montenegrin Internal Affairs Minister Filip Adžić wrote in a Facebook post.The arrest is the culmination of an international months-long search for Do Kwon. South Korea had asked Interpol to issue a ""red notice,"" which allows other countries to arrest Kwon.


According to the New York Times, U.S. prosecutors in the Southern District of New York filed criminal charges against Mr. Kwon a few hours after his arrest. The charges include wire fraud, commodities fraud, securities fraud, and conspiracy to defraud and engage in market manipulation.Who is Do Kwon?Kwon graduated from Stanford and briefly worked at Apple before designing his two cryptocurrencies. TerraUSD was a ""stablecoin,"" supposed to maintain a constant price of $1, while Luna's value fluctuated.Between 2021 and early 2022, Luna was valued at $40 billion. Kwon became widely popular. His fans called themselves ""Lunatics.""But Luna ultimately crashed—its value wiped clean overnight. The crash caused a domino effect on other popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Soon after, Kwon went into hiding.


Kwon claimed on Twitter that he was ""not on the run."" I am not ""on the run"" or anything similar - for any government agency that has shown interest to communicate, we are in full cooperation and we don't have anything to hide— Do Kwon ?

46,"Why Central Bank Digital Currencies Are Inevitable, and Why That's the Best Thing for Current Outdated Financial Systems","Mar 10, 2023",Sergey Shashev,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/cbdcs-are-inevitable-and-thats-a-good-thing/446381,"
In a recent research report by Bank of America, analysts concluded that ""CBDCs (central bank digital currencies) appear inevitable."" According to their research, CBDCs have ""the potential to revolutionize global financial systems and maybe the most significant technological advancement in the history of money.""While the contents of this report have been making waves in traditional media circles, those of us that have been researching and working with CBDCs over the past few years have been saying similar things for quite some time now. In this article, I will tackle some of the more prominent misconceptions about CBDCs, especially the ones concerning anonymity and the technology's potential use as a means of totalitarian control.Related: How This Digital Currency Will Transform The World and Benefit Cashless Societies



Anonymity is not part of the agendaSome of the most full-throated criticism of CBDC technology tends to come from the cryptocurrency community, where many consider the rollout of state-backed digital currencies to be an existential threat to anonymity. But if you think bitcoin and stablecoins are about privacy, they're not. Somewhere around 90% of addresses and transfers, if not more, have long since been traced and identified, and even in DeFi, cybercrime gets investigated, and the culprits get caught fairly quickly.Those who are active in the cryptocurrency industry and those who are knowledgeable about it know this. What is much more likely to be behind this vein of criticism of CBDCs is the perception of the technology not as an existential threat to privacy but as an existential threat to existing cryptocurrencies. However, this too is unfounded.


From working with regulators and countries in the process of launching CBDCs, it has to be said that privacy simply is not on the agenda in most cases. The central issues that are being dealt with currently revolve around what the legal framework should be, how the linkage to banks should work, how to move from stablecoin currencies to CBDCs, how to integrate the technology into international trade, how to incorporate CBDCs into ""superapps"" and so on.Related: Crypto vs. Banking: Which Is a Better Choice?Using CBDCs on the state levelWhen we move beyond the idea that CBDCs are a power grab by institutions looking to eliminate financial privacy, the actual value of the technology comes into view. There are two levels on which CBDCs offer vast improvements to the current status quo, that of the state and that of the individual.On the state level, it is important to understand that every foreign trade transaction now goes through the dollar. For example, take Pakistan and the Arab Emirates. When these countries trade, there is constant pressure on the national currencies because they must constantly sell their currencies and buy dollars. However, the dirham is quite trusted in Pakistan. So, direct payments in dirhams and rupees could be possible, but currently, there is no infrastructure to support this kind of transaction. This is where CBDCs come into play.


Regardless of how it's done, cross-border transfers must be straightened out. This could be achieved via currency baskets, AMM pools or mutual correspondent banks. One way or another, this will make economic processes easier and cheaper for almost all countries because cross-border rates and long chains of intermediaries will disappear.Related: Cross-Border Business Is Becoming a Non-Negotiable. Are You Ready?CBDCs for the individualThe main task facing CBDC development right now is building a basis for cross-border payments, which individuals do worldwide. The need for this to happen can be seen in how cross-border payments currently work in the Philippines and the Emirates.There are generally two ways of sending money from the UAE. The first is the old-fashioned ""hawala"" system. Here, the sender goes to their local community leader, gives him dollars, and then the leader's counterpart in the recipient's country gives the recipient the same amount in pesos.


The second method involves transferring money through services like Western Union. Depending on cross-border rates, the round-trip commission is between 6% and 12%. You inevitably have to have a double conversion. As a result, the cost of the transfer is extremely high.This is the process we are trying to build: the sender comes with digital dirhams either to a transfer point or a special machine. He needs to convert the dirhams into pesos. Both currencies are digitally deposited as stablecoins in an AMM pool, where the exchange rate changes very little. Conversely, the pesos are received through a transfer operator, which charges only 0.1% for the exchange of digital currencies. Thus, the total fees do not exceed 3% of the transfer amount.This is one way you can use CBDCs. And it is convenient and cheap for those who do not have cards or bank accounts, which in Southeast Asia alone amounts to several hundred million people. The fees these people have to pay to add up to a significant burden on a demographic that should be better served by governmental and financial institutions. And this is just a small picture of how revolutionary this technology can be. As development continues, the bigger picture will come into focus, but it is important now to recognize the potential CBDCs have to improve the lives of billions of people worldwide and focus on bringing that potential to fruition.

47,Should Your Business Launch an NFT? Here Are 4 Things You Need to Know.,"Mar 10, 2023",Gideon Kimbrell,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/should-your-business-launch-an-nft-here-are-4-things-you/433452,"
In 2021, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) came out of what seemed like nowhere to rack up almost $41 billion in sales. This explosive growth combined with its buzzy reputation might understandably lead startup leaders to wonder, is the NFT a smart growth opportunity for a young business, or just a flash in the pan that will only get you burned?After that initial explosion of buzz around NFTs, the market suffered a sales volume decrease as Ethereum, the cryptocurrency many NFTs are based on, dropped in value. With the NFT market now beginning to stabilize as the outlook of Ethereum becoming cheaper to mine appears positive, it's easier to get a real answer to the question of whether to delve into NFTs.Related: The Inception of Digital Assets and Growth of NFTs



Meanwhile, one of the market's major weak spots — its serious energy inefficiency — is also set to be fixed in the near future, removing one more obstacle to growth. In other words, strong indications point to NFTs continuing to flourish in the foreseeable future. But do they make sense for your fledgling brand?The NFT marketplace opportunities are expandingIn many ways, NFTs are just getting started. New marketplaces will continue to pop up, making it easier to pay for NFTs with fiat currency. Metaverses and video games will start to take full advantage of NFTs, selling transferrable avatars and in-game items to players that they can truly call their own.


With the right approach, you have an opportunity to tap into a steadily growing, tech-savvy global audience that's willing to purchase digital products that come with residual royalties built into the blockchain contract. However, that doesn't mean entering the NFT market is an automatic slam dunk for every business.Despite its trendy reputation, an NFT isn't a magic money maker. Like any product, it requires proper marketing, a thorough business plan encompassing the costs and risks involved and a dependable team behind it all. Launching an NFT also requires a thorough understanding of where it fits into your overall company vision. Here are some considerations as you ponder your decision regarding NFTs:1. Educate yourself on the behind-the-scenes aspectsBefore you get involved in this space, you need to start with a solid understanding of blockchain technology and NFTs. Plenty of resources are available to help you learn the ins and outs of the technology. NFTNow is a solid place to start.Related: How Blockchain Technology Is Changing the World From the Metaverse to NFTs


After you understand the process behind an NFT, you should also give yourself a practical education. Create a simple ""test NFT"" that you can sell to a friend or colleague for $1. Go through the entire process and see whether it's something you can see yourself and your customers repeating enough to generate a viable business line. Having a basic understanding of the process, along with the knowledge of how and why NFTs increase and decrease in value, will help you determine whether getting involved in the NFT space is the right fit for you.2. Decide if a potential NFT has actual value to your customersIn some ways, the popularity of the NFT isn't all that different from the mobile app craze of the past decade. As a software engineer, I was approached by a lot of people who were under the impression that if they just had a mobile app, they could become the next Mark Zuckerberg overnight.In most cases, the mobile apps they wanted to build would work just the same — or even better — on a mobile browser. For these entrepreneurs, building an app would just mean wasting money on something their business didn't need and their users didn't want. Today, plenty of entrepreneurs are making this same mistake with NFTs.Don't create NFTs in the hopes that you'll generate buzz for your business; launch an NFT collection only if you're serious about staying in the marketplace long-term and if you believe your collection has a unique value that NFT buyers will emotionally resonate with. Ask yourself whether you see a third party wanting to buy your NFT from a buyer as a resale. If the answer is no, then it doesn't belong on the market.


Related: Make Your Brand a Household Name Using the Power of NFTs3. Assess all the costs for launching an NFTWhile it's true that you might be able to mint and list an NFT at a cost of $100–$700, that doesn't necessarily represent the true cost of launching a successful NFT.If your current consumer base consists of people who love old-fashioned art and collectibles, for instance, you may have to enlist the help of experts to reach a new, younger demographic of NFT enthusiasts. This can easily turn into a marketing budget of up to $30,000 (or even more) just to get you started with proper brand creation, storytelling and creative direction. Make sure you're factoring in all these costs when deciding whether your launch will be truly worth it.4. Build a following and then launch an NFT — not the other way aroundNFTs should not be viewed as an ""if you build it, they will come"" technology. You need to make sure you have a robust audience who will want to buy what you're selling. NFTs are still in their relative infancy, and that means that entering this new market means taking on a certain amount of risk. But it means that there is still so much more room to grow.


While art has been the major focus of the NFT market thus far, plenty of other applications are only just being explored. Platforms such as Decentraland, for example, are using blockchain technology and NFTs to build a whole virtual world -- all owned by the people using it.NFTs offer a world of potential, and it will be forward-thinking entrepreneurs who help bring that potential to fruition. However, it's not enough to want to be one of these entrepreneurs. You need to have a plan and a vision that makes sense within the market. Otherwise, you will end up getting burned after all.

48,Why More Founders Should Think Like White Hat Hackers,"Mar 7, 2023",Ariel Shapira,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/why-more-founders-should-think-like-hackers/446323,"
Who would know better about protecting a complex system from exploitation than a gifted hacker tasked with destroying it?That is how the now decades-old cottage industry of white-hat hackers continues to thrive across sectors in tech development. For those unfamiliar, a ""white hat"" refers to an ethical security hacker, typically hired by companies or governments to identify security vulnerabilities in a system or software. These hackers operate under the owner's consent to test out many attacks against programs or even entire infrastructures to uncover potential exploitations before someone more nefarious reaches it.Despite its legal ambivalence, white hats are still commonly used as a high-intensity stress test, specifically in cybersecurity. More recently, ""white hat"" has become a marketing term used to launch products created by individuals with a past in more unscrupulous hacking circles —repurposing their skills to create a product or program of superior, ""hacker-proof"" quality.



Related: Be Afraid! 8 New Hacks From the Black Hat Conference That Should Scare You.But the concept of a white hat or products created by a benevolent troublemaker has fallen out of style in many mainstream fields of tech development. Now, any tech entrepreneur is a free agent to whichever tech trend happens to be in vogue, and ""disruptors"" is a hollow buzzword deployed by startup marketing teams.


Just look at how many projects and funds have pivoted back to AI now that the industry is reaching new heights of innovation and adoption. Trends drive funding and growth in any industry, but it becomes increasingly apparent when leading funds and investors radically change the projects they back, and every other accelerator follows suit to ride a wave. It creates an environment where worthy projects might miss out on valuable funding or attention because their industry isn't in a trendy tech investment listicle.With that in mind, do entrepreneurs and investors have the wrong mindset when exploring certain tech sectors?Part of the charm of white hat security comes from adopting a new perspective on a seemingly taboo or illicit part of tech culture and communities. It's a real-life example of keeping your friends close but your enemies closer. But with so many tech entrepreneurs and VCs chasing trends, it's harder for other parts of tech to escape being overlooked.Some might argue the taboo parts of tech culture have nothing that might benefit mainstream adoption. This argument is understandable, considering how underground tech fixtures are either built to be exploitative or harnessed for unsavory purposes. Reframing fringe developments for other uses may look like an endorsement or put projects in a morally grey area.


That being said, tech entrepreneurs and investors historically don't have a problem with being in the grey when it comes to backing projects or entire sectors. Case in point: Bitcoin and crypto, in general, were perceived as a tool for overtly criminal activity, such as buying drugs on the dark web.Related: Why 2023 Might Be The Year of the Crypto UnderdogThe dark web is probably one of the murkiest parts of the internet, yet many everyday users don't actually understand what it entails. The dark web allows private computer networks to communicate and transact completely anonymously by hosting internet content through highly-guarded overlay networks that can only be accessed through specific software or authorization. This kind of technology could be highly beneficial if it wasn't infamously associated with terrorism, child exploitation and other forms of violence.Polls repeatedly show Americans don't like government and corporate surveillance. And even Westerners who aren't as concerned about companies like Meta and Google tracking their internet activity understand the value censorship resistance offers activists and journalists seeking to share information under totalitarian regimes.


But most entrepreneurs wouldn't even consider repurposing the dark web's technological underpinnings due to its reputation. A white-hat mentality, for example, could be enormously beneficial in trying to keep the good in the dark web while finding ways to mitigate or even eliminate the bad.tomi, an anonymous project that claims to be led by crypto-industry leaders, has taken this approach in building its own alternative internet network. The idea is to ensure the free flow of information without government or corporate surveillance and prevent violence and illicit activity via tomiDAO, its community-led governance model.Related: The Metaverse Might Not Be Relevant Anymore, But AR Will Still Transform IndustriesEven AI has already been utilized for disreputable purposes. AI-based facial recognition has landed companies in hot water for illegal usage, not to mention the controversy caused by deepfakes and data privacy being compromised by generative AI. Yet there are few convincing arguments to completely abandon AI for benevolent reasons because it's being used for dubious purposes.


Innovation can often come from the most unlikely places, but adopting a trend-focused or narrow-minded approach to tech development will cause entire sectors to be discarded or pushed further to the sidelines. If we want to see more white hat-style development that creates the most interesting and generous tech products possible, it will require entrepreneurs and investors to shift their perspective. While not every seedy sector of tech has a hidden treasure trove of use cases waiting to be discovered, it would be worthwhile to look at the perimeter to at least examine how certain technologies can be used to benefit everyone.

49,Why the American Dream is Dead,"Mar 2, 2023",Solo Ceesay,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/is-the-american-dream-really-dead-yes-heres-why/445844,"
The United States of America was built on one main principle: one's inherited socioeconomic status is nothing more than a circumstance of the past that is to be rectified by their true destiny. The U.S. used this simple ideology to propel itself as one of the five great power nations of the world socially, economically and politically. This principle attracted countless immigrants who fled their countries of origin to escape a predestined fate.It might be incomprehensible to those born into America's idealistic regime, but on other continents such as Asia or Africa, it's pretty common for a person's future to be relegated to that of their ancestors. This is not an accident but a product bred out of extreme centralization and the elite pushing self-serving agendas. As a testament to this activity globally, Author Vasuki Shastry eloquently demonstrates:""Asia's billionaire class is a toxic addition to this mix. There is strong evidence in developing Asia that the political and business class often collude at the expense of public interest, aggravating already rising inequality and low social mobility, such as India's tendering of major infrastructure projects to favored business groups."" Centuries of strategic American propaganda have done an inconceivably good job at luring immigrants with the promise of a lucrative life built upon the foundations of hope and opportunity. I posit that it's becoming increasingly difficult for the vast majority to achieve Thomas Jefferson's American dream, underpinned by a person's right to the pursuit of life, liberty and happiness.



Related: Is the American Dream Dead?'The rent is too damn high!'It's no secret that the cost of living in America has been exorbitant for quite a while now, and the pace at which this has been increasing is historic. In 2021, we saw YoY inflation jump from 1.4% in 2020 to a blistering 7% — the steepest increase in YoY inflation since 1950, when we saw a delta of 8%. A year later, 2022 YoY inflation held strong at 6.5%, signaling a slight improvement. Concurrently, house prices increased by a record 16.9% in 2021.


To put things into perspective at a micro level, the price of eggs rose a staggering 60% in 2022. Considering the rising cost of basic necessities, a reflected increase in wages would be expected. However, little evidence points to any impending meaningful increases, with wage growth holding relatively steady between 5 and 5.5% since the beginning of 2021.Related: The Cheapest States To Live in 2023'Just put it on my card'To make ends meet, Americans are now more than ever electing to shift their expenses to credit cards and other lines of credit. American households currently hold $11.67 trillion in debt — a 25% increase from the $9.31 trillion they held before COVID-19. While inflation certainly contributes to the rapid rise of this number, inflation within itself isn't the most concerning piece of data when analyzing the financial health of the average American.Younger generations, millennials in particular, are struggling to buy homes despite taking on this debt. In fact, the median age for homebuyers in America today is about 47 years of age, eight years older than the median age prior to the financial crisis. To add salt to this wound, the average American currently has just $5,300 in savings, solidifying that this picture will likely worsen before it gets any better.


Related: Is the American Dream Attainable?The secret behind true wealth creationWe're in a transitionary period, teetering on the edge of a new digital economy. With this, we've witnessed quick, lucrative returns when trading stocks or cryptocurrencies, compared with returns on property ownership. This makes it more effective to chase 10 to 100x returns in capital markets instead of buying your first home, and although this might seem intuitive on the surface, this only applies to a certain demographic.Suppose you're a Wall Streeter or a software engineer at a leading technology company in a major city like New York or San Francisco. Given the entry point to the housing market is grossly higher than that of an individual living in Des Moines, the capital required to have any skin in the game is a barrier to entry within itself. Sure, you could buy a property in another city, but the cost, both monetarily and operationally, of having real estate that isn't yours in combination with your own expenses is a tall order. You might have to sacrifice a few thousand dollars on rent by not owning property, but your net income in this scenario is best spent building a diversified portfolio of non-real estate assets.In an alternate scenario, where someone holds a modest job — making an honest living like the vast majority of Americans — and resides in an affordable city, one's dollars are best spent investing in the property they live in, given that their entry point is likely accessible. Buying a house is the only investment you can easily pull off with 90+% leverage, meaning your upfront investment costs are subsidized. Conversely, buying stocks requires you to front 100% at the time of investment. What's more, the two-way volatility of the stock market is far harder to track compared to the housing market, which, for the past few decades, has generally moved upwards more consistently. You can certainly buy stocks, but due to the availability of leverage, assuming you have access to credit, real estate can more likely yield higher returns off of a small investment.


In contemporary society, the level of difficulty in achieving the American dream has skyrocketed. This picture-perfect life is visually synonymous with happily married couples with two children, a beautiful home and a white picket fence. However, the reality of this is vastly different. The latest numbers suggest people are no longer getting married, buying homes or having children nearly as much as in previous generations. Wealth disparity is at an all-time high, and divisions continue growing. The American dream is dead.Why they want you to believe the dreamWhile the vast majority of Americans are feeling the pain of the Federal Reserve's tight monetary policy, the nation's elite are not. Elon Musk lost over $200 billion in net worth to kick off this year, yet he is still one of the wealthiest people ever to live. After a certain point, more money does little to change your quality of life.In capitalist regimes, the rich remain rich because a willing middle class submits to their ideals. The rich own the credit card companies that the poor borrow from. The rich own the banks that pay out fractions of a percent in yield while making enormous profits via capital markets activities. The rich are also friends and lobbyists of the lawmakers that determine the fate of the majority in this country. The American dream wasn't designed to make you rich; it's a narrative spun by a coterie comprised of the nation's elite. It's a strategic and intricate device crafted to keep you where you are. It's a donkey and carrot model built to serve the system. While you're too busy chasing financial freedom through hard work and dedication, the American dream is adding more weight to your saddlebags.

50,NFTs Are Finally on TV — Here's What to Expect,"Feb 28, 2023",Jonny Caplan,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/nfts-are-finally-on-tv-heres-what-to-expect/444347,"
If someone told me in the 80s or 90s that playing Top Trumps, trading baseball cards or collecting old comics in plastic wrap would be replaced by digital collectibles that you can trade for serious money anywhere in the world in an instant, I would have laughed at them. Some people still laugh at this today.Sales of nonfungible tokens hit $17 billion in 2021, according to a report from Nonfungible.com, per CNBC.Like it or lump it, digital assets are here to stay. Major tech corporations such as Meta and Microsoft have already invested billions into the space. Currently, estimates suggest that less than 5% of the global population transacts using digital currencies — and that number is much smaller for digital assets such as NFTs and Metaverse properties.



So how do you entice the remaining 98% of the population? How do digital assets, NFTs and the metaverse go viral? How does mass global adoption take its course? These were all issues I was grappling with, as no doubt many others who found enlightenment in the Web3 space were.When I looked around to see what the world was saying about Web3, I found a lot of media chatter about financial pros and cons, elaborate crypto scams and unfriendly technology. Much of the coverage, in my humble (yet educated) opinion, totally missed the most important elements and benefits of this new market.


Opportunity, creativity, innovation, education, independence, unity, synergy, transparency, adaptability, interoperability, freedom, respect, privacy and so much more.It took me two years down the rabbit hole to truly understand the Web3 arena, which no one can say they fully understand, as it's continually evolving at the speed of light. But with enough time, effort and the ability to learn fast in a brand new and underdeveloped space, it is possible to get a good sense of what's going on and find direction, opportunity and community and both give and receive immense enlightenment.Most people don't have the luxury to spend two years researching in uncharted waters just to see if it's the right direction for them, nor would they instinctively walk into audio apps such as Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces to learn new things and ask questions.The truth is that the barrier to entry appears high and confusing, so it's naturally difficult for the mass market to organically step into this exciting and fast-evolving market. Although at first, it might appear daunting, operating in Web3 is quite easy once you know how. The real barrier to entry is the information gap, and that's where I had my eureka moment.


In 2017 I co-founded Tech Talk Media (TTM) and for the past six years, I have been creating, producing and directing cutting-edge TV series and documentaries for television and streaming services, including Amazon, Discovery, Disney, Apple TV, Roku, Virgin Media and many others in more than 100 countries.Our company's productions bridge the information gap in markets such as AI, space travel, cannabis, sustainability and robotics and identify emerging and exceptional individuals, technologies and brands.Based on the success of the TTM productions, I knew how powerful sharing new information via television can be. So instead of taking a well-earned sabbatical after delivering The Rise of A.I. and Inside NASA's Innovations to Discovery and Amazon, I turned my attention to producing a much-needed user-friendly, informative yet highly engaging documentary series on NFTs, crypto and the metaverse to enlighten millions globally on the digital realm.At the start of 2021, TTM registered its 14th production NFTme, and after completing filming across four continents in more than a dozen locations and interviewing 50 incredible guests, NFTme season one, compromising of six info-packed episodes on the digital revolution, premiered in the U.S. on Amazon Prime on December 24.


News of the launch of the show with Amazon broke in the days before release, with more than 50 international publications covering the series. NFTme's official Twitter Spaces launch party had more than 5,000 attendees.Needless to say, the market excitement was vast and viral, which had been anticipated somewhat. The reach of the series was limited to broadcast with Amazon in the U.S. and UK initially, with several new broadcast deals rolling to more regions and networks in 2023.It still frustrated me considerably that the entire world didn't have immediate access to this pertinent and elevating information about the Web3 space, which I have personally seen change lives for the better in some of the darkest corners of the planet.Although it's received a negative stigma in the media, largely due to incomprehensive reporting or huge corruption scandals such as the FTX saga, on the whole, the benefits of this technology and market can be hugely positive and uplifting.


It was therefore imperative to me to broadcast NFTme to a global audience as fast as possible and bridge the information gap, enabling the world to adopt Web3 faster. Towards the end of 2022, I met an old friend Alexander Newton, who is a co-founder of the new Web3 platform and technology MovieKey, which provides independent producers direct Digital Rights Managed (DRM) streaming worldwide, connected via a MovieKey NFT, which is effectively a digital Blu-Ray and is the MovieKey to watch, transfer or sell a movie or TV series to another person.It's a revolutionary technology for the entertainment business that outshines any former version of a Blu-Ray or DVD where the viewer owned a copy.""Our aim is to help Hollywood evolve into Web3 in a synergistic, fast and efficient manner, providing like-for-like DRM streaming, along with worldwide access without any restriction and direct compensation in real time to producers, investors, cast and crew,"" Newton says.After hearing about MovieKey, I realized immediately this was the perfect solution for NFTme, providing lightning-fast broadcast to the entire planet without payment or regional restrictions, with many additional benefits from the ownership of the NFTs, and giving us direct connectivity to our viewers eternally.


By the end of January 2023, NFTme released on MovieKey's platform with direct streaming and viewing access from the NFTme website, providing the viewership of the production to billions globally and reducing all barriers to entry. MovieKey enabled us to broadcast NFTme globally in record time, fulfilling streaming in 195 countries, loaded with superior payment options via credit card or USDC with a Solana Wallet, which is also a first of its kind in the entertainment space.Due to the continued success and impact of TTM productions internationally and NFTme's popularity to date, and with broadcast having only been available in the U.S. and UK to begin with, we did not doubt the global effect and positive impact that has been sparked by opening worldwide streaming to the masses so fast.Walking into the NFT and Web3 space two years ago, I never expected to adapt my way of thinking, meet so many amazing people, learn so much and find such an abundance of innovation and opportunity. But my experience has been mesmerizing and life-changing and is still producing fruits.I hope that everyone on the planet can find the same opportunity that I found in this space, and now with the world's eyes on NFTme season one, that dream is one step closer to reality.


To learn more about NFTs, crypto, the metaverse and all the excitement in the digital realm, watch NFTme season one now on Amazon Prime in the UK and U.S. or MovieKey globally.

51,The Pros and Cons of Big Brands Launching Web3 Projects,"Feb 27, 2023",Ariel Shapira,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/the-pros-and-cons-of-big-brands-launching-web3-projects/445864,"
If you've been watching blockchain news, you likely saw the troubling figure that Web3 startup funding fell 74% in 2022. Yet megabrands such as Starbucks, Mastercard and Nike, all launching Web3 or Metaverse projects this year paints a conflicting image of Web3's current status and future development.This may seem like deja-vu from the big-brand NFT craze in 2021 and early 2022, but these projects seem to be much more grounded in providing tangible value instead of manufacturing exclusivity. Major mainstream companies clearly see value in certain aspects of Web3, but with larger infrastructure still a work in progress, is this grand re-entry premature?Related: 4 Things to Consider Before Investing in Web3



Big brand benevolenceLarge companies debuting and re-entering Web3 benefit the space by granting an undeniable cachet to the industry as a whole. Where blockchain-based developments have often been marked as gimmicks or marketing ploys, lower-profile launches show that Web3 technology can function with less fanfare by putting concrete user benefits at the forefront of product launches.A stamp of approval from companies outside the blockchain realm, and even the tech bubble, can solidify which Web3 use cases are viable. Gamer outrage drove gaming companies to backpedal on NFT integrations seriously, but we've seen virtually no public backlash to Starbucks transitioning its already incredibly successful rewards program to an NFT-based framework. Yes, it is essentially the same technology, but utilized in a way that enhances a service that non-crypto users already love instead of a useless distraction from a main product.


Another key point of difference this time is the focus on the more tech and innovation-centered aspects of Web3, such as augmented reality (AR). Yes, Meta has long been the leader in this space with Oculus, but the details surrounding Apple launching its own ""mixed reality"" headset this spring gives a new level of prestige to AR progress. This news creates an even bigger splash considering Apple's reputation for observing tech developments from the sidelines until it's a clear win.If we're measuring Web3 progress by a constant influx of VC dollars, then the state of the industry doesn't look rosy in the short term. But the clear sustained interest from giants outside the industry shows that there is a solid curiosity and desire for Web3 technology. That being said, with big players entering the fold, there is room to question if Web3's skeletal infrastructure and limited interoperability are ready for it.Related: Venture Capitalists are Pouring Money into Web3. Here's Why.Too much too soon?A vote of confidence is vital for any industry's growth, especially for smaller projects looking to get off the ground and build something revolutionary. But outside support doesn't always guarantee that a platform or industry can succeed in the long term. Just look at the number of companies with an outpost in the primordial Metaverse project Second Life.


Large-scale Metaverse infrastructures are still more of a sketch than a completed portrait. While big brand investment certainly fuels more frameworks to exist, it might not always have the best interests of a community at heart. What could end up happening is brands painting themselves into a corner, developing siloed Web3 worlds that only serve their customers and mimic the type of ""walled garden"" ecosystem that describes many internet platforms now.Companies that ignore the need for community-based frameworks do so to their detriment. Silicon Valley's infamous ""move fast and break things"" mentality somewhat backfired on Web3 projects that didn't realize you need an infrastructure to exist first before breaking it.By creating ecosystems that are not conducive to community growth, Web3 development and infrastructures become a black box, inaccessible to other projects or developers. This is where projects such as SendingNetwork, a software development kit (SDK) with tools that Web3 developers of all sizes can use to create community-centric platforms, step in to form an interconnected digital landscape. These sector-crossing initiatives are just as vital to creating a common Web3 foundation with projects trying to form the industry in its image.Related: They Say Web3 Is the Future of the Internet. But How?


Making sure Web3 infrastructures are solid before courting larger projects can also help secure their interest in the long term. Companies of a certain stature have no qualms about experimenting in a new, potentially revenue-driving space, only to retreat after one bad quarter or plateaued growth. We've seen this happen in the blockchain space before, so it would be wise not to retread this path.Ultimately, there are clear benefits and drawbacks to megabrands hauling Web3 back into the mainstream. Where certain companies can lend legitimacy to the Web3 space, it's important not to disregard the less glamorous yet vital strides smaller projects are taking to create common ground. Essentially, while brands invest in their projects, they should consider taking a big-picture approach to become fixtures in Web3 that bring in new communities outside their own corporatized space.

52,School Employee Charged After Secret Cryptocurrency Mining Operation Found in Crawlspace,"Feb 24, 2023",Steve Huff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/school-employee-charged-over-secret-crypto-mining-operation/446392,"
A former school employee in Cohasset, Massachusetts is facing criminal charges after investigators discovered a ""cryptocurrency mining operation"" underneath the building. According to the Cohasset Police Department, Nadeam Nahas, 39, is accused of fraudulent electricity use and vandalism. A warrant has been issued for his arrest after he failed to appear in court.Boston's Fox 25 reports that Cohasset Middle/High School's director of facilities discovered the setup in December 2021 and alerted police to unusual wiring and ductwork in a small crawl space beneath the building. Detectives found that the school's electrical system had been unlawfully attached to a cryptocurrency mining operation.Crypto mining is the process that creates digital currencies like Bitcoin. Transactions are verified on a decentralized digital network called a blockchain. Rather than relying on central authorities like banks to manage transactions, the blockchain uses a distributed network of computers to validate and keep secure, transparent records of all transactions.The mining process requires computers to solve complex mathematical problems using special hardware and software. Miners compete to solve these problems, and the first miner to find a solution is rewarded with a new cryptocurrency and transaction fees from the verified transactions.The problem for the environment and the Cohasset school system (in this case) is that mining requires a lot of computational power. That means high electricity usage, which generates a lot of heat. Miners in the above-board operations must invest in specialized equipment and pay for those high electricity costs.After consulting with the town's IT director, investigators and U.S. Coast Guard Investigative Service members, as well as the Department of Homeland Security removed the equipment for forensic examination.



After what the Globe reported was a three-month investigation, police identified Nadeam Nahas as their suspect. A former Cohasset assistant facilities chief, Nahas had resigned as a town employee in early 2022.

53,3 Tips for Taking an Organization From Web2 to Web3 in 2023,"Feb 23, 2023",Bryan Ritchie,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-take-an-organization-from-web2-to-web3-in-2023/444764,"
After years of serving as a hotspot for early technology adopters and innovators, Web3 is finally receiving the attention it deserves. From Big Tech to traditional enterprises and even government institutions, the advancement of blockchain technology is undeniable.While this innovation remains complex, blockchain has shown that it can serve as highly secure, transparent and reliable infrastructure for countless applications. For example, as the U.S. Air Force works on tokenizing components of its supply chain and budget, FIFA even released an exclusive NFT series during its 2022 World Cup.However, as a growing number of traditional organizations line up to explore Web3, it's clear the transition isn't always easy. Efforts to track groceries using blockchain have progressed more slowly than expected, while others have given up due to the high costs associated with developing blockchain applications from scratch.



Despite these setbacks, it's important to note that organizations can mitigate the risks of experimenting with Web3 by structuring plans around a few core considerations.Related: Web 3.0 Is Coming, and Here's What That Really Means for You


Selecting the right strategyBlockchain has numerous applications that help optimize workflows and visibility across trustless systems. Companies can leverage blockchain to improve internal processes, such as budgeting, supply chain management, manufacturing and auditing — or they can utilize the technology to communicate with consumers and build a fanbase. These processes often require enterprise-grade solutions and thus are usually separated from public use of blockchain.Getting started with blockchain isn't always easy, requiring several critical decisions before development can begin. For example, companies must think about which specific use cases blockchain can offer to their organization, what data privacy and protection requirements they need to consider (which can help determine whether a public or private blockchain is necessary), what data needs to be stored on chain, as well as their current cloud and node infrastructure, among other decisions. These considerations must also include how to scale or adapt, accommodating an organization's future needs.Not all infrastructures are equalPreviously, most Web3 applications were built on Ethereum, the world's first smart contract platform. But this dynamic has changed dramatically since 2017, with an abundance of options emerging that allow organizations to successfully connect to the new internet era.With access to multiple options, choosing the right infrastructure is critical to ensuring compatibility with current systems and regulations, as well as future endeavors. Fortunately, unlike a few years ago, organizations can now select a protocol that perfectly fits their needs.


For example, decision-makers can choose between public, private and even hybrid blockchains. Public blockchains, such as Ethereum, commonly feature high transaction volumes, are used by a huge variety of projects and are popular amongst consumers. On the flip side, they're often quite expensive to use and lack privacy. As a result, public blockchains are best suited to consumer-focused projects like NFT markets and gaming.Private or permissioned blockchains, like Hyperledger Besu, perform as closed databases, allowing only select members to create and view transactions, smart contracts and nodes. These systems are best for internal applications or pilot projects.Hybrid blockchains, on the other hand, provide the best of both worlds. Polygon, for instance, is a relatively inexpensive public blockchain platform that integrates with Ethereum at significantly reduced fees, while also providing access to private environments via Polygon Edge.Another option is to choose a solution that simplifies building with blockchain by delivering exclusive tools, templates and sandboxes to build enterprise-grade blockchain applications. SIMBA Chain, for example, auto-generates APIs that support private, public or hybrid deployments. The powerful platform also supports a structured data feature that generates valuable business intelligence insights while allowing organizations to migrate between supported blockchain protocols with ease.


Perhaps most importantly, these platforms can significantly cut developing costs, shorten timelines and utilize proven infrastructure, ensuring a high level of reliability and security.Related: Web3.0: The Next Big Thing?The path to Web3 successWeb3 has the potential to significantly improve key processes in many organizations, but it's also clear that not every enterprise has the technical resources and talent to make an ambitious project successful.When Meta (then Facebook) announced its plan for a digital currency called Libra, the company went from having no blockchain connection to launching its own cryptocurrency. Although hundreds of organizations have launched their own cryptocurrencies over the years, it appears Facebook's initiative failed to receive the time, resources and preparation it needed to thrive. As an unnamed government official told Financial Times, the company ""spent years trying to reverse engineer their project to fix all of its faults. But they could never fix being linked to Facebook. It was their original sin.""


In comparison to such ill-fated projects, the U.S. government has been successfully expanding its blockchain applications across the Department of Defense (DoD). One of the U.S. Air Force's (USAF's) ventures into blockchain started with a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract in 2021, which tasked SIMBA Chain with developing a Web3 solution to manufacture, test and deploy 3-D printed replacement parts for aircraft and other weaponry on the battlefield. Following this successful implementation, the USAF has slowly expanded its blockchain projects in conjunction with other U.S. agencies, such as the U.S. Space Force.One step at a timeGiven the challenges associated with Web3 development, it's critical that organizations and governments take the time to learn blockchain fundamentals and weigh the opportunities and costs of each initiative. This practice is particularly important for large enterprises that already have well-oiled operations and those that deal with considerable public interest.Taking a step back to thoroughly consider specific solutions and their requirements, leveraging the right technology solutions to simplify the building process and relying on experts to help complete the job, are the three core pillars of virtually every successful blockchain project — and thus the key to rewarding investments and a solid reputation.Related: The Ultimate Guide to Navigating Web3 for Non-Tech Founders

54,7 Trends Crypto PR Professionals Should Be Aware of in 2023,"Feb 23, 2023",Valeriya Minaeva,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/7-trends-crypto-pr-professionals-should-know-for2023/444766,"
The crypto industry seeks to repair the damage of a dreadful year and return to first principles. Meanwhile, the wider world has been decentralizing, Web3 emerging, resulting in new avenues and opportunities for all PR. The only thing certain is uncertainty — but certainly, some things are already suggesting themselves. So, here are a few trends that crypto public relations professionals should be aware of this year.1. Increasing quality in journalism and audience targetingThe quality of journalism covering the crypto industry has greatly improved in recent years. Journalists from such outlets as The Financial Times, Bloomberg and Forbes have moved across from traditional finance to cover the space. With this increase in quality, the days of indiscriminate pay-to-play promotion are over. PR must now skillfully build a narrative, emphasizing engagement with, and relevance to, the target audience.In the wider world of PR, there is likewise an increasing focus on quality over quantity. Instead of a scattergun approach, publicists must increasingly pitch and produce stories that are tailored to their clients' products and demographics. This includes also crafting output to catch the attention of specific reporters.



Crypto PR needs to keep pace with the upsurge in quality, specifically around communication around technological innovation. Many projects are so focused on driving innovation that they can easily bamboozle the public. PR should bridge the gap, simplify the message and create the educative materials to match. The goal is to deliver the story to mass audiences in ways that can be easily digested, holding back on some of the bleeding edge details.Related: What's Hot and What's Not in Public Relations for 2023


2. Social consciousness continues to grow in importanceThe demonstration of social values has never been more important. According to recent research, the majority of consumers (70%) believe it's important for brands to take a public stand on social and political issues.In the crypto space, this means projects will want to put distance between themselves and the negative values associated with industry setbacks of the prior year, such as the collapses of FTX, Terra Luna, Celsius and 3AC. Messaging will focus on increasing transparency and returning to the foundational principles of blockchain itself. The aim is to repair the reputation of the space as a whole and build trust.It is a time to develop relationships with journalists and help them to navigate the evolving landscape. A key message to communicate is how the industry has learned its lessons — and for individual projects and companies, to clearly explain how differently they operate and deal with client funds compared with the failed projects of the previous year.3. Decentralization in mediaTraditional media, the arena of PR for more than a century, continues to shrivel, with its operations almost entirely migrated online. But the online environment itself is also developing quickly. The integration and amplification of news through social channels are expected to strengthen throughout the year. Facebook, Instagram and Twitter remain dominant, but not as before. TikTok has become a force, although, in the U.S., there are questions over its privacy policies and ties to China, with the potential for a full ban possible.


No single platform is dominant, so the utilization of several is necessary. Twitter and LinkedIn will continue to be efficient ways for subject matter experts to reach the media. Despite recent complaints of toxicity on Twitter, it remains the best way to break news and timely information.Related: 10 PR Trends That Will Explode Your Brand in 20234. Independent journalists, newsletters and SubstackIn recent years, there has been a growing break-out of journalists from media outlets into their own independent channels. Most notable is the phenomenon of newsletter publication on platforms such as Substack.This trend emphasizes for PR professionals the importance of fostering relationships with specific journalists, rather than outlets. In a time of declining revenues for traditional media entities, along with the viability of earning income for independent journalists, this trend looks set to continue.


5. PodcastingPodcasting is already a well-established channel of independent publishing. In the U.S., 130.5 million people listen to podcasts on a monthly basis. PR cannot afford to ignore this vertical. While some podcasts have only niche appeal, they deliver a highly engaged audience. Other podcasts can reach millions.These online newsletters and podcasts can also become another channel of owned media for companies. Owned media has never been more important in the PR world.6. InfluencersInfluencer marketing spend is projected to grow 23.4% and 15.9% respectively in 2023 and 2024. With the unpredictable dynamics of the shifting media and social media landscape, investing in individuals and personalities with audiences becomes even more attractive.Crypto projects often possess their own potential ""influencers,"" the core team itself. It's important for PR campaigns to not only tell the story of the project but that of the team itself, especially the founder's story. This will entail such details as their background, education and vision. It might very well be the most valuable story to be told.


Much more than abstract technological concepts or brand names, people trust people, and people buy from people. Such interesting and inspiring personalities can be deployed via thought leadership pieces, media quotes, podcast and event appearances, and so on. In this way, the brand can be built outwards from a founder and team and from owned media to earned media.Related: 5 Things You Should Know About Public Relations for Blockchain Projects7. Web3 — ""The future of the internet"" and PRWhat we are seeing with the proliferation of decentralization is also all part of the arrival of Web3. The job of PR is to build a relationship with the audience and users, and in the realm of Web3, the informational flow is much more reciprocal.Proactive publicists in 2023 will be collecting more data and listening to signals from target audiences, rather than simply transmitting messages at them. This means having conversations via social media and community outreach channels.


Quantifying business impact from PR is also becoming easier. In addition to monthly unique visitors, ad impressions and so on, clients increasingly seek to know how their PR efforts are achieving results, tracked over time. Thanks to improving analytics tools, PR impact is becoming easier to quantify.Bearing in mind the technology-driven nature of changes to the overall PR landscape, crypto PR pros should (and must) ride the edge of innovation in 2023. Communication in every direction.

""Audentis Fortuna iuvat."" The ancient Latin phrase translates as fortune favors the bold.It's a mantra that has survived the test of time for a reason. The world sees those who ask for forgiveness rather than permission as ""lucky"" when really, they're seeing the results of proactive and calculated efforts.Related: Why Entrepreneurship Favors the Bold



In ancient Rome, boldness involved battle-field initiative and political savvy. In the 21st century, some of the boldest moves take place in an economic setting. For businesses looking to maintain their bravery and willingness to take calculated risks in the turbulent year ahead, they should prioritize one innovative area: the metaverse.Here's why.


The metaverse is the front edge of innovationInnovation is exciting, but it's also unpredictable. It isn't easy to see where an industry or market sector will go over time, especially in an era dominated by the continual evolution and application of new technologies.This can challenge companies trying to maintain an edge over their competitors and remain at the forefront of their industries. Investments in a promising area like the metaverse set a brand up to discover value in the present while also positioning itself to adapt to future change.It's a creative balance that Jeff Wong, Global Chief Innovation Officer at EY, is intimately familiar with. ""We need to understand the state of the art technology,"" Wong says, ""but the only way we knew how to do that was to be on the front edge of what's possible.""Wong adds that this isn't easy, nor is it a clean process, ""That's what I mean by 'get your hands dirty.' You have to understand what the state of the art is for your industry, for your company. Otherwise you risk being disrupted.""


This future is founded in tech, like the application of a new tool such as the metaverse.Related: Now that Crypto Has Crashed, What's Next for The Metaverse?Even in a dampened economy, the metaverse has momentum""Entering the metaverse"" isn't a call to recklessly throw your business's resources at future potential. Mark Zuckerberg has already proved the foolishness of that kind of foolhardy abandon in the past few years.The Facebook-founding owner of Meta had to make a major course correction in 2022 when he laid off thousands of employees in a single move. The reasons for this sudden reduction in the tech giant's workforce were manifold, but Zuckerberg himself took responsibility for the about-face, detailing that ""I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.""


Related: The Upside Of Downturns For EntrepreneursIt's no secret that many of those investments revolved around Meta's shift toward the metaverse (from which it gets its name). And even in the face of devastating news, Zuckerberg indirectly pointed to the potential of the metaverse.Later in the same statement referenced above, the Meta-in-chief added that ""We've shifted more of our resources onto a smaller number of high priority growth areas,"" adding that this includes ""our AI discovery engine, our ads and business platforms, and our long-term vision for the metaverse.""So, even in its devastatingly reduced state, Meta is still investing in the future of the metaverse. Even in an economy on the ropes and a reeling tech sector, Zuckerberg is still pursuing this underdeveloped area of virtual reality.


Why? Because despite the cloudiness of the present, the world is moving that way. One way or another, the metaverse will be part of the future. Those who want to seize the opportunities that it presents need to be invested and pay attention when they appear.Enter the metaverse in 2023… with discretionAs a final note, the metaverse may already be off to the races …but it hasn't arrived quite yet. It's very much so at its genesis, and as such, investors must be cautious.When you see a suggestion like investing in the metaverse in 2023, make sure that you apply it thoughtfully. Don't go out and drop a chunk of change on metaverse property without thinking things through. Don't shift your internal operations to be metaverse dependent without considering the longevity and adaptability of the tools and software you use.The metaverse is here to stay. But there are still countless variables at play. If your company is interested in staying at the forefront of its industry, you should be investigating how the metaverse will impact innovation, specifically within those boundaries. From there, use that information to develop an investment strategy that balances boldness and risk as you look for ways to guide your enterprise into the metaverse in the year ahead.

How much will bitcoin or any altcoin cost in 2023? Great question. Even professional traders cannot foresee the price of crypto due to multiple impact factors. But as an investor, I want to reflect on something else. Are those who have already buried the crypt right, or is last year's market crash not the end?Related: Now that Crypto Has Crashed, What's Next for The Metaverse?Bugatti for bitcoin — failedIn February 2021, the capitalization of bitcoin exceeded $1 trillion for the first time. The first cryptocurrency grew by 900% in a year and traded for $54,000 per coin.



Despite the record price, there was no release from investors. For example, the Square payment service, owned by Jack Dorsey, then bought over three thousand bitcoins.Amid the rising bitcoin price, in March 2021, the founder of the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange, Jesse Powell, made a sensational forecast: by the end of 2022, one bitcoin can buy a Lamborghini, and in 2023, a Bugatti.


The forecast failed: today, you can only buy a Kia Rio or a Mitsubishi Mirage for a bitcoin. And this is after the boom of ETFs, NFTs, DeFi and stablecoins. So what went wrong?Related: Everything You Need to Know About NFTs and CryptocurrencyHigh-interest rates — doneIn 2022, the growth rates of blockchain technology remained high. For example, we witnessed the Ethereum protocol modernization: now, instead of the Proof-of-work algorithm, the blockchain uses Proof-of-stake. After the change, the network will consume 99.95% less energy.However, this event was overshadowed by others — the bankruptcies of the Terra project, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network crypto banks, Three Arrows Capital hedge fund, BlockFi and FTX exchanges.


Also, inflation in the US reached 7% in 2022, just as in the early 1980s. To curb inflation, the Federal Reserve raised rates seven times a year. The base rate is between 4.25% and 4.5%, the highest mark in 15 years.The Fed's policy affected the value of risky assets, namely stocks and crypto. The dollar strengthens as interest rates rise, but risky assets fall. Due to this and the bankruptcy of key crypto projects, the cryptocurrency market collapsed. The media again started talking about the onset of crypto winter — a decrease in the cost of all coins and a long bearish trend.But I disagree that due to the fall (over the past year, according to the Coinmarketcap charts, market capitalization has more than halved - from $2 trillion to $800 billion), this segment can be put to rest.Regarding crypto, price fluctuations are the last thing you should focus on. I look at less obvious factors to understand the market prospects.


Venture capital impactThe activity of venture capitalists decreased significantly in late 2022. This information can make beginners panic, but let's read the news more carefully.How did the timing of entry into projects change the enthusiasm of investors? Seed and early-stage crypto startups received larger checks in 2022. Investors are buying up young startups, meaning the game is not over, and funds will be poured into the sector.Besides, the cryptocurrency market is only developing. You can fail in school but enter college on the first try. So the failure of 2022 is not a sentence, but only growing pains.Related: Decentralized Venture Capital Will Transform Startup Investing Forever


Development of Web3Web3 is a new blockchain-based decentralized and tokenized incarnation of the internet. It is both financial applications and NFTs. But the most dynamic segment of Web3 is blockchain games.The crypto winter did not affect the growth of gaming programs based on distributed ledger technology: in 2022, the number of transactions in gaming blockchains increased by 94%.It is such a strong trend that only full-on electricity cuts across the planet can bring it down. So the entire blockchain sector will become less speculative and more practice-oriented.Return of NFTsAfter COVID-19, even people far from business learned that the most affected sectors actively recovered after the crisis. This is precisely what should happen with the NFT segment.


Over 2022, it decreased by 97%. But the fall is not a trend — unlike the arrival of big players in this market. NFTs were launched as part of a loyalty program by the giant Starbucks. By year's end, the list of majors that launched NFTs was replenished with Reddit, Meta, Nike, Disney and Coca-Cola.All these companies invested in developing their own projects based on Web3 and will continue to develop them in 2023. My guess, other companies will pick up the trend, so the NFT market revival is only a matter of time.Related: 5 Ways to Maintain and Expand Your Wealth During the Cryptocurrency DipAccumulation trendIn December 2013, on the Bitcointalk forum, a user, GameKyuubi wrote a post with a typo in the title - ""I AM HODLING."" He criticized traders who use bitcoin to get rich, contrasting their position with his own — to keep the crypto even when market signals indicate a need to get rid of the asset.


The term HODL became a meme, and the change in the number of hodlers became the data for analytical platforms to evaluate the development of the industry.New statistics from Glassnode demonstrate a sharp increase in the accumulation addresses in the Bitcoin blockchain. These hodler wallets have received at least two transfers in the past seven years. Yet, funds were never withdrawn from these addresses.The number of such wallets reached almost 800,000 — increasing by 18% during the year. The figures show that the number of committed users of the service is growing.Hodlers don't make money off bitcoin. They believe in its potential as a universal means of payment. And user growth is a significant factor in the global adoption of bitcoin. I am sure that while some faithfully accumulate crypto and those who develop the blockchain and projects based on it, seasonal and annual jumps are just ripples in a pond. The most exciting things happen in the depths.

2022 was an interesting year for NFTs (non-fungible tokens), to say the least. This was the year that saw public knowledge of NFTs go beyond Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to the field of digital collectibles, such as art and photographs.But while buying art and other collectibles may be getting most of the attention from the general public, they result in some of the more practical (and profitable) business applications getting overlooked. In reality, NFTs can have a variety of practical applications that help organizations achieve their existing business goals.First things first: How do NFTs work?NFTs are is cryptographic assets that are based on blockchain technology. The non-fungible aspect is important, as it gives NFTs distinctive properties that mean they cannot be replaced or replicated. They are unique, and can't be manipulated or forged. Most often, we see NFTs in connection with digital assets, such as art, sports cards, games and other collectibles, where the blockchain provides a certificate of authenticity.



NFTs can be bought and sold on the market, with pricing based on market demand, just like a physical product. However, the unique data that is part of the NFT makes it easy to validate ownership and verify the authenticity of the token.NFTs are also used to represent ownership details, memberships and more — and these varied use cases have proven key to business applications.Related: Here's a Beginner's Guide to Crypto, NFTs, and the MetaverseLinking digital tokens to physical benefitsOne key to generating business growth via NFTs is linking the tokens to a physical, real-world product or experience. As the report Brands in Web3 Q3 2022 by NFT Tech highlights, fashion brand Tiffany & Co. was able to turn NFTs into a set of exclusive physical goods. The company partnered with CryptoPunks to create an exclusive line of 250 ""NFTiffs"" pendants. Priced for 30 ETH (roughly $50,000 at the time), the unique pendants sold out in 22 minutes.Another example comes from the Australian Open. In 2022, the Australian Open launched a highly successful metaverse initiative of minting AO Art Ball NFTs that linked to data from live matches. This was paired with virtually hosting the Australian Open in a 3D virtual reality platform to provide an unprecedented level of access to one of tennis's largest events.While the initial launch was successful in and of itself, the Australian Open's commitment to this NFT initiative is poised to be even greater in 2023, with the announcement that holders of each Art Ball NFT will receive two complimentary seven-day Ground Passes to AO23's finals week. Art Ball holders also gain access to additional exclusive experiences, such as streams and viewing suites through the ""SuperSight"" fan experience and access to other United Cup matches.


With both Tiffany & Co. and the Australian Open, linking NFTs to real-world products or experiences proved to be a highly successful method for deepening relationships with their target audience.In addition, when NFTs are used in this way, they invite mass market participation, turning fans into financially-incentivized brand ambassadors who enjoy a high level of utility — and of course, can seamlessly trade their digital assets for real-world cash.Related: Putting the Intangible Into Your NFT ProjectReaching new demographicsNFTs don't just help brands strengthen relationships with their existing customers — quite often, they can prove key to reaching a new audience entirely.


Case in point: For quite some time, clothing brand Polo Ralph Lauren has seen its primary customer base largely concentrated among older adults, while younger demographics like millennials and Gen Z have been less interested in the clothing brand.In 2021 and 2022, however, Ralph Lauren made a full-fledged commitment to digital initiatives such as NFTs and the metaverse. These included launching a ""phygital"" fashion collection in Fortnite, as well as an exclusive digital clothing connection through the game Roblox.These digitally-focused efforts were a major success for the brand. As reported by Vogue Business, Polo Ralph Lauren saw its third-quarter revenue increase by 27% after the launch of its Roblox collection — with that growth largely driven by a 58% increase in the acquisition of new digital customers.In this case, strategic implementation of digital assets allowed Ralph Lauren to reach a younger target demographic in metaverse-style spaces where they would have the greatest appeal and potential impact.


When done right, NFT initiatives can help revive sales and reinvigorate a brand's image, making it more relevant and appealing in today's competitive market.Using NFTs wisely for your business goalsAs these examples illustrate, the potential use cases for NFTs go well beyond selling digital art. With a strategic approach, businesses can use NFTs to find new ways to engage with younger, more tech-oriented demographics. NFT-based projects can help position your company as an innovator at the forefront of disrupting the marketplace.That being said, any business investment in NFTs should be done strategically. Major NFT failures in 2022 garnered a lot of media attention, and should serve as a powerful reminder for businesses as they enter this space. All investments in NFT should be done with the interests of the end customer in mind.When you focus on how your target audience could realistically benefit from your use of NFTs, you will be able to identify strategies that have true staying power, and that will build greater rapport between your brand and its most tech-savvy customers.

When was the last time you looked at a work of art online and thought, even for a second, about what file type it was? Whether the image you see is a JPEG or GIF rarely matters to anyone except for professionals in the media industry, where file types have different properties, qualities and sizes. For the average content consumer, it doesn't matter at all.Now ask yourself: Why are NFTs any different?Of course, NFTs are different — but not in the way most people think. The mainstream understanding of NFTs is that they are overpriced JPEGs that speculators spent millions of dollars on during the pandemic's heyday. There's some truth to that. On the surface, the ongoing crypto winter appears to be justifying the alleged scam, as FTX filed for bankruptcy and once-skyrocketing bitcoin and NFT prices began nosediving.

60,"The FBI's Most Wanted 'Crypto Queen' Scammed Investors Out of $4 Billion. Now, 5 Years Later, a London Apartment Listing May Have Blown Her Cover.","Jan 30, 2023",Sam Silverman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/who-is-ruja-ignatova-the-fbis-most-wanted-crypto-queen/443924,"
Disgraced ""Crypto Queen"" Ruja Ignatova's time on the run may be coming to an end.Ignatova, 42, a German citizen born in Bulgaria, is a former crypto pioneer who vanished in October 2017 after over-promising high returns on her OneCoin crypto token in a $4 billion Ponzi Scheme. She's now facing several charges of fraud and has been on the run from the FBI for five years.Although she hasn't been seen since her disappearance, a new London apartment listing suggests she's alive and evading arrest.



Ignatova, the only woman on the FBI's most wanted list, was recently found to be connected to an £11 million [$13.6 million] penthouse apartment for sale in Kensington, England, thanks to a new rule change by the UK's Companies House, which acts similarly to the U.S's Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.The rule now requires properties purchased by companies to also list a beneficiary, and while it is believed Ignatova originally purchased the home under a shell company, a new court filing to the UK's financial regulators lists Ignatova as the ""beneficial owner"" of the property – inadvertently exposing her whereabouts.


Ignatova's connection to the home was first spotted by the host of ""The Missing Cryptoqueen"" podcast, Jamie Bartlett.""[The document] suggests she is still alive, and there are documents out there somewhere which contain vital clues as to her recent whereabouts,"" Bartlett told iNews.Since Ignatova's link to the home, which was listed on Knight Frank real estate website, was confirmed, the listing has been removed.Here's what to know about the disgraced ""Crypto Queen.""RELATED: Who Is FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried and What Did He Do? Everything You Need to Know About the Disgraced Crypto KingWho is Ruja Ignatova?Before Ruja Ignatova become one of 11 women to be on the FBI's most wanted list in its 72-year history, she was regarded as a rising star in the crypto industry.Ignatova was known for liking glitz and glamour, per CNN, and was revered for growing from her humble beginnings in Germany to success as a consultant and then a crypto entrepreneur.Together with her business partner Sebastian Greenwood, the pair convinced investors to back their OneCoin crypto token which they said would be more valuable than Bitcoin. However, authorities found that OneCoin defrauded investors out of $4 billion in one of the largest international fraud schemes of all time.


""OneCoins were entirely worthless … (Their) lies were designed with one goal, to get everyday people all over the world to part with their hard-earned money,"" U.S. prosecutors said, according to court documents.Furthermore, the court documents reveal that Ignatova and Greenwood intended to deceive their clients from the get-go, calling their own token a ""trashy coin"" and discussing an exit strategy in private emails.Their scheme imploded in 2016 when investors struggled to sell their OneCoins to recoup their investments, alerting the media and investigators to look into the business.Then in October 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice charged Ignatova with one count of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering, with a federal judge issuing a warrant for her arrest, court documents state.


But Ignatova fled on a flight from Sofia, Bulgaria, to Athens, Greece, just two weeks after the warrant was issued and she hasn't been seen since.The FBI has offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to her arrest. Additionally, they said: ""Ignatova is believed to travel with armed guards and/or associates. Ignatova may have had plastic surgery or otherwise altered her appearance.""The #FBI has named Ruja Ignatova to its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives List.

Taking advantage of the crypto frenzy at the time, investors gave them $4 billion between 2014 and 2016. However, OneCoin's value was manipulated by the company and it was never mined like other cryptocurrencies, despite telling investors otherwise, according to CNN.Once regulators uncovered the scheme and Ignatova vanished, she left her partners to deal with the fallout.Cofounder Sebastian Greenwood was arrested in July 2018. He's currently in jail after pleading guilty to wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and conspiracy to launder money. He is set to be sentenced in April.Ignatova's brother, Konstantin Ignatov, who was also a part of the business scheme, was arrested in March 2019 and is set to be sentenced in February after pleading guilty to wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering, and fraud charges.


Since the scandal unraveled, OneCoin has been shut down and its website is no longer active.RELATED: What Did Bernie Madoff Do?

61,Why 2023 Might Be The Year of the Crypto Underdog,"Jan 27, 2023",Ariel Shapira,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/why-2023-might-be-the-year-of-the-crypto-underdog/443065,"
The 2023 Super Bowl is just under a month away, and if you remember anything about last year's game, the sheer amount of multimillion-dollar crypto ads indicated that the industry was on the precipice of becoming mainstream. Suffice it to say, the rest of the year would not be so prosperous. Though it seems unlikely that we'll see more flashy, celebrity-filled ads for crypto platforms on our screens in February, that doesn't mean crypto is a dead industry in the slightest.Everyone likes to root for the underdog, but there are a few variables that investors, institutions, and entrepreneurs must consider before going full-speed ahead on any particular blockchain niche. Blockchain is in a much different position than it was a year ago, and external factors, such as incoming regulation and broader market trends, play a significant role in what projects will get or deserve substantial backing.Related: 5 Things to Expect from Crypto in 2023



A wunderkind is not enoughThis time last year, the crypto bull run was dominated by projects easily digestible by the public — think big exchanges, NFTs, Web3 and some DeFi. Typically, higher-profile projects were spearheaded by a savant-like leader, a mega-corporation with endless cash flow, or both.While a cult of personality can undoubtedly bring in new audiences and sell them on a product, the heightened attention becomes a double-edged sword once times get tough. Once the crypto winter came into full force, skeptics likely felt vindicated watching the more founder-centered dramatic downfalls.


But any entrepreneur knows that projects fizzling out don't necessarily dictate an entire industry's future. Now is an opportune time to get creative and look toward worthwhile crypto uses that have flown under the radar thus far, perhaps for all the wrong reasons. So if everyone has seemingly learned their lesson on investing in projects based on charisma (or lack thereof) alone, should we look to projects working in tandem with new tech developments?The general public's recent AI fascination driven by OpenAI's nearly miraculous generative AI model, ChatGPT, might be a signpost for crypto's next steps. Some startups are already banking on its potential to transform entire industries thanks to their fluency and competent prose. But despite AI's clear advancements and usability, it may not be ready for meaningful widespread implementation in crypto.Related: Microsoft Invests Billions in OpenAI, Creator of ChatGPTMost proposals for melding AI into crypto involve accessibility and fraud prevention. AI could help create a better user experience, while machine learning's propensity for patterns can flag unusual or risky transactions before they become catastrophic.


AI hasn't, so far, proven vital to industry-wide efforts to reign in and manage risk. Companies like Spool, for example, already create comprehensive DeFi tools for individual and institutional investors to build risk-assessed, diversified portfolios for DeFi returns easily.Fusing new tech with crypto platforms should be encouraged, but it can't be viewed as a safety net or substitute for due diligence on the part of the investor. And we certainly shouldn't be adding AI to products for the sake of adding AI.Playing by new rulesAfter a year or two of mostly superficial oversight, it appears governments are stepping back into being the parent in the room with crypto legislation. The next 12 months will likely build exponentially on 2022's regulatory developments from the European Union, Brazil and the UK, with the entire G20 committing to creating a policy consensus year at the end of the year.But the question of how to regulate crypto is no easier to navigate, and every country seems to have its interpretation of what it entails. Even the United States has its own competing priorities in moving legislation forward. Debates over how to classify digital assets with the SEC, mounting sanctions thanks to continued cybercrime, and a push to create its own central bank digital currency have put U.S. crypto policy in a deadlock.


Nonetheless, there's a clear signal that firmer regulation will play a much larger role than it did this time last year. Crypto purists might scoff at having regulators spoil the fun and insist that crypto can regulate itself, but the sheer amount of scandal and seedy developments don't point in their favor.If individual investors or smaller crypto VCs get scared off by having precise regulation and supervision after seeing the recklessness in the industry over the past two years, they should have never felt welcome in the first place. Transparent and decentralized blockchain projects have ways to self-govern — just look at any effective DAO. But setting clear guidelines could potentially woo back institutions and major VCs that slowed investment during the crypto winter.Plenty of blockchain-focused and crypto-native VCs have no issue staying close to the regulatory pulse and conducting due diligence to avoid the hype cycle. They're also unphased by the turbulent crypto market. For example, Digital Finance Group (DFG) is pushing full speed ahead with its steadfast support for projects it considers to be Web3 pioneers. One of the standout blockchains the firm supports, Polkadot, performed comparably well in 2022 despite market conditions, its Annual Polkadot Report showed.Trustworthy influencers and institutions imploring investors to do their own research may have had a point. And with a new playbook for crypto likely on the horizon, it may be time to internalize that lesson and re-evaluate what the blockchain industry should aspire to be.


We probably won't see crypto as a whole return to Super Bowl status any time soon. But a change in what projects and aspects of this industry investors and developers champion could help rebuild its reputation and operations. Instead of retreading old territory, it may be time to look at the crypto developments pushed to the sidelines. While they may be less glamorous, they could be the key to ensuring a blockchain-forward future.

Each day seems to carry with it a new, ominous headline propounding the imminent demise of cryptocurrency. The death of Bitcoin has been predicted more than 450 times as of this writing. And yet, it seems to have staying power: more than $23 billion of Bitcoin has changed hands in the last 24 hours. Seasoned crypto investors — and their detractors — have weathered ups and downs, and there are doubtlessly more to come. But with each crash (and subsequent boom), the war drum of federal regulation increases in fervor and proximity.In November, following the well-publicized collapse of FTX, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen chastised the crypto world in a threat that sent markets in a steep plunge: ""The recent failure of a major cryptocurrency exchange and the unfortunate impact that has resulted for holders and investors of crypto assets demonstrate the need for more effective oversight of cryptocurrency markets."" The specific areas of concern she identified included ""comingling of customer assets, lack of transparency and conflicts of interest,"" which she claimed ""was at the center of the crypto market stresses observed over the past week.""While a precise federal framework of crypto regulation has not yet been codified into law, she made it clear that the writing is on the wall: ""Where existing regulations apply, they must be enforced rigorously so that the same protections and principles apply to crypto assets and services. The federal government, including Congress, also needs to move quickly to fill the regulatory gaps the Biden Administration has identified.""

While navigating a tragedy, few people welcome a comment like, ""It was all for the best."" Too often we hear this pep talk from compassionate friends or family, as we quietly think to ourselves, They just don't understand what I'm going through.But do they? A recent investment scandal might offer some insights into why that cliché can be spot-on after all.Truth be told, there have been many bad eggs in the crypto space: The sheer fact that the technology was created to allow for anonymity created a breeding ground for hustlers and scammers. But over the last few months, the U.S. government (including the SEC) has finally been cracking down on Web3 crooks, with the first NFT indictment  — filed on June 1, 2022 by the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York and charging Nathanial Chastain of the NFT marketplace OpenSea with wire fraud and money laundering — and with an abundance of other rug-pulls currently being investigated by a variety of law enforcement agencies.

2022 was an important year for the crypto space. We will all remember the bankruptcies of major global companies: Luna, Celsius Network, FTX, BlockFi and others that left investors with massive losses. The bear market has dramatically affected the crypto economy and investors' portfolios.Just like in 2013 and 2017, the market moves in cycles. First, we had the crypto summer, where everybody was hyped about their profits and gains. Then came the crypto autumn, and investors started to see red in their portfolios. But investors' portfolios started bleeding when the crypto winter got underway, and even some big reliable companies went underwater.In this article, I want to focus on some of the most important lessons I have taken for myself and my company after living through one more winter of the crypto market.



Related: Will Crypto Make a Comeback in 2023?1. Money management strategies are everything2022 is the year of fallen legends. Companies believed to be reliable borrowers, like Alameda Research, borrowed funds without collateral and ultimately went bankrupt due to improper money management. On top of that, other standout names in the crypto space, such as Luna, Celsius Network, FTX, and BlockFi, also went bankrupt against all market expectations.


2022 showed that different approaches need to be used to track company assets, oversee their liquidity and provide collateral for obligations. The mistake many made was blindly placing faith in a company because of its size and reputation instead of analyzing the fundamentals.Related: How to Manage Your Money With Confidence2. Stay away from toxic assetsThe future market leaders are the companies who survived unscratched problems related to Luna, Celsius Network, FTX or BlockFi and do not hold toxic assets. These are the companies with the potential to launch new products and ideas.From personal experience, I can say that 2022 was when my company delved into exploring new directions. It proved that the standard earning tools on the market just recently have no future. So we chose to focus on developing new products that can fix the ongoing problems of the crypto market. I believe that doing this — answering a pain point of the sector and providing a reliable service to alleviate it — is a crucial step in maintaining your company's viability in tumultuous market conditions.


3. Watch out for tokenomicsWhen looking at a company, all performance indicators are important. What good is it to have great management and a business model if the tokenomics are not good? People are first and foremost investing in the token itself, making tokenomics an essential piece of providing a stable development.Bad tokenomics often gives valuable insight into whether the company's business model is sustainable over the long term. Look for projects with tokenomics designed to serve the investors, not the developers. Watch out for high inflation rates and other red flags, which are often signs of an unsustainable business model designed to enrich the very few.Related: 8 Smart Ways to Analyze Crypto Token Before Investing in It4. Don't follow the hypeThis year proves that the market is often wrong. During the crypto summer, many coins and companies grew on hype. Investors hopped on the train and followed the crowd ignoring the lack of solid fundamentals and prospects of future growth. However, when the bubble popped, their portfolio suffered.


Luna, for example. The company had $50 million in assets but still promised 20% interest payments in its own stablecoin currency. That meant $10 billion in payouts to people holding funds in its protocols. The business plan was too good to be true, but tons of people fell for it and lost everything when the stablecoin proved not to be that stable after all.Related: Is Crypto and NFTs a Passing Fad?5. Teamwork is essentialIn times of market turmoil, teamwork is more important than ever. The keyword is flexibility; the market is unpredictable, so it's the team's job to adapt to any changes rapidly.The market has very short business phases meaning that companies need to be highly flexible and able to adapt to new realities. Bear markets often make it impossible to plan too far ahead. Focus on what's in front of you, prioritize clients' objectives, predict what products the next phase of the market will be interested in, and prepare them in advance.


Furthermore, the bear market can also be a great time to generate revenue and offer products that alleviate investors' fears. Additionally, with the right money management skills, companies can alleviate clients' anxiety by investing their funds in discounted assets.Stay positive. The bear market will be over soonThe bear market is not easy, but staying optimistic is essential. Take a step back and realize that earning on the crypto market is a long-term game; that's the wealth-building secret.My opinion is based on analyzing past phases, where typically, the crypto winter lasts 4-6 months, then comes the spring. It will be essential for companies to enter with a big user base, good products and opportunities to scale up their own business.Companies need to pay attention to the costs and build teams out of people who believe in the market more than ever. Teams should have crypto enthusiasts that understand the market and products well. Having pros on the team is essential, so do not let them slip through your fingers.

65,Blockchain Technology: Overhyped or Underused? Here's What You Should Know.,"Jan 17, 2023",Steve Taplin,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/blockchain-technology-overhyped-or-underused/441905,"
With the recent collapse of FTX, investors now worry about the future of cryptocurrency. While some blame the technology, we should remember that people are corruptible, not blockchain. The ledger-based technology making cryptocurrency possible is as much a breakthrough today as it was yesterday. Unfortunately, crashes like FTX play into fears that blockchain is more hype than breakthrough. Will blockchain once and for all prove not very useful in the enterprise?When blockchain technology spawned a new way of thinking about money and creating wealth, many in the enterprise IT space began thinking about using blockchain technology to streamline business processes. For example, the global supply chain is still not working as well as it could. More than a decade later, enterprise adoption of blockchain technology is crawling at best and stalled across the board in many of the world's largest companies.Blockchain is an emerging technology, meaning its full potential and practical uses are still evolving. This creates hype as visionaries dream about using the technology to its full potential, usually long before everyone else sees its usefulness. This is the downside of emergent technology, as hype often masks reality.



Related: The Blockchain Is Everywhere: Here's How to Understand ItRemember the cloud?When cloud computing first came out, it was an emerging technology. Software developers scrambled to develop SaaS applications where people bought a software service instead of installing the software on each workstation. Two decades later, the endpoint for the evolution of cloud computing revealed itself to no fanfare. Cloud computing is behind the scenes and responsible for billions of data exchanges daily.


Everyone takes the cloud for granted today. But go back 20 years, and the same hype drove similar conversations about cloud computing. Indeed, go back half a century, and you will find hype about using computers in the enterprise. There was even excitement about driving cars instead of horses. The point is that the hype is part of the adoption process that all emergent technology must go through to become behind-the-scenes technology.Facts behind the hypeBlockchain technology and the movement of digital information across disparate locations are not exaggerated. Human civilization needs blockchain because it protects the process of moving digital data from one place to another in a physical realm people cannot see. Once a Bitcoin gets transferred, the record of that transfer does not change.What can change is the cybersecurity surrounding the transfer. Because software is a product of human creation, bugs will pop up from using the technology. Our society deals with this regularly. Consequently, there will be bugs; that is a fact.Another crucial point is that blockchain technology must use other technology with no attached hype — for example, securing cloud computing SaaS applications using Wi-Fi. If every other part of the information exchange is secure, working out the bugs is a process of elimination.


Related: How Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Can Revolutionize BusinessesTrailblazer vs. trail followerAlthough some technologists perceive blockchain as overhyped, what does that mean, and what should the enterprise do about it? Hype in the tech sphere is a cultural phenomenon driven by followers waiting for someone else to lead. Everyone knows blockchain is the future, but only some want to be trailblazers. Unfortunately, it does not help when a trailblazer fails. Enterprise leaders get worried and pull back.Provocatively, it collapses like FTX, which works to legitimize hype for emergent technology. Spectacular collapses tend to spur serious progress into making the technology live up to its hype. For the enterprise, the hype centers on supply chains as the world seeks a better way to manage global shipping.Making blockchain work for the enterpriseWalmart and other large retail businesses need blockchain technology or something like it, which is driving much of the hype. The global supply chain is not functioning as it could, so the enterprise needs blockchain much like the healthcare industry needs caregivers because of a worker shortage. In this light, overhype is a motivator for taking action or getting in line and waiting for the trailblazer.


The enterprise's decision-makers need motivational buy-in from software engineers with a trailblazer mindset. Moreover, the software applications must be heavily backed by robust security specifically designed to manage the movement of digital information from one point to another.Related: How Blockchain Can Make A Positive Impact On Global IssuesIncremental changeEnterprise adoption of blockchain is slow but not unexpected. Our modern society wants everything right now. If the digital revolution taught us anything, change is incremental. The best way to get comfortable using blockchain comes from using it in small test programs. Once these smaller programs work as a system, scale the operations together, then work the bugs out from there.Patience and hype need to get along better. However, trailblazers in the tech sphere must be patient or risk being victims of hype. Focus on small steps representing steps forward — for example, using an extensive global supply chain with only a tiny part controlled by blockchain. Once the blockchain-supported supply chain section runs without bugs, please step back and understand how it fits into the bigger supply chain. The process and setup systems needed for incremental change do not pay attention to hype.

66,S.E.C. Charges Winklevoss Twins' Crypto Companies With Offering Unregistered Securities,"Jan 13, 2023",Steve Huff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/sec-says-crypto-companies-offered-unregistered-securities/442860,"
On Thursday, the Securities and Exchange Commission (S.E.C.) charged Genesis Global Capital and Gemini Trust, run by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, with offering unregistered securities. According to a New York Times report, the ""Gemini Earn"" program promised investors would profit from high interest on deposits — but it was never registered with the agency.Genesis is part of the Digital Currency Group, while the Winklevosses run Gemini. In a statement quoted by the Times, S.E.C. chair Gary Gensler said the companies ignored ""disclosure requirements designed to protect investors."" The charges, Gensler continued, ""make clear to the marketplace and the investing public that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws.""According to the S.E.C., up to 340,000 investors lost nearly $900 million worth of crypto.



The S.E.C.'s action signals that the crypto winter that began in 2022 has prompted much greater scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry. Here's more from the Times:A crash in the prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin last spring led to a domino effect, with crypto hedge funds such as Three Arrows Capital and other crypto companies declaring bankruptcy. In November, FTX, a major cryptocurrency exchange run by the entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried, also collapsed after the crypto equivalent of a bank run.The S.E.C. complaint detailed how Gemini Earn investor money disappeared. Customers were supposedly earning interest on money loaned through Gemini to Genesis. Gemini — which was sued by investors at the end of 2022 — would take a steep agent fee out of the earnings intended for Gemini Earn investors.According to the complaint, Genesis also reportedly loaned more than half-billion dollars worth of crypto to Digital Currency Group. Then F.T.X. collapsed in early November, prompting Genesis to freeze customer assets. As a result, Gemini Earn customers couldn't get their money back.While the Winklevoss twins expressed belief in an interview that there is ""a path to getting a deal done that's a resolution for Earn users,"" the Times says Gemini has filed a response claiming it was just the middleman — that the transaction was really between the customers and Genesis.

67,How This Digital Currency Will Transform The World and Benefit Cashless Societies,"Jan 11, 2023",Sergey Shashev,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-cbdcs-will-transform-the-world-as-we-know-it/439982,"
Over the past couple of years, I have been working with my team at Broxus to develop the infrastructure necessary for central banks to deploy digital versions of their currencies. While we have been doing this work, and other projects have been engaged in similar endeavors, the dialogue around CBDCs has taken on something of a life of its own, colored by misconceptions about what Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are and their purpose.At their essence, CBDCs are digital versions of a country's fiat currency that are pegged at a 1-1 ratio with the original currency. For example, if the US were to release a CBDC, that would be in the form of a digital dollar that is always equal to its fiat counterpart. While CBDCs are related to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, some key distinctions exist.CBDCs are, by definition, recognized digital legal tender. That means that, unlike other similar digital assets like stablecoins, CBDCs carry the equivalent legal weight as fiat currencies. This is important as one of the main drivers of CBDC expansion is the shift occurring globally to cashless societies. As more societies become increasingly cashless, the current economic infrastructure has struggled to support local and international economies. CBDCs are a potential way of solving these issues.



Much of the disconnect has arisen from many's perceptions concerning cryptocurrencies, and the association CBDCs have in the public's eye with cryptocurrencies. The truth is, while cryptocurrencies remain primarily speculative, CBDCs are something else entirely. Here, speculation plays no role. CBDCs, if instituted correctly, would be able to optimize financial systems that have grown outdated and been failing to meet the needs of the world's most vulnerable demographics from a financial perspective.While the value of cryptocurrency is often tied to future developments and use cases, with CBDCs, the value is in the here and now. The utility of these digital currencies is something real, something that addresses shortcomings that are palpable around the world right now. I believe that the framework in which we discuss CBDCs needs to change so that ongoing efforts to integrate this technology into the fabric of the world economy may come to fruition.


Related: $465 Million of Robinhood Shares Linked to FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried Are in Question — What Now?CBDCs and universal basic incomeSocial security systems of the 19th and 20th centuries have all required the construction of a significant state body to redistribute wealth. These bloated governance structures have generally not been able to adequately assist the people who find themselves in the more vulnerable spheres of society. To address this issue, an experiment was conducted in Finland that sought to provide a Universal Basic Income (UBI) to generally unemployed people. Rather than using a welfare model, benefits were given out in Finland through a €560 direct cash deposit each month. On the one hand, this provided direct support to those in need and, on the other hand, reduced the costs of collecting, accounting and spending funds that run high in welfare programs.The final results of the Finnish experiment are now in, and the findings are intriguing: the UBI in Finland led to a modest increase in employment, greatly improved results in the material well-being of recipients, and increased positive individual and societal feedback.CBDCs can be uniquely positioned to improve the performance of Universal Basic Income (UBI) programs. Since most of the launched pilot projects and prototypes for CBDCs are focused on a 0% deposit rate, i.e., a situation where CBDCs are subject to inflation and depreciation, central banks could gain more effective leverage in managing aggregate demand in the economy by collecting taxes and distributing part of them to UBI recipients. By issuing currency in digital form, central banks will be able to radically reduce the costs of the state to ensure the circulation of the national currency and social support for the population.


Related: Regulated Blockchain: A New Dawn in Technological AdvancementReaching the unbankedIn 2021, according to the World Bank Group, 1.4 billion adults were still unbanked. That is a massive portion of the world's population, and the failure to provide these people with adequate banking services is likely to prolong poverty cycles and have a stunting effect on global economic growth.This problem is acute in South East Asia, and a good example of it can be seen in The Philippines, an area that we have focused on in our work. Just over half of the adult population in The Philippines has access to banking services. In a healthy economy, small and medium-sized businesses need access to banking services to thrive. With just over half of the population having access to those services, the Filipino economy cannot flourish, leaving the less affluent to bear most of the brunt.Related: Crypto vs. Banking: Which Is a Better Choice?


Lowering the cost of money transfersThe lack of banking services has led Filipinos to utilize alternative financial methods and seek work in other countries. Nowadays, remittances from Filipinos working overseas and sending money home account for 10% of the Philippine GDP or roughly 70-80 billion dollars. At the same time, the cost of money transfers is approximately 8-10% of the total amount of the transaction.Even here, CBDC technology can be effective in improving the situation. As part of our work in CBDC development, we have established a partnership between the Everscale network and DA5, one of the leading authorized direct agents of Western Union in the Philippines. The blockchain remittance service created by Everscale and DA5 will be the first technology in the Philippines capable of speeding up and lowering the cost of this process. As a result, people will no longer have to pay such high fees on their transactions once the service is launched.The first phase of the partnership will see the launch of Everscale's new stablecoin, which will be tied to the Philippine peso. After the stablecoin is released, users in the Philippines can immediately exchange fiat for its digital counterpart at industry-low rates. But this is just a stablecoin; if The Philippines were to launch a CBDC, there would be benefits for all sectors of the economy.The privacy debateA common argument against CBDCs is their lack of privacy. However, this is only partially true: it can be shown that more centralized systems can allow more privacy than decentralized protocols. The bad privacy properties of Ethereum, in which states are made up of reused addresses, are widely known. In addition, users sometimes use uniquely linked domain names, making their transactions transparent to outside observers.


There is a trade-off when designing decentralized protocols: complete on-chain privacy can lead to an inflation problem within the protocol that cannot be tracked - because the recipient and quantities are not known. A sidechain like Liquid gets around this problem quite simply: no more bitcoins can be created inside the protocol than were received at the input. In a centralized system, one trusted oracle can be provided that determines the boundaries of the issue.Centralized solutions based on Chaumian e-cash could use more advanced cryptographic methods to hide counterparties and quantities and selectively disclose this information at the request of the parties involved in transactions. In addition, there is no limitation on how privacy-enhancing features can be implemented since they are not bound to decentralized protocols with limited network resources and free space on the blockchain.Related: Web3, Crypto, Cybersecurity, Rural Fintech: Trends To Look Out For In 2023CBDCs as a vehicle for real and necessary economic changeThe issues above are not going away, and as countries worldwide continue to develop, the people affected by them are likely to continue to suffer. Quite simply, governments have never had the tools necessary to implement adequate benefits programs for those who need them. Now, however, that opportunity is here.


That is the real utility that all of the efforts towards developing CBDCs are based upon, and that should be at the center of the discussion around this new technology.

68,3 Steps to Optimizing Your Business Processes by Embracing the Metaverse,"Jan 10, 2023",Slava Podmurnyi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/3-steps-to-optimizing-your-business-processes-by-embracing/440575,"
There has long been endless discussion, debate and controversy about whether the metaverse appears to be a true solution for business. However, there are striking cases backed up by real outcomes showing that companies have successfully taken advantage of virtual world solutions.A great journey of metaverse implementation starts with taking a step-by-step approach. This involves the development of so-called metaverse-powered applications — digital twins, interactive platforms or decentralized smart contracts. By creating one metaverse-powered app, companies ensure whether or not it's worth further investments. For example, Boeing has achieved up to 40% improvement in the quality of certain airplane parts and systems by using digital twins. So, now the company can scale and move toward a business metaverse ecosystem creation.Related: The Metaverse Is the Future of Business. Here's How to Prepare.



What are the metaverse-related technology applications?Internal logic, user-engaging content and robust infrastructure … it takes lots of time and effort to develop a well-thought-out metaverse. At the same time, business process optimization and high performance of teams are needed right away. Based on metaverse technologies, such applications operate as parts of a potential business virtual ecosystem.Digital twins: Digital twins are virtual copies of the company's products. Their main feature holds in the capability of testing functionality and studying performance issues. This helps to get valuable insights and come up with the next improvements for the original physical product.


Renault Group considers digital twins as an essential part of their vehicle development process. They use 3D copies of cars to run immersive simulations and check literally every part of the future car — from design to engine performance. Moreover, vehicle digital twins are put through certain virtual car crashes and road driving scenarios. That allows for getting an ideal virtual car prototype moved to the production stage.Interactive platforms: A web-based corporate space offers a great variety of applications for businesses, establishing efficient production workflow and enhancing marketing and sales efforts. It also assists in organizing corporate educational activities — namely, competency-based training, hard skills quizzes and competition games to enhance employee performance.Henkel actively employs their own interactive learning platform to help the team keep its skills up to date and thus make the company's performance better. The Henkel Learning Hub includes 4,000+ educational modules dedicated to presentation training, remote leadership and agile working methods.Decentralized smart contracts: These digital contracts allow companies to automate the workflow of agreement execution. Powered by blockchain, they ensure secure and clear processes of different transactions.


Thanks to smart contracts, Home Depot has created an efficient vendor management system. Transparent communication and improved supply chain visibility accounted for having better relationships with vendors. This led to a time reduction that used to be spent on discussing invoice management issues.Different businesses, different metaverse solutions. But as far as they're implemented, these apps can emerge in one big business ecosystem that will cover all business needs.Related: What You Need To Know About How the Metaverse Will Affect Business3 steps for successful metaverse ecosystem developmentInnovation is important, but what's even more essential is the way a company approaches these emerging technologies. By embracing new tech gradually and smartly, a company ends up being advanced and high-performing. So, to create a business ecosystem powered by the metaverse, consider the following:


1. Define a way to get business improvementsAudit the current state of business, and observe the most critical challenges a company faces these days. Then, consider all possible metaverse-related technology solutions: digital twins, interactive platforms and smart contracts. Go for the one that perfectly links the company's existing capabilities with metaverse power.2. Gain your first-time outcome, and move forwardBy incorporating only one metaverse-related technology solution, it's possible to evaluate whether this particular one positively impacts your business by optimizing processes. If the whole effort proves to be effective, then scale.


3. Link all metaverse assets, and build an ecosystemTo cover the needs of all business units and establish an efficient workflow within them all, create an interconnected solution — a metaverse ecosystem. Connect all metaverse-related technology solutions, and manage business processes from a wide perspective.A great case in point showing how a gradual approach towards the metaverse benefits a business is Mars, which created digital twins to avoid packages overfilling. The technology allowed the company to observe the production lines from a birds-eye perspective. Thereby, line production managers could monitor performance in online mode and control the filling process.Having achieved great results by using virtual twins, Mars decided to scale. The company is aimed at creating the ""Factory of the Future"" — a cutting-edge platform. It will include automation and AI features that are going to help with the issues such as waste reduction, water stewardship and greenhouse emissions.


Related: Increase Your Brand Value Online By Venturing Into the MetaverseThe world is transforming, and digital solutions seem to be pretty handy. They provide many tools for automation, performance improvement and discovery of insights. As proof, 71% of tech leaders consider the metaverse as helpful and truly bringing positive changes in the business.So, what makes the metaverse that worthwhile? Being one of the business ecosystem types, the metaverse helps save costs and establish efficient workflows within a company. Though it's not always about 3D, it's more about immersive experiences and user-generated content. That leads to building a strong community around a particular business.

69,3 Marketing Strategies You Can't Ignore to Fuel Your Digital Media Growth in 2023,"Jan 6, 2023",Melissa Stone,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-ways-to-fuel-your-digital-media-growth-in-2023/440601,"
In light of recent shakeups at tech companies, a possible looming recession and enduring inflation, it's never been more important for companies to reallocate marketing budgets across a variety of platforms to maximize return on investment. Collectively, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google) and Meta (Facebook/Instagram) have lost more than $3 trillion in market value this year alone, according to Bloomberg.Frequent mass layoffs and highly volatile technology stock prices have led companies to wonder whether these firms are stable enough to continue advertising with. And even if they are, should channel priorities change?A few digital media shift highlights of 2022:



After Elon Musk's chaotic takeover of Twitter — including his sudden departure as CEO and both introducing and then disposing of subscriptions for Twitter Blue — advertisers have been anxiously pulling paid media spend, fearing brand safety, misinformation and minimal content moderation.Tech layoffs were so common that they quickly became trending hashtags, including #TwitterLayoffs and #MetaLayoffs.Meta's valuation plunged this past February and set off Wall Street's worst drop in nearly a year, with Meta shares falling more than 26%, representing a $230 billion decrease in its market value, according to The New York Times. This plunge comes on the heels of Facebook's re-brand to Meta, including a pivot from driving brand growth through performance-centric ads to its Metaverse future vision focused on augmented and virtual reality.Related: ""Tweets are read ~100 times more than they are liked,"" Musk Rolls Out New View Count FeatureSo, how can leaders confidently put together 2023 marketing budgets and forecast return on ad spend (ROAS) when the technology firms they've been advertising with — and upon which they have become so reliant to drive brand awareness, new leads and revenue — have seemingly become so unstable?


My experience managing digital marketing at B2C companies like Nike, L'Oréal and Meta, and now as vice president of digital media at The Bliss Group (a data-driven marketing communications agency focused on financial services, professional services and healthcare) grants me unique insight into the future of these and other media platforms.With that in mind, here are tips for optimizing 2023 marketing plans and budgets:1. What do the metrics show? Re-evaluate your analyticsPerformance starts and ends with a weekly assessment of metrics. The ability to determine why numbers are up or down is critical in order to drive sustainable growth. For example, if Twitter is an important channel for your brand engagement strategy, start looking more closely at recent trends. Have your followers been significantly increasing or decreasing, and more quickly than usual? An unexpected increase could indicate bots, while a sudden decrease could indicate that followers are leaving the platform. If you're seeing a significant decrease, it might impact referral traffic from Twitter to your company's website, potentially leading to fewer new visits and leads.Tip: For Twitter, it might be worth pausing ads until the platform stabilizes, and re-allocating that budget portion to another channel like TikTok, Instagram or LinkedIn, depending on where your audience is. And for organic social media, be sure to monitor comments on your corporate Twitter account. If sentiment is trending more negatively than usual, re-consider the type of content you're promoting and/or how frequently you post. For B2B firms, it might be worth re-focusing on other channels, like LinkedIn.


Related: How to Make Social Media Marketing Effective for Your Brand2. Who are you talking to? Re-assess your audienceThe way advertisers identify and target audiences is changing, including increased friction between balancing data privacy best practices and delivering personalized content. To provide a truly one-to-one user journey, marketers need to have a clear understanding of who they're talking to. The challenge? There has been a heightened global focus on data privacy, with government regulation at the forefront (i.e., GDPR in the EU, Google Chrome's possible deprecation of third-party cookies and Apple's iOS changes).Because of these shifts, it might become more difficult for companies to identify a highly segmented audience, track its behavior and assess paid media metrics. This could impact digital advertising campaigns' re-targeting, measurement and attribution. (Source: Meta & Deloitte Digital, Q3 2022).Ensure that your organization clearly understands what audience data is being collected and by whom, what technology tools are housing that data and how you plan to leverage information in marketing communications and reporting. In other words, continue to invest in paid media campaigns, but be sure to prioritize owned media by capturing first-party data on your website, rather than being completely reliant on third-party data through various ad platforms.


Tip: To grow an audience base through owned media, focus on collecting new email addresses on your website (lead generation), then follow up with a strategic lead nurture campaign in which your company sends segmented ""Welcome"" emails, with personalized content to new users. By honing your website customer relationship management strategy, if third-party cookies were to go away in the future, your company will be prepared, since it has already developed a direct relationship with its audience and captured information in a trustworthy way.Related: 3 Tips to Re-Engage With Isolated Consumers3. What happens after the click? Create a streamlined user experienceMore than 80% of smartphone users access email on their devices, but if they are not easily readable on mobile, consumers delete them in three seconds, according to HubSpot. If subscribers open your email, click on the content and land on your website, what messaging do they see? Do they take an action, or do they immediately leave? It's critical to use responsive design and prioritize the mobile website journey.Tip: Create a seamless ""after the click"" experience. Align your company's email with its website content. Develop concise benefits-oriented copy with a clear image, a consistent user experience that ensures all key messages are ""above the fold"" (at the top of the mobile landing page) and a clear call-to-action, using buttons that are action-oriented, such as ""Download Now""). The simpler the user experience, the higher the engagement.

    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

2022, for numerous reasons, was one of the most decorated years in cryptocurrency's brief history. In spectacular fashion, we saw the industry's beloved hero Sam Bankman-Fried's fall from grace at a speed that rivaled Bitcoin's crash from $69,000 to $20,000.Contrary to a majorly negative year in the space, we've also witnessed record levels of development on top of the industry's most popular blockchains. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson stated that more than 1,300 applications are being built on top of the Cardano network. In comparison, Hedera's Hashgraph network expects more than 80 applications to go live in Q1 2023, according to Shayne Higdon, CEO and Co-Founder of The HBAR Foundation.At the very least, this ongoing rate of development seems promising and should continue well into 2023, unstirred by other industry variables. Let's look at other trends we can expect for blockchain and crypto in 2023.

More volatilityYou've probably heard from numerous sources that 'the bottom is in,' signaling that we should be entering a one-way vortex to new all-time highs. While we all pray for short bear markets and long bull runs, there are a few reasons why the future road to record highs might be bumpy.


For starters, monetary policy may remain strict because inflation is far from the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. It need not be the case that inflation must hit 2% before a Federal Reserve pivot. Still, indicators must appear well on their way to the aforementioned target before any meaningful easing occurs. The Fed has openly stated a target of 5% for its Federal Funds Rate — we are currently 50-75 bps away from this figure. Because the Fed has been relatively forthcoming with what to expect, the only remaining variable is how we get to where they say we're going, not if.Distilling it down to the perspective of ECON 101, when the Fed hikes rates, we usually see a pullback in prices for risk assets — Bitcoin is no exception. Higher rates also impact the average person's ability to pay for various day-to-day items, particularly the most expensive ones like lodging or transportation. I say this because it's often the case that internet discourse, as well as the 'Discord Bros' that offer investment advice, like to think bear markets have expiration dates. Unfortunately, this is not the case.Related: Bear With Me: 3 Ways To Capitalize During the Crypto Winter2. A declaration that Bitcoin is deadDuring times of duress, extreme viewpoints become far more commonplace. If you haven't already, you'll likely hear that extensive dialogue on how Bitcoin is suddenly extinct, a scam, or pointless technology. This usually is a symptom of too much screen time; people who've dealt with the agony of seeing their net worth slash itself almost instantaneously typically forget why they initially began their investment journey. For what it's worth, Bitcoin has been declared dead well over 400 times, yet the network hasn't faltered for even a moment.


3. More insolvencies, more bankruptciesAs with traditional financial markets, the 'search for yield' often leads some market participants into trouble, trouble that is sometimes irreversible. Leveraged positions and groupthink investment strategies can pay off handsomely during euphoric bull markets. However, when tides turn, they can also exacerbate losses to the point of irreparable harm. Crypto markets are no different.Additionally, struggling businesses are far more likely to take excessive risks to try to reverse their course trajectory should they face any looming failure. The pressure to build a profitable business within this industry is far greater than in more traditional sectors. Failure is far more likely to be conflated with the narrative that the technology itself is problematic than any other macroeconomic factors.Related: The Penthouse Suite: What Product-Market Fit Should Look like In Web34. Fewer celebrity endorsementsCelebrity endorsements go hand-in-hand with enterprise success, especially in the Western world. Whether you're selling soda or software, global marketing teams rely on the likenesses of public figures with dedicated fan bases to promote their products. However, given the recent actions of regulators, I expect many public figures to be far more reluctant to collect checks for endorsing crypto projects. First, we saw Kim Kardashian settle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for $1.3 million following the promotion of EthereumMax. Not long after this event, we witnessed probing into Stephen Curry and a cohort of celebrities affiliated with FTX.


5. More regulatory clarityLastly, and most importantly, we can expect to see an accelerated focus on crypto regulation from regulatory bodies around the world. As the asset class grows in size, the need to create safe and meaningful rules on how we can build and interact with blockchain technology grows exponentially. While the market capitalization for the asset class is significantly smaller than that of Apple (AAPL), various regulators and I understand that this could change dramatically after the next bull run. Because of this, the number of individuals involved and the total wealth at stake will grow to a point where they can no longer postpone regulating the asset class. The question is: how just will the supposed regulations be?Related: 5 Ways to Maintain and Expand Your Wealth During the Cryptocurrency DipHodl onWhile numerous challenges appear to lie ahead of us as we enter 2023, I do want to take a moment to emphasize that bear markets are necessary. They keep us honest and force us to fall in love with our assets for what they are instead of what they are worth. In crypto, patience can be a truly lucrative virtue, so hodl on, my friends, and I'll catch you on the other side.

71,Fed and Bank Regulators Issue Warning Over 'Significant' Risks of Crypto Assets,"Jan 4, 2023",Steve Huff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/fed-regulators-warn-of-significant-risks-of-crypto-assets/442173,"
On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC released a joint statement on the risks posed by crypto assets. Among other things, the statement addressed dangers to banks, such as fraud, inaccurate or misleading representations by crypto companies, and market volatility.According to the agencies, ""risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled do not migrate to the banking system."" The statement said they are cautiously approaching crypto-assets due to several large crypto-asset companies' significant risks and failures (see FTX). The Fed, FDIC, and OCC also said they are evaluating proposed crypto-asset activities and exposures at each banking organization to ensure maximum consumer protection as well as crypto compliance with existing laws.The statement raised current concerns about cryptocurrency, including legal questions surrounding redemptions and proper crypto asset custody procedures. The statement was published shortly before disgraced FTX crypto exchange co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces over 100 years in prison if convicted, entered a not guilty plea to charges including conspiracy, wire fraud, and securities fraud.While the agencies made a point of saying that banking ""organizations are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking services to customers of any specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation,"" they also stated that they ""will continue to closely monitor crypto-asset-related exposures of banking organizations.""One thing was clear, despite the equivocations: the Fed, FDIC, and OCC see decentralized systems as akin to a minefield full of peril for uninformed investors:



Heightened risks associated with open, public, and/or decentralized networks, or similar systems, including, but not limited to, the lack of governance mechanisms establishing oversight of the system; the absence of contracts or standards to clearly establish roles, responsibilities, and liabilities; and vulnerabilities related to cyber-attacks, outages, lost or trapped assets, and illicit finance.

72,What Is the Metaverse and Why Is It Important to Entrepreneurs?,"Jan 3, 2023",Entrepreneur Staff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/what-is-the-metaverse-and-why-is-it-important-to/442015,"
In recent years, you've likely heard about the so-called ""metaverse,"" along with a host of inaccurate descriptors like ""it'll be the next Internet"" or ""it will revolutionize eCommerce."" In truth, the metaverse is both more and less than what many commentators say it is.So, what is the metaverse? What does it mean, and why is it so important? Specifically, why is it important to small businesses and entrepreneurs? Read on for answers to these questions and more.So, what is the metaverse?The metaverse is the interconnected, VR-enabled digital world that persists through the Internet and cloud technology. Think of it analogously to the Internet.Related: Brace For Impact: It's Time To Usher In The MetaverseWhen you make an account on Google, you can take that Google account with you to many other websites, like YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. Similarly, you can make an avatar on the metaverse, which you can bring with you as you visit different domains, platforms or worlds connected to the metaverse network.



You can, for instance:Create a metaverse avatar for work purposes.Take that metaverse avatar to a workplace meeting held wholly digital so people worldwide can collaborate.Take that metaverse avatar to a game where you play with your friends.Take that metaverse avatar to a digital shop to purchase digital items for your avatar, like new clothes.In many ways, the metaverse is intrinsically tied to Web 3.0: the next ""iteration"" or version of the Internet. Web 3.0 focuses more on user identity persistence across different domains and websites and incorporates more VR and AR technology, further blurring the line between the online world and the real world.People often confuse the terms Web 3.0 and metaverse; however, they are fundamentally different. Many metaverse platforms are now accessed with Web 3.0 technologies and integrate decentralized finance (DeFi) into their economies in the form of cryptocurrencies and NFTs.Web 3.0 is based upon the idea of decentralized control and ownership over the internet. The metaverse isn't concerned with technology ownership, but instead the creation of a shared digital reality.


Related: The New Wave of Web 3.0 Metaverse InnovationsThe metaverse as it stands today is partly theoretical and partly accessible — you can, for example, purchase a VR headset, make an avatar and jump into a virtual reality world right now.However, the metaverse is not yet fully interconnected, and its various platforms or domains are still largely isolated. That said, the metaverse is well on its way to achieving its eventual potential.How does the metaverse work?The metaverse works by marrying new hardware technology, such as fully immersive VR headsets that are cheap enough to be commercially available to the average person, and cloud technology and enhanced servers.


In a nutshell, the metaverse is a linked series of worlds or digital domains that people can access using the same user ID. Since the metaverse relies on VR technology, your user ID is connected to a digital avatar that is 100% unique.Related: Why Your Business Needs to Prepare for the MetaverseWhat is the history of VR and AR technology?The earliest examples of VR and AR technology were created in the 1960s and 70s. Over time, as people began to grasp the full range of computer capabilities, they began to imagine what it would be like to wear hardware headsets that displayed fully digital or virtual worlds before their eyes.In the 1980s and 90s, new technologies involving headsets that projected fully realized 3D worlds became available, mainly as novelties or training devices for military personnel. Only in the 2010s did VR headsets become commercially available for the average American, usually to play games or immerse themselves in virtual worlds.


The idea of a ""metaverse"" isn't new. In the Neal Stephenson novel Snow Crash, protagonists interact with a fully immersive virtual reality environment, and movies like The Matrix also showcase metaverse-like technology.However, it has only been in recent years that technological advances have become powerful enough to emulate these ideas and bring them to life.VR vs. AR techNote that there is an essential distinction between VR and AR technology.VR, or virtual reality, technology overlays a digital, virtual world over the real one, typically using a headset like the PlayStation Oculus.


AR, or augmented reality, technology adds digital or virtual elements, icons, and other things to the real world. AR technology can include wearing smart glasses or playing a smartphone game, like Pokemon Go.Potential applications of the metaverseAlthough it is still early, the metaverse has many potential applications, some of which you can already see used in the real world.Working remotelyFor starters, many may use the metaverse to work remotely. You've probably already heard about businesses requiring their employees to attend virtual meetings using 3D avatars on the metaverse. Or, maybe you've already participated in these meetings yourself.Related: Why Remote Work Will Fully Embody the Metaverse


Regardless, the metaverse allows employees to collaborate as if they were in the physical world, even if they have offices around the globe. Real-time Zoom meetings in virtual spaces or corporate real estate are closer than ever, similar to the environments in movies like Ready Player One.Workers with the opportunity to work remotely, as well as their managers, report increased productivity and work-life balance. These and other benefits help paint the picture of how metaverse technologies could push efficiency and productivity forward for small business owners and entrepreneurs.Playing gamesOf course, many people already use metaverse technology for playing games. VR games are already popular among those who can afford VR headsets. While the graphics and controls are still in their earliest iterations, that technology will likely only improve as time goes on. Eventually, VR gaming may become the most common way to play games.Video games like Fortnite, Roblox and Second Life may bring NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and other developments to the gaming side of the metaverse, partly powered by social media. This would allow players to sell virtual items for crypto, giving in-game economies real-world value.


Gamers can expect metaverse tech companies to push the frontiers of gaming further into sci-fi territory, as virtual reality headsets like the Oculus Quest have already done.Related: The Metaverse And Future Of GamingSocializing onlineMore people will likely use the metaverse to socialize online. Digital hangouts, like metaverse coffee shops or dance clubs, may pop up on particular platforms or in certain virtual worlds. In the future, people may use the metaverse to go on dates, interview job candidates or hang out with friends without leaving the comfort and safety of their homes.Related: Metaverse: A Game-changing Innovation For Entrepreneurs


Online shoppingThe metaverse will almost certainly be used in online shopping for real-world and digital items. There are already metaverse shops that you can browse with your avatar to purchase digital items for your character, like clothes or accessories.But imagine visiting a metaverse car dealership to see a graphically realistic version of a car you want to purchase before heading there personally. That's a possibility the metaverse may bring to fruition.As a side note, the metaverse may grow to require using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.""Replacing"" real lifeIn the long term, the metaverse may continue to replace aspects of real life. Whether or not this is good depends on your philosophy and how you view technology and the Internet.


Overall, there's no absolute limit to what the metaverse can do and what it may let people achieve.Is the metaverse becoming more popular?There's a lot of debate and discussion surrounding whether the metaverse is popular now and whether it will become more popular in the future.According to Pew Research, the metaverse is currently at the bottom of its popularity level compared to what it will likely rise to in the future. In other words, the metaverse, especially as it becomes a necessary part of many workplaces, may only become a more integral and regular part of daily life.This doesn't necessarily mean that the metaverse will look exactly how Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft, Apple and others predict it will, of course. However, it seems inevitable that the metaverse and Web 3.0 will likely both become more popular as time passes and as adoption becomes widespread.


Current metaverse platformsEven today, there are plenty of metaverse platforms you can experience and check out. Here are just a few examples:Decentraland: A blockchain-based social environment through which you can explore virtual worlds, build things, trade or earn money.The Sandbox: A virtual 3-D world hosted on the Ethereum blockchain network. You can build things, make money, interact with others and enjoy new virtual experiences.Bloktopia: A VR world represented as a 21-story structure ""built"" out of 21 million Bitcoin.Meta Horizon Worlds: A VR platform through which users can make and host business meetings, socialize, and participate in various virtual activities like games.Metahero: A unique metaverse platform that lets users scan real-world objects and move them into the metaverse instead of building them in the virtual world.The importance of the metaverseThis all leads to the million-dollar question: Is the metaverse important?It's tough to say whether the metaverse will completely reinvent the workplace. However, it is safe to say that the metaverse is incredibly important and may become more critical in the future.Representing yourself graphically and accurately online might be attractive to many. More importantly, the metaverse can eventually allow people to interact around the globe in a largely physically realistic virtual environment.Even though the metaverse's graphics are relatively simple now, you can rest assured that, in a few decades, those graphics will likely be fantastic.The metaverse may lead people to spend more and more time online, which can have wide-ranging consequences on socialization, the economy and other major sectors.Bottom line: The metaverse has the potential to change the way the world works just like the Internet did in the 1980s and 90s, if not more so.Related: The Metaverse Is the Future of Business. Here's How to Plan for It.What does the future hold for the metaverse?Ultimately, the metaverse is the next iteration of digital technology, marrying VR or virtual reality hardware with advanced, cloud-based software platforms.In theory, the metaverse has the potential to revolutionize how humanity works, communicates and plays games. But it remains to be seen whether the metaverse will be as successful as proponents like Mark Zuckerberg hope.Looking for more?

73,Sam Bankman-Fried Pleads Not Guilty To Fraud Charges,"Jan 3, 2023",Gabrielle Bienasz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/sbf-enters-not-guilty-plea-to-ftx-fraud-related-charges/442154,"
Sam Bankman-Fried, who once helmed a crypto empire and represented an industry, pleaded not guilty to eight criminal charges, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering, in a U.S. District Court in Manhattan court on Tuesday.Bankman-Fried was a self-styled ""elder statesman"" of the crypto universe after founding Alameda Research in 2017, succeeding with tactics including financial arbitrage. He later created the crypto exchange FTX in 2019.Related: Who Is FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried and What Did He Do? Everything You Need to Know About the Disgraced Crypto King



The Securities and Exchange Commission has contended that FTX was lending out customer money to Alameda, which, broadly speaking is illegal, as the company was trading customer funds without their consent. The current CEO of the company, John J. Ray III, called it ""really just old-fashioned embezzlement"" in a Congressional hearing in mid-December.Bankman-Fried faced eight criminal charges in the District Court, including wire fraud, all of which he pleaded not guilty to today.Reuters reported last week he was expected to enter that plea.He was also filmed entering the courthouse on Tuesday.Sam Bankman-Fried has arrived in court for his arraignment.

The collapse of the crypto exchange platform FTX is sending shockwaves into the metaverse. The cryptocurrency exchange was once thought of as a stable and responsible leader in an industry which is often fast-changing and unregulated. In the wake of its failure, many wonder what the implications will be on the metaverse.While this moment for FTX will likely be viewed as a learning moment for crypto, metaverse and Web3 organizations and projects, it will also probably be seen as a huge opportunity that some saw for what it was while others missed it entirely. It's essential to recognize that this is a great time to consider what's possible in the metaverse and how you can best take advantage of it through your personal brand.Related: Metaverse: A Game-changing Innovation For Entrepreneurs



Seize the momentThe metaverse is only just beginning to take shape. As exciting as the VR and AR experiences offered today are, these are only the embryonic stages of what's to come. A recent survey showed that 54% of experts expect the metaverse to be a refined and immersive aspect of daily life for a half billion or more people globally by 2040. This would be a cultural shift similar to the rise of the internet.As the metaverse develops, AR and VR experiences will be better able to reach and serve consumers than current technologies can. These new technologies will become a more significant part of our lives and offer users opportunities to purchase virtual and physical goods, travel and even receive healthcare. The metaverse will be an expansion of our daily lives.In this post-FTX moment, it's possible that users will spend less in metaverse contexts because of FTX's challenges on many cryptocurrency holders. This isn't much different from the effects of an economic downturn, and it isn't permanent. There will be an impact that's widely felt, but it won't last forever, and this momentary setback shouldn't cloud our vision of what the metaverse will become.Now is the time to gain positioning in the metaverse. This technology will be a massive part of the future and offers unique opportunities to shape your brand and connect with consumers. Our lives are increasingly happening in a hybrid of on- and offline spaces. Don't let fear prevent you from getting a foothold in this important space.


Related: Why Your Business Needs to Prepare for the MetaverseBe real in the metaverseA lack of clarity on many levels made the end of FTX particularly shocking to many. The lack of clarity makes it seem like this came out of nowhere. An important lesson to learn here is that clarity is vital to the success of CEOs in metaverse and crypto spaces. People want to know what's going on. They also need to have things explained to them in a way they can understand.The metaverse creates new opportunities to garner connections with customers and clients. Much like social media, the metaverse blends social connection and commerce in a way that allows people to connect with your brand on a human-to-human level. These connections can generate value for you and your customers and clients in new ways through the metaverse.Because the metaverse technology is so new, it's easy to get caught up in the spectacle of the metaverse itself. Keep in mind, however, that customers value quality, authenticity and clarity in the virtual world just as much as they do offline. These things should be central to your brand –– they will help your customers to ease into the new world of the metaverse.Now is the perfect time for a reboot. Valuing clarity means being honest with users and customers about your business's operations and values. This moment is an opportunity to show how things work behind the scenes. 58% of Americans say they do not understand the metaverse and NFTs –– you can be the one to guide them through this new world and get them excited about it.Be clear, simple and engaging when it comes to the metaverse. Go off the beaten path when communicating about crypto, NFTs and the metaverse. Emphasize user experience, and get people excited about what you're doing in the metaverse. Don't get overly technical; show users and customers that these spaces can be fun and easy to understand.


Related: Your Brand Can Become Part of the Metaverse. Here's How.Rebuilding trust will take timeThe fall of FTX will certainly have an economic impact within the metaverse since crypto is central to the financial functions of most metaverse platforms. These impacts won't last forever, though –– economic recovery will occur over time. That being said, this is only one that we will see in the metaverse.It will take time to build back trust with investors. The days when the metaverse was seen almost as a get-rich-quick investment by venture capitalists are likely over. Investors will be pickier and more careful about the NFT, crypto and metaverse-based companies and products they choose to invest in.Clarity will be necessary to build back trust. Branding that emphasizes authenticity, transparency and clarity will connect with investors who feel less trustworthy of the metaverse. Investors will want to take advantage of the lower investment price in the metaverse we're seeing right now. The opportunity is there; you just have to be willing and able to close the gap in trust.Crypto got its start in the wake of the financial crisis of 2009. It originates in people's desire for decentralization, clarity and trust. Crypto is fundamentally adaptable, and it is still growing. Recovery is already happening. Remember where crypto came from and what its purpose is. Remain calm, emphasize clarity and trust and connectivity will continue to grow.

Twins Cameron and Tyler Winkelvoss are facing a significant class-action lawsuit from investors who used Gemini, their cryptocurrency exchange.According to Bloomberg, aggrieved investors believe the exchange and Winkelvosses sold them interest-bearing accounts that weren't registered as securities.The Winkelvosses, who first gained fame after suing Facebook over its resemblance to an earlier social media site they founded, launched New York-based Gemini in 2014. Consumers use the platform to buy and sell digital assets, and one of the company's most popular programs has been Gemini Earn. The initiative, launched in 2020, lets users earn interest on their crypto holdings and received plenty of attention from the crypto community and media outlets.As described in a press release from Kim & Serritella LLP — the law firm that filed the action in the Southern District of New York (SDNY) — the suit claims explicitly that the defendants failed the plaintiffs by not telling them customers' assets were loaned out at below-market rates or used for other types of possibly risky securities transactions. The suit also alleges some investors received no earnings despite following Gemini's instructions. The plaintiffs are seeking damages for losses that resulted from the alleged misrepresentations.The outcome of this case has profound implications for crypto asset investors and crypto asset exchanges. If successful, it could lead to tighter regulations surrounding certain aspects of digital asset trading, such as disclosure requirements or customer protections — which could impact investment decisions regarding cryptocurrencies.



The case against Gemini's Earn program highlights some critical issues related to investment disclosure requirements and customer protections within the cryptocurrency space — issues that will likely be addressed more directly in the future, regardless of how this particular case turns out.

Despite the bombshell fraud revelations surrounding trading platform FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried and months of what industry experts referred to as the ""crypto winter,"" longtime crypto fan and billionaire Mark Cuban is doubling down on the coinage.Cuban joined comedian Bill Maher on his ""Club Random"" podcast this week to talk business, sports, and everything in between, including Maher bringing up Bitcoin and saying he's rooting against the currency.Surprisingly, Cuban is also rooting for the coin to go down — but not in the way Maher was thinking.""I want Bitcoin to go down a lot further so I can buy some more right now,"" he told Maher, who then asked him about his thoughts on investing in gold.""If you have gold, you're dumb as f**k,"" Cuban said bluntly. ""It's not a hedge against anything, what it is, it's a store of value.""



Maher brought up that gold never goes away and that you can always sell it, which Cuban refuted by saying Bitcoin is the same, pointing out that most gold owners don't hold the physical piece of gold they own (much like cryptocurrency).""If everything went to hell in a handbasket and you had a gold bar, you know what would happen? Someone would beat the f--- out of you or kill you and take your gold bar,"" Cuban told Maher. ""When you own gold, all you own is a digital transaction.""Cuban also made the case that both currencies are ""pinned to nothing.""Bitcoin weathered a rough year, losing roughly 60% of its valuation since the beginning of 2022.As of Thursday afternoon, the coin was valued at $16,614.99.

77,5 Metaverse Trends That Will Shape the Next Decade,"Dec 21, 2022",Ashot Gabrelyanov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/5-metaverse-trends-that-will-shape-the-next-decade/440377,"
In times of economic uncertainty, you can find unique entrepreneurial ideas emerging in the metaverse, often driving industry innovation and opening up new opportunities for businesses and individuals alike. As the metaverse continues to expand, here are five trends that will shape the next 10 years:1. Virtual content creation3D modeling has been used for many decades in almost all industries, such as gaming, engineering and architecture. All products, buildings, characters and environments have been created using 3D modeling tools on a computer. This industry is only projected to increase in value, reaching $6.33 billion in 2028. This number doesn't include the metaverse space, which is predicted to reach $783.3 billion by 2024.As consumers migrate to the 3D space, the need for virtual goods has only increased. For example, the most popular Roblox metaverse has over 40 million games where its users exclusively create all items, characters, and environments. Those who are top creators can make a ton of money. Just look at Samuel Jordan, who reportedly makes up to $80,000 each month from selling his digital goods in Roblox.



Related: Brace For Impact: It's Time To Usher In The Metaverse2. Metaversal educationCovid-19 has shifted most of the world to remote working and distance learning. Some of the fastest to adapt to this change included schoolchildren. The idea of learning digitally has really caught the younger generation to the point where one of the most popular metaverses, Minecraft, has an educational platform for distance learning.


However, this is just the beginning of the global trend for online education. The online education market size is expected to reach $198.9 billion by 2030, according to Straits Research. Entrepreneurs should expect new virtual studying platforms to appear, as well as courses covering topics such as meta-marketing, avatar design and virtual law. This will open up a lot of career options for the younger generations that use the metaverse.3. Virtual social and music eventsDid you know that 4 million people attended Rod Stewart's free concert on Copacabana Beach in Rio in 1994? It remained the most attended live show until Travis Scott performed in the Fortnight Metaverse in 2020, as more than 12 million players logged in for his virtual concert.Once other artists caught wind of this, they started planning their own virtual concerts. Artists such as Post Malone, Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber provided virtual concerts using the metaverse as their platform. This trend creates many opportunities for musicians and other event planners on platforms who want to capitalize on the popularity of virtual events.However, it's important to start exploring these opportunities now, as global entertainment company, Live Nation, has already partnered with Snap this year to improve the virtual concert and social experience using AR technology.

MetfluencingWhen it comes to influencers, the metaverse has become a prime platform for marketing and advertising products and services. This is mostly due to its interactive platform, which allows users to engage with each other in real-time.


This trend is known as ""metfluencing,"" which refers to when an influencer leverages their popularity in the metaverse to influence other users. For example, Albert Spencer Aretz, also known as Flamingo, is an American Roblox Gamer whose ""let's play"" videos are gaining millions of views. His estimated net worth is over $20 million, as reported by various sources. Due to his popularity, brands are now paying him to promote their products on his channel.

78,Metta World Peace: NBA All-Star-Turned-Web3 Investor Has This Advice for Entrepreneurs Launching a Startup,"Dec 17, 2022",Sarah Austin,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/metta-world-peace-nba-all-star-turned-web3-investor-has/438668,"
If you're reading this, then chances are you'll agree: Starting a Web3 business feels daunting and confusing. At least, that's how I felt when I first started funding my business with Web3 solutions for early-stage crowdfunding. The learning curve felt almost out of reach. My perspective changed, however, after sitting with my friend Metta World Peace — yes, the former Lakers legend who brought home an NBA Championship in 2010. He coached me on how his targeted $1 billion venture capital fund Tru evaluates his portfolio investments.""There are two types of founders,"" Metta told me, the ones who ""have the experience and education and then there are the founders that are the visionaries who know exactly where they want to be."" The founders he's looking to invest in, he says, take calculated risks. ""You want to take it step by step, make sure you're building a good product, test it out before you spend too much money building the wrong tech architecture, and be careful not to blow through your investment money because I've seen so many people lose so much money so fast.""A calculated approach is more than necessary in today's volatile market. Despite the recent bankruptcy filing by crypto exchange FTX, entrepreneurs are building and innovating in the sector — and why shouldn't they? The global blockchain market is still expected to be valued at around $67 billion by 2026 according to recent Cornell University research. Even as Bitcoin falls, the total crypto market cap stands around $900 billion, and hundreds of Web3 projects have raised billions in funding. Despite the uncertain economic times, Metta still sees opportunity in this growing and emerging market and he's investing in blockchain technology projects today as a result.



Not everyone sees it that way though — venture capital investment money has plummeted in half. That's why many entrepreneurs are turning to alternative funding options in addition to raising venture capital.1. Raising funds and finding investorsHave you ever invested in a traditional startup or even a crypto startup? Investing in new cryptocurrency projects is highly accessible. Too easy, some might say, so you have to be really careful when using these products. There are many fraudulent new projects in this Industry, so make sure to do your own research before losing money in the attempt to make it.


On the other hand, raising funds for yourself can be easier using crowdfunding tools versus in a traditional finance setting. ""Using crowdfunding tools is a new way founders are going about raising money. That's attractive to founders who don't have connections to investors, angels or venture capitalists,"" Metta explained. In Silicon Valley, for example, raising money from cold emails can be a challenge and often requires a relationship with an investor to get a foot in the door. When you consider the hurdles and obstacles you need to overcome to meet with investors without a preexisting network, in addition to the legal paperwork that goes into term sheets, it can be a lot of hassle to navigate the venture capital world. So many founders are looking to crowdfunding as an alternative to venture capital or in addition to it.Metta World Peace understands how important crowd-sourcing startups are to the future of Web2 as it enters Web3. Since his unofficial retirement in 2017, Metta has shifted his focus to the entrepreneurial and tech industries, where he is an investor as well as a spokesperson for several startups and small businesses.For example, Orbiiit Technology is a company in Metta's investment portfolio where he was an early investor. The company launched a virtual competition called ""The Pitch,"" which officially launched in late October 2022 and wraps up on November 28, 2022. The competition sets out to find the next up-and-coming unicorn startup founder. Metta is participating in the competition as a startup judge.Think Shark Tank — but online. Startups compete to win capital and in-kind prizes to help them grow their businesses without losing any equity. Metta judges the contest alongside Orbiiit founder Nader Navabi. Together, they will evaluate the top 10 final contestants, who will be selected through a public online voting process. The first-place winner will receive $25,000 cash and a one-on-one Zoom mentoring session with Metta and the investment committee.


Not everyone can raise funds, however, or compete in ""The Pitch,"" for that matter — which is why saving and investing could be the way to go.2. Saving and investingMany new entrepreneurs get their start after saving, investing and then getting started when their nest egg is ready to hatch. To get ahead, Metta says ""you want to get a revenue stream as early on as possible."" Being strategic about the job or side hustle you choose can also set you off on the right path to achieving your entrepreneurial goals.""Let's say you're building a coffee company. Go work at Starbucks to learn their systems, so you can also make some money through a day job. If you want to start a FinTech app, get a job at a VC, start in the mail room. Do whatever you've got to do to learn something that can impact your own company in a meaningful way,"" he said. ""Do this while you're also gradually saving money to self-finance your business because the more you bootstrap your company the more equity you can hold on to and improve your business,"" he continued.To survive, Metta says, you always need additional money coming in. Selling digital goods is one way to earn passive income to fund your startup, let's say, for example, you're selling original IP or you profit on secondary sales by buying low and selling high. ""You can also save on payroll by paying your employees in equity, tokens or even NFTs in addition to cash."" Finally, if you're sitting on digital assets then you can put your money to work by locking them up in decentralized finance platforms to earn yield — but remember to be very careful with the platforms you chose because this option is very risky.


3. Build connections ""Building connections helps founders raise money,"" says Metta. ""If you don't have connections it's going to be hard for you to get the startup capital you need. Web3 gives the opportunity for platforms to decentralize the way the money is raised.""We live in a highly social world. With so much opportunity, it can be easy to make the right connections if you stay active and do your best to learn more. The most common way that founders go about raising money when they don't have connections to investors is by bringing on seed investors and advisors who do. For example, in an insular community like Silicon Valley, it is less about how many people you know and more about who you know. You can know few people yet if you know the right people in venture capital those relationships can go a long way. Bringing on an advisor who can make vetted introductions is a common way to get pitch meetings scheduled. Give the advisor a small equity package and they will work hard and long hours to open up their network to help secure valuable pitch meetings.Even if the investor passes, you can always follow up to ask the investor if they mind making an introduction to another investor friend of theirs who they think might make a better fit. Always research the investor's portfolio of startups to understand common themes, sectors, and stage of investment fit into that investor's existing portfolio and what motivates them to invest. Also, remember to keep the dollar value range within their typical check size because if it's outside their typical range then the chances are higher that they'll pass.It's still early. Good ideas rise to the top. If you have innovative concepts in mind but don't know how to integrate them into the traditional market, it may be time to get started as an entrepreneur. Who knows, maybe Metta World Peace will invest in your company?

This past year of events and severe lack of financial rectitude would have any investor, retail or institutional, grappling with their internal monologues about long-term market confidence. 2022 has seen some of the crypto industry's most lucrative empires crumble, unicorns disappear and a resurgence of 2008's worst media discourse.Bearing more monetary value than the GDP of Costa Rica, in the past eleven months alone, we've witnessed the collapse of the Terra stablecoin, the bankruptcy of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and crypto lender Celsius, as well as the most prolific year for network hacks, collectively amounting thus far to an estimated loss of almost $70 billion. All of this happened before the unprecedented collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange FTX and its Alameda Research counterpart. The result of this series of blows to the industry is, of course, a myopic viewpoint on Web3's efficacy.Related: Bear With Me: 3 Ways To Capitalize During the Crypto Winter



The impactAs the word recession begins to permeate conversation the world over, and we potentially move into the new year within a declining market, a long-term strategic viewpoint is crucial to keeping this whole Web3 thing afloat and far away from the phrase 'in vain.'Bringing a thread of solace to the situation are our learnings from the dot-com bubble burst in the early 00s, the subsequent stabilization of the tech sector and the rise of the behemoths we know today — demonstrating that promising technology sustains itself in the long run. While the next chapter may be an impossible challenge for most, it is nonetheless worth pursuing. After all, bull markets breed rich people; bear markets breed the wealthy.


Related: Are We in a Recession? Here's What Economists SayThe gravity of the 2008 financial crisis knows little bounds. The event was arguably the most impactful one of our lifetime, ravaging the entire global economy. Nearly 9 million people lost their jobs, and almost 10 million people lost their homes due to foreclosure. After four years, more than 46.5 million Americans were living in poverty. Countless people defaulted on auto loans leaving them without a car and with incredibly low credit scores. These poor credit scores have led to the inability to access credit, which has led to financial, social and practical exclusion.The aftermath of this recession has continued to proliferate many lives. We cannot and should not draw parallels between that event and what's happening with cryptocurrencies and technology. We are not seeing crypto's 'Lehman moment' — a narrative propelled by media. Recessionary markets do not denote a recessionary economy. What we are seeing is a more substantial, more volatile crypto winter than the last. We also see a decline in equity investments — something that can happen before and after an economic recession is declared — but most importantly, we are seeing an opportunity to understand the consequences of our current frameworks and the value proposition that still remains.Related: Why the Bear Market is the Best Thing To Happen To Web3 and Cryptocurrency


Crypto and financial parityI'm not oblivious to the financial losses incurred over the past few months — losses of significant magnitude from which many will not recover. I have nothing but empathy for the investors who have been failed by a nascent system that lacks effective regulation. However, this declining market has a silver lining for the vast majority of the U.S. population who have not yet invested in digital assets.For those not physically recoiling at the idea of funneling more money into crypto and Web3, the downward trajectory of market price allows many people to bulk buy the dip and accrue a portfolio of assets they previously may have been priced out of.As the racial wealth gap continues to widen in the U.S. and minority communities look to bank on crypto for alternative income generation, declining markets, in some respects, present an opportunity. Warren Buffet's famous quote, ""be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful,"" springs to mind.Successful startups, and even some unicorns, are born during bear markets by serving new demands created by economic circumstances. Out of the last crypto winter came crypto unicorns Uniswap and OpenSea. Based on previous economic cycles, we know that with robust use cases will once again come market confidence, institutional backing and finally mass adoption. Historically, bear markets are shorter than bull runs, and so, if you can stomach the volatility long enough to remain invested in the market, this can separate you from the rest.


Related: 'We're the First Group Who Loses Out': Black Americans Hit Hard By Crypto CollapseBlack Americans hold less than 3% of overall wealth in the U.S. despite making up 16% of the population. Instead of trying to fight the systemic barriers of the traditional financial system that has been in place for centuries, digital asset investment serves us with a chance to blaze our own trail, with access to the markets at our fingertips at a minimum investment threshold of $5 or $10. The biggest challenge we still face in this regard is education. The 2022 Black Investor Survey from Ariel-Schwab found that 29% of black Americans who invested in something they didn't fully understand did so because it seemed like a ""sure deal."" This is how you lose money, not gain it. While stocks and coins continue to plummet, take some time to read, watch and listen.Now is the time to look beyond traditional systems of wealth generation so that we narrow wealth disparity and level the playing field in the U.S. and beyond. Likely, the next unicorn, unmatched digital asset, or exclusive NFT collection is being built for public trading during this bear market. Imagine missing the opportunity to invest in it ahead of the next, guaranteed bull run.TLDR: Crypto investment is chess, not checkers. And guess what? It's your move.

Call it the millennial-ification of fraud.To the apparent disbelief of the internet, Congress, and a corporate fraud expert, now-disgraced FTX and its affiliated companies — which were once worth billions of dollars — were using QuickBooks for accounting.The company's new CEO, John Ray, testified as much at a hearing before Congress on Tuesday, for the House Financial Services Committee.There was ""no recordkeeping whatsoever,"" he said. ""They used QuickBooks, a multibillion-dollar company using QuickBooks,"" he said.""Quickbooks?"" sputtered Representative Ann Wagner (R-Missouri) in response to Ray's revelation. The video of Ray's testimony and her reaction quickly grew popular on Twitter.

QuickBooks declined to comment.Ray added that the company was using Slack (and emojis) to approve expenses. The CEO had previously led scandal-ridden companies like Enron through bankruptcy processes.QuickBooks is owned by Intuit, which also owns Mint and TurboTax. It is marketed as an accounting and tax tool for small businesses to do things like manage expenses and invoices. In a commercial for the service posted earlier this year, ""small business owners"" joke about feeling self-conscious about knowing more about how to build furniture than manage a payroll.


Sam Bankman-Fried founded FTX after he created Alameda Research. The group of companies collapsed last month after questions emerged about the balance sheet of Alameda Research, which looked to be dependent on an asset that did not really have independent value, which led to customer panic withdrawals, and, eventually, revelations FTX had used customer money to fund trades at Alameda.Related: 'I'm Sorry.

Jimmy Fallon, Madonna, and Justin Bieber are just a few of the celebrities named in a class-action lawsuit alleging they hoodwinked fans into buying Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs and other Yuga Labs products. The suit claims celebrities lied about the non-fungible token's value, making them seem like great investments. This allegedly prompted people to buy ""losing investments"" at ""inflated prices.""The lawsuit was filed on behalf of plaintiffs Adam Titcher and Adonis Real on Thursday by Scott+Scott Attorneys. It covers Yuga Labs NFT purchases made between April 2021 through today.Coindesk has more details:



Titcher purchased Mutant Ape Yacht Club #1984 in August 2021 for 5.3 ETH (about $17,000 at the time) and minted Otherdeed for Otherside #16235 on OpenSea in April, while Adonis purchased an undisclosed amount of ApeCoin on Coinbase. According to the filing, both men purchased the assets ""in reliance on the misleading promotions"" from Yuga Labs and a number of celebrities, resulting in ""investment losses.""The plaintiffs say they lost money due to the way Yuga Labs — and Bored Ape Yacht Club talent rep Guy Oseary — promoted and sold the products.


In addition to Fallon, Madonna, and Bieber, the suit also targets a laundry list of famous names, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Paris Hilton, Serena Williams, Post Malone, Diplo, Snoop Dogg, Kevin Hart, Steph Curry, Future, The Weekend, DJ Khaled, Adidas, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and NFT artist Beeple.This court action comes on the heels of a California court decision dismissing a lawsuit filed on similar grounds against Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather for promoting the EthereumMax token. In that case, the judge said plaintiffs didn't prove they'd seen the celebrities' promotional activities, but could re-file later if they turned up new evidence.Read the full ""Real v.

82,"If We Want a Green Blockchain, We Must Invest in It","Dec 9, 2022",Par Chadha,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-to-create-a-green-blockchain/439435,"
Blockchain storage is fast emerging as a credible competitor to the cloud. One definite advantage offered by blockchain is that its distributed nature of storage makes it a more secure form of storage compared to storing your data on the cloud.But blockchain technology has been continuously plagued by significant energy usage and a large carbon footprint. Cryptocurrency, in particular, has been a sore point with environmentalists. Bitcoin, for instance, is famed for consuming more electricity in a year than entire nations. At a time when a United Nations agency just reported that the last eight years had been the warmest ever recorded in modern times, the future of the energy-intensive blockchain technology may get inextricably linked with its ability to offset its carbon footprint.Related: The Blockchain Is Everywhere: Here's How to Understand It



What's preventing the environmental, social and governance (ESG) shift in blockchain companies?With debates raging around responsible consumption, companies, including the historically ESG-resistant FAANG, have now turned around to commit to definite targets around their ESG goals. Morgan Stanley even declared that ESG-focused metrics might dictate the next decade of investment to understand a company's growth potential.But while investment choices get dictated by ESG metrics, it behooves us to remember that the ethical choice may be easier for some than others. While some of the largest multinational companies like Apple and Google can afford to pivot to ESG with relative ease, the same is not necessarily true for companies focused on blockchain, including even the more prominent players.


As institutional investors become subject to closer scrutiny for ESG reporting than ever, they remain inconveniently out of reach for most crypto projects. This, in turn, affects the entire momentum of widespread mainstream blockchain adoption. Companies with tens or hundreds of servers involved in blockchain in a fragmented ecosystem just do not yet have the latency to commit to ESG.Related: How Blockchain Can Help Tackle Climate ChangeThe blockchain industry needs to focus on a wider audienceWith its anti-establishment flavor, Blockchain, especially cryptocurrency, has found and developed a core niche that's 94 percent GenZ and younger millennials. But for the technology to see mass adoption and investment, it needs to appeal to a much wider audience.It's well documented that younger investors are more likely to make riskier investments — like cryptocurrency, which is known for its volatile price fluctuations. This type of risk does not appeal to those looking to save for a home, family or retirement; therefore, many middle-aged and older consumers have no interest.


Even many Gen Z and Millennials, the generations identified as the most climate-concerned yet, choose not to involve themselves with blockchain technology due to the toll it can take on the environment.Such a small audience doesn't lend itself well to large companies or those looking to make large profits investing in the technology, leading to a standstill in developing greener initiatives since many companies in the space may just be looking to stay afloat.There is a need for blockchain technology to prove its use cases beyond cryptocurrencies. This image makeover will likely happen over time as blockchain storage slowly gains wider market traction as a more secure alternative to the cloud.Related: Solving the No. 1 Issue of Our Time: Using Blockchain Technology to Scale Climate Action


A greener blockchain is possibleThe blockchain industry is at a phase where it is perched at the edge of global adoption. It can easily add thousands of users each month. But blockchain companies need funding to secure ESG initiatives and appeal to the widest possible audience for it to move beyond an emerging technology and become mainstream.Solutions to build an inclusive and sustainable future for blockchain technology are already starting to emerge in projects such as the Green Treasury Initiative by ClimateTrade, which adds to the number of carbon-negative blockchain use cases. Ethereum plans to replace its energy-intensive equipment, which could cut down its energy consumption by 99.95 percent. But offsetting the carbon impact of blockchain networks is likely to remain a persistent challenge for the industry in its quest for mass adoption.Smaller blockchain companies will require adequate funding to find relevant solutions to remain environmentally positive. If we want to benefit from the blockchain without hurting the environment, we need to invest in blockchain and blockchain companies so they can have the money to find these solutions. If you want to appeal to a much larger audience, you must focus on ESG initiatives or join hands with well-established cloud companies with leadership in ESG.

83,Crypto Lawsuit Against Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather Jr. Dismissed in California Court,"Dec 9, 2022",Steve Huff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/kim-kardashian-floyd-mayweather-jr-and-fellow-celeb/440728,"
Since crypto winter began in the summer of 2022, celebrities have learned some hard lessons about the dangers of shilling new products. Several, including Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather Jr., managed to avoid court-ordered payouts after a California judge dismissed the lawsuit against them, concluding that investors were unaware of the celebs' promotional efforts.In January, a lawsuit was filed claiming that EthereumMax executives and celebrity promoters took part in a scheme meant to induce investor purchases of EMax tokens — an action that drove up the cryptocurrency's price, netting significant profits once the celebs and execs sold their holdings.Here's more from CNN:



US District Judge Michael Fitzgerald in Los Angeles said that the investors may amend and refile their proposed class action.The decision comes as other celebrity promoters face lawsuits from users of the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, whose collapse has deepened an ongoing ""crypto winter.""Attorney Sean Masson represented the plaintiffs in the EthereumMax suit. He indicated plans to change investors' claims by adding ""additional facts demonstrating defendants' wrongdoing and liability.""CNN also quoted Kim Kardashian's attorney Michael Rhodes, who had no complaints, saying reps for the celebs were happy with what he termed ""the court's well-reasoned ruling.""Judge Michael Fitzgerald explained his dismissal by stating that the plaintiffs could not prove any intention to mislead investors. Additionally, investors didn't say whether they'd seen the promotions, such as Mayweather sporting an EthereumMax logo on his trunks in the ring or Kardashian's Instagram posts.The claim was permanently dismissed. According to Judge Fitzgerald, the California statute protects consumers regarding fraud related to real-world products or services — cryptocurrency is considered intangible. However, aggrieved investors may still get their day in court, as they can file suit again once they've revised their claims.

84,Why NFTs Will Shape the Future of Gaming,"Dec 5, 2022",Arnav Pagidyala,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/why-nfts-will-shape-the-future-of-gaming/438878,"
Video games are one of the few mediums in which people freely collaborate regardless of race, ethnicity, gender or geography. This universal appeal stems from the ability to enable players to travel across different dimensions and build their own narrative as they unlock characters, weapons and other in-game items. The allure of creating a whole new identity in another world fosters a deeper interaction with users, far beyond that of any other form of media.Unfortunately, as it stands today, gaming applications are built on centralized infrastructure with all in-game assets, user data, game logic, etc., stored on closed systems where complete ownership lies solely with the gaming companies. This means that these games predominately operate by perpetuating a flow of value where players invest their time and money only to increase the profits retained by game developers such as Activision, EA and Epic Games, to name a few. The gaming industry is expected to yield nearly $200B in revenue in 2022 alone, showing no signs of slowing down in the coming years.To restructure the one-sided economic systems imposed by traditional games, a blockchain technology called NFTs can empower players to contribute to an equitable ecosystem that embodies the values of ownership, interoperability and transparency.



Related: 5 Technologies That Will Shape the Metaverse's FutureOwnershipThe famous first-person shooter game Call of Duty generated an estimated few hundred million dollars in revenue on in-game purchases in 2021 alone. Despite having paid for these digital assets, if Call of Duty experienced some downtime or were discontinued altogether, players would have no way to use their assets as they were only accessible within the confines of the game. Thus, players never actually experienced ownership over any of their assets.


In contrast, NFTs exist independently of any individual gaming ecosystem and live directly on the blockchain. As a result, regardless of what happens to a game, in-game purchases in the form of an NFT can always be bought, sold or traded on public marketplaces.The autonomous nature of NFTs enables many use cases outside of just commerce. For instance, an NFT can be displayed outside of the game it originated. This can allow owners to include their NFT on their social profiles to build a reputation as an elite gamer, collector or degen. Gaming NFTs enable owners to expand utility far beyond entertainment and become part of a much larger effort to create a unique digital identity.Related: Key Trends In NFT Gaming To Watch Out For In 2023InteroperabilityUp until the introduction of blockchain gaming, games exclusively existed on centralized servers. As a result, in-game assets could only exist within their own game-specific systems, unable to communicate with other online applications.


For example, most people will eventually get tired of a single game and move on to another. When this happens, they can not transfer any of the content they unlocked within the game, thus abandoning all of their efforts. Is it fair for all their time, money and effort to be rendered useless?This lack of interoperability, caused by siloed ecosystems, effectively fragments the gaming world, ultimately punishing gamers. Instead, games have the opportunity to design for interoperability, thus opening their ecosystem up to network effects as players from other games can also interact with their application. For instance, two games built on the Binance Smart Chain network can logistically support the same in-game assets such as characters, weapons and vehicles. As a result, games could see an increase in customer growth, engagement and satisfaction.TransparencyWhen players earn or purchase any in-game item, they cannot objectively assess its rarity, authenticity and scarcity. Therefore, there exists an implicit need for game developers to operate as honest actors.On the other hand, NFTs will spark a new era of transparency in gaming. In-game assets, in the form of an NFT, can enable owners to freely access helpful information such as specifics around the NFT's uniqueness, the total number in circulation and indisputable proof of the NFT's validity. This level of transparency will drastically increase trust between buyers and sellers, likely giving birth to a vibrant secondary market. Further, NFTs can provide even more advanced data for avid gamers. For instance, NFTs contain information including the number of past owners, average hold time, previous sale prices, asset creation date, etc.


Related: How to Fix the Lack of Trust in the NFT MarketConclusionThe difference between traditional gaming assets and gaming NFTs is quite significant. A quick dive into the fundamental differences between the two reveals how much more effective blockchain-based assets can be in creating a more player-driven ecosystem.For the first time, in-game assets as NFTs will enable games to offer utility far beyond what was previously thought possible. The beauty of in-game NFTs is they bring the gaming world a little closer to the real world. And isn't that the endgame?

""The concert is the same DJ spinning the same music,"" said one user, while Chadwick questioned if he had the date wrong.The other attendees then gave up – leaving the singular journalist as the only person at the gala, less than an hour after its advertised start.The ""Global Gateway"" strategy aims to raise €300 billion of investments by 2027 to help the world recover after the pandemic, in an attempt to counter China's influence.After seeing the metaverse party, one EU diplomat told The Times of London: ""Beijing must be wetting themselves with laughter. It would be funny if it was not a serious project, and if we had not paid for it all.""


The EU did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider.The metaverse has faced renewed criticism since Mark Zuckerberg announced losses and layoffs at his company, Meta, where the virtual reality division has lost $30.7 billion.The Financial Times reported that investors were ""more disgusted"" after Zuckerberg then doubled-down on his vision for the metaverse.

86,How the Metaverse Will Transform the Way We Approach Marketing,"Dec 3, 2022",Nicholas Leighton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-the-metaverse-will-transform-marketing/438395,"
One of the most innovative ideas to gain momentum is the concept of the metaverse. For marketers, it's critical to understand what the metaverse is and how it will impact the way brands promote their products and services.Related: Oculus Founder Slams Mark Zuckerberg's 'Terrible' MetaverseWhat is the metaverse?Think about science fiction movies from the early- to mid-20th century. In those films, they depicted the future of floating cities with millions of flying cars zipping around (for those that can't afford teleportation, of course). Some aspects of these films came true, such as robots depicted in the 1927 film Metropolis or video calls shown in the 1968 movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. Of course, much of today's technology looks very different from those early predictions. The same can be said about the metaverse.



Although there has been talk over the past decade about the creation of a metaverse, most people are still unclear about what the metaverse is. Part of the challenge in defining the metaverse is that it's still very early in the stages of development. The reality is that we don't know how the metaverse will look in the future. The metaverse is truly at a point where science fiction is beginning to meet reality.Much of the promotional metaverse content we see now is aspirational and doesn't represent what can be done with today's technology. What's exciting is that the future is unknown.

Here's How.The metaverse and Web 3.0Although the metaverse will be a significant innovation in this century, its development is not an isolated event. The development of the metaverse is just one part of a much bigger transformation of digital technology. It's difficult to imagine a metaverse built on top of our existing infrastructure. For this reason, many companies are shifting their focus to the creation and adoption of a third iteration of the internet (named Web3 or Web 3.0).For marketers, it's important to understand the technology that is being envisioned for Web 3.0, as many of these innovations will be incorporated into and power the metaverse. The first version of the internet (Web 1.0) was focused on simple protocols that could be used to share and deliver information. Web 2.0 took this a step further, with the focus being on user-created content (email, blogs, video content) and peer-to-peer interactions (social media). The evolution to Web 3.0 will transition the internet to a trustless and permissionless version of the internet, meaning that people will have more control over their data and use of the internet.Web 3.0 will be heavily powered by blockchain technology, artificial intelligence and virtual and augmented reality. Web 3.0 will also shift to a more decentralized model where sites, applications and tools are collectively shared and developed. These technologies will include decentralized finance platforms (Defi), decentralized applications (dApps), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DOAs).


Related: How Small Businesses Can Use the Metaverse to Increase Their CustomersHow to use the metaverse for marketing todayCompanies all over the world are starting to realize that their advertising and marketing efforts will likely be highly disrupted by the shift from physical to digital spaces. Today, the metaverse industry is valued at more than $61 billion. This is expected to increase rapidly, with some projecting a total market value of over $400 billion in the next five years. Savvy marketers must understand how to start taking advantage of new opportunities to promote their products and services across digital platforms. Here are five ways marketers can get started today.1. Incorporate the metaverse into your marketing strategyThe most important thing marketers can do today is to develop a comprehensive strategy on how their company will adapt and transition its efforts to digital spaces. Because the metaverse is largely still in development, resources should be allocated to monitoring and understanding this emerging technology. Companies that have the best visibility to new technology and advancement in the space will have a significant advantage. At the speed that technology is moving, reactive approaches will be ineffective.


2. Create your own digital spacesBrands should consider creating their own digital spaces within existing digital platforms. There is a wide range of strategies when it comes to creating these spaces, depending on the type of product or service you are marketing. Companies with physical products might consider building a digital version of one of their brick-and-mortar locations. For example, an auto manufacturer can create a digital auto showroom where users can check out the latest models.3. Immersive experiencesTraditional marketing approaches have worked for decades, but the metaverse environment will demand more immersive experiences. For example, a major movie theater brand could create a virtual movie theater where you could visit and watch a movie with friends who are thousands of miles away. Or a Michelin-starred restaurant could invite visitors to join them in a digital kitchen to learn how to cook alongside world-famous chefs.


4. Digital collectiblesIn the real world, some companies focus on giving out branded items such as T-shirts or other collectibles to their biggest fans. This can work similarly in the metaverse. Some companies are focusing on creating and distributing digital collectibles. These can range from unique badges to skins that can change the appearance of the user's avatar. Disney is a great example by allowing Fortnite players to ""dress"" their in-game characters in Marvel or Star Wars-themed skins. Many of these skins are used to promote upcoming films or other events.NFT (non-fungible token) technology can create unique and exclusive collectibles that can be issued to users.5. Traditional marketing with a digital twist


Although new approaches will be needed across metaverse marketing, traditional marketing efforts shouldn't be tossed aside entirely. The metaverse world might still allow for many traditional types of advertising, such as billboards and advertising on the side of digital buildings. We're already seeing this as major companies plaster digital advertising across digital stadiums in popular sports games, much like they would in real life.Related: 5 Metaverse Jobs That Could Make Your Kids RichThe metaverse creates unlimited marketing potentialIn the short term, there may be some limitations on the types of digital advertising and marketing you can conduct in the metaverse. For example, a cookie manufacturer might rely on the scent of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies to sell their product. Smelling digital cookies (unfortunately) isn't an option. So, some companies may need to get more creative when it comes to how they market their products.However, there is much more flexibility than there are limitations within the metaverse. For example, a natural history museum could promote a new dinosaur exhibit by attracting young users to spend an afternoon working as a ""digital zookeeper"" feeding and caring for a virtual baby Triceratops.


At the end of the day, the most creative and innovative marketing departments will shine in this new digital world.Related: This Entrepreneur Is Using The Metaverse to Create an Immersive Virtual Lesbian Bar so It's Accessible to All

87,5 Crypto Marketing Fails and How to Avoid Them,"Nov 30, 2022",Karishhma Mago,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/5-crypto-marketing-fails-and-how-to-avoid-them/438813,"
Cryptocurrency today is a trillion-dollar industry. According to The Motley Fool, over 12,000 cryptocurrencies existed in the digital space in mid-2022. With $107 billion trading every 24 hours, the crypto industry is equally high-stakes and fast-moving. Effective marketing is crucial to ensure your crypto project is a considerable part of this activity.Brands need a fail-proof crypto marketing plan to confirm their project is not just seen but goes viral. While working with numerous crypto brands, I've learned that a solid crypto marketing strategy is quintessential for the success of every crypto project. And then, there are crypto marketing fails that startups must sidestep while launching their crypto brands. Here's a list of the five most extensive crypto marketing fails and ways to avoid them.1. Not setting up a thriving communityDid you know the first-ever bitcoin transaction took place via a discussion on Bitcoin Talk? In 2010, a user named ""liazlo"" offered 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizzas and successfully achieved this milestone.



Fast forward to 2022, online crypto communities are the most-effective method to build and engage a like-minded audience. Reddit, Discord and Telegram are highly active groups offering priceless information and insights. Best of all, the marginal, if not zero-dollar, price tag fits any marketing budget.Reddit alone boasts over 500 crypto-related subreddits. As Reddit is one of the most visited sites on the web and the 6th most-used in the United States, one can get a rough idea of how many views this translates to. Set up an online community for your project, and reap the potential of this indispensable part of a successful crypto marketing strategy.


Related: How to Build Your Own Online Community2. Lacking social proofSocial proof, formally known as informational social influence, is people's tendency to copy the actions of others. Indirectly, it is fear of missing out or FOMO. Utilizing social media in crypto marketing, especially online communities, is a way to gain social proof. Early adopters can significantly boost your project, but this will likely be the minority of your investors. The more social proof your project establishes, the more potential buyers it can get.Social proof on social media platforms can create positive hype around a crypto brand in no time. At the same time, a lack of it can make even a solid crypto project appear dubious. Crypto brands must engage with the right set of crypto influencers, content creators and followers to skyrocket social proof.3. Not leveraging crypto public relationsYou must leverage press coverage in leading crypto publications to keep your project from vanishing into the sea of competition. Crypto publications like CoinDesk and CoinTelegraph have over a million followers on Twitter and other social media platforms.


These publications stay on top of crypto trends and market news and boast millions of monthly visitors from niche crypto readerships. Therefore, every crypto project must see crypto PR as a powerful armament in their marketing arsenal.Related: How This Startup Went From Zero Funding To a Leading Crypto Marketing Agency4. Ignoring DM MarketingDM (direct messaging) marketing is quickly becoming one of the most effective ways to connect with potential buyers. DM marketing thrives on social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook, as a DM creates an instant and personal connection with a potential investor.Besides sales, crypto marketers can use this strategy to build a good reputation, apologize for a negative experience, strengthen a community, reach out to influencers, or even hold a live question-and-answer session. One of the most significant advantages of DM marketing is to show people you are a real person, not a bot. Transparency is critical in any business transaction, especially financial ones. Direct messages provide a human touch that can go a long way with people. It might require a considerable time, but it also offers a tremendous return on that investment.


5. Underestimating Web3 blog and SEOIf a project does not take search engine optimization (SEO) seriously, it will be difficult to recover from this tremendous error. SEO makes it easier for potential investors to find your project. It's all about including relevant and well-placed keywords in your copy. These keywords can also help with monitoring your traffic when running project analytics. Determine where your project is trending the highest and focus your efforts on this area.Also, keep in mind that Web3 will alter SEO practices. This new iteration of the internet gives users more power and control. The artificial intelligence of Web3 will be more human and scan for the most relevant information possible in a search. Therefore, compelling and well-researched keywords are a must. SEO is a dynamic activity that must be consistently utilized and monitored. Therefore, brands must monitor and upgrade their website and blog content to stay ahead in the new digital landscape.Related: 5 Essential SEO Strategies For Entrepreneurs to Boost Their Traffic

88,A Tiny Pacific Island Nation Threatened by Rising Sea Levels Plans to Create a Digital Copy of Itself in the Metaverse,"Nov 17, 2022",Stephanie Stacey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/a-tiny-pacific-island-nation-threatened-by-rising-sea/439393,"
Tuvalu plans to become the first country to create a complete replica of itself in the metaverse as rising sea levels threaten to completely submerge the tiny island nation.Simon Kofe, Tuvalu's foreign affairs minister, announced the project in a virtual address to world leaders at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt.""The tragedy of this outcome cannot be overstated. But because the world has not acted, we must,"" he said.



""Our land, our ocean, our culture are the most precious assets of our people and to keep them safe from harm, no matter what happens in the physical world, we will move them to the cloud.""Kofe also issued a warning to other nations: ""Tuvalu could be the first country in the world to exist solely in cyberspace. But if global warming continues unchecked, it won't be the last.""


Situated about halfway between Hawaii and Australia, Tuvalu is composed of three reef islands and six coral atolls. It's home to around 12,000 people, and has a total land area of just 10 square miles.For Tuvalu, climate change poses an existential threat. The UN has classified the low-lying island nation as ""extremely vulnerable"" to rising global temperatures, and experts predict that it could be fully submerged by 2100, per Chatham House.The first step of Tuvalu's digitization project is a recreation of Teafualiku Islet — the country's smallest island, and the first part of the country that's expected to be lost to rising sea levels.In his address to COP27, which was delivered against the backdrop of a digital replica of Teafualiku, Kofe said: ""Islets like this one won't survive rapid temperature increases, rising sea levels, and drought, so we'll recreate them virtually. Piece by piece we'll preserve our country, provide solace to our people, and remind our children and our grandchildren what our home once was.""

He told delegates: ""Only concerted global effort can ensure that Tuvalu does not move permanently online and disappear forever from the physical plane.""This isn't the first time Kofe has attracted global attention on behalf of Tuvalu. At the COP26 climate summit last year, he grabbed headlines by addressing the conference while standing knee-deep in the sea to underline Tuvalu's vulnerability to climate change.

89,FTX Collapse Has Nervous Crypto Investors Draining Bitcoin From Exchanges at Near-Record Rates,"Nov 15, 2022",Steve Huff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/ftx-collapse-has-nervous-crypto-investors-draining-bitcoin/439140,"
Bitcoin holders are skittish following the dramatic collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, according to blockchain analysts at Glassnode. Bitcoin (BTC) withdrawals have hit a record rate of 106,000 monthly, indicating that customers may be losing trust in third-party services.Glassnode tweeted that there had been three other periods in recent years with similar withdrawal patterns, April and November 2020 and June to July 2022, when combined factors — including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the failure of the Terra LUNA stablecoin — caused the crypto market to nose-dive.Following the collapse of FTX, #Bitcoin investors have been withdrawing coins to self-custody at a historic rate of 106k $BTC/month.This compares with only three other times:- Apr 2020- Nov 2020- June-July 2022 https://t.co/92aYVYU4Yt pic.twitter.com/em7CsDBWUf— glassnode (@glassnode) November 13, 2022In the past, similar outflows have sometimes signaled a bull run. In this case, it's much more likely to be a sign that investors have lost faith in big-name exchanges. As Markets Insider noted, these actions ""suggest crypto investors are reconsidering how to manage their digital assets now that the once third-largest crypto exchange in the world has faltered and the value of the fortune built up by FTX's founder Sam Bankman-Fried [has] now been wiped to $1.""CoinEdition quoted Hong Kong Digital Asset Operations Manager Alan Wong, who said that after FTX, ""things will continue to simmer"" and that with an $8 billion gap ""between liabilities and assets, when FTX is insolvent, it will trigger a domino effect, which will lead to a series of investors related to FTX going bankrupt or being forced to sell assets.""



Reuters reported Monday that FTX is under investigation by an alphabet soup of agencies, including the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. As of 11:30 Monday night, Bitcoin was trading at $16,770 after dipping below the $16,000 mark earlier in the day.

""Let's say there's a game: 51%, you double the earth out somewhere else; 49%, it all disappears. Would you play that game? And would you keep on playing that, double or nothing?"" Tyler Cowen asked Sam Bankman-Fried, the now-disgraced founder of the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, in his podcast back in March 2022.The vast majority of us would not take the risk of playing that game even once. After all, it seems morally atrocious to take a 49% chance on human civilization disappearing for a 51% chance of doubling the value of our civilization. It's essentially a coin flip.But Sam Bankman-Fried isn't like the majority of people. He responded to this question by telling the podcast host that he is quite willing to play that game — and keep playing it, over and over again. Cowen asked Bankman-Fried about the high likelihood of destroying everything by going double of nothing on a series of coin flips. Bankman-Fried responded that he was willing to make this trade-off for the possibility of coin-flipping his way into ""an enormously valuable existence.""



Hearing that podcast made me realize the high-risk, high-reward decision-making philosophy that made his wealth possible — but also fragile. Indeed, he did end up in an enormously valuable existence — worth $26 billion at the peak of his wealth. He was the golden boy of crypto — lobbying and donating to prominent government figures, giving interviews to numerous high-profile venues and rescuing failing crypto projects. He was even nicknamed crypto's J.P Morgan.His decision-making philosophy worked out for him — until it didn't.


FTX — the crypto exchange he founded, which represented the source of his wealth — filed for bankruptcy on November 11, along with 130 other companies associated with it. That filing stemmed from the revelation of some very shady bets and trades, which led to a run on the exchange and federal investigations for fraud.Related: 'I'm Sorry. That's The Biggest Thing.' Sam Bankman-Fried and Cryptoworld Lose Big in FTX Meltdown, Company Files For Bankruptcy.Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO as part of the bankruptcy filing. His wealth — all tied up in FTX and related entities — shrank to near zero. His coin-flipping luck finally ran out.So what happened? As his financial empire was collapsing, Bankman-Fried tweeted: ""A poor internal labeling of bank-related accounts meant that I was substantially off on my sense of users' margin.""


Certainly, we shouldn't simply take Bankman-Fried's word for the situation at hand, given the circumstances. Yet at least the atrocious bookkeeping part of the explanation and excessive optimism about user funds is supported by the only external investigation of the matter so far.Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, originally offered to buy out FTX as FTX was collapsing. However, after taking a look at FTX's books, they saw that the problem was too big to solve. Binance backed out, citing revelations of ""mishandled customer funds"" and describing ""the books"" as ""a nightmare"" and ""black hole,"" according to a person familiar with the matter.Messing around with customer funds is a big no-no. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Department of Justice (DOJ) are all investigating FTX's handling of customer funds. Specifically, they're examining whether FTX followed securities laws related to the separation of customer assets and trading against customers. Based on Binance's statements when it backed out of the deal, and even Bankman-Fried's own tweets, FTX very likely violated securities laws.Indeed, Reuters reported that Bankman-Fried built what two senior employees at FTX described as a ""backdoor"" in FTX's book-keeping system, created using bespoke software. This backdoor enabled Bankman-Fried to execute commands that would not alert others, whether at FTX or external auditors. The two sources told Reuters that Bankman-Fried ""secretly transferred $10 billion of customer funds"" from FTX to Bankman-Fried's own trading company, called Alameda Research.


Bankman-Fried described his decision to move this money to Alameda as ""a poor judgment call."" This coin flip landed the wrong side up. Double or nothing turned into nothing.The underlying story here is of a fundamental failure of compliance and risk management. The inner circle of executives at FTX and related companies, such as Alameda, lived together at a luxury penthouse and had very strong personal and romantic bonds. CoinDesk reported several former and current employees at FTX described the inner circle as ""a place full of conflicts of interest, nepotism and lack of oversight."" Naturally, this context of personal loyalty at the top makes it hard to have any oversight and risk management. It allows things like secret software backdoors, shady bookkeeping and mishandling of client funds to flourish.Related: FTX's Crypto Empire Was Reportedly Run By a Bunch of Roommates in the Bahamas Who Dated Each Other, According to the News Site That Helped Trigger the Company's Sudden CollapseSuch nonchalance toward risk management stems fundamentally from Bankman-Fried's decision-making philosophy of high-risk, high-reward bets. Bankman-Fried is unquestionably a visionary and financial genius. One of the most prominent venture capital firms in the world, Sequoia Capital, invested $210 million in his company, and a partner at the firm said that Bankman-Fried had a ""real chance"" of becoming the world's first trillionaire. Yet it ignored the serious dangers of Bankman-Fried's decision-making philosophy.


Bankman-Fried is not the only multi-billionaire who ignores risk management and oversight. Consider Elon Musk's approach to Twitter.After taking over the company, he fired the vast majority of the existing executive team and replaced them with a select inner circle loyal to him. Then, he started experimenting with various Twitter features, most notably selling blue checkmark verification badges for $8 a month without any mechanism for confirming a user's real identity.Previously, Twitter only offered verification — for free — to those who had some public status and could prove it. After Musk's offering, thousands of new accounts popped up with a blue checkmark impersonating real people and companies, such as an account that looked like Eli Lilly claiming that insulin is now free. Musk seemed very surprised by this outcome and paused the paid blue checkmark program in response.Let's be honest — the outcome for Twitter in introducing paid blue badges was clearly predictable, and many publicly predicted it would go badly. Yet there was no meaningful risk management and oversight check on Musk's actions, just like there was none over Bankman-Fried.


The outcome of Musk's risk-taking at Twitter might be bankruptcy, which would mostly be a loss for some big banks and investors. The outcome of Bankman-Fried's risk-taking at FTX is definitely bankruptcy. That bankruptcy not only harms large investors — it also destroys the savings of thousands of ordinary people who held their money in FTX, given Bankman-Fried messed with customer funds.Bankman-Fried's misdeeds also harm the many worthwhile charitable causes to which he donated, such as pandemic preparedness. A committed philanthropist who already gave away many millions focusing on evidence-based charities, Bankman-Fried raised hopes for inspiring billionaires to give away their wealth rapidly, just like MacKenzie Scott. However, many charity projects to which he promised funding are now in limbo, with their funding withdrawn; the employees at Bankman-Fried's granting organization, the FTX Future Fund, resigned due to the revelations of misdeeds at FTX.Such harmful consequences from a lack of oversight and risk management highlight why it's critical for founders to have someone who can help them make good decisions, manage risks and address blind spots. Such risk managers need to be in a strong position, able to go to the Board of Directors or other sources of insight. When I serve consulting clients in this role, I insist on being able to access this oversight body as part of my consulting contract. I almost never need to use this option, but having it available helps me rein in the double-or-nothing impulses of brilliant founders such as Bankman-Fried or Musk since they know I have that option.An important takeaway: If you're deciding to make an investment with a seemingly brilliant entrepreneur, do your due diligence on risk management and oversight. If it seems like the entrepreneur has no one able to rein in their impulses, be wary. They will take excessive risks, and you're gambling rather than investing your money wisely.

CoinDesk reported Thursday that FTX was run by a ""cabal of roommates.""These roommates also were reportedly in and out of dating relationships with each other.CoinDesk also leaked the balance sheet that led to the unraveling of SBF's empire.This story was originally published on Business Insider.As Sam Bankman-Fried falls further down the cryptocurrency mineshaft, the publication that helped to launch his descent is throwing more fuel on the fire.Earlier this month, crypto news site CoinDesk leaked a balance sheet that showed that Bankman-Fried's two endeavors — crypto exchange FTX and trading firm Alameda Research — has assets that were largely wrapped up in FTT, the in-house crypto token of FTX.With the crypto market already on shaky ground, CoinDesk's revelation set off a panic among traders. The price of FTT came crashing down, as did Bankman-Fried's fortune.



On Thursday, CoinDesk unearthed more secrets about the inner workings of Bankman-Fried's crypto empire, including the untraditional makeup of his inner circle.""The whole operation was run by a gang of kids in the Bahamas,"" CoinDesk reported, citing a source who was familiar with the matter.The publication said that several current and former employees of FTX and Alameda Research agreed to speak about their experiences on the condition of anonymity.


Those sources told CoinDesk that both operations were run by Bankman-Fried's inner circle of 10 roommates. All of them either are — or have been — paired up in romantic relationships with one another, CoinDesk reported. The consensus among all the sources was that ""It's a place full of conflicts of interest, nepotism and lack of oversight,"" CoinDesk reported.Among the named members of Bankman-Fried's inner circle were Caroline Ellison, Alameda's current CEO. Ellison was the only employee CoinDesk singled out for having reportedly dated Bankman-Fried at one point, but no other specific past or present relationships were disclosed. The publication noted that Ellison did not respond to their request for a comment.Others included Gary Wang, FTX's co-founder and chief technology officer, and Nishad Singh, FTX's director of engineering.""They'll do anything for each other,"" one source told the publication regarding Bankman-Fried, Wang, and Singh.


The publication also noted that most of the 10 roommates were either Bankman-Fried's college friends from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or former colleagues from Jane Street.Some employees outside Bankman-Fried's inner circle noted that they were shocked by the events of the past week.""Some employees kept their life savings on FTX,"" an anonymous source told CoinDesk. ""We trusted that everything was fine.""FTX and Alameda didn't immediately respond to an Insider request for comment.

People are losing money — and faith — with crypto.Sam Bankman-Fried, the previously lauded billionaire and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, saw his fortune and confidence in his platform tumble after a CoinDesk article revealed that a company he also owned was heavily dependent on an asset without independent value, leading to panic from FTX customers and in the crypto world, in general, this week.By Friday morning, the company had announced that it would be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in order to ""maximize recoveries for stakeholders,"" the company's new CEO, John J.

Bankman-Fried will step down but stick around to help with the transition. It will affect 130 companies affiliated with FTX with a few excluded.Press Release pic.twitter.com/rgxq3QSBqm— FTX (@FTX_Official) November 11, 2022One fear that could be sorted out during bankruptcy proceedings is that FTX was not solvent, i.e., that customers would not be able to actually withdraw their coins from the platform. The CEO Bankman-Fried earlier denied these rumors on Monday in a now-deleted Tweet and has said online the company's users in the U.S. need not worry about the liquidity of their assets.In a surprising series of events this week, a competing company, Binance, moved to rescue FTX on Tuesday by buying it — but had backed out by Wednesday, after its due diligence process and because of concerns FTX was being investigated by government authorities.""In the beginning, our hope was to be able to support FTX's customers to provide liquidity, but the issues are beyond our control or ability to help,"" the company wrote.FTX also announced Thursday it had partnered with Tron to help users access assets, and the company has been further Tweeted about various withdrawal-related steps it's taking with foreign regulators including in The Bahamas and Japan. In the comments, seeming users express frustration and confusion.


On Thursday morning, FTX CEO also Bankman-Fried apologized for and explained his take on the situation in a long Twitter thread, saying he made mistakes with liquidity that affects, he claimed, just users of FTX International, and that he planned to spend the week raising money to be able to cover user deposits.""Anyway: right now, my #1 priority--by far--is doing right by users,"" he wrote. ""So, right now, we're spending the week doing everything we can to raise liquidity…. There are a number of players who we are in talks with.""Whether or not that is the true scope of the problem or if FTX will be able to provide for its users through bankruptcy proceedings remains to be seen. Bankman-Fried previously told investors he needs $8 billion to cover a ""bank run"" on the platform.The saga has been a bucket of cold water for crypto investors, says micro crypto influencer and longtime token-holder in the space, Tiffany Fong.""It is shocking to see a company a lot of us looked at a hopeful and optimistic way have such issues and have such an illiquid balance sheet,"" she said.The anxiety inherent to the FTX episode can be traced back to the fall of fellow crypto exchange Celsius, which filed for bankruptcy in July, trapping the assets of its users, and the general decline of the value of cryptocurrency, which has been hammered by the instability of the wider economic environment. Bitcoin, a flagship coin, for example, has dropped 18% since the beginning of the FTX saga last week and has lost 65% of its value since the beginning of this year.What's going on with FTX?FTX and Binance are both cryptocurrency exchanges. You can use them to swap a coin from one currency to another. Both also offer other types of products, like leveraged tokens, which are theoretically less risky crypto assets. Prior to Binance's plan to buy the company, the companies were thought to be rivals.Then, things started to get bad for FTX. Last week, CoinDesk published a story that noted a company very closely linked to FTX, Alameda Research, which is Bankman-Fried's research firm, (it is like a crypto hedge fund of sorts that trades crypto assets on a larger scale and is not accessible to everyday retail investors) had a very large portion of its assets as the cryptocurrency coin FTX itself had created, called FTT. (Alameda is also part of the bankruptcy proceedings.)


There's nothing ""wrong"" with that, as CoinDesk noted, but it's as if all of your wealth is based on an asset (or, at least based on the documents the outlet had access to) that only has value because you say it does, as opposed to something with objective value on the market.This spooked people. Fong said she had started to hear rumors on Twitter of the platform's insolvency even before the article came out — and then, after the CoinDesk piece, Binance announced Sunday it would sell all of its FTT. Customers then began withdrawing money from FTX and people began to sell FTT, further driving down the price of FTT — and, theoretically, the value of Alameda.Then, in an angel moment, rival trading platform Binance swooped in, and the two company leaders, Bankman-Fried and Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao Tweeted Tuesday they had signed a non-binding letter of intent for Binance to acquire FTX.CoinDesk then reported Wednesday, citing an anonymous source, said Binance was considering ditching the acquisition after getting a look at the company's financials, which Binance later that day confirmed in its own Tweet. None of this bodes particularly well for people involved in FTX.


None of this week's events bode particularly well for people involved in FTX. Bankman-Fried lost almost 94% of his fortune, some $14 billion, because of the debacle. Tom Brady publicly invested in FTX and was an influencer for the company, so the money he has put into the platform is also at risk, per Yahoo Finance.It's unclear how much Brady and his now ex-wife Gisele Bündchen, who also signed an endorsement deal with the company, sunk into FTX or how much they might have lost.BREAKING: Crypto exchange FTX has announced an endorsement deal with Tom Brady & Gisele Bündchen.Both Brady & Bündchen will receive equity in FTX and a signing bonus in crypto.In total, FTX has committed to spending over $350M on sports partnerships in the last 6 months alone— Joe Pompliano (@JoePompliano) June 29, 2021Previously, FTX and Bankman-Fried were seen as the ""white knights,"" as Fong put it, as Bankman-Fried had dived to rescue via buying struggling competitor Voyager Digital. So, finding out FTX needed rescuing was disturbing, she added.


It is possible Brady and Bündchen could even face questions about how much they knew about shaky business foundations, as crypto-astrologer-influencer Maren Altman has about Celsius.More official sources appear to be poking around as well. Bloomberg Law reported Wednesday that two U.S. government entities, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are looking into FTX over questions about its liquidity.In Bankman-Fried's Twitter thread on Thursday, he explained how he miscalculated the platform's liquidity. He also said his crypto trading fund, Alameda Research, would be ""winding down.""6) My sense before:Leverage: 0xUSD liquidity ready to deliver: 24x average daily withdrawalsActual:Leverage: 1.7xLiquidity: 0.8x Sunday's withdrawalsBecause, of course, when it rains, it pours. We saw roughly $5b of withdrawals on Sunday--the largest by a huge margin.— SBF (@SBF_FTX) November 10, 2022""And so we are where we are. Which sucks, and that's on me. I'm sorry,"" he wrote. Crypto entrepreneur and ""whiz kid"" Justin Sun has also said he's working with the platform trying to help solve the issue.No matter what happens, it has been a tough time for Fong, despite her longtime love for decentralized finance. Although she did not have any significant coins in FTX, Fong lost about $200,000 in the Celsius debacle, and that, combined with the FTX drama, has her questioning her confidence in some of the currencies.After this, ""people [are] losing faith in crypto as a whole,"" she said.

94,Use These 3 Growth Strategies for Your Business In This Bear Market,"Nov 9, 2022",Adir Buskila,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-strategies-to-grow-your-business-in-this-bear-market/434360,"
We see a lot of startup founders turning to Web3 models, and a lot of established Web2 companies are already taking a step toward upgrading. With companies like Nike, Adidas, Google, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Twitter, we can say for sure that leaders are predicting that the future of the internet will be Web3-based. As more and more entrants join the space and create great companies, they're heavily affected by the crypto market, which is currently in a bear market.As both cryptocurrency and Web3 come from the same technology — that is, blockchain technology — many people confuse Web3 with cryptocurrency and even think they are different names for the same thing. That's not the case.Web3 and cryptocurrencies are not the same things. Sooner rather than later, the Web3 market will detach from the crypto space and join the startup economy, which trends more toward user statistics valuation rather than investor speculation.



It's the wild west out there. Some tokens are down drastically as seen on Coingecko, and the market is bearish. We're seeing a decrease in users who actually uses the apps themselves (look at Sandbox, Decentreland, Opensea, etc.). This tells us something that is very important to note — the investors are the users, which leads to use only when the market is bullish. Imagine a company where the entire user base is made up of people who actually use its app for its utility, instead of just trying to make a profit.Now, here's how to grow during a bear market.Related: How Your Business Can Thrive in a Bear Market1. Build better foundations for your companyFurther optimizing and building during a bear market is one of the best things you can do for your company. Go through your processes, check what worked and what didn't, and optimize it as much as you can.Before the market went down, we saw companies hitting ATH (all-time high) in two weeks. Making their company a unicorn for a few days is very appealing, and that desire probably led to many founders optimizing their projects to a bull situation filled with hype and FOMO (fear of missing out). While that can work perfectly for pyramid-based projects and high-yield projects, that is not the case for most of the Web3 space. That's why this is the time to build a better foundation.Getting ready for the future is much easier during times like the ones we're in now when getting positive attention for your company is difficult. The worst thing you can do is to stop building and wait for the next bull. You may fall for the illusion that ""every company does well in a bull market,"" but that's usually not the case. It's much harder to advertise and get real attention during hard times with all the noise going around.


2. Grow and nourish your communityI've never seen a chart that goes in only one direction, so neither bull nor bear is defining the problem to solve. It's the consistency of building a community of people that your product provides solutions to. Nourish the community relationships and make them feel like they are in a stable and caring space. That and only that will create a stream of revenue that fluctuates far less with the market. Getting the right audience in front of your solution during a bear market will prove how resilient your project really is and will indicate how well it will do in a bull market.The Web3 space will lose its peg to the crypto market very soon and every big sector will be led by a company that supports or uses tokens to their users' advantage.Related: Why the Bear Market is the Best Thing To Happen To Web3 and Cryptocurrency3. Advertise and market in a personalized mannerAdvertise and market your product to your audience. If you already have a product that solves a problem, your next task is to get it in front of the right audience. That isn't easy, but establishing your brand now is the best thing you can do for your company.


The advertising techniques used during a bull market, like sponsoring a soccer team or paying influencers, will not have the same effect now. The key is to build different funnels for different segments of your audience and optimize until you can grow and scale your marketing, or in two words: Personalized Ads.The biggest ad networks like Facebook and Google are mostly rejecting Web3 companies, as they classify them as crypto-companies and they are not very friendly towards those types of companies. However, newer companies have joined the game and want to promote Web3 companies.To wrap it up: it's important to state that every company will be affected by a bear market and Web3 companies are still getting wrecked by the crypto market. But companies that still bring utility during these strange times should focus on growing their user base and building their brand. I suspect such companies have a better chance of drinking tequila on the beach in the next bull market.Related: Where is the Bottom for this Bear Market?

95,How Offering Crypto as a Payroll Option Could Help Your Company Win the War for Talent,"Nov 8, 2022",Frederik Bussler,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-crypto-can-be-used-to-attract-and-retain-top-talent/437298,"
In April 2020, unemployment in the U.S. was at ""the highest level on record,"" followed by nearly record-low unemployment in 2022. There's also a record high of two open jobs for every unemployed person, which is driving fierce competition for talent. Some firms are turning to cryptocurrencies to sweeten the pot.Offering salaries in cryptocurrency isn't new, but it's becoming more common as companies attempt to lure top talent. In 2017, Japanese internet company, GMO, announced that it would pay part of its employees' salaries in bitcoin, and it is joined by the likes of SC5, Fairlay and io.Related: 3 Ways to Stay Competitive in the War for Talent



Why offering crypto payroll is a meaningful perkA tremendous 56% of American adults (around 145 million people) own or have previously owned crypto. To offer salaries denominated in cryptocurrency is to appeal to a much wider swath of the population. What's more, young people are particularly bullish on crypto. A recent survey found that buyers in the Gen Z and millennials buckets make up nearly 94% of all crypto buyers.Offering cryptocurrency as a payroll option is a way for companies to tap into this enthusiasm and signal that they're forward-thinking when it comes to new technologies. It's also a way to attract employees who might be interested in working for a company that is comfortable with and supportive of cryptocurrency.


Paying salaries in cryptocurrency comes with some risks, of course. The value of digital assets can be volatile, and so a worker who is paid in crypto could see his or her earnings fluctuate wildly from month to month. For this reason, it's important for companies to consider whether they're prepared to offer salary protection in the form of cash top-ups or other benefits if the value of crypto falls.Employees may want to get paid in crypto for a number of reasons, from the potential for appreciation to the simple fact that it's a more convenient way to hold and use digital assets. But regardless of the reasons, companies that want to stay ahead of the curve would do well to consider offering crypto payroll options. It could be the key to attracting and retaining top talent in today's competitive landscape.Related: The Complete Guide to Crypto, Bitcoin, ApeCoin and Blockchain TechnologyCrypto payroll is beneficial for employers, tooIn addition to the ability to attract top talent, there are a number of reasons why paying salaries in cryptocurrency could be beneficial for employers.


For one, it can help companies save on costs. Cryptocurrency transaction fees are generally lower than those associated with traditional payment methods like wire transfers or credit cards, particularly for cross-border payments.In addition, crypto payroll can help firms hedge against currency risk. If a company pays its employees in a foreign currency, it is exposed to the risk that the value of that currency will decline relative to the company's home currency. By paying salaries in cryptocurrency or stablecoins like USDT, companies can hedge against this risk. For example, the value of the Japanese Yen dropped over 20% against the U.S. dollar (or the stablecoin equivalent, USDT) this year.Last but not least, crypto payroll can give companies a competitive edge when it comes to speed and efficiency. Cryptocurrency transactions are generally much faster than traditional payments, which means employees can get access to their earnings more quickly. And because digital assets can be stored and used electronically, there's no need for paper records or checks (which can often get lost or delayed in the mail) — everything is stored securely on the blockchain.Related: The Future Of Banking: How Blockchain Technology Can Merge Crypto and Traditional Banking


How to offer crypto payrollIf you're interested in offering crypto payroll to your employees, there are a few things you need to consider.First, you'll need to decide which cryptocurrency or cryptocurrencies you want to use. There are thousands of different digital assets in existence, so it's important to do your research and consider what makes the most sense for your company.For example, if you want to offer employees the ability to hold and use their earnings easily, you might want to consider a major cryptocurrency like bitcoin or Ethereum. If you're more interested in hedging against currency risk, a stablecoin like USDT could be a good choice.Once you've selected a cryptocurrency, you'll need to set up a way to pay salaries in that currency. The naive approach would be to simply ask employees to provide you with their cryptocurrency wallet address and manually transfer the appropriate amount each month. But this is time-consuming and exposes you to the risk of human error.


Another option is to use a crypto payroll service. This not only saves you time and reduces the risk of error, but it also makes it easy for employees to receive their earnings directly into their own wallets or exchange them for other currencies if they so choose.Ultimately, offering crypto payroll is a way to stay ahead of the curve and attract top talent. If you're interested in doing so, there are a number of things you need to consider. But with the right preparation, it could be a major competitive advantage for your business.

97,Bear With Me: 3 Ways To Capitalize During the Crypto Winter,"Nov 8, 2022",Solo Ceesay,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/3-ways-to-make-money-during-the-crypto-winter/437817,"
From a young age, we are taught that capital markets have the power to make us rich. Whether it's from your first economics professor or your uncle who is an accountant, we've all heard countless times that compounding is king and time in the market is the most valuable asset you can buy. To be clear, that math does add up. History shows that the market, as measured by the S&P 500, has an annual return of approximately 10%. That said, it never really feels like this is what people are doing.Markets are as flippant and volatile as they've ever been on the back of greater access to consumer finance products and the rise of social media platforms as mediums for information sharing. GameStop, AMC, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are great examples of how market sentiment isn't something to underestimate and, in most cases, shows that you might be better off doing as they say and not as they do. Time in the market may be ""king,"" but timing the market (within reason) is equally important.Here are three things to keep in mind to capitalize on your financial investments.



1. Do. Your. Research.One of the biggest obstacles for cryptocurrency markets is the notion that they're purposefully convoluted and confusing. To this day, the average person still can't explain how a blockchain works or how an economy running on cryptocurrency will lead to ultimate financial inclusion. Instead, narratives about how blockchain and crypto enable money laundering and financial exploitation saturate the internet. What's more, the remarks of regulators around the globe often discourage the average person from diving into the technology, indirectly forcing them out of the market because they don't understand it, and things that we don't understand are scary.While it's important to understand what you invest in, there are numerous instances in which the average person takes a passive approach and follows the crowd. When was the last time you read the terms and services agreement before hitting ""Accept""? That approach is how most people move even with investing. They're quick to dump their hard-earned money into the most popular and discussed stocks.


However, very few people have the skill set to value a company. Terms like tender offers, stock splits and market capitalization live outside the minds of the vast majority of market participants. This isn't to say that you should do the same with speculative cryptocurrency investments — I'm actually proposing the opposite. Take the time to learn about blockchain and cryptocurrency's main value propositions and take a little more to better see the arbitrary inconsistencies within financial markets. By doing so, you might just unlock your next big blessing.Related: How To Start Investing2. Diversify, Diversify, DiversifyThe world of financial markets is unbelievably vast. Stocks, bonds, foreign exchange, ETFs and cryptocurrency are just a few ways for investors to take views and attempt to capture value. Part of solving the puzzle that is financial markets is understanding how to use the tools you have in your toolbox and ensuring that your toolbox has the best tools in it. For instance, to invest in cryptocurrency, you don't necessarily have to purchase individual tokens. You could get crypto exposure through the stock market by investing in Coinbase or one of the other companies that IPOs. Or you could invest in any number of ETFs that allow you to diversify your holdings automatically.It's critical to understand that not all coins are created equal. Of course, you have your mainstay cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum, but there are thousands of alternative coins (altcoins) that you could invest in. Understanding the difference between infrastructural coins and decentralized application (dApp) coins is critical as well, given that the risk profiles of these investments are quite different. Infrastructural coins are a bet on technology's ability to attract builders of hopefully successful applications, while dApp coins are levered to the success of that individual application's success. Understanding these dynamics helps smart investors balance risk more effectively.


Related: Cryptocurrency Millionaires Are Diversifying Into Property. You Should Be Too.3. Buy low. Sell high.It sounds simple, but this staple rule of financial markets is commonly broken.The market gets out of hand every now and then, and quantitative tightening occurs. When this happens, frothy markets correct themselves and prices start to reflect that. Unfortunately, there are always investors who can't stomach the long-term volatility and start to divest out of assets prematurely. Groupthink exacerbates this issue, and oftentimes those traders bring their friends along with them. We're generally taught not to prey on the misfortune of others, but this behavior often creates the best opportunities for those who are patient and willing to weather the volatility. The market can sometimes be like a rubberband where things swing from overvalued to undervalued in an instant. Taking advantage of these swings can set you up to capture even more value than before.Related: 5 Ways to Maintain and Expand Your Wealth During the Cryptocurrency Dip


To sum upCapital markets serve as the ultimate mechanism for value to exchange hands between borrowers and savers. As an investor, your job is to ensure that you have the capital to deploy when opportunities arise and that you also part ways with money when advantageous exits arise. At the end of the day, the main takeaway here is that very few investors conduct the necessary due diligence required to make the most educated investment decisions. While reiterating these rules may not rectify that fact, it might inspire a couple of investors to take advantage of the opportunities their counterparts leave them.

98,Why the Bear Market is the Best Thing To Happen To Web3 and Cryptocurrency,"Nov 1, 2022",Ariel Shapira,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/the-bear-market-is-a-blessing-for-web3s-future-heres-why/437183,"
Cryptocurrency enthusiasts might think it's blasphemy, but what's currently happening in the industry is a reason to rejoice rather than despair.Crypto is going through the necessary but painful process of separating the wheat from the chaff. And boy, is crypto full of chaff. From Do Kwon, who ran Terra into the ground, to Three Arrows Capital's founders, who are literally on the run, crypto doesn't lack bad projects that need to disappear.The common denominator among such projects was espousing values such as decentralization and transparency, whose absence in traditional finance, crypto entrepreneurs claim, prevents financial empowerment. Those values largely didn't translate into real-world business models, which is important since the industry lacks strong regulation and enforcement. Celsius's founders raiding the company coffers before screwing the retail customers is a case in point. Access to funds and the power to move them willy-nilly remained only with the company's creators.



Is it true that blatant misuse would have been prevented if Celsius was actually a decentralized finance (DeFi) company without a centralized business structure? Such platforms do exist, while not with the same name recognition among more traditional techies. Take EQIFi, which operates in the same space but is backed by a globally licensed digital bank and structures its platform decentrally. The idea is to offer investors an ecosystem in which they can stake their tokens in a truly decentralized way.Related: Rebound And Reset: Making The Most Of The Current Crypto Bear Market


It's hard to know whether platforms that adhere to DeFi purity will win out and fare better than the likes of Celsius in the long run, but it's undoubtedly the case that they are doing things differently. By combining the best of both worlds, one might be able to deliver on the promises of an earlier generation of crypto leaders.It's not only big projects like Celsius and 3AC that were thriving in the bull market. The world right now is full of ""zombie firms."" These companies could never survive in normal market conditions but managed to stay alive because of cheap access to capital. While a joke, the widely circulated quote during the bull run asking, ""if I raise money faster than I am spending it, am I profitable?"" speaks to a phenomenon that was endemic during the booming market.Small crypto startups successfully chased huge valuations with very little but hype to underpin them. Now the industry is paying the price. According to classic Darwinian logic, the survivors of this downturn will be the companies that built products that can thrive even in this harsh environment. And that's happening. Imagine leveraging blockchain to do something useful, like improve crowdfunding through real transparency. There's a Web3 crowdfunding platform called SeedOn doing exactly that. Instead of scaling back in the downturn as companies collapse, they are taking on new vetted projects showing that innovation still brings value.Related: How should investors weather this 'crypto winter'


Instead of growing for increased valuation, Web3 can now focus on building. It can maximize users' value and transform how companies do business. In the long run, it will be healthier for Web3 to have value as an underpinning instead of valuation bubbles.Another valuation bubble that burst is — of course — bitcoin's. From having peaked at almost $70,000, now the price is hovering at $19-$20,000. Surprisingly to many enthusiasts, this is also a good thing. Many speculators made money when the market pumped and Bitcoin went to the moon. It also served to promote virtual currency in the mainstream. However, the booming price creates problems that hinder the ecosystem's growth — the main obstacle being that money needs price stability.Bitcoin maxis might think a bitcoin price around $20,000 is way too low as they want to get rich on ""HODLing."" But the fact is a stable bitcoin enhances its feature as a store of value. If I expect an asset I hold today will be worth twice as much next year, why would I ever spend it? Conversely, if I fear the currency to lose half its value by next year, why would I ever even hold it? If the price is stable, the currency's usefulness is amplified manifold.The crypto ecosystem might see a bright red line between Bitcoin and Web3, but there isn't one. For example, Jack Dorsey, the legendary founder of Twitter, is building a decentralized version of the web that Bitcoin will entirely power.


That the first and most prominent cryptocurrency establishes itself as a helpful way of storing wealth is great. If I, as a consumer, can count on Bitcoin to keep its value, maybe I'll save some in my wallet, even just out of FOMO, and perhaps use it for something in the future.The road to mass adoption is full of surprising twists and turns. Instead of price pumping for the sake of speculators making money on the movement, Satoshi Nakamoto's vision of a decentralized currency is a step closer to reality.This bear market will end at one point, and we can't know what tech or crypto will look like after the winter. But right now, there are many reasons to be optimistic that the growing pains we are experiencing will be worth it in the long run.

99,Web3 Is Here to Stay — But Here are 2 Key Elements Holding It Back,"Oct 25, 2022",Ivan Liljeqvist,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/web3-is-here-to-stay-but-here-are-2-key-elements/436882,"
It is impossible to ignore that crypto has endured a tough, trying year. We have seen Bitcoin and Ethereum collapse in price, exchanges suffering shutdowns due to market volatility, hiring freezes, job losses and company valuations slashed. The pain in the market has been very real and has emboldened Web3 skepticism about the industry's future.The argument by those who consider Web3 nothing more than hype is that this year, Web3 has been found wanting — that it lacks the infrastructure and mainstream use cases needed to influence the future of the internet in the ways it claims it can and will. However, when I listen to those attacking the legitimacy of Web3 based on the current market, I cannot help but hear echoes of the same claims put forward following the burst of the dot-com bubble in 2000.Yes, this year in crypto has been hard. But no, Web3 is not going away. Not all tech stocks have melted down, not all projects have hit the wall, and despite the downturn, Web3 companies are still managing to raise funds. I would argue that the market collapse managed only to kill off the weaker Web3 projects and that the fundamentals of blockchain adoption, user expansion and new use cases remain unchanged.



What I feel has held Web3 back is what holds most internet projects back: bad user experiences (UX) and poor user interfaces (UI). These elements play an essential role in the success of any application, and below I outline why this is where the industry needs to focus if we are to onboard the next billion users to Web3.Related: The World Of Web3: A Beginner's Guide To A Space That's Set To Change The World As The Internet Once Did


What is holding back Web3?If you have used blockchain applications before, you will know that most of them rely on users opening a wallet to be authenticated. Users that have been in the space longer already have those wallets set up. But for newcomers, setting up a wallet and adding a browser extension can be complicated. Unfortunately, most blockchain applications are just not that user-friendly. Given that user-friendliness is integral to mainstream adoption, what should we be doing?Well, we know that traditional users are familiar with email and social media logins. This is the preferred option when signing up for a new app, rather than creating a separate account. So, we can say with some confidence that offering these signup and login options into blockchain applications ought to enhance the user experience, making it simpler, easier, more effective and more efficient.Related: Usability First: Why You Should Pay Attention To User ExperienceThe path to mainstream adoption starts with great designThere is a simple fact all developers should keep in mind: Good design is vital to mainstream adoption. It is no good pretending otherwise. If the UI alienates users, and if the UX frustrates them, then we can kiss adoption goodbye. As a developer, I know that when it comes to products, whether users accept them or reject them, is down to you. So, my advice is: Design with the user in mind. If a product looks good and is easy to use, people will integrate it into their daily lives. If it isn't, they won't. That is really what it comes down to. Make it good, and make it accessible.


The other aspect I would say should be central to the design process is trust. As I mentioned above, there remains a lot of skepticism surrounding Web3, so developers should be designing with transparency in mind. When thinking about new users, we have to accept that many of them will be taking a step into the unknown and that not all of what they have read or heard is likely to be good. So, blockchain applications should be big, bold and upfront with their security measures, including how transactions are made and monitored.Our aim as developers is to make the world of blockchain applications feel safe and familiar to newcomers. And if we are successful in achieving this aim, then mass adoption by hundreds of thousands, millions, and eventually, billions of users is within our grasp.Related: What All Entrepreneurs Need to Know About Web3So, what comes next?Right now, Web3 still exists on the fringes of the mainstream. That's neither a bad thing nor a commentary on whether it will ultimately break through. We forget that the adoption of the internet itself took some time. Most people either don't understand blockchain, its adoption, use cases or what a decentralized internet can really offer. This is to be expected. Change doesn't happen overnight, and the infrastructure of Web2 is very well-established and entrenched within our daily lives. That's also something that's not going away soon.


The next thing we need to do is design for ease of use. Assume nothing about our users, and focus only on the human experience. We must design with simplicity, trust and transparency top of mind. If we do that, Web3 will move from the fringes to the mainstream in no time at all.

The Fyre Fest saga captured a national audience, spawning multiple documentaries and deep public interest in how a weekend trip advertised as the ultimate luxury getaway turned into a logistical nightmare.Although the festival was supposed to take place on the island of Great Exuma in the Bahamas, it has sat dormant since 2017. But now, one company is looking to make use of the vacant spot after all.AGIA International plans to sell 60 ultra-luxurious pavilions and villas in hopes of creating the most ""exclusive enclave in the Caribbean.""



The catch? Each unit will be sold as NFTs, available for purchase on the Ethereum blockchain. Owning the minted NFT for the corresponding property means that the buyer will have ownership of the physical property. ""When the public buys one of the 60 homes here via their crypto wallets, they're not only buying into a wealth of oceanfront experiences, they're also bringing economic vitality to the Bahamas,"" Erik Sanderson, Co-founder of AGIA International, said in a company release. ""We are committed to growing the local economy and creating sustainable jobs.""


Sanderson also said the AGIA Foundation will assist the island's educational and healthcare needs. Unlike the Fyre Fest which notably left trash on the island and disrupted the local infrastructure, the company says it will work to ""build awareness around climate change by preserving the island's natural beauty and environmental resources, along with promoting the importance of agriculture throughout Great Exuma.""The resort is set to boast a super yacht marina as well as a village complete with restaurants, bars, and shopping. Each home will have its own pool and floating boat slip and will range in price from 1,000 to 6,500 square feet.""This is the first time an entire real estate development has been exclusively for sale on the blockchain,"" Matthew Salnick, Chief Strategy Officer of Unchained Partners, AGIA International's blockchain developer explained. ""There's never been a 100% tokenized resort-style community.""AGIA said that it would announce the official date of the mint later this month.The announcement comes on the heels of another major milestone in NFT real estate.Earlier this week, the first-ever NFT home was sold in South Carolina for around $175,000.

101,What is Web3 and How Will it Impact My Business?,"Oct 21, 2022",Atul Jindal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-web3-will-transform-small-business/436351,"
Technological developments have always had profound effects on the way businesses operate. The proliferation of the internet led to the introduction of digital marketing. The development of artificial intelligence changed how businesses interact with their customers. And now, Web3 is set to revamp how the internet works as a whole.Web3 is touted as the turning point of the modern internet and is expected to rehaul cyberspace as we know it. What should a business expect from the successor of Web2.0, the internet we have grown accustomed to?Related: Web3.0: The Next Big Thing?



What is Web3?Before we dive into how Web3 is expected to influence small businesses, let's first talk about what Web3 really is. It is a blockchain-driven internet that offers a decentralized alternative to the web as we know it.While still in the early stages of development, Web3 solves what seems to be the most difficult problem with the internet today. It offers better data privacy by eliminating central organizations and allowing users to keep their data stored in their personal crypto wallets.


So, while Web3 may not entirely replace today's internet, it may offer a safer alternative and may trigger an exodus of users from the second to the third generation of the internet.Benefits of Web3Web3 is still in the making. So all its benefits are currently rooted in theories and the potential of blockchain technology. If the technology develops like Big Techs have assumed it would, these benefits might be realized, leading to a massive shift in business processes.1. No-third party involvementSmall businesses rarely have the resources to collect their own data, hence resort to third-party data mining companies.


Such third-party data is costly and rarely accurate. 86% of the companies using third-party data think it is inaccurate. And inaccuracy of data adds to the cost of data-driven operations. This is why ""dirty"" data is said to impact 88% of a company's bottom line and lead to an average company losing 12% of its revenue.Blockchain eliminates third-party involvement, just like how cryptocurrencies have largely eliminated banks' participation in monetary transactions. Similarly, Web3 is expected to eradicate third-party data brokers by enabling P2P connections and decentralized systems that allow businesses to connect with their customers directly.In this way, businesses might be able to collect data directly from the source, either free or at a smaller price compared to what data brokers demand. The accuracy of data, that too at a lower price, may lead to better strategies, which may eventually reflect in a business's bottom line.2. Reinforce cyber security


Cyber security is a menace in the online shopping arena. People are skeptical of sharing their information lest malicious actors steal them. And businesses are at risk of hefty fines due to failure to comply with regulations.British Airways faced a whopping $26 million fine in 2018 for its failure to protect sensitive consumer data. Proponents of Web3 claim that this next generation of the internet will eliminate this problem.Since the entire infrastructure is decentralized, Web3 does not have a single point of weakness that hackers can exploit and get their hands on critical information. Blockchain technology makes it difficult for cybercriminals to penetrate networks and tamper with or steal sensitive information.3. Well-built customer trust


Web3 will eliminate third-party data brokers who rarely regard consumer privacy. These companies often mine data without informing the users and then monetize it. Businesses that buy this data then leave their customers skeptical of trusting them.Web3 solves this issue by removing data brokers from the equation. If everything goes as theorized, businesses can collect data from the customers themselves and practice better operational transparency.94% of shoppers remain loyal to companies that operate with transparency, while 73% are willing to pay a higher price to businesses that stay transparent. Therefore, Web3 may enable businesses to build and retain consumer trust, which is a significant revenue driver in every era.4. Better customer experienceCustomer experience has and will always remain among the key variables in a business's success equation.Regardless of how critical it is, 63% of digital marketers struggle with developing a good customer experience, even with the easy availability of data. With browser cookies crumbling, data acquisition is expected to become much harder than it is today, which may make personalizing the customer experience even more of a challenge.Web3 may solve this problem with its easy availability of data. It can help marketers acquire critical customer data without offending them. And if used right, this data can then help deliver a more personalized experience that the users crave.Since 48% of buyers are more inclined towards businesses that personalize their communications, this may lead to improved customer acquisition and, eventually, more profit.


5. Enhanced supply chain57% of businesses have poor visibility across their supply chain.Blockchain technology, the backbone of web3.0, distributes data across all the nodes present within a network. This eliminates informational siloes and enhances data transparency across the supply chain.Once the supply chains are more transparent, businesses may experience a dip in relevant costs and a hike in supply chain efficiency due to increased traceability.


Related: Web 3.0 Is Coming, and Here's What That Really Means for YouFinal wordsThe next generation of the internet is on the horizon, ready to rise and trigger a new era of business operation.Small businesses need to keep up with the latest trends and learn about blockchain technology as best as possible. Additionally, they must try and innovate their processes according to the available technologies so they might be better positioned to adopt newer technologies that may arrive in the future.This might help them avoid being left behind by the big tech companies that are already investing massive amounts in these futuristic technologies.

102,How This DeFi Platform Plans to Overhaul Traditional Finance,"Oct 20, 2022",Jessica Abo,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-this-defi-platform-plans-to-overhaul-traditional-finance/437505,"
Piers Ridyard is the CEO of RDX Works. He sat down with Jessica Abo to talk about the public decentralized ledger core developer Radix.Jessica Abo: Piers, for those who are unfamiliar, can you start by telling us about RDX Works and what you do?Piers Ridyard:



RDX Works is a core developer of a public ledger, like Ethereum or Bitcoin or Solana. Ours is called Radix, and it's a public ledger entirely focused on decentralized finance (DeFi).Decentralized finance is basically building financial products and applications on top of a piece of decentralized infrastructure (blockchain) that is designed to make it easy for people to create things like assets and services, in a way that is more digital-first than the current financial system we have today.


And so, if you've ever heard about things like Ethereum - platforms that allow you to build solutions like decentralized exchanges, decentralized money markets, or decentralized financial products - that make it easy for people to do investing, saving, and trading.It's basically a new area of technology. In the same way the internet was a new area of technology back in the 1980s and 1990s, that's what we're seeing today - this new, revolutionary system that allows you to replace the current financial systems like banks, and create a new way of allowing people to build.Why should we care about all of this?The way that I often think about the current financial system is, it's a little bit like an archipelago of badly connected islands. So each bank has its own internal system, its own internal ledger. Each stock exchange has its own internal system, its own internal ledger. But actually, if you look at the banking system, a lot of transactions are done by Excel spreadsheets that are sent between companies to be able to reconcile because systems don't talk to each other.


Now, a bit like before the internet came along, people would do things by phone or by fax, but there wasn't a unified place where you could send information easily. And right now there isn't really a unified place in which you can create financial assets and move them around between companies. And that's what this infrastructure is for.And I know it sounds very simple, but it's as simple as it was when we went from newspapers to reading things online. It was enabled by a bunch of new technologies and new platforms that were created, but couldn't have been created before.One of the big revolutions of decentralized finance is this ability to create liquidity around long-tail assets. So when you think about the current financial system, you'll be like, well, Apple; I can go and buy and sell Apple stock. But if you're an entrepreneur and you're building a company, even if it's a relatively big company, your equity isn't very liquid. Your debt isn't very liquid. And that actually makes it harder to raise finance, it makes it more expensive to raise finance.And what this infrastructure does is makes it radically easier for people to be able to access the financial ecosystem, and be able to do things that get out of the way of their business. It allows entrepreneurs to get on with doing the thing that actually matters, which is building great products for people.


Where does Radix fit into the DeFi universe?When Ethereum first came out, people didn't really know what the purpose of these public ledgers was, what the idea of smart contracts was. And so they started playing around with different products and services. But it quickly became apparent that the real thing to use for these public ledgers is actually decentralized finance.However, Ethereum and the competitors to Ethereum are not really designed for building an asset-first platform. So we think that decentralized finance is going to eat the 400 trillion global financial system. It's going to move everything to public ledgers in the same way that all information moved to the internet.But to do that, you have to actually build a piece of infrastructure that's designed for the application that is being built. And what we found is, it's really difficult to build decentralized finance today. You see lots of hacks, lots of exploits, lots of problems that all come down to the tools that entrepreneurs have available to them to build with these systems.


So what Radix did is, we spent the last three years working with DeFi developers and DeFi projects to build an incredibly intuitive experience for being able to build these platforms and services.You can think of Radix as an operating system, or a platform for people to build applications on top of it. We've created a programming language and a public ledger that makes it really intuitive for people to be able to harness the power of this new type of technology that came along and make it much easier for entrepreneurs that are thinking about launching a business in Web3, or launching a business in DeFi, or launching a business in crypto, to be able to go from idea to production code and take that down from two years to something like three months.In simple terms, what is a smart contract?Smart contract is really a difficult term. Because it's kind of a misnomer, right? It is not a contract from a legal point of view. A smart contract is a piece of code that exists on a public ledger. The code itself can control money directly. And so a simple example of a smart contract is, if I have some Piers tokens, I can send them into a smart contract. And the smart contract can say, okay, well, if someone sends me 10 Piers tokens, then I'll send them 20 Radix tokens.


But the smart contract does it on its own. It isn't on a server that's running on AWS or something like that. It's actually part of the public ledger. Now, this superpower is critical because it allows you to create more transparency around how finance operates. Right now if I go to a bank, I send my money to the bank, and the bank has its own general ledger about whose money is what. And then I have to ask the bank to get my money out.With a smart contract, all of that money exists on a ledger. And then all of the code that deals with the logic as to who is allowed to access that money, what that money can do when interacting with other applications on top of the ledger, is all administered directly through the logic of the smart contract itself.So you can think of it as basically a program that exists on a public ledger, that will follow the rule set to do with the administration of assets on its own without needing some company to be running that in the background.Where do you think DeFi is headed? What are some of your predictions for 2023?


I think 2023 is actually going to be a consolidation year. It's going to be the year that people learn the lessons of what happened in 2021 and 2022, and work out what the real value was and what was created; things like how you create liquidity around long-tail assets.I think what you're going to see in 2023 is a lot more real-world assets. So things like building debt, things like business financing, project financing - that's all going to start to come to public ledgers. And you're going to start to see more stitching together of what we think of traditional assets into this unified layer of financial products and services.A lot of people talk about NFTs, and the Bored Apes artwork and stuff like that. These are kind of toys, but they're toys that represent what is actually possible to create with this technology. And you're going to see more serious companies coming in and building things that are actually more exciting than the traditional financial sector, but using all of the tools and power that's available from DeFi tool sets, like what Radix is building.In your opinion, who do you think should go into crypto and who do you think should avoid it?


Everyone should take the time to learn. Not necessarily to go into, this is what my business is going to do in this space. Because we are still at an early stage. It is still the very early days of the technology. But go and use Scrypto, our programming language, that we've built to make it as easy as possible for people to get started in Web3 and DeFi. It's a great way to learn the tools and understand what the technology could mean to your business.And that's the exploration that is necessary now. That's where the entrepreneurs who really take that initiative are going to have the most opportunity for their businesses in the next cycles. Because they'll have taken the time during these bear markets to understand how the technology might apply to their company, and how they can think about that for a long-term strategy of how their company is going to win as a result of this new tool set that's available to them.

103,How Small Businesses Can Use the Metaverse to Increase Their Customers,"Oct 20, 2022",Atul Jindal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-metaverses-power-in-improving-small-business/435978,"
Metaverse. The buzzword of last year.71% of business executives think the metaverse would be suitable for business, and that's probably why the big wigs of business have already stepped into it.But what does metaverse entail for smaller businesses?



In its literal sense, the metaverse is a digital alternative to the real, physical world. It is a realm where digital and physical worlds combine and offer people new, immersive, 3D experiences.Regardless of its glitz and glamor, the metaverse is still surrounded by a lot of skepticism, with people going as far as calling it a fad. But the internet was also labeled as a fad many years ago.


Look where we are now.The metaverse may potentially be the revolution we expect from the future. And this revolution may already have begun. So, it might be a good time for businesses to learn what it promises, see its benefits, roll their sleeves and dive in.Related: Metaverse: A Game-changing Innovation For EntrepreneursHow will the metaverse influence small businesses?Retail and eCommerce are among the industries that stand to gain the most from the metaverse, even while it is still in its early stages.Here's how the metaverse is expected to revolutionize, or at least evolve, the current business scene:Revamped shopping experiencesThe metaverse is expected to blur the lines between digital and physical and merge online and offline shopping experiences, creating a more immersive eCommerce ecosystem.If the Big Techs manage to deliver on their vision, customers would be able to put on their AR/VR headsets and go into virtual malls, browse through virtual stores, speak with digital salespeople and enjoy an outdoor shopping experience, all while staying in the comfort of their home.And a fraction of this ""future"" is here already with the introduction of AR in retail. Online furniture retailers Wayfair and IKEA started offering AR experiences to their customers, so they could try furniture before making a purchase.


So, for small businesses, the early waves of the metaverse bring an opportunity to get into AR and deliver on the current customer expectation — giving them the ability to ""try"" things before they can buy as they shop online.New customer engagement approachThe metaverse may take the current digital marketing approaches to the next level, offering new opportunities for brands to engage and communicate with their audience.With the metaverse approach, community building might take an exciting turn where businesses can organize live, immersive and significantly more engaging events such as virtual tours and 3D webinars. This could be a kind of local gathering where the audience has the opportunity to meet and engage in a highly interactive way.With these personalization capabilities, businesses can try new ways to hook their audience and keep them engaged, potentially building more substantial and profitable partnerships.


Related: Unlocking the True Potential of the MetaverseA new form of advertisingWith entertaining content in different sectors, such as virtual gaming, comes opportunities for advertising where businesses can put up their ads for people to see. Virtual sign boards can also potentially drive exposure, similar to physical billboards.With the metaverse's immersive content offerings, businesses can try new ways to drive the audience's attention through 3D interactive ads and leave a more profound impact.Increased exposure to a massive audienceEven with the ease of eCommerce, people still like to make in-person brick-and-mortar store visits. The metaverse is free of geographical constraints, meaning you can offer an in-person store experience to your customers. As a small business, Metaverse stores can bring down investments in real estate.Customers can have great experiences at fantastic stores through personalization. Engaging avatars acting as your sales associates may reach and influence more people by offering individualized experiences.


Apart from salespeople, the metaverse may also allow you to personalize your virtual stores according to each individual's moral, social and cultural beliefs and take web personalization to a new level.First mover advantageThe metaverse could be the next internet. It could be the shift of this century. And it could be nearer than you think.That means people who accept the metaverse as the possible future and adopt a progressive approach might be able to enjoy the first-mover advantage.They may learn the ropes sooner, understand the nuances, and find solutions before their competitors even get there. These businesses might be able to establish their authority in front of the digital audience before anyone else. And more importantly, they might get a say in how the technology progresses and the laws are developed.Final thoughtsThe metaverse as we know it packs unprecedented opportunities for businesses of all scales. From allowing newer levels of personalization to introducing a new business model, brands may have much to gain from this futuristic ecosystem.


However, the metaverse is a product of ambitious aims and massive promises, the realization of which depends on some appreciable technological marvels that are yet to be seen. So, while the metaverse continues to light up the horizon, its rise depends on how the technology develops.Regardless of how the future shapes the metaverse, we are standing on the threshold of a new era, an era driven by Augmented and Virtual realities, and businesses that wish to stay relevant need to prepare accordingly.

104,They Say Web3 Is the Future of the Internet. But How?,"Oct 19, 2022",Ariel Shapira,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/web3-is-the-future-of-the-internet-but-how/436320,"
Today's blockchain landscape has a lot in common with the early Internet: It's an unwieldy, unsafe, and unregulated ""wild west"" of loosely connected protocols that hardly appear to form the infrastructure for future commerce. The internet's early critics were clearly wrong that no one would ever want to use email. With blockchain, however, the jury is still out.Concrete usability is one of the biggest challenges in moving blockchain past its wild-west phase. Using crypto for its original purpose of financial transactions is still comparatively difficult. But more importantly, the broader Web3 ecosystem still lacks the practical functionality and UX to form the infrastructure that will replace Web2.Web2 is an incredibly well-oiled and easy-to-use organism. Think of Facebook, Google, Uber, DoorDash and your favorite banking app. Crypto lovers often complain about the problems with centralization in Web2, but the end user sees proper functionality and an excellent user experience. In Web3, on the other hand, they see only a trendy UX dumpster fire with potential.



Related: Web 3.0 Is Coming, and Here's What That Really Means for YouOne of the major players behind current — and therefore Web2 — IT technology is, of course, Microsoft and its Office Suite. Microsoft Office found its way into almost every business and every home since the late '90s. Excel rules finance, and Outlook rules email. These software were so functional that even hard-hitting critics and competitors had no choice but to use them. Nowadays, we can almost say the same thing for Google. Try as you may to cut yourself off from Google's products, but you will barely last a week.


Web3 doesn't have a Microsoft or Google equivalent. The most usable crypto wallets, such as MetaMask, that often serve as the portal into Web3 platforms have limited functionality. So far, interoperability is just a promise of some of the more ambitious projects.Until now, most hyped crypto projects focused on Play-2-Earn games, minting NFTs of pixelated frogs, or monkeys with bling. Today, however, Web3 projects are building infrastructure that matters, making way for traditional companies to join the fray. Infrastructure can take blockchain past the hype because businesses that need services actually need usability and use cases that help them. Now, products can be as functional as Web2, but designed to incorporate the crypto ecosystem.For example, a group of ex-AWS executives got together and built Mailchain, which simplifies messaging on Web3. It resembles and functions like a basic email setup, but in the background, it services crypto, recreating the abundant functionality from current IT tech in the Web3 space.Other solutions take it even further. Instead of aiming to just about replace Web2 infrastructure, they fundamentally improve it with new functionality. One such example is Document GPS, one of ShelterZoom's signature solutions. It leverages blockchain to tokenize e-mail attachments and other content.


The extension enables users to track their email attachments and revoke access, even after a recipient has opened the email. It also prevents downloads, which can significantly reduce the excessive carbon emissions and data pollution from the repeated uploading and downloading of the tens of billions of attachments sent daily.For the past decade, it has been Gmail's domain alone actually to improve email. But leveraging blockchain, the crypto industry could rapidly catch up to Google's dominance.Related: If You Have No Clue What Web3 Is, You're Not Alone. Here's a Breakdown of the Future of the Internet.Decentralized building changes the fundamentals of building infrastructureBlockchain creates a new dynamic where you may not need one dominant company, like Google or Microsoft, to make all the functionality in one project. Instead, you can have a collection of projects inside one ecosystem — which is in Web3's spirit of fostering democratization.


Ethereum has managed to offer a home to many amazing projects. But with the difficulties of managing bridges safely, and the siloed nature of the L2s and sidechains, perhaps other systems have a greater potential of being home to more all-encompassing ecosystems.Decentralized building is still one of the strengths of blockchain technology. By not depending on a single authority, the direction and future of the system will not be driven by parochial interests. The progress might be messy, but the messiness can also be seen as a complex form of collective deliberation. One killer project at a time, a whole landscape of new potential can bloom.Polkadot, for example, is built to facilitate cross-chain interoperability, allowing multiple Layer-1 solutions to communicate effectively, thereby possibly giving birth to highly functional ecosystems. So far, Polkadot has suffered from a lack of killer applications, and the project progress is slow.Replacing Web2 is a tall order for any technology, and it is doubtful whether blockchain has the goods to do it. Finally, however, the industry is stepping up to the plate. Funky NFTs will keep gathering headlines and imagination, but the infrastructure companies will be the ones to bring Web3 to the forefront.

105,A House Sold as an NFT for the First Time in History,"Oct 19, 2022",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/the-first-nft-home-just-sold-for-175000/437522,"
Despite fluctuating value, NFTS, ""one-of-a-kind"" digital artifacts, are still popular, and items ranging from videos to Tweets to paintings have all been sold as digital collectibles. Now, Web3 and the Metaverse are staking a claim in a new frontier — real estate.An NFT of a real-world home was sold for $175,000 over the weekend in Columbia, South Carolina.The home boasts three bedrooms and was recently renovated, featuring a large living room and dining room area complete with a galley-style kitchen and walkout patio.There's also a master suite complete with a walk-in closet and double vanity.The rental property ""was sold on the Roofstock onChain NFT marketplace by transferring the Home onChain identity to an Ethereum address owned by the house buyer Adam Slipakoff,"" Unusual Whales reported.How Does NFT Home Ownership Work?The LLC of the company that wishes to sell the home creates an NFT representing ownership of the home. Whoever purchases that NFT then has ownership of the property. Though the purchase is digital, the ownership is very real -- whoever owns the NFT owns the physical home in the real world.The historic purchase marks the start of what could potentially be the future of real estate as NFTs, possibly opening doors to make crypto purchases for real estate a viable source of funding.

106,Most Web3 Marketing is Fake. Here's Why.,"Oct 19, 2022",Rafael Guerreiro,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/most-web3-marketing-is-fake-and-fraudulent-heres-what/436434,"
Around October 2021, my attention got caught by what was happening in the NFT space. If you were there, you certainly felt intrigued at how ""pictures of animals"" were being sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars.While my first gut reaction was skepticism at the general sentiment, my curiosity propelled me to learn more. As I dug more into it, all the signs of an unhealthy and unsustainable market were there: the frenetic FOMO, greed, toxic positivity, scarcity and fake urgency.If you experienced being a part of the NFT space during this time, I'm sure you recognized these patterns on many of these projects' Discord, Twitter and Telegram communities. Behind many early ""degen"" projects were greedy marketers taking advantage of the speculative market sentiment and profiting huge sums by spreading narratives of incredible returns and making empty promises of utility in the forms of ""roadmaps.""



But as I struggled to find the value in expensive apes, lions, monkeys and giraffes, I couldn't help but notice the incredible technology (NFTs) at the foundation of all of this. Many entrepreneurs were innovating and pioneering this exciting tech that opens so many doors to real-life use cases for blockchain. As soon as I realized this, I knew I had to be a part of it.Related: Here's a Beginner's Guide to Crypto, NFTs, and the Metaverse


The potential of NFTs and Web3 to disrupt the status quo of so many industries, norms and social structures really caught my attention as an entrepreneur and rebel at heart.And so I decided I wanted to dip my toes into this new ecosystem, and I went after what would be my agency's first client — a P2E NFT game — a use case for NFTs that fascinated me as people could openly and securely transact in-game assets between each other, creating entire digital economies inside of these games.It took me weeks of writing free reports, campaign suggestions and telegram stalking until I got the CEO's attention. After many conversations, I finally signed the contract and agreed to get paid half in tokens (please, don't ever do this). I started by focusing on fixing the many positioning, messaging and communication flaws in the game's existing strategy.My goal was to identify its core attributes and ""sexy traits,"" understand the potential audiences and finally identify the narratives and channels we could leverage for the game's launch, which took place in just six weeks.


The CEO hated that I spent my time and resources focusing on these ""frivolous"" tasks that — according to him — had no impact on the overall campaign. His attention seemed to be entirely on getting as many influencers, Twitter followers, WAGMI's and discord members as possible. After all, that's what he was paying me for (read the irony).That was a red flag, but I needed the case study. So I got him the vanity metrics he was desperate for and kept doing the important work in the background without making it so evident. The launch went well, but I retired their account as soon as it was over.Many web projects in Web3 fail to understand that marketing in this new industry is not as special or different as they might think. The number of well-intentioned (and not-so-well-intentioned) projects that died as fast as they came up during the bull run was overwhelmingly shocking.The main reason behind this was that many marketers, most without any previous ""real-world"" experience, believed that the industry's standards of short-term, manipulative and amateurish marketing tactics were the way to succeed in this space. Too many projects thrived in toxic environments where narratives of greed, future earnings, buzzwords, exaggerated roadmaps and artificially positive communities led to massive and explosive growth.


Vanity numbers and manipulation tactics helped these projects to sell out and thrive momentarily during the NFT bull run. Still, as soon as their members found the next big thing — projects quickly became irrelevant. If a project didn't sell out in 3.5 seconds, their own communities would start spreading FUD, and the valuations of their recently bought NFTs would drastically plummet. Many people entered the NFT space and quickly got burned or scammed. These toxic and short-sighted market dynamics surely left a bad reputation and delayed the progress of the NFT space as a whole.Related: The First-Ever Tweet in NFT Format Sold for $2.9 Million in March 2021. The Most Recent Bid Is $132.So, Web3 Founders and enthusiasts, let's create the next bull run based on healthy narratives, highlighting our project's benefits and value, building trust, credibility, and transparency through our marketing. Let's focus on deploying strategies and campaigns that create and sustain healthy and thriving communities regardless of market conditions. Let's create communities that are genuinely passionate about our products, solutions and the value we're creating for the world.We do this by playing the long-term game. By doing the right things over time, building products and solutions that people really need. By leaving the toxic hype behind as a lesson.


Once we get there as an industry, we will be able to attract and convince the masses instead of repelling them. We will attract the professionals, customers and investors we need to build and sustain the growth and adoption of Web3 projects for years to come.We can genuinely accelerate the implementation of new and innovative business models built on transparency, ownership and decentralization toward the future of this new web. But for that, we need to come together and acknowledge our past mistakes. And to be clear on our path moving forward. And communications and marketing — how we present ourselves to the world and create our communities — is one of the first steps we need to reflect on and ensure we do it right next time.

107,The Metaverse Is the Future of Business. Here's How to Plan for It.,"Oct 18, 2022",Trevor Hubbard,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/the-metaverse-is-the-future-of-business-heres-how-to/435440,"
Twelve years ago, companies didn't hire social media talent — they didn't think they needed it. But now? Businesses need social media directors and entire social media teams. The same is true for playing in the metaverse.It is my belief that within the next three to five years, a minimum of 30% of business is going to come from a blend of metaverse experiences and implementations of Web3 technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence, virtual reality and nonfungible tokens, or NFTs). It is essential for creative agencies (e.g. advertising agencies, marketing agencies, etc.) to prepare how they will play a role in the metaverse now so their customers will be able to find them.Related: What You Need To Know About How the Metaverse Will Affect Business



The big threeThe first step in preparing for the metaverse is for creative agencies to decide which of the three roles they will play — either the expert experimenter, the contributor or the activator. Making this decision now will help companies get ready for when their customers arrive in the metaverse, and it's only a matter of time before they do.Expert experimenters. These are businesses that have an understanding of the metaverse already. To find out whether they are in this group, business leaders can ask themselves if their business strives to be the deep subject matter expert on all things in the digital universe, or whether it's an early adopter at the vanguard of new technologies. In that case, they need to understand the technologies involved within the metaverse and how Web3 is speeding up evolutions and revolutions.Contributors. These are businesses that are still in their infancy in terms of embracing this new wave of technology and deep subject matter expertise is not required. Creative agencies in this group can introduce their client partner brands to the metaverse and converge their physical and digital presence in a way that is profitable and meets customer needs.Activators. This last group is made of businesses that focus on seeking ways to offer holistic experiences for businesses and audiences to have within the metaverse. Businesses in this group are like a hybrid between the expert experimenters and the contributors.Nevertheless, whether you know a little or a lot about Web3, you can't afford to be left out completely; defining your role is an essential first step in preparing for the integration of the metaverse. People are investing in the metaverse heavily. It's expected to reach $5 trillion in value by 2030, and this number is exponentially growing each and every month.

Here's How.Next stepsAfter leadership at creative agencies decide which role they want to play, they need to develop a strategy and strengthen their online presence. To do this, they will want to hire people whose job it is to prepare the company to implement itself into the metaverse, in whichever role the company has chosen to take. Doing this will help them strengthen their brand identity — and thus, brand loyalty — before the metaverse fully arrives (and it's coming sooner than we think).Additionally, leaders and creatives should focus on user experience. What kind of experience do they want their customers to have with their business in the metaverse? This is essential for brands getting established in the metaverse because if they can think one or two steps ahead of what their customers will want when they emerge into the metaverse, brands will be there waiting, ready to give customers what they're looking for.Finally, it's critical for creative agency leaders to remain adaptable as they learn more about the metaverse while it's still unfolding. Staying adaptable and remaining at-the-ready for change will help agencies stay ahead and prepared to meet customers when they find them in the metaverse.

Here's How to Create a Company That Can Thrive Without You.The importance of Web3Even if your agency isn't embracing extended reality and other metaverse projects, experiences and communities quite yet, many of your client partners' customers are. And arguably, meeting customers where they are is the single most important piece to building brands and businesses that grow and transform.The metaverse isn't just a probability — it's inevitable. Throughout the evolution of the internet, waves of advancement emerged because of technological advancement. The internet went from simply being a new technology to sharing the world of information through web browsers to developing social media. Underneath all that were advancements in the programming language, faster internet speeds and, of course, the smartphone.Now, we are in a new wave: the wave of augmented reality (AR), VR and mixed-reality experiences with the technologies to make them work even more soundly and profoundly. If you haven't begun exploring immersive platforms and how you can approach conversations and tactics related to the metaverse with your client partners, the time has come.


Related: The Metaverse Isn't Dying, the ""Experts"" Just Keep Getting It WrongThe natural progressionIf trends in technology really do repeat history, then it won't be long before hanging out in the metaverse becomes more mainstream. We must watch where people go. An immersive virtual world in which customers socialize, shop, relax, work and play isn't so far-fetched anymore.Given there was a time when people thought the idea of online dating, smartphones, social media and real human connection online was scary and too futuristic, it makes sense that agencies might be facing those same fears about the metaverse. The popular movie Her may have seemed sad and dystopian, but there were some interesting predictive themes being provoked in that film. Concepts like love, connection, relationships, identity and community will evolve as they always have over time.However, knowing what we know now, we understand that embracing new technologies is far better than avoiding them. And for creative agencies, it's much more profitable. The metaverse is becoming so much more than a buzzword, and the reality is that advertisers and marketers will be doing business in a virtual world at an exponential rate as seamlessly as they advertise on social media — and very soon. Blending our real and virtual lives has already begun, and the sooner you get on board, develop a point of view and experiment, the better.

108,Popular Astrologer Under Fire For Working With Crypto Lender Celsius Network,"Oct 17, 2022",Gabrielle Bienasz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/crypto-astrologer-maren-altman-faces-backlash-for-celsius/437357,"
Astrologers are already saying it makes sense that Maren Altman was recently attacked online — as Mercury retrograde began at eight degrees Libra in early September.If you don't know what that means, don't worry. (That 8th degree is about ""exposing the ugly truth,"" according to the astrologer.)Altman is an influencer who rose to online fame (in part) for creating content that combined astrology with cryptocurrency predictions. (Astrology tracks the movement of the planets in our solar system and purports that they reflect or indicate current events).



But now, she's facing fire online for taking money from now-defunct, possibly fraudulent cryptocurrency company Celsius Network — and posting a ""free"" video interview with its former CEO, according to CoinDesk.Altman told the outlet she cannot ""overstate the viciousness and insanity of the threats… The equivalent of this would be like if I was paid by Peloton to talk about their bike and investors blamed me for the stock price going down.""


The documents came out via Celsius bankruptcy proceedings and, naturally, Twitter. One user pointed out that Altman had said she wasn't ""paid sh–"" for an interview with former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky.Why lie about being paid? This is from a YT interview she did with Alex Mashinsky in May. pic.twitter.com/HbeeGrq7Qg— ZachXBT (@zachxbt) October 9, 2022Someone else then pointed out that Celsius's documents show she was paid $15,000 from the company in April and May.Looks like @marenaltman was taking $15k/month from $CEL pic.twitter.com/ZQyXHq13LT— BowTiedIguana (@BowTiedIguana) October 7, 2022""The reality is Maren is an astrology grifter who advertised a Ponzi scheme to her followers in exchange for large sums of money. She continues to lead people into meat grinders at no risk to herself,"" one Twitter user commented on the latter Tweet.Altman pushed back on the criticism to CoinDesk.She said in a blog the Mashinsky interview was a ""favor."" Altman also told the outlet she had a separate contract to post about the company until it ended the deal unexpectedly in May (the company paused withdrawals in June) – and that she communicates when her social posts are paid.""My error was trusting Celsius,"" Altman told the outlet. As for the company's finances, she said, she had, ""Not a clue, no visibility on anything other than my marketing campaign.""


The crypto world and more traditional sources started noticing Altman's predictions and online sway last year, with her prediction of a new moon-related dip and then a bull run in January 2021, for example.""When to trade bitcoin? When Saturn crosses Mercury, of course,"" Reuters wrote of her in January 2021.Altman has dealt with online backlash before, however, with people within the Astrological community saying she stole content from creators of color. She did not immediately respond to Entrepreneur's request for comment.Whether or not Mercury retrograde's degree can be cited for why certain people have turned against her online, Altman was pretty clear about what she thinks about this controversy.


""It's like a witch hunt for someone they don't even know,"" she told CoinDesk.

109,The First-Ever Tweet in NFT Format Sold for $2.9 Million in March 2021. The Most Recent Bid Is $132.,"Oct 17, 2022",Gabrielle Bienasz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/news-and-trends/once-worth-29-million-nft-of-first-ever-tweet-is-now-132/437349,"
The NFT of the first-ever Tweet, which was first purchased for $2.9 million, has suffered yet another ground-floor bid — of $132.72.just setting up my twttr— jack (@jack) March 21, 2006Jack Dorsey, co-founder and former CEO of Twitter, auctioned an NFT of the first Tweet in March 2021.



Ending this March 21stWill immediately convert proceeds to #BitcoinAnd send to @GiveDirectly Africa Response— jack (@jack) March 9, 2021Dorsey sold the NFT for $2.9 million, converted the proceeds to Bitcoin, and then donated it to the organization Give Directly, an NGO that allows people to donate string-free to impoverished people around the world.


The NFT's new owner was Sina Estavi, CEO of Malaysia-based cryptocurrency company Bridge Oracle. He then went to list it the following month, and his plan was to then sell the NFT for $48 million and donate half of the result to charity — which failed miserably, per CoinDesk.One of its biggest bids was around $280.But on OpenSea, billed as the world's largest NFT market, someone put in another offer Sunday of even less money, of 0.1 Ethereum, or $132.72.Owners can run specific auctions on OpenSea, but any user can just put in a bid for an NFT at any time.Estavi is still the NFT owner, and it is unclear if he has any interest in selling right now. He did not respond to a request for comment via Twitter DM.Estavi is also coming back from a rocky few years. According to CoinDesk, he was arrested in May 2021 for ""disrupting the economic system"" in his home base of Iran and has been accused of misleading investors.But, he was released after nine months, and in April 2022, set out to revive his crypto token, BRG.Estavi bought his NFT Tweet in a different world for crypto and tech-related ventures at large.The same month Estavi bought the Twitter NFT, The New York Times raked in over half a million for an NFT of one of its columns.Amazon reported a quarterly profit in May 2021 that was 220% higher than the same quarter in 2020. Technology stocks in general pushed the S&P 500 to a record high in October 2021.But it all came crashing down. The tech industry at large has been rocked by layoffs. One high-flying cryptocurrency startup, Celcius, went belly-up, pausing withdrawals and filing for bankruptcy.NFTs are purchased with cryptocurrency, and while the currency has had low periods, this year has been particularly brutal. Bitcoin, for example, lost nearly 60% of its value since the start of the year.
