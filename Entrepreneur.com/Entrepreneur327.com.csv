0,The Most Innovative Leaders Use These 3 Mental Models to Unlock Their Best Ideas,"Apr 23, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/unlock-your-most-innovative-ideas-with-these-3-mental-models/471485,"
In a world where GPS is a thumb stroke away, most people take maps for granted. It's hard to fathom that the oldest surviving maps had little to do with reality. The Babylonian Map of the World, for example, was a clay tablet about the size of a first-generation iPhone. Created between 700 and 500 BC, the map shows Babylon in the middle, with the Euphrates River cutting through the center and the ocean on all sides. As Smithsonian Magazine explains, it wasn't a map for navigation — more of a way for the map-holder to understand the idea of the world around them. Accuracy was an afterthought.It would be centuries before an astronomer and astrologer named Claudius Ptolemy attempted the first realistic map — a two-dimensional depiction of what Ptolemy understood to be a spherical Earth. This is a prime example of when a great thinker applies a new mental model — essentially, a new way of thinking about things; a heuristic for interpreting the world. Rather than accepting earlier, more symbolic pictures of the Earth, Ptolemy ventured to create a true-to-life representation. He shifted the way of thinking from storytelling to describing reality.Mental models help us to understand things more fully and come up with smarter, more innovative solutions. But as Charlie Munger, former vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., used to say, you have to build a ""latticework"" of mental models, employing various models to maximize your understanding of different situations.

1,Your Work Ethic Is Not the Problem — Debunking Three Modern-Day Productivity Myths,"Apr 22, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/lets-debunk-these-3-modern-day-productivity-myths/471744,"
In ancient Greece, philosophers like Plato and Aristotle were already grappling with the notion of work-life balance. The latter described amusement as a remedy for the ""ills of work,"" which he said was accompanied by ""toil and strain."" Work, they acknowledged, was necessary for living a virtuous life — and paying for stuff — but it shouldn't be the end, in and of itself.Nearly two-and-a-half millennia later, we still struggle to define what constitutes a good life and how work and productivity factor in. Our modern-day hustle culture, and many of today's outspoken business leaders, would have you believe that more is more. A steely, unwavering work ethic is a requisite for success. Sleep can wait, so the thinking goes.But a growing body of research plus some innovative companies are showing that the truth about productivity is more nuanced. More isn't always more — but working long hours isn't always bad either. There are no hard and fast rules.

2,Do You Want to Live to Be 100? This Researcher Has the Answer to Why Longevity is Not a Quick Fix or Trendy Diet,"Apr 19, 2024",Elisette Carlson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/do-you-want-to-live-to-be-100-this-researcher-has-the/472338,"
Dan Buettner is an explorer, National Geographic fellow, award-winning journalist and producer, and author of The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer from the People Who've Lived the Longest. In 2000, Buettner traveled to Okinawa, Japan, to investigate why people lived to be 100 and beyond there. With the support of National Geographic, Buettner and his team then traveled around the world in 2004 to explore other regions with reportedly high lifespan, better known as longevity.He identified five places, which he named ""The Blue Zones,"" where people live the longest, healthiest lives. The five original Blue Zones were Okinawa, Japan; Sardinia, Italy; Nicoya, Costa Rica; Ikaria, Greece; and Loma Linda, California. The research and learnings from the five populations where he interviewed many centenarians living high-quality lives became a Netflix Documentary entitled ""Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zones."" Within these communities, people prioritized family values, community, Mediterranean diets and living in walkable neighborhoods.I've known of Dan for years, and while I don't hold his three Guinness World Records in distance cycling, we share a mutual passion for cycling and the outdoors. I intended to dig deeper into his insights regarding how people, especially in America, always look for the quick fix and jump on the latest fad wagon. Be it Ozempic, no alcohol, cold plunging or eating a carnivore diet, I asked Dan for his opinions on these trends, more of which included CrossFit workouts, keto diets and intermittent fasting.



I said to Buettner, ""Amongst all of these protocols, trends, supplements and nutrition plans, where is the magic of longevity?""""There is no short-term fix,"" he responded. ""We keep searching for it, and we keep failing. None of it has been proven to work on humans for more than single digits of a percentage of people.""


Every year, we are marketed to try new diets, supplements and workouts and three months into them, 90% of people fail at what they started. Buettner explained how he discovered five populations that are living long because their daily unconscious behaviors are healthy and sustainable. And guess what? It doesn't cost much.Related: Adopt These 9 Habits and You'll Be Unrecognizable By the End of 2024Nutrition and specific foodsBeginning with food, Buettner explained how people eat so much processed food and tend to rely on a ""see food"" diet. If we see it on our counter or pantry, or there are treats in the office, we eat them and are mindlessly eating.This data was backed by research at Cornell, and in his books, he encourages people to set out bowls of fruit in their kitchens and keep healthy food accessible, including beans and nuts, both of which have strong nutritional benefits and help reduce inflammation. Beans are also loaded with fiber, something that 80-90% of Americans need more of, and they're inexpensive, shelf-stable and benefit the healthy gut bacteria. Buettner also relies on a handful of nuts daily, and his research shows that nuts add 2-3 years to life expectancy.


Buettner eats a plant-based diet, and the five cultures in the Blue Zones mostly do the same. These communities eat meat about once per week, whereas an American eats an average of 240 pounds per year — ""about a bathtub full of meat.""He explained that meat is like radiation in that we know we are likely going to die sooner of Type 2 diabetes or cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. He also loves his coffee and explains that coffee drinkers have lower rates of Type 2 diabetes or Parkinson's and also have better physical endurance and cardiovascular output.Related: These Four Words Can Change The Way You Approach Every Impossible TaskCommunity and purposeYour circle of friends influences happiness, health and a sense of purpose. For example, if you have active friends, you'll likely be active, and if your best friends are obese, there's a good chance you'll be influenced in that direction. ""Upgrade your circle of friends"" to people who will encourage you to be happy and healthy, make you laugh and make you feel good about yourself when you are with them.


Related: Your Peers Shouldn't (Only) Think Like You Moving naturally and avoiding health trends that failSo how about sauna and cold-plunging? Buettner occasionally saunas and believes that cold plunging is already on the decline. Unless you are swimming in the ocean, surfing or doing something you enjoy, he believes that intense cold plunging at 35-40 degrees, which is what most cold plunge studios do, is painful. As with most gym and nutrition trends, people get excited for a few weeks or maybe a year, and then they almost all say, ""Enough.""I loved hearing Buetter explain that the ""no pain, no gain"" mentality is wrong. The opposite is correct and true: ""The least pain, the most gain,"" and doing this long enough to make a difference is precisely what populations in the Blue Zones do. The Blue Zones populations interact with the outside environment, sit down at meals with their family, socialize with friends and prioritize sleep.These are human things that bring joy amongst daily and inexpensive habits that expand lifespan — such as living in walkable neighborhoods where you walk to get your food and run your errands, eating mostly fresh and non-processed food and avoiding things that cause you pain.


When I asked him about Ozempic, he exclaimed, ""Who the hell wants to jam a needle into their gut to lose weight?"" Again, it's another fad miles away from longevity.The number of obese people in America has tripled since 1980, and Buettner explained how this is an unmitigated mental health failure. Most Americans get fewer than 20 minutes of exercise per day, while Blue Zone people walk to most locations, garden or weed in their yards and practice stress-reducing activities, unlike CrossFit, which can raise inflammation and cause injury.Buettner, also an outdoor enthusiast, passionate about ultralight hiking and pickleball, explained that 75% of Americans can benefit by simply walking to work or taking public transportation. The morning we spoke, Buettner told me that he went to get a haircut, had a physical therapy appointment and then picked up some breakfast, all on his bike.I encourage you to watch the Blue Zones documentary to learn more about specific longevity lifestyle habits. If we all adjusted just a few small daily habits, it might just help us 'Live to 100.'

      Key Takeaways    



        Goodfriend turned his passion for food tours into a business with some encouragement from his friends. 
      


        The business made about $30,000 a year before Goodfriend was laid off from Meta and went full-time with the venture.
      


        Goodfriend appreciates being able to ""pursue something I love and earn a salary from it.""
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Scott Goodfriend, who was working as an executive producer in New York City when he launched Ultimate Food Tours. Goodfriend coordinates food tours all over New York City, ""allowing the participants to experience the city's culinary scene in a whole new light.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Ultimate Food Tours. Scott Goodfriend. When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it? I moved to New York from Los Angeles in 2011. I always loved traveling and getting lost walking through different cities. When I moved to New York, I was fascinated by the ability to visit anywhere in the world by subway, even neighborhoods that were far away. I researched different restaurants and then started thinking, well, maybe I can eat at a few different places, so I started planning walking routes to different eateries on Google Maps. My friends found out I was doing this and wanted to join.



Eventually, the word spread. My friends and family from out of town started calling me when they came to visit New York. They would tell me about a neighborhood they wanted to explore and ask if I could plan a food tour. I enjoyed the challenge and was happy to do this, and I probably ended up planning 50-100 tours over seven or so years.Related: TV Shows All Entrepreneurs Should Be Watching


During this entire time, I was a broke freelance TV producer living in the East Village who lived off a fair amount of $1 pizza. I lived close to Chinatown and figured I could probably take a short walk and find something better. I not only found delicious food but also discovered the variety, depth and complexity of Chinese food, which I became obsessed with. I started doing tons of research into the regions, cuisines and history and the Chinese experience on the Lower East Side. I started taking people to Chinatown, and they fell in love with the tour. They told me to do this as a business, and I always poo-pooed the idea, saying I didn't want to build a website or do the marketing (sweet, sweet irony — but more on that later). My friend encouraged me to put my tour on something called Airbnb Experiences. I posted the Chinatown tour on Airbnb in 2019; it got to the top of Airbnb in a short timeframe. Then, Covid-19 hit, which shut my operations down for over a year.In 2021, I reworked the tour and put it back on Airbnb, and it got to the top of the ""Activities to do in NYC"" list. People started asking me what other tours I had, so I wrote more. Eventually, I had to hire people to help run the tours and help with the marketing. It got overwhelming because I was also working my dream job as an augmented reality producer at Meta, but then….I was part of the Meta layoffs in 2023! I had a decision to make: Go work for another company I really loved and respected, or pursue my entrepreneurial dreams. I decided to pursue Ultimate Food Tours full-time. It's been great, and I've learned so much doing it. I am really glad I made the jump.Related: This Dad Started a Side Hustle to Save for His Daughter's College Fund — Then It Earned $1 Million and Caught Apple's Attention


What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?The biggest challenge while building my business was deciding where to focus and invest my time. You need to be strategic about what parts of the business you invest in and focus on. Since entrepreneurship doesn't have a playbook, the answer is often to go for it, analyze the results, learn from it and do better next time.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?Ultimate Food Tours evolved tremendously over the last few years, and I'm lucky enough for it to be my full-time job now. Before switching to this as a full-time role, I was making around $30,000 a year. I probably saw consistent revenue between the second and third years. At this time, I was only pursuing Ultimate Food Tours on the weekends, so I was making around several thousand dollars a month.What does total annual revenue look like now?Currently, I generate around $200,000 a year and have seen the brand grow by about three times year-over-year.Related: This Insurance Agent Started a Side Hustle Inspired By Nostalgia for His Home State — Now It Earns Nearly $40,000 a Month


What do you enjoy most about this side hustle? I love being able to leverage my passions and turn them into business strategies. A great example of this is our content marketing. I come from a family of foodies, and I have always loved history and making videos, so I created a social series called Origin Stories, which tells the history behind New York's famous foods and the best places to eat them. We have three seasons and plan to begin long-form content soon. I am so proud of this because we get to use our platform to drive traffic to local restaurants while simultaneously building our own brand. It's conceptualizing and executing these win-win strategies that really got me excited about running a business.Being an entrepreneur is a lifestyle! When I first started, I was putting in around 20 hours a week. Since making my side gig my full-time job, I probably work between 50-60 hours a week. Combining my passion with my livelihood allows me the flexibility to pursue something I love and earn a salary from it. I also utilize outside technology that helps streamline my finances and save me time to focus on my business and personal life.What's your advice for others hoping to start successful side hustles of their own?Stay organized! It's easy to get overwhelmed with various spreadsheets and different numbers flying around. Using an accounting sofware helps free up time on my schedule, allowing me to turn my attention to other areas of the business like marketing and developing additional tours.Whatever idea you have, whatever your big dream is, take that first step now! Buy that domain name, make that social media post, whatever it is. Just do one small thing a day, and the rest will fall into place. Make it part of your routine, and you'll see a return.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.


If you're working a full-time job, try to bite off what you can chew and plan your side hustle schedule around your current commitments. You'll be able to see if it has room to grow, and if you do think you want to make it your full-time thing, start putting things in place that prepare you to make the jump when you feel ready.Network and talk to other entrepreneurs! The most valuable thing I found was talking to other people who started businesses and food tour companies of their own. They knew what needed to be done and were able to fill in a lot of the gaps in managing my time and gave me the insights needed to successfully launch my own business.

4,They Designed One Simple Product With a 'Focus on Human Health' — and Made $40 Million Last Year,"Apr 18, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/simple-health-focused-product-led-to-40m-in-revenue-in-2023/472859,"
Branch Basics founders Marilee Nelson, Allison Evans and Kelly Love ""never set out to sell soap,"" let alone launch a cleaning brand that would generate tens of millions in annual sales.But the company's ""mission to create healthy homes"" while keeping cleaning routines simple continues to resonate with customers — 50% of whom are returning, according to the brand. Among other select accessories, Branch Basics offers a comprehensive ""starter kit,"" which features a fragrance-free, ""plant- and mineral-based"" cleaning concentrate along with various glass bottles that can be filled with different combinations of the solution and water to meet specific needs: from wiping down a bathroom counter to doing a load of laundry.Image Credit: Courtesy of Branch Basics. Marilee Nelson, left; Allison Evans, center; Kelly Love, right.



The story of how the company came to be begins with Nelson, who, after battling chronic illness, was told that she'd never have kids and needed to go on dialysis. Nelson wasn't sold on the prognosis and turned to another doctor who used ""food as medicine"" — a leap of faith that ""literally changed her life,"" eradicating those health issues and even inspiring her to become a medicinal cook. Later, after her 10-year-old son was exposed to pesticides and suffered brain and immune system damage, she took another hard look at environmental factors that might contribute to healing.""His immune system had been so damaged that he could not detoxify the things we're all exposed to every day,"" Nelson says, ""and he would have extreme reactions. I took one box and thought, Oh, I'll keep my favorite perfumes in here, favorite skincare products and things, in the closet, and when he gets better, I will bring them back out."" However, according to Nelson, the box's removal made such a significant difference that it showed her ""how important it is to [recognize] how powerful these chemicals are."" Nelson's son started to heal, and when word of mouth spread, she developed a course to help other people better understand the products in their homes.


Related: How This Pediatrician-Turned-Entrepreneur Transformed a Health Policy into a Consumer Product for Kids""Of course, the type of fuel we put in our bodies matters for how we feel.""Nelson's niece, Allison, had a similar experience. Diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, Evans was told by doctors that ""no lifestyle change"" could help her heal and to take birth control indefinitely; in college, she faced a range of symptoms — muscle aches, loss of motor skills and more — and says she was prescribed numerous medications to no avail. At the time, Evans and her aunt Marilee weren't particularly close, but she consulted with her and realized that some simple lifestyle changes just might help her feel better.According to Evans, removing certain products with synthetic ingredients and eating whole foods did help her condition improve, and as graduation neared, she decided to spend eight weeks with Nelson in the Texas Hill Country, where she'd learn more about healthy living from her aunt. Her friend Kelly joined her, and despite being in good health, also noticed a transformation — ""My dry itchy eyes, headaches, muscle aches are all gone,"" Love recalls, adding, ""the more I learned about all this, it just made sense to me: Of course, the type of fuel we put in our bodies matters for how we feel, how we think, how we act.""

The organization also notes that even naturally occurring fragrances, such as citrus, ""can react to produce dangerous pollutants indoors.""


""Nontoxic"" labels on products aren't the be-all and end-all either, Nelson notes. After all, ""it's the dose that makes the poison,"" as the Swiss physician and chemist Paracelsus said nearly 500 years ago. According to Nelson, looking at the ingredients themselves is key. The founders want people to feel empowered to examine any product — from Branch Basics or another company — and understand the ingredients being used. To that end, they offer a $99 ""Toss the Toxins"" course to ""walk you through a step-by-step process to remove products that pollute your home and body.""Related: Go Green Or Go Home: 3 Ways Industrial Facilities Can Clean Up Their Acts""Our 32-ounce liquid concentrate cleans your windows, cleans your baby's bottom, cleans your produce.""Branch Basics' ""minimalist"" product line is meant to make the whole process easier — and save time.

It's so safe it can be used on the skin.""


""Our 32-ounce liquid concentrate cleans your windows, cleans your baby's bottom, cleans your produce, takes off your eye makeup, cleans your countertops [or] your hardwood floors — whatever depending on the the ratio,"" Evans adds.The approach is resonating with customers, the company reports. Gross sales grew around 42% year over year from 2022 to 2023, with revenue hitting $40 million last year. The company currently has more than 50,000 product subscribers, 600,000 email subscribers and 10,000 five-star reviews on its concentrate and Oxygen Boost, which amplifies the power of the concentrate ""for tough cleaning jobs.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Branch Basics""We know that human health is our priority...

What's more, Branch Basics boasts a 6% referral rate compared to the industry's 2% average.""We approach everything [by asking] What do we want?"" Love says. ""What's missing in the market? What do we, as people who are moms, as people who are health-conscious, need and want? Because, most likely, other people would need and want those things, too. We know that human health is our priority, so when we formulate products or make our marketing plans, [that] keeps everything aligned.""This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

Responses have been edited and condensed for clarity.Image Credit: Courtesy of CCRSP INC. Dr. Amareen Dhaliwal. How were you introduced to EdTech, and what inspired you to start your side hustle in that space?When I had the opportunity to tutor STEM classes in college, I quickly realized teaching was my passion. I excelled on the newly formatted MCAT and decided I wanted to help students achieve higher scores (one of my students even reached the 99th percentile!). A college friend suggested I create a pre-med club focused on innovative learning experiences, which sparked my interest in curriculum development and the use of learning management systems supported by professionals in medical and scientific fields. The idea to build a website and offer tutoring services emerged after I hosted a successful MCAT seminar, and my commitment to tutoring in college laid the foundation for my future endeavors.



My tutoring venture expanded into a holistic coaching experience, which focused on the psychology of studying, anxiety management and wellness, including the utilization of 24-hour planners, exercise and nutrition. This comprehensive approach led me to pursue a psychiatry residency. Despite not initially seeing myself as a business person, the need for innovation in MCAT preparation drove me to entrepreneurship.Related: Best New Shows for Entrepreneurs (Streaming Free)


After collaborating with peers in clinical trials, we launched online clinical research courses, aiming for excellence and continuous improvement. This endeavor was more than a business; it was about making a meaningful impact and addressing broader needs. CCRPS INC was founded to address the underemployment of foreign medical graduates and healthcare professionals in the U.S. despite their impressive credentials. Together with colleagues in clinical trials, we aimed to provide educational courses to help these individuals secure entry-level positions that offer both competitive salaries and a sense of purpose. We established a strong online presence, developed expert-led courses and focused on education and career preparation. Our commitment to quality content quickly earned us recognition and trust, positioning CCRPS as a leader in the field.What were some of the first steps you took to get CCRPS off the ground?First, we identified our niche by recognizing a gap for non-clinical medical professionals seeking valuable career paths. We built a user-friendly website and formed partnerships with providers, building trust by seeking out video and audio reviews from graduate students to help other students have a better idea of our comprehensive and in-depth educational approach. We collaborated with experts to create high-quality course materials and secured the necessary accreditations to establish credibility. We also offered comprehensive career support and focused on quality education, which spurred organic growth through referrals and a robust online presence.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building the side hustle, and how did you navigate them?Building and growing a startup requires constant ""figuring out"" of challenges. The biggest challenge was meeting and surpassing our clients' needs so they could continue to grow. Additionally, delegating to the right people requires trial and error; you can't expect to get it right from day one! The key to overcoming these challenges is learning to be okay with the ups and downs, being the rock when changes don't go as planned and consistently providing excellent services.Related: This Insurance Agent Started a Side Hustle Inspired By Nostalgia for His Home State — Now It Earns Nearly $40,000 a Month


How long did it take you to see consistent revenue from your work within EdTech?From the outset, our business achieved net profitability, a testament to our compelling curriculum. Starting with one in-person student whose enrollment funded our initial website and SEO efforts, we adopted a strategy that allowed us to reinvest early profits into expanding our operations. This approach was essential in both our foundational stages and as we scaled, particularly with the MCAT company.Despite promising early enrollments, our focus has always been on student success and quality education rather than merely generating revenue. This commitment enabled us to reduce prices over time, making education more accessible and aligning with our belief in the importance of affordable education. Engaging students meaningfully requires commitment, evidenced by our successful partnerships with contract research organizations and our lean yet effective operational model.How do you balance your entrepreneurial pursuits with a demanding career in medicine?Following a year-long hiatus to launch CCRPS, I transitioned back into my residency. Today, brilliant clinical research professionals and a solid team manage the day-to-day operations and business aspects, ensuring student success remains a priority at CCRPS while I fully immerse myself and focus on my residency.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades.

What do you enjoy most about running your own business?I appreciate the profound influence I can have on students' success and career advancement. Witnessing their growth, seeing their achievements and knowing that we play a pivotal role in shaping their futures is incredibly rewarding and reaffirms my passion for education entrepreneurship every day. With over 22,000 student members from more than 1,200 organizations, including six government agencies and 308 universities, the reach and influence of CCRPS are evident. A 2024 LinkedIn review of graduates highlighted remarkable outcomes, with placements in over 1,600 companies and 23% achieving managerial roles or higher. Furthermore, the initiative has significantly contributed to developing the clinical research workforce for various contract research organizations. This progress, driven by a team of exceptional clinical research educators, underscores the collective effort and dedication to advancing clinical trials and healthcare.What's your advice for others hoping to start successful businesses?Learning how to harness and delegate our strengths effectively is crucial. Sometimes, guidance from those who've walked the path before us can be a game-changer; seeking expert mentorship in areas we find challenging can make all the difference.Start small and focus on what matters: In a world brimming with startups, it's vital to remember that at the heart of every idea and venture are the people we aim to help. They are our priority, always. Let's embrace our unique talents, lean into learning and always put people first.This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

7,"This Emergency Room Doctor Has Seen It All — And in Moments of Failure, He Shares The 2 Things That Help Him Start Again","Apr 15, 2024",Jon B. Becker,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-a-trauma-doctors-death-ritual-can-change-your/471605,"
If you are an emergency room physician, death and the fear of failure are constant companions. A countdown timer starts when a patient arrives with a fatal wound or condition. If that timer reaches zero, the patient will die. If it is prevented from reaching zero, the patient will survive and live to fight another day.It is literally a race against the clock, and the role of the ER physician is to battle that timer directly through medical interventions that either solve the problem or keep the patient alive long enough for a trauma surgeon, interventional cardiologist or other specialist to solve the issue that is killing them.As you might imagine, when the ER staff wins that fight and saves a life, it is a fantastic feeling, but when they fail and lose a patient, it is devastating. Worse yet is when they lose a patient who could have been saved because they either made an error or did not have the required resources to save the person. Every ER Doctor has memories of the patients that they lost. In fact, a requirement for a long and healthy career in emergency medicine is the ability to find peace with this notion.



I recently had the opportunity to spend time with Dr. Dan Dworkis, an ER physician, Professor at the USC Keck School of Medicine, Medical Director of the Mission Critical Teams Institute, Podcast host and the author of The Emergency Mind. Dan has spent his career working in emergency rooms. In fact, not just emergency rooms but a busy trauma center in Los Angeles.As you might imagine, Dan has seen it all and, as a result, carries the stories and memories that come with working at a hospital that is frequented by children who have been shot, traumatic car accidents and people with life-threatening injuries and illnesses.


Dan has spent a big part of his career studying how we make decisions under stress, how to operate in high-stress environments and how to create a culture of continuous improvement. Not surprisingly, I learned a lot from Dan. But, by far, the most profound thing I learned from Dan was a unique way to approach failure and, in the process, open ourselves up to growth and learning.Related: The 5 Key Qualities of a Good LeaderThe ritual: Learning by embracing lossAs you can imagine, trauma physicians see quite a bit of death. No matter how good a doctor you are, you will lose patients, and some of those people certainly could have been saved with different skills or different resources. It would be easy to simply block yourself off from these feelings, to harden your heart, and to put these bad experiences into a mental box that you lock away. While this might not be great for your mental health, it is certainly a seemingly easier thing than confronting these memories and feelings. Yet, Dan actually advocates doing the complete opposite, leaning into the failure and attacking it directly.When a patient dies, there is an awkward moment immediately afterward where the team that treated the patient must transition away from that fight and move on to another. Despite just a few minutes before waging a war to save their life, the team must move on from this person. Machines must be turned off, tubes and wires removed, and each team member must emotionally reset and get back to work.


It would be easy at that point to block the feelings and doubts that arise, place them in a box and move on to the next task while hoping never to think about those feelings again. But that is not what Dan does or advocates. Instead, he engages in a ritual that he was taught as a young doctor, which is to gather the team at the bedside of the patient, place a hand on the deceased patient, and utter the following phrase: ""Thank you for teaching me. I am sorry that all I could do for you today was learn.""This seemingly simple act and brief statement is more than just a ritual to clear the mind before moving on. Instead, it is a deeply profound approach to situations where we cannot succeed and lays a strong foundation for learning and growth.Related: 2 Phrases I Learned From a Senior CIA Officer That Changed My Leadership StyleEmbracing failureThe first significant thing that this ritual does is acknowledge and embrace failure. Rather than moving on and pretending that something profoundly negative didn't just happen, this ritual looks failure square in the eye and leans into the discomfort of the situation. It embraces failure and immediately triggers the learning process.


The first step to growth is the recognition and admission that what we currently do or know is not sufficient. To learn from others, we have to accept our own shortcomings, and this practice opens the door to that and to discovering something better. If we do not admit to our shortcomings, we cannot improve, and this is precisely the point of this ritual.Simply look at the phrase, ""Thank you for teaching me. I am sorry that all I could do for you today was learn."" By its nature, it says I failed you today, and I wish I had more to give. It doesn't say, ""It's too bad you died,"" or ""Wow, rough break you got."" It says, ""I am sorry."" It embraces that the team didn't have enough to save the person (and to be fair, no one may have been able to save them), but simply that acknowledgment doesn't go far enough. Rather, it says I ""learned from you."" It implicitly says, ""I will be better next time"" and ""I am growing and improving my skills."" It is active, not passive, and immediately takes the first step toward learning. ConclusionA profound lesson extends far beyond the medical field and this single ritual to all of us. Whether you are an entrepreneur, a business leader, or even a parent, creating a culture of learning from mistakes and continuous improvement is critical to getting better. We should never run from our errors or try to hide them. We should embrace our failures and view them as perfect opportunities to grow. By establishing a process that immediately addresses our failures or shortcomings, we also immediately focus our attention on how we can improve, where we have deficiencies and perhaps most importantly, we immediately begin the process of learning and growth.

8,5 Ways to Maximize Your Returns at Live Conferences,"Apr 12, 2024",Lena Grundhoefer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/maximize-your-roi-at-live-conferences-with-these-5/472055,"
Conferences are among the most important marketing avenues for my consultancy, and I'm not alone. The global live event industry (which includes live sports and concerts, corporate events, and conference and exhibitions) surpassed $650 billion last year and is projected to reach $1.2 trillion by 2032.Of course, it's worth mentioning that conferences aren't guaranteed success. E3 was once the most important annual video game event, but it struggled to remain relevant after the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and inevitably shut down permanently in December. Although sad, it's an anomaly in a recovering industry–events like CES, SXSW and ComicCon bounced back and continue to prove their value for major brands and professionals alike.Major players like Apple, Amazon and Coca-Cola have robust live event strategies, so clearly, the return on investment is there for planners, buyers and exhibitors from the top brands in the world.



The average trade-show budget for exhibitors was $1.4 million last year, an increase even from pre-pandemic levels. Add-ons like panel and stage participation, awards and strategic advertising throughout the event increase costs. However, calculating the ROI of these expenses can get complicated.Related: How to Network at Events Like a Pro and Watch Your Startup SoarThrough working countless events and putting many hours behind the upsides and even pitfalls, here are five tips to maximize your ROI at events.1. Lean into your brandingBranding is perhaps the most important factor for attending, sponsoring or exhibiting at a major event. In fact, research found conferences can increase brand recognition by up to 76%, although 85% of exhibitors say their primary reason for attending is to generate leads and sales (covered in the next point).To maximize this benefit, be sure everything you bring with you to the show improves your branding down to every detail. This includes what your team wears to the event, any merch you plan to hand out, marketing materials, brochures, clipboards and pens used, and more. These events fly by fast, with a lot going on at once, and it's important to make a lasting impression quickly for the best possible results.2. Nail a clear call to actionAs mentioned above, sales leads are the lifeblood of any business, and conferences can make or break your company. That's why it's necessary to have a clear call to action in all of your branded materials. If you forge a strong connection with a potential prospect, you need to close the sale before they talk to someone else and forget.


Conferences last from a couple of days to a week, and you'll meet hundreds or even thousands of potential prospects in that time. You should have a highly polished elevator pitch (30 to 60 seconds) that easily highlights the selling points of your business, and it needs to end with a simple and intuitive CTA to ensure you complete the necessary sales to guarantee an ROI.And following up a week or two after the event is equally important in closing the deal.Related: 5 Ways to Make the Most Out of an Industry Conference3. Leverage satellite eventsEveryone assumes the business happens on the trade floor, but little do they know the handshakes happen in intimate settings. Every conference has satellite events, and these typically happen at the various venues surrounding the main event venue. Decision-makers often attend these get-togethers to network, and these side events are where it's at.


These side events are also a great way to benefit without a ticket to the main event. It's not unusual for aspiring entrepreneurs to lurk outside the main convention to learn more about side events happening after hours and stake those out to meet potential investors and clients. A handshake deal after hours can make the difference between a win and a loss at the event.4. Tag teaming makes the dream workOrganization is the best way to ensure success, and conferences are best handled with a team of three or more people. Throughout the event, the exhibition floor remains active, and there are plenty of conferences and panel discussions happening simultaneously. It's impossible to be everywhere at once unless you have a team willing to divide and conquer.Set up a time and place to meet at the end of the day, and keep two-way radios on hand, as event Wi-Fi can be spotty. These small radios have about a six-mile radius, which is more than enough to keep you in contact throughout any major event. Staying in contact with each other ensures you maximize potential opportunities throughout the event without doubling up on each other's efforts.Related: 5 Tips to Networking at Conferences as an Introvert


5. Have fun!Above all else, it's important to have fun when attending conferences. Although it's a business trip, these events can be a fun place to meet up with people you've only worked with virtually. Getting to know other people and learning new things can help you build your community, even if you don't close the deal.ConclusionConferences are a cornerstone of business, and even at the height of pandemic lockdowns, live virtual events came through. If you're looking for a way to elevate your business to the next level, attending a live conference or conference can be the way to go.It's not guaranteed, though–these events are expensive, with tickets that can cost thousands of dollars and exhibits and sponsorships that easily cost seven to eight figures. Without careful planning, it's easy to waste money without any tangible ROI. Some people even find success offsite without ever buying a ticket to the main event.Be sure you have a solid plan and execute on it for the best possible outcome. If you do it right, you can easily land the deal that makes up for the cost of the event and creates sustainable long-term success for your business.

9,We Live in a Data-Driven World — Here's a Case For Listening to Your Gut Instead,"Apr 12, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/its-a-data-driven-world-but-i-say-listen-to-your-gut/471040,"
Fresh or frozen? That was the million dollar question facing restaurateur Danny Meyer following a searing New York Times review. The local rag had torn into Meyer's slowly growing Shake Shack empire — then about 30 restaurants — for serving frozen french fries. Pride wounded, Meyer quickly switched to fresh fries without thoroughly researching the alternative. If he had, he may have discovered that fresh fries have to be fried three separate times, and the taste and quality are inconsistent. A year later, the burger chain converted back to frozen.The takeaway? Meyer should have listened to his gut. Despite the review, high-quality frozen fries were working for customers. You know the adage: If it's not broken, don't fix it. And second, Meyer could have dug more into the data and researched the proposed business change. He may have realized that it wasn't worth switching to fresh — that his intuition had been right all along. It's a prime example of why leaders should pay heed to data and their gut.In recent years, there's been a big push toward data-driven decision-making.

10,Feeling Overwhelmed at Work? Follow These Tips to Prevent It From Turning Into Burnout.,"Apr 11, 2024",Cyrus Claffey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/feeling-overwhelmed-at-work-heres-how-to-handle-it/472314,"
Running a successful business isn't just about finding a lightning-in-a-bottle idea or hiring a great team to surround yourself with; it's also about staying motivated and making sure you don't become too overwhelmed. Keep in mind, however, that acknowledging that you're overwhelmed isn't a sign of weakness but of great self-awareness.It's a skill to step back from a project and say, ""I'm swamped, and I need more help on this project or time away to regroup."" As a business founder and owner at ButterflyMX, I've learned that how you proceed after this acknowledgment is key to not letting your overwhelm turn into burnout.Related: Overwhelmed? These 10 Techniques Can Help You Cope With Uncomfortable Feelings.



Early indications of being overwhelmedIn order to prevent being overwhelmed from morphing into burnout, you have to first be able to detect it. This is hard because many early indications of being overwhelmed are subtle and can be mistaken for typical workplace stress. Still, keeping tabs on the indicators to see if they become persistent over time is a good way to become aware of overwhelm early.Here are a few key indicators that you're becoming overwhelmed at work:


Never-ending feelings of anxiety surrounding projects, meetings and deadlines.Consistently working extended hours that considerably disrupt your work-life balance.Feeling a continual decline in job satisfaction despite achievements.A focus on formerly routine tasks and deadlines as grueling and taxing.You feel like you're facing challenges you can't handle rather than healthily challenging yourself.Overall, when your focus at work shifts from the solutions you're finding to the problems you're facing, you're probably reaching a tipping point. So, it's important to face this issue head-on before it becomes unmanageable.What fuels the state of being overwhelmed?You've determined that you may be overwhelmed, which could very easily turn into burnout at work. What's next? Determining what's fueling your overwhelmed feelings could point you toward a solution.So, what fuels the state of being overwhelmed?


There are a handful of reasons one might become overwhelmed at work. The pressure to grow and climb the corporate ladder, the wish to be a linchpin member of your team or simply the desire to appease your boss and colleagues are all common reasons people become overwhelmed. Noticing that you've felt any or all of these things in conjunction with key indicators of overwhelm may mean that it's time for you to set more professional boundaries.Related: 7 Tips to Avoid Burnout When Growing a BusinessSetting professional boundariesWhen responding to feeling overwhelmed, you don't need to drop all of your responsibilities in order to avoid burnout. Instead, you can reassess your task management style in order to set more firm professional boundaries. When doing this, look at how you prioritize projects, how you delegate tasks and how you and your team members manage your time. You may think that you're doing all of these things well, but until you take a step back and really examine how you manage your tasks, you're unlikely to reduce your frustrations.But what exactly does setting professional boundaries look like? This varies from professional to professional, but most of the time, it starts with the same few things.


First, map out and clearly communicate when projects must be completed, so you and your team are on the same page about deadlines.Second, delegate tasks to your direct reports — and have them delegate to their own teams. Not only does delegating tasks immediately lighten your workload, but it also gives your direct reports the chance to challenge themselves by doing a task outside of their comfort zone. Just be sure to check in on their progress and offer helpful feedback on their work.Third, set professional boundaries to avoid being overwhelmed, which includes project prioritization. Do you have two projects due the same week and don't know which to start with? Consider which project will affect the largest group of people. If one project is a report due that needs to be completed before a larger project can move forward, and your other project is a draft that won't be published for several days or even weeks, start with the report. And if you ever need to push a deadline back in order to prioritize a more pressing project, inform those who will be affected well ahead of time to avoid surprises.Related: 7 Ways to Reduce Stress When You Are Overwhelmed and Need to Prioritize


Recovering from feeling overwhelmedOnce you've faced your feeling of being overwhelmed head-on, you need to apply long-term solutions to ensure that the same lingering threat of burnout doesn't plague your future. But how can you do this?Recognizing areas of imbalance at work is important, but the steps you take to achieve stability are even more important. Keeping a healthy balance of professional challenges, workloads and professional relationships is key to becoming a successful worker long-term.Remember, knowing that you're feeling overwhelmed and taking steps to improve is not an admission of defeat. It's a mark of self-awareness and dedication to the greater good of your company.

11,"Following These Five Practices Dramatically Improved My Mental Health — Find Out If They Could Help You, Too.","Apr 8, 2024",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-following-these-5-practices-saved-my-mental-health/470699,"
Mental health affects all of us. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), 1 in 5 adults experience a mental illness every year. Both NAMI and Forbes Health cite suicide as the second leading cause of death in adolescents ages 10 to 14 years alone. The CDC reported a 2.4% increase in the number of adults receiving mental health treatment between 2019 and 2021. There's no doubt that poor mental health affects our ability to thrive in our relationships and at home, work and school.Mental health can be a challenging thing to manage. Nine years ago, I decided I wanted to learn more about it, and I hired a licensed therapist (who I still see weekly). After nearly a decade of focus, I've found that the following five practices dramatically improve our mental and emotional well-being. I discuss these practices with my clients on a daily basis, and literally all of them report positive effects from practicing them.Related: We Need a Real Commitment to Mental Health at Work. Here's How (and Why).



1. Identify and then prioritize the things that matter most to youIt's easy to get swept up in the demands of others and forget about ourselves. Determine what activities, hobbies, events and jobs you love most and prioritize those things. Mental wellness often seems to disappear when we don't make time for the things that make us tick. It doesn't matter whether it's pickup soccer, painting or playing guitar. Figure out what you love to do and regularly spend time doing it. Have dreams and articulate them.If you've always wanted to learn to speak a foreign language or write a book, I recommend you don't lose sight of that. For some, these goals are forgotten once we have children or start to age. I recognize it's hard to juggle and balance the demands of a family or career with your own needs and interests, but it's not impossible. It starts with you believing it can be done and committing to doing it — no matter what. To start, create a vision board or mission statement and post it somewhere you can see it. This helps remind us of the things that matter most.


2. Set and enforce boundariesDon't be afraid to say no. Some of us were raised to be people-pleasers and feel compelled to always ""do it all."" This thinking is misguided. Anytime we say yes to one thing, we're automatically saying no to something else. If that ""something else"" is always yourself, you're likely not caring for your mental health. In my expeirendce, this will catch up with you. Unhappy, frustrated and burnt-out individuals spend a tremendous amount of time doing things for other people and not nearly enough time doing things for themselves. Figure out what you really want to do and what you don't. Then, articulate it confidently and without guilt.As Stephen Covey said, ""It's easier to say no when we have a greater yes in mind."" When you know what matters most (to you), you'll have an easier time making (and protecting) space for it. To start, give the things you most want to accomplish a place to live and breathe on your calendar. Use Outlook or another calendar to schedule time for your top priorities — this will help you say no when a last-minute conflict arises.Related: Entrepreneurs Are Scheduling Their Days Down to the Minute for Ultimate Success3. Honor and validate your emotionsMany of us like to be right. Understandable; it feels good to know things and be correct. However, sometimes our desire to be right stands in the way of us actually doing what's right. It's not uncommon to gaslight others. Frequently, people invalidate the experiences, beliefs and emotions of others just because they don't mirror their own. Learn to recognize that you can't control how often this happens to you, but you can control your response. Make a point to regularly connect with yourself and truly understand your feelings. Once you know what those are, trust and listen to them. Don't allow yourself to be talked out of them.


Getting advice and mentorship from someone you deeply care about (who also has your best interests at heart) is one thing. Being gaslit by someone who feels threatened by your success or is uncomfortable with a difference of opinion is entirely another. If you choose to be influenced or persuaded, make sure it's for the right reason. To start, regularly journal or talk to a therapist (or coach) about how you feel. This helps you connect with yourself and be self-aware of what you're really experiencing.4. Celebrate every step of your journeyWhen it comes to pursuing big goals, the road is long. It can be easy to become discouraged. Remember to celebrate your efforts along the way, not just at the end. Make time to acknowledge what you've done well and choose to be proud of yourself. Instead of focusing on perfection, focus on progress. Are you wiser, stronger and braver than you were a few months ago? What about a year ago? If the answer is yes, then make sure you choose to feel good about yourself and where you're at, even if you're not completely done yet. To start, keep a gratitude journal or list of your accomplishments. Catalog specific things that are working well. If you do this consistently, you'll rewire your tendency to see the negative or engage in any sort of negative self-talk. Instead, you'll notice far more of the good. And that feels good.Related: 3 Reasons to Celebrate Small Wins in Your Business5. Only associate with people who support your mental healthWho we surround ourselves with matters. Many people who struggle with mental well-being keep the company of others who actively try to undermine them. Ultimately, we tend to adopt the beliefs, values and mindset of those we see the most. If you associate with negative people who complain, you'll develop a tendency to do the same thing. If you associate with catty people who love to gossip, you'll develop a tendency to judge as well.


It's been said that ""Two things prevent us from happiness: living in the past and observing others."" If we care about our mental well-being, it's important to surround ourselves with like-minded people. Spend time with others who have goals, pursue their purpose with passion, set and enforce boundaries and will respect you as you do the same. To start, take inventory of the people with whom you spend your time. How do you feel when you're around them? Do they support and encourage you? Do they champion your goals? If not, limit your interactions with them and replace that time with these other activities.Most of us face a tremendous amount of outside pressure from our bosses, families and even friends. It can be extremely hard to prioritize ourselves and our well-being over the demands of others — but we must. As hard as it is to show up for ourselves, regularly practicing these five principles will make it easier.

Everyone knows the exasperation of unnecessary friction.We've all navigated systems that create maddening ordeals rather than give us simple answers, services, or refunds. We've sat through endless meetings with blabbermouths and ill-defined agendas. We've pulled our hair out over rules, procedures, traditions, and technologies that once made sense, but are now antiquated, pointless, and inefficient. These are all soul-crushing forms of organizational friction that make it difficult to do simple things. And as professors at Stanford's School of Engineering and Graduate School of Business, we spent the last seven years researching the causes and cures for these problems.But one of our biggest discoveries surprised us. It turns out that friction isn't always a problem. In fact, sometimes it can be a solution.

This Q&A features Lauren Myrick, founder and CEO of Found. Myrick raised more than $75.2 million from leading VCs including Sequoia Capital, Founders Fund and Lightspeed Venture Partners to build a better banking system for self-employed freelancers and independent workers. Image credit: Courtesy of FoundWhat inspired the idea for Found?I've seen the frustrations of small business owners firsthand through my personal and professional life. On a personal note, my sister is a yoga studio owner and self-employed fitness instructor, and I saw her struggles navigating traditional finance and business management tools. Professionally, when I was the GM of Square's Payroll business, I saw how complicated, painful and stressful taxes can be for small business owners.



Both of these perspectives inspired me to further investigate the financial management and tooling challenges that self-employed business owners face. Connor Dunn, my co-founder, and I started talking to family members, friends and other self-employed business owners to understand their challenges. Many people don't realize that managing your finances when you're self-employed differs quite a bit from when you are a W-2 employee. There are different tax requirements and forms, and you are on your own to figure out how much you need to pay in taxes. We also saw a common theme that people start their own businesses because they want freedom, flexibility and creative control — not so they can become their own accountants.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.


During these conversations and additional research, we realized two important things. First, we could provide tremendous value to these self-employed individuals by giving them a toolkit to manage their finances — something we felt we were uniquely equipped to do because of our backgrounds at Square. Second, the self-employed population in America is large and growing: Approximately 60 million Americans today are self-employed, and self-employment will soon surpass traditional employment to become the majority of the American workforce. Shortly after these conversations, we started Found.Why is doing taxes one of the most difficult financial tasks for freelancers?Unlike W-2 employees, business owners and freelancers do not proactively have income taxes taken out of their paychecks — and are expected to calculate and report their expected taxes themselves throughout the year. They are also frequently acting as their own ""finance department,"" an area where most have very little expertise. This typically involves keeping business and personal finances separate, correctly calculating and proactively saving the proper amount for taxes, and tracking financial deadlines, expenses and fines.In addition, tax laws are always changing and complicated by both state and federal policies. These laws are also starting to regulate how payments are invoiced, paid and tracked in relation to apps and platforms that we all interact with. For example, millions of freelancers, gig workers, solopreneurs and contract workers breathed a collective sigh of relief in December 2022 when the IRS delayed the new tax-reporting requirement for third-party payment platforms like Venmo, Cash App and PayPal, but that was just a temporary measure.Keeping finances organized while also staying on top of these changing laws is a lot to manage, and the tools available to the self-employed are typically expensive and disparate. Because of this, and because there is the ever-looming risk of owing money in taxes at the end of the year, we frequently hear that doing taxes is one of the most stressful parts of being self-employed.


Related: This Once Single Mom Had Negative $1,500 in Her Bank Account Before She Started a Lucrative Side Hustle — and Earned $100,000 Within 1 YearHow does Found's partnership with Column Tax this year offer a solution for that?Found directly helps self-employed professionals save for and pay quarterly taxes. Found can automatically estimate and set aside money for taxes for our users based on their income. We can also help our users easily categorize expenses and provide guidance on what can and cannot be deducted as write-offs.Found partnered with Column Tax to take these benefits a step further and provide tax filing services to its users, particularly those who are Schedule C filers. Column's tech is integrated into Found's suite of financial tools for independent workers. With Column Tax, Found Plus subscribers can access free tax filing services as part of their annual subscription.Filing through Column Tax is already around 1.5-2 times faster than standard DIY tax software providers and can be even faster for certain filers like independent workers who often have more complex tax returns. Because Column Tax is able to pull data directly from Found accounts, this partnership can help save Found users a lot of time when entering financial details during the filing process. The IRS has estimated that self-employed individuals spend 24 hours on taxes per year! And pay $560.

Keep track of 1099-NEC forms from clients and 1099-K forms from payment processors like PayPal to avoid a last-minute scramble. Second, make sure to separate business and personal finances, ideally through maintaining separate bank accounts, which will help simplify end of year reporting. You also want to meticulously track all business-related expenses, as these could be deductible expenses and significantly lower your taxable income. This could include expenses related to equipment, supplies, home office costs, phone bills and any other materials needed for your business.Lastly, it's crucial to understand your responsibility for paying self-employment tax in addition to regular income tax. To ensure you have sufficient funds to cover your tax bill, including estimated tax payments, allocate 20-30% of your freelance income into a separate savings account dedicated solely to taxes. If you expect to owe at least $1,000 in federal taxes for the year, make quarterly estimated tax payments to avoid underpayment penalties. Properly budgeting and making timely tax payments can save you from potential financial headaches down the line.And what are some of the common mistakes they make during filing, especially around retirement?When we surveyed Found customers last year, we learned that only 22% of self-employed people know how to maximize potential deductions and write-offs, which means they are missing the chance to lower their taxable income — and therefore their tax bill. Some of the tax deductions, like when you buy a new laptop for your job or pay your CPA, are more straightforward, but there are so many others.

And when you're self-employed, you can likely deduct contributions made to several types of retirement plans, such as traditional IRAs, SEP IRAs and Solo 401(k)s. Some of these retirement accounts can lower taxable income by deferring the tax bill until the money is withdrawn in retirement. Not being aware of these benefits can lead to missed opportunities for tax savings.

      Key Takeaways    



        Smith and his wife first heard about the EyeSpy side hustle from friends who knew founder Mistie Boulton. 
      


        Smith started with the company over two decades ago; these days, he completes about three evaluations each month. 
      


        Since he began keeping track in 2008, Smith has enjoyed a $40,000 food budget in exchange for his reviews. 
      












This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cliff Smith. Smith is based in Palo Alto, California and has been an evaluator for EyeSpy Critiquing & Consulting since 2003. The piece has been edited and condensed for clarity. I started working as a mystery diner with EyeSpy over 20 years ago. Our friends knew the founder Mistie Boulton, so they were among the very first people to do it, and when they told us about it, we thought it sounded too good to be true — to have our meals at nice restaurants paid for in exchange for writing up the experience. We didn't jump on the opportunity right away, but when I lost my job and began to tutor GMAT prep, I picked up the side hustle so we could continue dining out.Typically, I complete around three evaluations a month, and the work takes me to fine dining establishments as well as more casual restaurants; sometimes, the evaluation will even be for a takeout order. One Saturday last month, my wife and I did a brunch evaluation at The Village Pub, and our budget for brunch was $250 — and we needed it. We actually went slightly over with the tax and tip. The following Friday, we got a pizza delivery. So it remains a mix, and that's one of the advantages: This side hustle gets you into places you might not go otherwise.



Related: She Used Her Kids' College Fund to Build a Side Hustle, But the Product Was 'Unsellable' — Here's How She Got Back on Track for $100 Million in SalesThe process usually starts when you receive an email, then you go to the website and see that you have an assignment. You can negotiate when to do the assignment within the month, and if you can't do it that month, you can explain why and potentially take on the assignment the next month, but you may not get it again. It depends on what's going on — sometimes if they already have someone for the following week, it doesn't work out.


For each evaluation, there's an online survey form, and they do differ. Different restaurants care about different things. For example, The Village Pub cares a lot about how they handle the wine. Do they observe proper protocol? Do they keep filling your glass? Other places don't care nearly as much about that, but they might care about how many people say goodbye to you. So before an evaluation, you really do need to look at the form. Even if it's a similar kind of restaurant, the management may care about different things for different reasons. And you're supposed to remember when they did different things. I take pictures so I have a timestamp for all of it.Related: This 29-Year-Old Left His Marketing Job to Pursue a Side Hustle — Now He Earns Nearly $200,000 a Year: 'So Attracted to the Adrenaline Rush'You have to turn in the evaluation within 24 hours. When we started, it was two days, but they changed it to the next day. And in a way, that's reasonable because you have to remember a lot, and it does fade. The time it takes to finish an evaluation depends on the place. For the pizza place I mentioned, I completed it that night and maybe spent two hours on it at most. But I probably spent about six hours on The Village Pub evaluation. I wouldn't do it all in one day for a place like that.We also have to submit photos. I use Photoshop to crop them because I'm surreptitiously taking the pictures — though it doesn't have to be too surreptitious because a lot of people are taking pictures these days — but I take so many that I don't want to be too obvious about it. I don't take great pictures all the time. For the food, I do, but for the other things, not so much. But I may take a picture of the table to show the place settings if they care about their positioning. Later, when I'm submitting the photos, I need to crop them so they look better, and I reduce the rest so I don't bring the EyeSpy server to its knees.


Since July 2008, I've tracked how much I was budgeted for each evaluation — and it comes out to $40,000 in total. Of course, the real number is higher than that because we started the side hustle in 2003. And, of course, the cost of dining out has increased over the years. My favorite part of being a mystery diner is the ability to go places we wouldn't otherwise; it gets us into restaurants like The Village Pub, where we just wouldn't spend that kind of money on a dinner, let alone a brunch. We also try places we might not normally try. We go to Oren's Hummus, which is owned by the founder Mistie Boulton, all the time, but before working with EyeSpy, I'm not sure if we'd ever had Middle Eastern food.Related: I Started a Semi-Passive Side Hustle That Earns $33,000 a Week on Amazon: 'Selling There Is a No-Brainer'I also appreciate that I really have a voice. Generally, if you go to a restaurant and they treat you badly, you might ask to speak to the manager, and maybe you get comped or you get a free dessert. But I have a nuclear weapon. If I note that something isn't right, there probably will be a change. This wasn't vindictive, but one time, we went to a nice bistro in San Francisco, and our server just wasn't very accomplished. It wasn't a deal-breaker that would keep us out of that restaurant in the future or anything like that, but things weren't smooth or well done. A few months later, we went back to the same restaurant, and that same server was there, but now she was an assistant server, not the main server. So I thought, Well, they listened. And she seemed to be okay doing that; it was a better fit for her skill set. It's gratifying to know that I'll be heard because the restaurant management paid to hear it.

16,Specialization is No Longer the Path to Success — This Simple Life Hack Can Boost Your Career and Business,"Apr 4, 2024",Dustin Lemick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-elevate-your-business-with-skill-stacking/471765,"
It is a common belief that a razor-sharp focus on a single talent or skill is ideal for business success. The generalist or jack-of-all-trades is rarely considered optimal. Corporations often want employees to ""stay in their lane"" at work, where crossing into other skills or departments isn't encouraged or allowed.A number of professions, like legal and medical, require specialization. Industry consultants and experts often focus on a niche service. Production lines need workers to be proficient in one specific set of tasks. Cultivating expertise in a defined field or role is necessary for any career. Specializing in a particular talent or specific skill has its benefits.But, specialization can also be limiting and is not the sole path to success. Leaders and workers must be increasingly more flexible and adaptable in today's challenging economy and tech-powered world. That means rapidly learning and experiencing new and unexpected things related to their jobs. Even in careers and industries that require specialization, there has been a need to expand horizons. For example, restaurant owners must become tech-savvy and well-versed in e-commerce, food delivery apps, point-of-sale systems and social media marketing. Bringing a business online is a growing trend known as ""skill-stacking."" It can potentially help you, your workers and your organization.



Related: Why Being a Specialist Can Hurt Your Career SuccessThe premise of skill stacking is simple: be a generalist instead of a specialist. Rather than deep proficiency in one line of work, you aim to gain experience across many relevant practices. Obtaining these experiences can be applied to most job roles and at any stage of your career. Building a flexible and capable workforce across a broader range of business capabilities can help drive your company forward. For leaders, a working knowledge of all facets of your organization's needs can have infinite upside. For workers and job seekers, skill-stacking can enable you to increase your value while advancing your career. In entrepreneurship, it is not optional. You have to be capable of understanding and doing everything, especially at an early-stage startup.


I first encountered skill-stacking in college at UW-Madison. I was an Econ major exposed to wide-ranging areas of macroeconomics. At the time, I thought about how to apply what I was learning in the real world if I wasn't going to be a trader or an economist. However, it taught me a generalist skill set —thinking differently to recognize the value of gaining information and understanding across a broad spectrum of ideas and practices. I developed a willingness and interest to learn how to tackle just about everything. Today, I use skill-stacking daily as a founder and CEO and encourage our team members at BriteCo to do so.Related: 5 Invaluable Soft Skills to Seek in Your Next HireFor example, I knew little about digital marketing when I started my company. I am now proficient enough to help guide and drive results from learning and doing it. Am I an expert? No. Do I know enough to be dangerous? I do. I can recognize when something isn't accurate or working as intended and call it out. I can think strategically with enough tactical understanding to be an asset beyond my traditional role. It has helped. The more exposure to new and different business functions relevant to your company, the more you can learn how things work and where you can best contribute. Being a generalist helps you access other ways of thinking, approaches and insights you may not have gained otherwise. Building on top of your core expertise, you gain more.It's not just about knowledge but how you obtain the knowledge. It's about setting a base of expertise that serves as your ""personal infrastructure"" and building on top of it. That's the goal. Today, my infrastructure has gained depth and breadth across various experiences, skills and insights relevant to running my company. This is the skill-stacking effect.


Related: How to Get Comfortable Being Uncomfortable, No Matter Your Age — Lessons for EntrepreneursAs a founder, CEO and leader, you can incorporate skill-stacking into your work by evaluating your current personal infrastructure. Then, build out the areas that you aren't as familiar with. These might include focusing on your customer support or learning from a third-party service provider of a critical business goal such as paid search or publicity. Keep an open mind and be curious. Make it a point to engage differently with a more hands-on, engaged approach. Continuously learn and participate. To instill the value of skill-stacking in your organization, encourage employees to explore and expand their infrastructure. Make it an integral part of your company culture.I prefer to learn new skills by doing. My research typically involves talking directly to people, hearing their perspectives and sharing their expertise. I also follow many business experts on social media. Others may prefer a more traditional textbook way. Some opt for online and on-campus courses and classes. All of these approaches to skill-stacking can be effective. Consider what works best for you and offer your employees various options.Try to include learning by doing whatever is possible. A direct, hands-on experience can provide unequaled value. Regularly check in with people and see how they're progressing. Encourage cross-participation and continuous sharing of execution experiences. Building a skill stack personally and across your organization can pay big dividends personally and professionally.

While remodeling, I hosted a wedding as a favor to an acquaintance. The feedback was incredible, and that ""favor"" started the ball rolling toward transforming the barn into a wedding and event venue.



Related: This 29-Year-Old Left His Marketing Job to Pursue a Side Hustle — Now He Earns Nearly $200,000 a Year: 'So Attracted to the Adrenaline Rush'What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I signed up for a wedding show — which was a complete failure. I had zero interest from potential clients, so I moved on to Facebook. I posted photos of the venue every day and came up with a package, which I posted on Facebook as well. I immediately booked two weddings, and after that, the leads started flowing in from referrals and sharing about successful events.


What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them? One of the bigger challenges was learning to take the public's opinion with a grain of salt regarding what and how I should do things regarding the venue. There were a lot of strong opinions on what I should do with the barn due to its local history. Many people felt they had a valuable opinion of what should be done and how it should be done. One of the other big challenges was learning how to set and respect my boundaries and balance my personal time with work. In the first five years of getting the venue off the ground, I was terrible at work-life balance. I was consumed by the venue and did not give much thought to my own personal time.Related: This Mom Started a Side Hustle After a 'Shocking' Realization in the Toy Aisle.

Consistent revenue came within the first six months. In the beginning, I offered limited packages at a minimal investment, yet I still managed to book about $100,000 within the first year.You now own several successful businesses. How did you go from side hustle to owner of multiple companies? Once the first business became consistent and respected within the industry and the community, other opportunities started to land in my lap. If they were a good fit with our existing business and a good business opportunity, we gave it a lot of thought and moved forward with those companies — not just for our benefit, but for the benefit of the community and the clients they would be serving.


What do you enjoy most about running your businesses now?The independence and freedom of being my own boss allow me to incorporate personal vacation time into my life without having to ask permission.

Sleep, exercise and good nutrition are proven stress reducers and productivity enhancers, according to Harvard Business Review. That might sound simple enough, yet more than half of employees report being relatively unproductive at work, per McKinsey & Company. So what else exactly goes into unleashing creativity and optimizing performance in the workplace or in pursuit of another professional goal?Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Lewis, acclaimed author of hit titles including Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game, The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine and most recently Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon, about the crypto fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, explores just that in his new class on MasterClass.The class not only breaks down Lewis's unique approach to masterful storytelling — ""which will enhance your life in all kinds of ways,"" the author says — but it also delves into the processes that lead to productivity and success in writing-related endeavors and beyond.



Related: 'Big Short' Investor: SVB Crisis Is Accelerating Economic Slowdown""At the bottom of the best me is love. It's love of what I do; it's love of the characters, for better or worse.""One essential component? That would be the creation of an environment conducive to success, according to Lewis. You have to zero in on that space and commit to it, the author says, adding that you should choose a location ""where you feel safe."" For Lewis, that means working in his office surrounded by photos of his family. ""At the bottom of the best me is love,"" he explains. ""It's love of what I do; it's love of the characters, for better or worse. It's love of telling stories. It's love of the interaction with the reader.""Additionally, Lewis suggests minimizing all potential distractions: Remove the cell phone from your desk ""because it's only a matter of time before it buzzes or rings,"" and consider slipping on headphones to listen to a mix tape. ""The key to it all is the feeling of impossible interruption,"" Lewis says. After a while, that playlist might even have a Pavlovian effect and kickstart any working session, he adds, admitting he wrote the whole of The Undoing Project to Frozen's ""Let It Go.""Related: 10 Simple Productivity Tips for Organizing Your Work Life""It's useful to have routine, but the minute it becomes a superstition…it becomes a crutch.""Lewis also notes that we can ""learn from the smartest baseball players about the power of routine,"" but the trick is to establish a loose routine — and ensure it doesn't start to get in our own way. ""You need to insist upon the difference of routine and superstition,"" he explains. ""It's useful to have routine, but the minute it becomes a superstition…it becomes a crutch.""Lewis prefers to write at the beginning of the day because ""your mind processes problems when you sleep"" or at the end of the day (he sometimes worked from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. before he had kids). Otherwise, Lewis isn't precious about it: ""The routine is put my ass in the chair. Don't get up until I have 1,000 words. Let that be a floor, not a ceiling. If you can go beyond that, that's great.""Related: Want to Be More Productive? Stop Trying to Finish Every Task, and Do This Instead""I know exactly where I want to go so there's no snag. When I start the next day, it will be obvious where I start.""Another perhaps surprising tip from the author is to ""stop before you're actually finished"" — essentially, you want to interrupt yourself in the middle of a task when it's going well so that it's easier to jump back into it later. ""I know exactly where I want to go, so there's no snag,"" Lewis explains. ""When I start the next day, it will be obvious where I start.""And some final words of wisdom for those who have their sights set on a writing project? Although you can ""be in almost any mood when you start writing,"" it's better to edit when you're in a good one. ""Write on caffeine, edit on wine,"" Lewis says. ""Don't write on wine and edit on caffeine. That's the wrong way around. It's a very bad way to do it.""

I'm 47 years old. I still feel like I'm 21, but I now ""enjoy"" a host of aches and pains that have no discernible cause. I'm also moving towards needing reading glasses. And yet, for the first time in my life yesterday, I strapped on a snowboard and tried something completely new. Let me give you a little background.Twenty-six years ago after college, I moved to Summit County, Colorado with my great friends Davin, Ted and Dan. We lived the quintessential ski bum lifestyle. And I was pretty good. Good enough to become a ski patroller at Keystone (full disclosure, I was still the worst skier of all my roommates). Good enough to ski basically anything in Colorado. I loved it, but after two years, I left for law school.Fast-forward 24 years. I was an attorney living in Chicago when the pandemic hit. Crime skyrocketed. Chicago languished. So, my wife and I made the decision to pack our stuff and move back to Summit County, Colorado with our son. We've been here for almost two years now, and we ski every weekend in the winter.



Related: The Lasting Benefits of Getting Comfortable With DiscomfortThe challengeSeveral weekends during the ski season, we head out with our friends Connor and Laura. Laura is a skier (an outstanding one) and Connor is a snowboarder (a spectacular one). While Laura and I use the same medium, watching the speed and power that Connor can generate on snowboard is really impressive. To be honest, I never had a massive interest in snowboarding, but when you see someone who is really good, well, I couldn't help but think: ""I gotta try that.""


Now, let's go back to the beginning. Once again, I'm 47 years old. Snowboarding is legendary for being crushingly hard on your wrists, back, butt, shoulders and knees when you're starting out. So, when I mentioned I was thinking of trying it, the majority of my friends told me I had lost my mind.Still, I couldn't shake the interest, and I wanted (maybe needed) an excuse to give it a shot. Fortunately, my buddy Chuck and his family were headed out to visit us, so I asked him if he'd be up to go snowboarding for a day. His exact response was: ""Always down for an adventure.""So, one brisk morning in early March, Chuck and I got snowboards and headed over to the mountain. Did we take a lesson? Of course not. Too headstrong. And both being strong skiers, we figured ""How hard can it be?""Well, I won't keep you in suspense. It's hard. Really hard. The minute I clipped one foot in, I realized I could barely stand. As we sat in the lift line, I began to sweat profusely. I realized that for all the comfort I have on skis, I was basically helpless on a snowboard. But off we went.


Here are the results: (a) I didn't get off a single chairlift without falling; (b) I couldn't make a toe edge turn to save my life; (c) literally, I fell more in one day on a snowboard (probably 30-40 times) than I have in the past 30 years combined on skis; (d) on skis, I'm confident, really to the point of cocky. On this snowboard, ""Paddington's Easy Way Home"" looked like K2; and (e) the next day, I assessed my injuries … two jammed thumbs, two sprained wrists and two severely bruised knees.Related: Want to Be an Entrepreneur? Get Comfortable Being Uncomfortable.The rewards and the application to entrepreneurshipSo, you're probably thinking it wasn't a very successful day — the exact opposite. It was absolutely amazing, and I can't wait to do it again. Here is why:As you get older, there are very few things that you can do that are truly brand new and challenging. Particularly as an entrepreneur, your life becomes discomfort. The more you are able to thrive under those circumstances, the better.Fear is not a weakness — it's a strength if you decide to overcome it. Taking the leap into entrepreneurship necessarily entails fear. But if you never leap, you never fly. Embrace the fear, and take the leap.Being humbled reminds you that you're never as great as you think you are. We can all use a dose of humility now and again. As an entrepreneur, you are going to fail. Over and over and over again. And that's okay. Failure teaches you. Learn from your failures and improve.Your friends have both the power to inspire you to do new things and to join you on the ride. Both are an absolute gift. As an entrepreneur, you cannot accomplish your goals on your own. Create a great group of colleagues and friends. Let them inspire you. Lean on them for help. And enjoy the ride with them.Pain is temporary, but self-improvement is not. When starting a business and running a business, you are probably going to experience metaphorical pains that will make you want to quit. It's going to happen often. Pushing through those pains and marching forward is the only way to succeed. Remember, take one step forward each day, no matter how bad it may hurt, and eventually, you'll reach your destination.Lastly, being an entrepreneur means you NEED to get comfortable being uncomfortable. Life is full of routine, often to the point of monotony. When you jump outside the routine and truly get uncomfortable, you can be recharged in a way you never expected. Moreover, if discomfort isn't your bag, starting a business may not be either.Related: Why Getting Out of Your Comfort Zone Is the Best Thing You Can Do as an EntrepreneurWhen I recover from this adventure, the first thing I will be doing is buying a snowboard and boots and going again. I'm sure it will hurt … again. I'm sure I will suck at it … again. I'm sure I will fall … again and again and again. But there is a new mountain to conquer. A new goal to achieve. And it will be very uncomfortable getting there — and I'm completely comfortable with that.

20,A Student in an Ivy League University's Most Popular MBA Leadership Class Asked a Tough Question: What If Your Boss's Downfall Is Necessary to Get Ahead?,"Apr 2, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/mentora-lift-accelerates-performance-breakthroughs-at-work/472054,"
Seventy percent of employees avoid difficult conversations with their boss, colleagues or direct reports, according to a study by coaching and training firm Bravely. Unfortunately, awkward interactions in the workplace are often necessary to see positive results — including those in the form of a promotion or raise.One recent study from UK-based Reed Recruitment found that more than half of employees surveyed hesitate to broach the subject of career advancement, with 16% admitting that they simply don't know what to say. What if someone could help them find the words and prepare them for any possible response?A GenAI-powered coach from Mentora Institute, the global institute dedicated to developing exemplary leaders and accelerating performance, does just that.Related: I Attended an Ivy League University's Most Popular MBA Leadership Class and Learned How Steve Jobs Became a Better Leader in 10 MinutesThe just-launched Mentora LiFT is designed to expedite performance breakthroughs at work with actionable and personalized coaching with ""the path breaking leading-in-flow method,"" Dr. Hitendra Wadhwa, Mentora founder and professor at Columbia Business School, shared in Harvard Business Review.



The tool became available for enterprises on April 2, and individuals will be able to access LiFT in waves with priority given to those on the waitlist and those who sign up today and throughout the week. Its three-level price tier includes an individual version for $45 per month, a professional version for $195 per month and an annual subscription for $1,995.How do you bring up the possibility of a promotion or raise when the path to career advancement isn't clear?In January, I had the opportunity to sit in on Wadhwa's business course at Columbia and see the technology in action. Wadhwa, who also authored the book Inner Mastery, Outer Impact: How Your Five Core Energies Hold the Key to Success, teaches the university's most popular class on leadership and success. Wadhwa asked for some class participation to help show what Mentora LiFT could do — did anyone have a challenging situation at work they'd be willing to share and work through with the tool?The student selected revealed a common problem: How do you bring up the possibility of a promotion or raise when the path to career advancement isn't clear? In this student's case, though, an industry-specific constraint added some complexity. As a professional working in academic medicine, he said the hierarchical structure and long-established trajectory of those working within it meant those who chose to stick around could expect a slow climb to the top, one that ultimately hinged on their superior's departure — by choice or otherwise.What if the only way to get a promotion is for your boss to…die? Naturally, his question elicited some laughter, as did his admission of offering his boss cheeseburgers to speed the process up, but the general premise — how to start a tough conversation in the workplace — was just what Mentora LiFT needed to do its work.


Related: The Secret to How Businesses Can Fully Harness the Power of AIThe Mentora LiFT added possibilities — and a lot of them — to an otherwise stultifying situation.The student prepared for a meeting with his boss that could change the trajectory of his career, and by inputting his specific goals, received recommendations for concrete actions and a custom plan complete with intention-setting, action-review and centering and visualization practices — and all in just 10-15 minutes. The tool also offers a simulated role-play option for those important real-world conversations.The student still had a significant challenge ahead of him in shifting the status quo, but the Mentora LiFT added possibilities — and a lot of them — to an otherwise stultifying situation. And that's precisely what it was built to do.In early testing of LiFT by executives from major organizations such as Google, IBM, Amazon, Citibank, Mastercard and more, executives mostly or completely achieved their performance goals 80% of the time with the tool, which also delivered an immediate average boost of 20% in achieving performance goals, increasing to 135% over time after 10 uses.

Use This Script to Get the Raise You Deserve.""After fifteen years of scientific research and field-testing, we've devised a straightforward yet profound methodology which emphasizes that true leadership and performance begins from activating the right energy — the right thoughts, emotions and intentions,"" Wadhwa said in a statement announcing Mentora LiFT.

      Key Takeaways    



        In 2008, Vaccarella needed a better, practical beach bag — so she decided to create one herself. 
      


        The bags flew off shelves at a local boutique, but disaster struck after she invested her kids' college savings in more pieces. 
      


        Hurricane Sandy ""unexpectedly opened a door,"" leading to donations and increased interest in the bags.

Image Credit: Courtesy of Bogg Bag. Kim Vaccarella. Did you have a 9-5 when you started the business? Yes, I spent 26 years in commercial real estate before fully dedicating myself to Bogg in 2018.



When did you start the business, and where did you find the inspiration for it?It seems like a lifetime ago. The idea came to me in 2008, born out of a practical need for a better beach bag. I envisioned the ultimate mom bag: durable and sturdy, with non-collapsing sides, large enough to carry everything we needed and washable at the end of the day. The catalyst was a trip to the Jersey Shore and a serendipitous encounter with EVA material, which I realized was the perfect material for crafting the perfect beach bag.Related: The Remote Side Hustle a 43-Year-Old Musician Works on for 1 Hour a Day Earns Nearly $3,000 a Month: 'All From the Comfort of Home'


What were some of the first steps you took to get Bogg Bag off the ground? How did you come up with the ""Bogg Bag"" name?As a full-time working mom with no experience in bag sales, the leap into launching Bogg Bag was huge. The idea came to me as a necessity, and despite the challenge of stepping into unfamiliar territory, I was determined to give it a go.The goal initially was to patent the Bogg Bag concept and sell the idea, avoiding the complexities of manufacturing. After facing numerous rejections, I realized the only way to see my vision come to life was to do it myself.Naming the bag was simpler than you'd think. Reflecting on water, frogs and lily pads, I played around with words until Bogg stuck. It felt right, signaling a fresh start — Bogg, it's the new bag!You used your kids' college fund to bring the dream to life. What happened next?After our first batch hit a small local boutique, they flew off the shelves. At first, I wondered if it was just friends and family showing support, but I chose to believe it was genuine love for the product. Encouraged, I doubled down and ordered 600 more. Those sold out too. Feeling bold, I invested my kids' college savings into over 1,000 pieces. It was a major moment, unloading a full container in our storage unit's parking lot under the night sky. But as we unpacked, my heart sank — every piece was marred by black streaks, unsellable to the high standards I dreamt of for Bogg.

We found a new purpose for these imperfect bags. The storm had wreaked havoc on our community, so we repurposed the flawed bags as emergency kits filled with essentials for those affected by the storm, distributing them to families in need. It was a heartrending experience, but providing aid gave a new meaning to our efforts.Initially, I thought this marked the end of Bogg's journey. However, about a year later, our Facebook page lit up with messages from those recipients. Beyond their thanks, they wanted more bags — for themselves, for family, as gifts. That overwhelming response reignited my resolve. I knew then that Bogg had to make a comeback.Image Credit: Courtesy of Bogg Bag


What were some of the additional challenges you faced while building your business, and how did you navigate them?After leaving my steady job in 2018, the pressure of succeeding on my own was immense. Having been accustomed to a regular income for 26 years, the shift was daunting. I set an ambitious target: $1 million in sales for 2018. Miraculously, we hit it. Then 2019 began promisingly until Covid brought the world to a standstill. Like everyone, we were in uncharted territory with no playbook on how to adapt.While many brands shifted to online sales — a logical move in such uncertain times — we chose a path less traveled. We stayed in close touch with our retail partners, sharing in their hardships and looking for ways to support them. The Bogg Bag's unique selling point — its washability — unexpectedly became its strength during the pandemic. Hospitals purchased them for healthcare workers, schools for teachers, and stores filled them with goods for contactless pickups and deliveries as Easter approached.This approach may not have been the most profitable in the short term, but it was the right thing to do. Maintaining these relationships was more important than immediate gains. To this day, I'm grateful for the support we were able to provide during those tough times, a sentiment echoed by our partners whenever we meet at trade shows.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? What does total revenue look like now?Even in the early days of 2014 and 2015, we began seeing monthly revenue come in, albeit modest, but steady and growing. Fast forward to 2023: We hit a milestone that once seemed a distant dream, crossing over $50 million in revenue. Now, with momentum on our side, we're ambitiously setting our sights even higher, targeting a groundbreaking $100 million in 2024. This growth is a clear testament not only to our product's value but also to the incredible team behind Bogg and the unwavering support from our community. We truly have something special.

22,Want Success? Invest in Your Biggest Enemy,"Mar 26, 2024",Jon Michail,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/want-people-to-follow-you-invest-in-yourself/471357,"
When most people think, talk or try to research investment, they often focus on opportunities in areas like real estate and stocks. For many people, investment is all about financial gains. Of course, pursuing and building an investment portfolio that would yield financial gains is a commendable feat. Yet, an investment that is equally as important, if not more, is self-investment.Self-investment is hard because one can often be their own worst enemy, as they are intimately aware of their weaknesses and insecurities, which can lead to self-doubt and self-sabotage. Their inner critic often amplifies their fears and magnifies their failures, hindering their progress and potential for growth.According to Warren Buffet, one of the most successful and wealthiest men in the world, ""The best investment you can make is an investment in yourself… The more you learn, the more you'll earn."" This statement is not cliché; it is straightforward and practical, but people still often overlook the importance of self-investment.



Whether you want to earn the highest figures, reach the peak of your professional career or become a better person overall, investing in yourself is non-negotiable. It's that sort of investment that yields a substantial gain every time.Now that we're in a constantly and rapidly evolving era, self-investment — an investment in personal development and self-growth, is the best insurance policy for these challenging times. Here are some instances of how self-investment can set you up to nurture growth, personal fulfillment and career success.


Enhancing personal growth and developmentIt's impossible to talk about self-investment without its impact on personal growth and development. Self-investment involves using available resources to improve your overall well-being. This goes beyond formal education; self-investment sets one on a path of continuous learning and development by pursuing passions, curiosity and innate skills. Apart from the apparent rewards, those who remain dedicated cultivate adaptability and resilience — the ability to be flexible, composed and decisive in crucial times. These traits are essential for anyone who will successfully navigate today's competition and uncertainty.By investing in their personal growth and development, individuals become self-aware and authentic to their true selves. This sets the foundation for a purposeful and successful life.Related: Want to Succeed? Learn to Say 'No'Promoting mental and physical well-beingMost people are not proactive, paying little to no attention to their mental and physical well-being in pursuing success until a problem arises, and then they react. People often believe their physical and psychological well-being must suffer if they're to attain success until a problem arises. This couldn't be farther from the truth; to give yourself the best chance of achieving your goals, your mental and physical well-being has to be in the best conditions possible. By investing in your mental and physical well-being, you get to


Sustain your energy and productivity for longer periods due to improved fitness levels.Cultivate the habit of remaining focused and peaceful because you know how to manage stress.Operate at your optimal level and give your best effort daily because you're well-rested.By investing in a sound mind and body, you strengthen your cognitive and problem-solving skills, thereby increasing your chances of excelling in your ambitions.Facilitating financial excellenceWhile it's true that the reward for most investments is money, self-investment promises more than just financial gains. Self-investment helps nurture a healthy relationship with the pursuit of money. You can create feasible financial goals because you understand the importance of savings and planning. The result is that it almost looks like you earn more than you do because you still have enough to pursue your goals and aspirations. By investing in yourself, you equip yourself with the basics and foundational knowledge necessary to live the life you aspire for.Advancing your careerGlobal incidents in the last couple of years, like the pandemic, have emphasized that the modern workplace is dynamic. You can't afford to stay stagnant. However, when you consciously invest in yourself, you plug yourself into lifelong learning and the perfection of your strengths. By so doing, even when there are disruptions, you're well equipped not just to cope and stay relevant but also to use such disruptions to further advance your career.Also, proper self-investment allows you to refine your skill set continuously, thus giving you the right to establish yourself as a thought leader in your industry.


Related: Why You Need to Invest in Your Happiness (and How to Do It)Improving social and emotional intelligenceThe success and meaning of every relationship, whether personal or business, are determined by those involved's social and emotional intelligence. By investing in yourself, you develop the ability to communicate effectively. Improved emotional intelligence means not only knowing what to say and when to inspire those around you, but you're also able to gracefully manage and resolve conflicts, thereby making you a professional and distinguished leader. This modern day is characterized by diversity, so interpersonal skills, empathy and emotional regulation are needed to navigate social complexities with grace successfully.Building legacy and impactThe final reason we're going to discuss self-investment is the subsequent impact such a person can have in the community. By striving to become the best possible version of ourselves, we spread our impact and influence across our immediate environment. This impact can come from providing resources, mentorship or philanthropy to drive progress and build a legacy in society. To put this in simple terms, the better we become as individuals, the better our contributions and services to society will be.Related: 4 Ways to Begin Investing in Yourself


ConclusionIt's worth remembering that the best investment anyone can make is to invest in themselves. This is particularly important in our present-day society, where material success and external validation are primarily the order of the day. An investment in core values like self-development and purpose-driven growth will set anyone apart. Not only does self-investment set you apart, but you also give yourself a better advantage in achieving all your goals while living a prosperous and fulfilling life.In navigating the challenges of our modern society, we should always remember that our greatest investment lies in treasures within. When leaders and entrepreneurs embrace and practice this reality, they realize their 'value' possibilities in new and inspiring ways.

      Key Takeaways    



        Woo's background in management consulting and further research inspired her to build a tool in the form of a card game ""that anybody could enjoy.""

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dr. Jenny Woo, educator and founder of Mind Brain Emotion, the company behind a line of card games and other tools for the development of emotional intelligence. The story has been edited and condensed for clarity. There's some research that shows that today's college students are way less emotionally intelligent compared to those a decade ago. And this research was done before the pandemic, so you can imagine what that looks like post-pandemic. I've also seen a lot of research on the impact of distance learning and social isolation, where adults and kids just don't have the same opportunity to interact with people. For kids, this translated into social anxiety and regression [in] communication skills and language, and just that unwillingness to connect with people.Image Credit: Courtesy of Mind Brain Emotion. Dr. Jenny Woo.



I've done management consulting for Fortune 500 companies, and through working with senior leaders, I found that soft skills in the workplace are not quite emphasized, which really impacts the health of an organization's team. When I was researching this area at the children's level, I realized, Oh my gosh, these are the skills that basically weren't really taught or discussed in school. So, while at the Harvard Innovation Labs, I took a research-backed approach to develop a tool in the form of a card game that anybody could enjoy — you don't have to go to school or anything. (I wanted to do something that was easy and accessible because I'm the first one in my family to graduate college.)Related: This Gen Zer's Stylish Side Hustle Earns About $20,000 a Month and Paid Off His Parents' $200,000 Debt: 'I Enjoy the Hands-Off Nature'


The development of my first card deck, which launched in May 2018 with the help of a Kickstarter campaign, stemmed from a combination of education research and industry experience. I was in a master's program in education that was focused on the intersection of cognitive science, neuroscience, education and child development, and I guess psychology sprinkled in there. I started with the 52 Essential Conversations to really help people have purposeful conversations in an authentic and vulnerable way. This would be parents with children, adult parents and grandparents with children in school. It's almost like the pearls of wisdom that you want to leave someone close to you — to feel good that they're set for life and can make responsible decisions.I didn't even really think about developing more card decks, but organically, as I was testing the game out with users and gathering these case studies, understanding how people are actually engaging and interacting with it, I realized that in order to even begin to have these vulnerable, heart-to-heart conversations, you need to have that trust, respect and understanding first. And so that is where I created the second deck, which is the Relationship Skills deck — to help people go back to the drawing board, connect with each other and build that caring trust necessary to even have a conversation. I released that one in January 2019.Related: Her 'Crude Prototype' and $50 Craigslist Purchase Launched a Side Hustle That Hit $1 Million in Sales — Now the Business Generates Up to $20 Million a YearAmazon is a platform that's continuously growing in terms of people who rely on the service, so selling there is a no-brainer. These days, I launch a new deck every four to six months on Amazon, and the sales bring in $33,000 a week. I have other streams of income as well. I lecture at the University of California, Irvine. I'm lecturing but also providing a service through my online course as Mind Brain Emotion, my company. So every quarter I teach, and they pay me directly per person taking my online course. We do some real estate too.


I speak a lot to entrepreneurship classes at the graduate college level, and one time I got this question from someone: ""Can you start a business if you're not really passionate about what you're selling if it will make a lot of money?"" My answer is, ""Why would you want to do that?"" My advice is to do something that you're truly passionate about and hopefully passionate about for a long, long time because it is a grind. You're going to get negative customer reviews, which is like a death sentence for a business. And you have to love what you're doing enough to just pick yourself up and keep going. That also goes into knowing what your values are; you're going to have so many dilemmas and decisions that you need to make, and in order to weigh the pros and cons, you have to go back to your values and what's important to you.Related: Learn How You Can Take Advantage of Amazon's Advertising Tools to Get More Eyes on Your BusinessAdditionally, as a solopreneur, you don't know what you don't know, and that's one of the biggest challenges I see when I talk to other entrepreneurs. Sometimes you could be so in love with your idea, but it's really important to talk to as many people as you can and listen to the customer first before yourself or the product to understand if this is meeting a need and if there are demands for this product.Looking for your next side hustle?

When I was 17, I founded a company to save police officers' lives. We distribute and manufacture body armor and other protective equipment. And yet, I will admit: For the first eight years, this work felt abstract — like watching war unfold on the nightly news. I understood its importance, of course, but it wasn't personal.Then, an officer in a nearby town was killed. It changed everything.His name was Louis Pompei. He was 30 years old, served in Glendora, California, and was killed while off duty, as he heroically tried to stop a grocery store holdup. We'd never met, but we had many mutual friends. When some of them invited us to his funeral, my wife, Melissa, and I immediately accepted.

25,Want to Succeed? Learn to Say 'No',"Mar 22, 2024",Ginni Saraswati,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-say-no-to-others/471244,"
A goal of mine this year has been to be super intentional with my time. The path to intentionality, I have learned, is a paved road with two parallel lanes. The left lane is about practicing discipline when it comes to focus and how your time gets allocated. The right lane is paved with the lessons of a two-letter word that should have been used more often.Stage I: The time to growGrowing a business is a symphony of yeses. As a first-year founder and entrepreneur, I was saying ""yes"" to every opportunity, course, seminar, coaching strategy and meeting because I was in the building stage of my business.For me, being mandated to stay indoors during 2020 wasn't the time for making sourdough or catching up on my reading. It provided a rare opportunity to focus solely on growing my business. In February of 2020, we had 6 team members. By the end of the year, we had grown to 24! Purely organically, with no outside investors, all the while navigating the shifts and changes of the world around us.



Related: Learn to Say No to These 3 Things to Take Your Business to New HeightsStage II: Life and the in-betweenThe last four years have been years of extremes for me. Joy, sadness, growth, forced stillness and counting down the days until something was over. It's been a time for me to learn patience and endurance while simultaneously not letting my business fall through the cracks.


Losing my mother in early 2021 at the height of worldwide restrictions and lockdowns meant that I had to endure a 14-day hotel quarantine immediately after the long flight back to Australia. Once released, we could spend our final 11 days together, and then she was gone.Following this loss, I had to hunker down unexpectedly in the closest non-Schengen country for two weeks before being allowed to return to the US. Waiting to leave hotel quarantine, waiting for the impending loss of a parent, and then waiting to leave Romania so I could return home to NYC, it felt like I was facing struggle after struggle, and time went at vastly different speeds. I was also (somehow) juggling a global team as business was booming. How did I get through that and still have most of the hair on my head?On the joy front, 2022 and 2023 brought many gifts. I fell in love and got engaged. This time was rich in terms of my personal life. When you put it all together, these years changed me, and the contrast between them was profound.Related: How to Harness the Power of Change in Entrepreneurship


Stage III: Embracing the power of noAs things began to settle, and I passed life's infamous ""Hey, here's everything all at once!"" test, my company emerged from its transformation cocoon. It was evolving into something bigger, more mature, and more stable. I knew that if my business and I were going to survive this evolution, I had to learn to pull back the reflex to say ""yes"" to everything that came my way.I now have a process when it comes to a new opportunity, a fresh business venture, continuing a current venture, or involving myself in anything that requires a time and energy commitment.Here are the guidelines I follow before entering a new project:If I'm not very excited, the answer is ""no.""If I don't need to go for a walk to release pent-up excitement, the answer is ""no.""If it doesn't allow me an avenue to give back, the answer is ""no.""My experiences have taught me to prioritize being present so that those who rely on me and me can have our needs met first. Achieving this has meant that the word ""no"" plays a bigger role in my life. My ""yeses"" are reserved for the guidelines I've put in place and, by extension, for my team, my fiance, and those closest to me.


It's a stage of maturity in entrepreneurship and also a privilege, I might add, to go from a ""yes"" person to someone who is selective and intentional when opportunities arrive. But there's a lot of wisdom gained along the road. As James Clear writes, ""The amateur does not know what to do. The master knows what not to do."" With every ""no,"" I'm learning to master this journey better.

      Key Takeaways    



        In 2015, at 18, Cao heard about a lucrative business opportunity from a friend: reselling sneakers.
      


        He joined online forums like Reddit to conduct research — then started purchasing online drops. 
      


        After a while, he automated the process, and the venture has generated more than $1.5 million in total revenue.
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Ray Cao, a Gen Z seller on StockX, an online marketplace and sneaker reseller. Image Credit: Courtesy of Ray CaoWhat was your day job when you started your side hustle, and why were you interested in entrepreneurship?I was a student working as a part-time barista earning about $8 an hour (minimum wage at the time) at a bubble tea store in New York City. My family had gotten into $200,000 worth of debt from speculative investments and gambling. We were desperate to the point where my parents borrowed from relatives to get by. This put an obvious strain on the relationship between them, and my family would quickly become the topic of untoward gossip. I was ashamed, scared and insecure. I eventually cultivated these feelings of vulnerability into action and dove into entrepreneurship.



When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?I started the side hustle in 2015 when I had just turned 18. Sneaker and streetwear culture was growing popular, and demand for these coveted brands trended higher. I heard from my friend that this would be a lucrative business opportunity, and we both pursued it. My inspiration for starting and continuing this business was always my immigrant family.Related: I Was a 25-Year-Old Nurse When I Started a Side Hustle to Combat Anxiety. It Made $1 Million in 7 Months — Then Sold for a Life-Changing Amount.


Throughout my childhood and adolescence, I grew to understand that I was much poorer than my peers. My parents were seamstresses and worked around the clock to support the family. My mom would tell me that she only earned a dime for each fabric she had sewn together, totaling only $200 weekly. Even my late grandma would spend her days picking up bottles and cans to recycle for five cents per piece. My parents and grandma navigated their lives here through sacrifice, cultural disparity and language differences. To this day, their story continues to fuel my ambitions and keeps me progressing.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I joined online communities and forums (Reddit, Facebook, NikeTalk) to conduct research and opened a bank account and card to purchase online drops. Eventually, I bought my first item, Supreme Air Jordan Desert Camo 5s (2015), for $225 and sold them locally for a $400 profit.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?As college progressed and my finance career came into focus, I didn't have the energy to grind through the manual labor required for the business (sorting through incoming inventory, shipping outbound orders, conducting quality checks and dealing with returns from purchases and sales). I automated the business through Excel spreadsheets and worked with my parents to facilitate the day-to-day operations. During this time, I also gained access to store inventory at the StockX warehouse. This dramatically reduced my active work time and involvement to 10 hours a month. Everything I needed to manage the business could now be done from my laptop anywhere in the world.Related: Access our best side hustle stories and make more money. Subscribe to Entrepreneur+ now.


As my available capital increased, a new challenge sprouted: order sizing. For example, with $1,000 and a hype release, it was easy to size my order — as much as I could afford. When that available capital increases a hundredfold or a thousandfold, things become more complex. I remember placing a roughly $10,000 order for the Nike Blazer Mid 77 Vintage White Black. About the first 30 sold at a 15% premium, but demand dried up as I flooded the market with available pairs. I lost about $3,000 and quickly learned the importance of order sizing and liquidity.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?During the early growth stages, monthly revenue trended closely with the amount of capital that was readily available. As the business matured, monthly revenues in the past two years peaked at a little under $20,000.What does total revenue look like now?I've earned about $1.53 million in total revenue on StockX.What do you enjoy most about this side hustle?I enjoy the hands-off nature of this business because it allows me to simultaneously progress my finance career (whether it's a new business venture or another corporate gig). The network of partners and relationships I've built along the way is invaluable, and so is being surrounded by so many smart individuals — special shoutout to the StockX team!

Your network is a major barrier to growth, so take every opportunity to show potential partners the value you can bring them. Good information is valuable and scarce: Conduct your market research within small niche communities and build connections organically.

    Sarah Michelle Boes knew there had to be a better way to prepare for her stress-inducing nurse practitioner's exam — so she created it.

      Key Takeaways    



        Sarah Michelle Boes followed her passion for teaching into nursing school. 
      


        After passing her nurse practitioner's exam proved easier than expected, she wanted to instill confidence in others. 
      


        She put together her first course within a week of that exam — and became a millionaire within the year. 
      












This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sarah Michelle Boes, the founder of Sarah Michelle NP Reviews (SMNP), which was acquired by Blueprint Test Prep in 2022. Boes currently serves as the chief nursing officer for Blueprint Test Prep and hosts the podcast Becoming A Stress-Free Nurse Practitioner. She earned her BSN from the University of Kentucky, her MSN in Nursing Education from Western Governors University and her post-MSN-FNP from Eastern Kentucky University. The piece has been edited and condensed for clarity. Image Credit: Courtesy of Sarah Michelle BoesI grew up in rural Eastern Kentucky, and I always had this passion for being a teacher. I had my heart set on it. But my parents are teachers, and they're like, ""Absolutely not. You can't do that."" There are a lot of politics and bureaucracy within teaching. It's a lot more than just being an educator. Then, when I was a teenager, my grandmother was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. Without great access to premium healthcare in our area, we had to travel two hours to Lexington to get that diagnosis and receive a care plan that she could take back home. That was over the summer, so I went with her, and that was my first introduction to nursing at the Markey Cancer Center.



Those nurses were incredible. I feel like oncology nurses, in general, are kind of angels. Not only did they take care of her, but they also took care of me. It was just a great experience. So, knowing that I wasn't going to be able to be a teacher, I was like, Well, nursing — I feel like I could get something done. And there would be a teaching aspect because there's a lot of patient education, but I'd also get a human connection with people, which I thrive off of. So it was a no-brainer, and I attended the University of Kentucky, which guaranteed me admission to their program — and that's a really big deal.Related: This Nurse Turned $500 in Savings Into $100 Million in Sales After Sharing Her Hair Care Routine on YouTube. Now She's Revealing Her Secrets to Success.


I grappled with anxiety during nursing school. A class was notorious for weeding out people, and everyone dreaded taking it. I had a ton of anxiety in that class in particular, so much so that my instructor was like, ""I don't think nursing is for you. You're too anxious to be a safe nurse."" I had to choose to stay. The grading scale in nursing is also very different: In most programs, anything less than a 76 means you fail — and on the first exam in that class, I got a 74. I literally failed the first exam by one question. So I had to figure out how to contend with my anxiety, to think about the tools I could use.So, I started to figure out how to manage that class and my anxiety. Then, I began tutoring, ultimately quitting my full-time job as a manager to help students full-time. I taught them the skills that had helped me tackle that challenging class in a different way, and my anxiety didn't pick up again until I was a nurse practitioner — because it had been a long time since I'd taken a high-stakes exam. There was no one to turn to get perspective because I was the first nurse in my family, and I didn't know many people who were nurse practitioners.What's more, I took my nurse practitioner exam in the prime of Covid, May 2020. So it was chaos. Testing centers were down, and some places would let you take it online at home, but others wouldn't. By the time I took the exam in the middle of May, it had been canceled five times, three of which I'd already arrived at the testing center. So, there was a lot of anxiety involved. I was like, Am I ever going to take this test? My job is riding on this.Related: Nurse Makes $2 Million In One Year With Side Hustle Selling Class Notes Online


I was so stressed that I ended up breaking a tooth in my sleep because I was grinding them so hard. I was going to have to get a dental implant to the tune of $7,000; my hair was also falling out. But I finished the 175-question exam in less than an hour, and I passed. I was like, I can't believe I was stressing over this thing. This was so much easier than my nursing exam. All I needed was confidence in myself because I'd spent years in schools and hundreds of hours in clinical preparing. None of my reviews had given me that confidence.That realization — and the fact that I still had to pay for a $7,000 dental implant — motivated me to put together my first review course. I started my business because I was like, I can't afford this $7,000 implant. I figured if I put together a little review course and even just earned $500, that would help pay for it. And I started to think about how it could be done differently — how it could be less like someone lecturing you and more like studying with a friend. So, I came up with a Q&A approach, which I'd used as a tutor in nursing school and when I taught nursing students at the collegiate level.Within a week of passing the exam, I made my first three-hour course. I actually gave it out to all of my classmates for free. There were 30 of us, and I was like, ""Hey guys, I'll give you this course for free if you invite someone else into the group when I give it to you."" I gave the course to the first 100 people who came into the group. Then, not even a couple of days later, someone who had taken the course went on to pass, and it kind of exploded through word of mouth. It got wild really quickly. The first person I tried to sell it to for $25 got mad because her friend had gotten it for free, so she haggled me down to $15. Still, I made $1,000 on the first day I started selling, and I didn't even make $1,000 in a week as a nurse. I was like, What if I made $1,000 a day, every day? What would life look like?Related: Her 'Crude Prototype' and $50 Craigslist Purchase Launched a Side Hustle That Hit $1 Million in Sales — Now the Business Generates Up to $20 Million a Year


By the end of June and July, I'd surpassed what I used to make annually as a nurse. I told my nurse practitioner job I wouldn't be coming. I wanted to see how far I could take the business, but being reasonable and never having run a business before, I kept my full-time teaching job, just in case. But every spare hour I had, every weekend, was all about the business. Because I was so anxious about it being a startup, fragile and new, I waited to quit my teaching job until I made $1 million. We hit seven figures in seven months.About a year and a half in, I was still using third-party software to host my courses — nothing was in-house or really in unison. It got to the point where my students were literally breaking the software; I needed my own. We actually spent $100,000 trying to build an app that ended up completely falling apart. That was really hard, but we just kept running up against technology, and I realized I was the bottleneck to this thing. The business wanted to grow, so I started looking into other options.We considered a sale and put out some teasers, hoping to get constructive feedback. As it turned out, the test prep provider Blueprint had some internal meetings about the prospect before I even sent out the teaser. They had medical stuff, and they had LSAT stuff, but they didn't have any nursing material at the time. And I wanted to take some pressure off myself because a week into sending out the teasers, I found out I was pregnant. I never want people to think I sold because I was pregnant; it just coincided with the timing.Related: I Turned My Side Hustle Into a Passive Income Stream That's Earned More Than $1 Million — But Making Money Isn't Even the Best Part


We loved the Blueprint team, but the deal just wasn't right at first. My husband and I had decided on a number before we had a single conversation, and I'd recommend any entrepreneur do the same. Otherwise, it can be hard to navigate a deal when emotions are running high. So the first deal wasn't our number, and we walked away. Then they came back with our number, and we ended up selling around the two-year mark. That money has been life-changing.At 36 weeks pregnant, we found out that my daughter was going to have a congenital heart defect. We had no idea. So everything kind of flipped on its head really quickly. When I gave birth, the money gave us the flexibility and ability to be with our daughter when she needed it the very most. She had six surgeries in her first five months of life, two of which were open-heart surgeries. So, very crazy, chaotic times, and what a blessing to be able to have not only a maternity leave, but also a medical leave, and to be able to be fully present for that — and not only me but also my husband. We could be there together and support one another.Now, my daughter is 19 months old, and for the past year, we've been working to do a legacy gift to our local children's hospital, where they literally saved her life. Hopefully, next month, fingers crossed, everything's going to be finished, and they're actually going to dedicate the Norton Children's Heart Institute to my daughter. They are trying to build out a premier heart program there, and you have to have the funds to be able to do that. So the money gives us a lot of freedom and flexibility — my husband's also starting up his own business — but our work with the children's hospital is the most meaningful and impactful accomplishment.This article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of being a Young Entrepreneur®.

Ben Huffman, CEO and co-founder of Contra, knows what it takes to run a successful freelancing side hustle. Huffman got firsthand experience in the freelancing space as a music producer, working with small labels and, ultimately, Sony Music. The work was fun but ""didn't pay well,"" he tells Entrepreneur, so he started designing apps, pitch decks and websites. Huffman became a ""power user"" on Elance and Odesk, which would merge to become Upwork, and soon ""became fascinated"" with the idea of building a team globally.Image Credit: Courtesy of Contra. Ben Huffman.""I would find projects locally in New York and then hire freelancers from all over the world to help me with the skills I didn't have,"" Huffman recalls. ""I loved the freedom and autonomy of working independently, but even more, I loved working with people from different cultures and backgrounds. Early on, I realized the flaws in the business models of the platforms I used.""



The world was becoming more connected, Huffman explains, and the ""take-rate model"" eBay brought to the fore ""didn't make sense for people and working relationships,"" especially as workers increasingly sought flexibility and employers needed more niche skills. So Huffman set out to create a platform that could address those pain points, and after interviewing thousands of independent workers, discovered they need to think about three things to be successful: creating their identity and credibility, managing their business and finding new leads. Contra, which has raised $45 million from venture capital firms, provides support in all of those areas.Related: How to Start a Freelance Writing Side Hustle


""Contra is commission-free, so our users can keep 100% of their earnings.""""Independent workers can create a profile that showcases their skills and what they can actually do instead of their roles at past companies,"" Huffman says. ""Focusing on projects and skills allows independents to highlight the specific problems they've solved and the value they've delivered. Independents can find new projects from high-quality, vetted clients, manage their business with our free invoices, contracts and proposals, and, most importantly, they can get paid. Contra is commission-free, so our users can keep 100% of their earnings.""Nowadays, nearly two in five U.S. adults have a side hustle, and one in three of them say they use their side hustle earnings to cover everyday expenses, according to a Bankrate survey. Freelance projects can be an accessible, flexible option for people hoping to capitalize on their skill sets, but the most successful will be those who avoid the common pitfalls of the job.Related: 10 of the Most Profitable Side Hustles You Can Start With Little or No MoneyHuffman shares four mistakes that could hinder any side-hustler's success:1. Underpricing your services to attract your first clients""Going down this route can devalue your work,"" Huffman explains, ""and make raising prices much more challenging in the future. Before solidifying your prices, get to know the market you're entering, track industry rates, consider your years of experience and outline your unique expertise; these variables will help you determine a price that works for you and your clients.""2. Not prioritizing your projects the right way""It's important to prioritize projects that fully align with your skill set and politely turn down projects that could be a better fit with someone else,"" Huffman says. ""While many first-time freelancers may regret turning down new projects, taking on too much work can often lead to being overwhelmed and subpar work.""3. Not learning new in-demand skills""Right now, we are seeing a ton of demand for skills like Framer for building websites, video animation and social media management,"" Huffman says. ""There is also a huge opportunity to upskill in the latest AI tools. So much of the world of work is changing because of AI, and there is a huge opportunity to get ahead of it all.""

Not going the extra mile for your clients""Going above and beyond with clients can lead to referrals, more projects in the future and a reputation that will help you build longer-lasting relationships,"" Huffman says. ""To set up any project for success, you will want a well-scoped out set of deliverables and project timeline. Once you have this, you should get everything put into a contract so that you have a framework for your agreement and protection if things get off track.""And one last piece of advice for side hustle success? While growing your network of clients is important, don't forget to cultivate a network of other independent consultants, too. ""Having a community of fellow freelancers to bounce ideas off of and get advice from is invaluable and can lead to new leads in the future,"" Huffman says.

Dr. Kathrin Hamm, founder and CEO of sleep-wellness company Bearaby, never wanted to be an entrepreneur. After graduating with her Ph.D. in economics, she started as an economist at the World Bank. Her work took her all over the world and provided invaluable insight into the small, medium and women-founded enterprises she tried to convince banks to lend to — but she ""learned firsthand how hard it is, especially in developing countries, for women to get access to finance and start and grow their businesses.""During her time in India and Bangladesh especially, Hamm faced long, ""exhausting"" travel days. She'd ""never been a good sleeper,"" waking easily even as a child, and she developed a chronic case of insomnia. It began ""on a more moderate level,"" with difficulty falling and staying asleep, before the periods of wakefulness became longer and longer, motivating her to look into different solutions.Image Credit: Courtesy of Bearaby. Kathrin Hamm.



She started by investigating various mattress options, but when she dug deeper, she found an article discussing weighted blankets. The piece focused on helping children with sensory issues, Hamm recalls, but it also mentioned that evenly distributed weight on an adult body could support better sleep. Hamm was immediately intrigued — as a potential customer.Related: The No-Excuse Approach to Sleep and Work Performance for Entrepreneurs


""Let me buy a product, sleep better and then move on with my career.""""I came from a consumer lens,"" Hamm says, ""and knowing how hard it is for women to start a business, I [was] like, Yeah, I'm good here. I don't want to start a business or even think about becoming an entrepreneur. Let me buy a product, sleep better and then move on with my career.""However, the purchase process proved difficult. Unable to find options online, Hamm had to go to a pharmacy in Germany, where she's from, to place an order. Six weeks later, a ""big bean bag"" arrived. It was orange and blue and ""very noisy,"" Hamm says. She was reluctant to even try it at first and wondered if she'd made a mistake.""But then I put it on during the day on a weekend, and I just passed out after 10 minutes,"" Hamm says. ""And I woke up more than two hours later, [after] a solid nap, completely passed out, and I'm like, Wow, this is magic. This thing works for me.""


Related: Fighting Sleep Is a Losing Management Strategy. Let Your Employees Take Naps.So Hamm kept using the blanket at night, but there was a problem: Because the blanket was filled with plastic beads to add weight, she often got too hot. The underlying functionality works; the weight on my body works, Hamm remembers thinking, but how it is made doesn't work. After some research, Hamm discovered that the technology, which largely consisted of bead-filled chambers between layers of blanket, had been around for 30 years — ""Nobody had innovated anything about this product.""""Why can't you just use strips of cotton?""Hamm decided to experiment with alternative designs. She drew some inspiration from her time spent in India, ""where there's a culture of making rugs, knitting, crocheting,"" but the ultimate breakthrough came from a conversation with her mom. Hamm had been considering changing the material or adding holes for airflow when her mom said, ""Why can't you just use strips of cotton?"" They would create a thick yarn that could be knit together for natural airflow, eliminating the need for heavy artificial materials that shift around and reduce comfort. That idea led to the development of Bearaby's first small blanket, made from a cut-up t-shirt.


Confident she was onto something, Hamm opted to take a year's leave from her job to focus on the business. ""I didn't want to take too much of a risk, again, knowing that it can get really hard,"" she admits. ""[But] my boss was super supportive, and she said, 'Look, if it doesn't work out, we make a case study out of it.'""Hamm withdrew $120,000 from her retirement fund and raised just over $250,000 from a crowdfunding campaign to fund the prototypes for the first batch of blankets. She also looked into patents, but they were expensive, so she did the drawing herself, then had a lawyer put together a provisional patent application, which entitles the filer to 18 months before they have to pay more money. That went through just a couple of days before launch in December 2018; the blanket sold out in two weeks and was the only product of its kind on the market for a couple of years, Hamm says.Image Credit: Courtesy of BearabyRelated: How to Take Advantage of the 'First-to-File' Patent System


Despite the early success, the more than 50 factories that Hamm approached weren't inclined to take on the product. They'd never seen anything like it: It wasn't apparel, and it wasn't bedding. So, for that first year and a half, Hamm rented a small garage outfitted with knitting machines and knitters to churn out the first products. The strong sales helped the business continue to finance production, which was a good thing, too — because people still weren't all that interested in investing in the first-of-its-kind product.""In hindsight, we had to learn to be profitable.""Hamm leaned into the ""bootstrap"" mentality, which was a blessing in disguise. ""In hindsight, we had to learn to be profitable,"" she explains, ""to become in tune with our production processes and marketing processes, to be efficient, which sometimes you didn't see at that time in the direct-to-consumer space. Everyone was like, 'I raised that much money, and I'm putting that much million on a marketing spend.' So we never had it, but now, in an environment where money is not flowing [as] freely, we never had that money in the first place, so we are feeling pretty good right now.""Bearaby saw another major advantage in brand loyalty. Hamm notes that people seeking wellness and sleep tend to form an ""emotional connection"" with the blanket,"" and that it's easy to fall in love with a brand that helps you sleep better. Substantial interest also translated into an early retail presence. Just five months in, Bearaby was in West Elm, thanks to customers who walked in and wanted to try the blanket. That happened with Nordstrom, too.


Related: Customer Loyalty Is Your Holy Grail for Success. Here's How to Cultivate It.As Bearaby considered expansion, it centered on functional products that would uphold its commitment to quality and sustainability (the company is certified by third-party organizations, including The Global Organic Textile Standard, The Forest Stewardship Council and The Global Recycled Standard). Because anxiety so often goes hand in hand with insomnia, the company landed on its warmables line; boasting a weighted and heated neck wrap, bottle and lap pad, it ""takes the nervous system to zero,"" Hamm says.Image Credit: Courtesy of BearabyNaturally, Bearaby's products have become an integral part of Hamm's own sleep routine, and as she's gotten older, she's realized even more just how much sleep she actually needs. ""Now I sleep for a minimum of eight hours,"" she says. ""I'm training myself to get nine to 10 hours of sleep, obviously not every night, but definitely every weekend. Also, [it helps] whenever I get a chance to take a nap, like just a 20-minute nap to reset. [I make sure that I have] these conscious breaks, whether [it's] napping or deep breathing because running a business is a marathon, and if we don't take care of our bodies, we're not able to do that over a very long time.""


""Just have tunnel vision for one year, and then reevaluate after those 365 days.""Hamm's five-year marathon with Bearaby has led to over eight figures in sales and more than 10 patents — but it all started with a single, somewhat reluctant leap of faith. And according to the founder, that's exactly what it takes to be successful.""Once you believe in a product, just take a chance and give yourself a year,"" Hamm says. ""It's much more manageable if you [have] a considerable time frame where it's like, Okay, in that year, I'm giving everything I have, 100%. Because sometimes we second guess ourselves. After [a few] months or six weeks, we don't see the success, [and] we start doubting ourselves. You say [I have] one year, and I'm not asking if this is working. Just have tunnel vision for one year, and then reevaluate after those 365 days.""This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

A wood stove in the kitchen heated the entire property, and there was an outhouse for a toilet.""It was tough from day to day,"" Cohen, a second-generation immigrant to New York, told Business Insider.But his upbringing motivated him to aim high.""I remember carrying buckets of water to the chicken coops, one in each hand,"" he said. ""It was cold. 'I'm not going to live this way all my life,' I said to myself.""



Cohen, who attended a one-room schoolhouse, received a scholarship to an agricultural college — ""The only thing it didn't cover was board and lodging,"" he said — where he earned a bachelor's in microbiology and a master's in biochemistry and nutrition.Cohen had a basic childhood on a farm with no electricity or running water.

He got married, had three children, and became the CEO of another pharmaceutical firm.Now 101 years old and still in his home, he's in good health. He manages his finances, oversees renovations, and is interested in philosophy.""I keep in shape, mentally and physically,"" he said.He said he'd learned a series of longevity lessons over the decades and shared some with BI.Be ambitiousCohen said he ""came from zero"" to become a CEO.


The centenarian took risks in his career, such as pivoting from research to a role in advertising at his first drug company, despite having no experience in the latter.Cohen spent his 55-year career at three companies, culminating in his role as CEO.Cohen with his wife, Joan, at a work function in the 1960s. Courtesy of I. Roy Cohen. via BIHe traveled the world — for business and pleasure — before retiring at 81.""The idea of early retirement is horrible to me,"" he said of working almost six decades. ""It's stultifying.""He said the secret to a fulfilling career — and longevity in general — included stepping out of your comfort zone.""If you want something badly enough, if you feel something's not right and you need a change, you'll find a way,"" he added.


Work at relationshipsCohen, who had seven brothers and sisters, said he learned to ""get along with other people,"" often out of necessity.His childhood revolved around relationships with his siblings.""You have no choice but to figure out how to stay stable,"" he said. ""If you live with a whole bunch of other people, you can't carry on wildly and selfishly as if you're the only person in the family.""His first marriage was annulled after less than a year. It was sad, he said, but the experience helped him reconsider the idea of a life partner.Cohen and his wife, Joan, had 3 children and 6 grandchildren together. Courtesy of I. Roy Cohen via BI""I was cautious about making that commitment again,"" he said, adding that he found ""the right woman"" in his second wife, Joan, a teacher, who died six years ago at 83.""It took a while to adjust to each other, but, like all things, you have to work at it,"" Cohen said. ""It's no good if you head down a negative pathway without communicating properly.""


He urged younger people to do the same. ""You should keep an open mind and listen to the other person's point of view.""Follow the Mediterranean Diet and walk dailyCohen thinks his longevity has a genetic element. His father and mother died at 86 and 90, respectively.Still, he said there were some simple rules he'd followed throughout his life.The 101-year-old, who said his only health issues were prostate-related, is a devotee of the Mediterranean diet, popular among wealthy executives like Jeff Bezos, who famously ate ""breakfast octopus."" Biohacking tech millionaire Bryan Johnson also follows aspects of the diet, and sells his own ""longevity"" olive oil.


While the diet is beloved by wealthy longevity-seekers, it features relatively accessible ingredients that are easy to prepare. Cohen avoids processed foods and meat in favor of fresh fish, vegetables, and olive oil.""If I want a snack, I'll munch on a piece of cauliflower, a carrot, or a red pepper,"" Cohen said. ""I eat a lot of cabbage and salad.""He said he'd long incorporated fitness into his life, starting with his work on the farm.Cohen with his wife and their first child, David, now 63. Courtesy of I. Roy Cohen. via BI""I used a pitchfork to throw bundles of hay onto the wagon and into the barn,"" he recalled. ""You're lifting a chunk of hay over your head, and it's very difficult.""These days, his exercise regimen involves 20 minutes of leg exercises while sitting on the bed every morning. He also walks ""circuits"" around his open-plan kitchen and living room. ""I do at least 60 every day.""Keep your brain agileThe centenarian said he was sorting paperwork to prepare his tax return for the accountant to submit in April.""I keep track of all my finances,"" he said. ""I tackle all the details before they before they even come up.""It keeps my mind in shape.""He said he ""constantly has a project on the go."" Most recently, he had the driveway and roof of his house redone and installed lighting in the trees.""Being busy keeps me happy,"" Cohen said.He said it was important to nurture a positive attitude with age.""People allow things that are not that important to drag them down,"" he said. ""But you can't allow yourself to be angry or jealous all the time.""He also said spirituality had helped steer him through life.""It doesn't have to be organized religion, but it's important to try at least to figure out what makes the world tick.""

In 1991, the average reported retirement age was 57; in 2022, it was 61, according to a Gallup survey of more than 1,000 U.S. adults.The increase is perhaps not surprising given recent inflationary pressure, but it paints a troubling picture of what's ahead if Americans don't set themselves up for retirement in the years to come.And a new survey from personal finance resource GOBakingRates suggests that many of them won't. The research, which surveyed over 1,000 U.S. adults, revealed that nearly 40% of Americans are contributing nothing to a retirement fund — and 30% of them say they'll never be able to retire.

      Key Takeaways    



        Rowley recognized a gap in the market when it came to aesthetically pleasing baby gear — like wraps. 
      


        She bought a few thousand dollars worth of fabric and a used serger and opened an Etsy shop, then got to work. 
      


        After her husband joined the company, they hired their first employee, and sales exploded — to $1 million. 
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Elle Rowley, founder of Solly Baby, a company that produces sustainably sourced baby wraps made of 100% certified TENCEL Modal and other baby gear. In 2023, Rowley stepped away from her day-to-day role (she now serves the brand as a strategic advisor and is on the board), and the company welcomed Nicole Newhouse as CEO to lead the next stage of Solly Baby's growth.Image Credit: Courtesy of Solly Baby. Elle Rowley.When did you start Solly Baby as a side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?



After having my first baby in 2009, I was surprised to find a surge of creative inspiration that I had never known before having kids. My husband was still in school, and I was hungry to start something to supplement our meager student income. By the time I was pregnant with our second child in 2011, the online world was fertile ground for mothers looking to start a side hustle from home. I tried a few different things, but I intuitively knew that there was a gap in the market when it came to aesthetically pleasing baby gear, so I was pretty focused on that space throughout my pregnancy.I loved wearing my first baby, and I'd heard that wraps were the most comfortable way to wear an infant, so being industrious and broke, I made two wraps out of cheap jersey knit fabric — one for me and one for a friend who was also pregnant. While my crude prototype was far from what the product became, I could see the potential for this long piece of fabric to actually be a fashion accessory for the wearer rather than ""baby gear."" What really sealed it, though, was the first time I timidly ventured out holding my toddler's hand and carrying my baby wrapped on my chest. Before we left the front porch, he was asleep and breathing deeply on my chest. The increase in confidence that I felt with each step was palpable. I felt liberated, and at the same time, I'd never felt more connected to my baby. I knew I was on to something.


What were some of the first steps you took to get the side hustle off the ground?I found a fabric supplier in the fabric district of Los Angeles, purchased a few thousand dollars worth of fabric (thanks to credit cards and a loan from my in-laws), bought a used serger on Craigslist for $50 and opened an Etsy shop. Then, I got to work mostly when my babies were sleeping. I turned our house into a factory to make the first 50 wraps. I signed up for every local handmade market that I could find, which didn't garner great sales results, but the feedback I received from people in real life was invaluable. Lastly, in a decision that felt reckless at the time because of the cost, I hired my favorite photographer to take photos of me wearing my son. I had a nice camera and could have ""made-do"" on my own, but I knew that having beautiful images would help compensate for the many other areas where the brand was weak.Image Credit: Courtesy of Solly BabyWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building the business, and how did you navigate them?


Growth is expensive: I had no capital other than the $4,000 loan for fabric, and finance is not my area of expertise, so I knew I would need a very cash flow-positive business model. In the first three years, it was very challenging to finance our growth, but I can see what a gift it was now to have that constraint. Because we had no factoring terms with our suppliers or credit lines, we'd have to pay a hefty deposit on our production when we submitted the purchase order. Then, we'd pay the remainder of the balance upon completion. This made growth slow, and we were constantly underselling. As demand for the product grew, we started placing everything on preorder on our website, which gave us enough to pay for the order. This made it so our customers were essentially funding our growth.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the business bring in at that point?Sales had been growing year over year in 2013, but we were still only grossing a few hundred thousand dollars a year and taking home less than $100,000. Daily sales were still very inconsistent, which made it difficult to have a lot of confidence in hiring employees or even believing that this was anything more than a side hustle. I was hitting a wall of exhaustion when my husband and I made the leap of faith to bring him into Solly Baby with me. He'd finished school and was working with another startup, but we both felt his time would be better spent if we focused our efforts together. This shift immediately led to new growth and vision. His help also freed me up to work more on the business rather than in the business. We then hired our first employee, Kortney, who took over customer service and fulfillment in a way that freed my husband and me up to focus on growth.Just weeks after hiring Kortney, and days before I had my third child in the spring of 2014, we released our spring collection, and the demand went through the roof. Sales went from anywhere between zero to $3,000 per day to $2,000 becoming our new daily baseline — and releases bringing in tens of thousands of dollars in a day. We hit $1 million in sales that November, and by the end of that year, we knew this was much more than a side hustle.


You've since turned your side hustle into a very successful business. What does revenue look like now?It's been amazing to experience the growth we have been able to achieve. To see this business grow from my house to an Etsy shop to reaching millions of mothers, parents and families is truly humbling. As we continued to build the team and find our footing in the market, some years, we saw revenue double year over year. Today, Solly Baby operates at $10 to 20 million in annual revenue.What's your favorite part about running Solly Baby? As a mother of four, connecting with, encouraging and providing products for postpartum mothers during a very transformational time of life has always been life-giving work for me. It will never get old to meet a mother or father who says, ""Your wraps changed my relationship with my baby."" Knowing that our products have the power to change the trajectory of a parent-child relationship is deeply rewarding.


Developing company culture and ethos was also very rewarding. I made our company motto ""small things with great love"" several years ago because I hold a deep belief that small things done thoughtfully create the biggest and best things. This is relevant to growing a business and equally relevant to raising children. Seeing this adopted and trickle down into every part of the company as CEO felt very meaningful.What does your routine look like these days? Are there any helpful habits you'd recommend to other entrepreneurs?Keeping a daily routine is my best advice. I am a big believer in getting up before your kids (unless you have an infant — then sleep as much as you can!), exercising, getting ready for the day and taking at least 30 minutes for spiritual or meditative practice.It was easy in the early days to completely neglect myself to meet the needs of my family and the business, but I strongly believe that we would've grown faster and with more intention had I taken better care of myself from the beginning. I was running on empty all of the time, and it just about broke me in the first two years. What's more is that the business was not stronger because of my ""sacrifices."" I became very depressed and anxious and finally shared this with my husband. We made a self-care plan together, and everything quickly improved in my life, personally and professionally.


What's your best advice for others hoping to start a successful business of their own? We're often encouraged to ""think big"" when it comes to business, but sometimes, thinking ""small"" is the perfect way to begin — mainly because it will get you to begin. I don't think I would have had the confidence to start a multi-million dollar, global company at the age of 25, but I didn't need to. I just needed enough confidence to make the first 50 wraps to help pay the rent and a sincere desire to bring mothers and babies closer through the product. That was all I needed to get the ball rolling, and then my confidence and vision expanded with the company. We kind of grew up together, Solly Baby and me.This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

33,Virgin Voyages Wants Remote Workers to 'Work From Helm' on Month-Long Cruises,"Mar 13, 2024",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/virgin-voyages-offers-remote-workers-monthlong-summer-cruise/471108,"
For remote workers seeking a change of scenery, Virgin Voyages may have the answer.The adults-only cruise line, which is owned by Richard Branson's Virgin Group, has unveiled the ""Scarlet Summer Season Pass,"" giving cruise-goers a full month (with options available in June, July, August, and September) to sail the Mediterranean aboard the company's Scarlet Lady ship — all while keeping our day job.Related: Richard Branson: Create Something Special, Money Will Follow



""Take a vacation away from your monotonous work-from-home setup, and start taking calls from your private balcony overlooking the Mediterranean Sea,"" the company said in a release. ""With the fastest at-sea internet on the high seas in the [business], it'll be a breeze hopping on your morning video meeting as you feel, well, the literal ocean breeze.""Prices start at $9,900 for two and include laundry service, ""premium"" Wi-FI, a dedicated concierge service, and a $10 daily coffee credit.


Each ship will explore different routes and stop at nine ports (two times each) in select locations on the coast of Spain, France, and Italy. All four voyages will depart from Barcelona, which means U.S. remote workers will need to fly to Europe to begin their journey.""I've never thought of work and play as two different things — it's all just living,"" Branson said in a release. ""We want to give sailors that same opportunity, so we came up with this idea to have them travel the world while working aboard our beautiful ships — though this sounds like a lot more fun than my houseboat.""Related: These Are the Best Cruise Lines of 2023: ReportVirgin said that there are a limited number of rooms available and that interested attendees must fill out a form online and will find out within 72 hours if they've been selected. If selected, cruises are nonrefundable.

      Key Takeaways    



        Tremblay and Ciupka wanted to ""think beyond the industrial era five-day workweek, two-day weekend."" 
      


        After reading case studies and analyzing their own team's productivity, they decided to eliminate Fridays. 
      


        The model requires an ""experimental, progress-oriented mindset,"" but they'll never go back to a five-day workweek.
      



This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dominic Tremblay. He and his partner Ludwig Ciupka are co-founders of TUX, a creative agency that gives back through its Karma Foundation and boasts clients including Eucerin, Prada, Lancôme Paris, Make Up For Ever, Milk & Bone and Doctors of the World, among others. Image Credit: Courtesy of TUX. Dominic Tremblay.In 2021, we started to think about how we could push TUX further. We're an LGBTQ+-owned company that's been B-Corp-certified since 2017, inspired by many companies that were really innovating in terms of sustainability practices. For us, the next quest became, Could we reinvent the workweek? Could we think beyond the industrial era's five-day workweek and two-day weekend? It was a big decision, so we began the research process.

35,She Started a Side Hustle While Working 2 Jobs as a Line Cook for $22 an Hour Combined — Now It's an 8-Figure Brand You've Probably Seen on TV,"Mar 13, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/an-apron-side-hustle-turned-into-a-multimillion-dollar-brand/470978,"
For Ellen Bennett, founder of kitchenware brand Hedley & Bennett, food has been a life-long love. ""I'm half-Mexican and half-English, and so I grew up with this very unusual combination of eating tamales and caldo de pollo, and things that are very Mexican, alongside shepherd's pie and tea with my English grandpa,"" she tells Entrepreneur.But before Bennett built the apron business named for her English and Mexican families, she attended culinary school in Mexico City, where it was more affordable than in the U.S. She took modeling jobs and translation gigs to support herself there, then moved back to Los Angeles, where she was raised, to work at some of the city's best restaurants.Image Credit: Shayan Asgharnia. Ellen Bennett.



""I've always put one foot in front of the other towards the thing that I want to do, never stop and don't stare too long because then you'll get scared and won't do it,"" Bennett says. ""So I keep myself moving always and forever. And I feel like that has been one of the successful traits for me: I don't analyze — I just do.""In 2012, at 24, Bennett was doing a whole lot: She worked as a line cook at Providence, which boasts a two-star Michelin rating, and at Bäco Mercat, pulling in $22 an hour between the two jobs. In the mornings, she also worked as a personal chef for a family. ""It was around the clock,"" she recalls, adding that 14-hour days within the industry were par for the course.


Related: She Used $10,000 in Savings to Turn Her Side Hustle Into an 8-Figure Brand You've Probably Seen""If I can make the [equivalent] uniform piece of dignity [and] roll [that] into this world of cooking, maybe I change this whole industry.""Despite the ""hustle"" of her day-to-day, Bennett had a big idea, one that served as a ""funny through line"" from her life as a ""hardcore line cook"" to the ""other life"" she led — in Mexico City she'd often donned suits for work events, and as an avid runner with marathons under her belt, she knew a thing or two about athletic attire that could stand up to the rigors of the sport.""So I combined the two in my head,"" Bennett says, ""and I thought, Man, if I can make the [equivalent] uniform piece of dignity [and] roll [that] into this world of cooking, maybe I change this whole industry. Because we're getting our asses handed to us. We work so hard, [and] everybody looks like shit.""


A few weeks later, a chef at one of the restaurants where Bennett worked presented her with the perfect opportunity to start her side hustle. He said he was going to order aprons for everybody, and Bennett, who'd been thinking nonstop about chef coats and various aspects of the uniform, ""blurted out in Ellen Bennett fashion"" that she had an apron company.Image Credit: Courtesy of Hedley & Bennett. Related: At 23, She Started a Side Hustle for 'Quick Money.' Now the Business Brings in More Than $1 Million a Month — and Boasts Celebrity Fans.Of course, Bennett didn't have a business at that point, but she said she'd been working on an idea — ""and by working, I meant it was in my head,"" she admits. Still, she managed to convince the chef to place an order for 40 aprons, and with ""absolutely nothing other than willpower and chutzpah,"" she ""started the whole damn thing."" Bennett showed up anywhere she could find chefs who might be interested in her aprons — from farmers' markets to Eater LA events.


""I would walk up to people and just be like, 'Hey, I'm a cook at Providence. I work there, and I have an apron company. Can I show you what I'm working on?'"" Bennett says. ""So it was very much from a place of humility, but I also was shameless about talking to anyone. And I never hid behind a computer waiting for people to email me. I just stood in front of you, and if you had ears, I was going to talk to you.""""'Oh my god, Japanese denim? That's cool. American canvas? Hell yeah.'""Bennett didn't have a sewing background, but she'd always loved design, so her process in those early days ""was truly scrappy."" She'd sit down with chefs and listen to their pain points (which she knew all too well as an industry professional), drilling down on the finer yet crucial details that so often went ignored in the apron game — like durable fabric.Image Credit: Courtesy of Hedley & Bennett.


Quickly, Bennett leaned into ""elevating the core materials,"" much like how a Michelin-starred restaurant raises the bar for food. ""We're still just selling food,"" Bennett explains, ""but it's the best fish you've ever had in the world because we sourced it from the best place. So I applied that same logic."" And Bennett's aprons were an instant hit.Related: For Years, This Black Founder Learned an Uncommon But Essential Craft on the Side. Now His Creations Are Beloved By Celebrity Chefs — and Can Sell for More Than $1,000.""These chefs got really nerdy about it,"" Bennett says. ""They're like, 'Oh my god, Japanese denim? That's cool. American canvas? Hell yeah'. And then, instead of using plastic hardware, I'd be like, 'What if we use brass hardware?' And they'd be like, 'Yes, I love that.' So I essentially just collaborated and listened.""Now, Hedley & Bennett is an eight-figure brand, and if you've tuned in to any cooking show or show about cooking, you've no doubt seen it in action: 70% of chefs on the Food Network wear Hedley & Bennett aprons, and nearly every chef who appears on Top Chef and The Bear is donning one too, according to data provided by the brand. Hedley & Bennett also boasts partnerships with The Beatles, NASA and Crocs, among others, and has since expanded into general kitchenware, including knives, potholders and more.


""Even if you go out and raise $50 million, you still have to build community to get customers.""Although Bennett's apron idea resonated with other chefs immediately and has seen enormous growth in the past decade-plus, she stresses that Hedley & Bennett was far from an overnight success — and that, realistically, there's no such thing.The brand didn't have any outside investment. Instead, she grew Hedley & Bennett ""the old-school way,"" reinvesting every penny back into the business as she built ""brick by brick,"" ""street by street"" and ""customer by customer,"" securing that essential brand loyalty along the way. And the people she sold her aprons to in the beginning remain customers, Bennett notes: ""There's a love that exists that you can't buy from an Instagram ad.""""Even if you go out and raise $50 million, you still have to build community to get customers,"" Bennett says. ""You just happen to have more money in the bank. Are you willing to show up and talk to people? Are you willing to listen, pivot, adapt your product to them and what they actually need? Everyone goes through the same struggles. It's just how many resources you can throw at it. And because I had limited resources, I got a lot more creative than I would have if I had all the money in the world.""


Related: Using Social Media Alone to Build Your Brand's Online Community Means You Risk Losing It All. Here's Why.What's more, Hedley & Bennett's initial business-to-business (B2B) model meant a ""slow and steady"" approach that benefited from ""brutally honest chefs"" who didn't mince words when it came to letting Bennett know what was and wasn't working. The feedback was invaluable, but despite an influx of requests for additional products, Hedley & Bennett remained ""hyper-focused"" on putting out the perfect customizable apron — until the pandemic hit. We need to actually create a systemized streamlined menu of how we outfit these restaurants in a way that we can scale it, Bennett realized.So Hedley & Bennett incorporated a direct-to-consumer approach. Within one month, the brand went from shipping everything internally to shipping with third-party logistics (3PL). ""It was not clean or smooth or anything like that,"" Bennett says. ""It was just the right thing for the business, and the whole world couldn't meet in person. So it was like, 'How do we get it online as fast as possible?'""From there, Bennett considered all of the feedback they'd received — and which products it made sense to tackle next. ""We're like, 'Okay, well, what's the natural extension from aprons that's an essential, because we don't like making tchotchkes.'"" Bennett recalls. ""We're all about longevity, quality on things you need, not just like a lemon squeezer, which is fine, but you can squeeze a lemon with your hands, too."" That led the brand to knives.


Image Credit: Shelby Moore.""There's nothing wrong with taking longer to build something great.""Hedley & Bennett's journey has been lengthy and full of ""little peaks and valleys"" trending upward overall, but because she's ""such an action-oriented person,"" Bennett says she rarely dwells on what she didn't do along the way.Still, in the beginning, Bennett does wish she'd taken a step back to value herself and her contributions the way that other people did. ""I don't mean that in an ego-driven way,"" she says. ""It's not about being like I'm the coolest, I'm the best, but it's simply respecting yourself for the work that you did and saying, 'Not only did I build the table — I built the chair that I got to sit in at the table. I made this.'""


Image Credit: Evan Robinson.Related: Don't Just Sit At the Table, Flip It. A Reflection for Women Entrepreneurs.And her best advice for other entrepreneurs who want to take their big idea from side hustle to multimillion-dollar brand?""I'm a huge believer in the long game,"" she says. ""You can start something out of your house with no money and have a viable, profitable business that you are a majority owner of many years later. And that is awesome. There's nothing wrong with taking longer to build something great. I know our whole lives are oriented towards speed and how quickly things grow and [becoming] a unicorn, but you can be a long-game unicorn too.""

The asynchronous work environment was largely forced upon us in recent years, with professionals worldwide having little say in the matter. However, the continued commonality of this geographically extended workplace means we have to make sure that by cutting certain corners of traditional work, we aren't depriving ourselves of personal working life hacks and skills, such as motivation, that should be ever-present in workplaces.From my experience, intrapersonal-type skills tend to be cast aside and devalued in an async environment. Our focus for today is motivation, which is one of them. If we just stop for a second to think about prior conversations regarding our levels of motivation, I believe that most of our memories will jump to a time when a pitfall in motivation brought about the conversation, and thus, occurs at a time when it is almost impossible to successfully maneuver ourselves out of this rut, and onto an inspired, powerful, and motivated path once again.This mustn't be the case, and as a pioneer of async communication and workplaces myself through my role as CEO of Bubbles, I want to make sure we are continuously mindful and self-aware, but that we also collaborate to structure our working environments in such a way that we give each other the highest chance of success and omnipresent motivation. Let me show you how.



Related: Has Technology Killed Face-To-Face Communication? How to Navigate the Nuances of Digital Age CommunicationUnderstanding asynchronous workTo understand optimizing asynchronous motivation, we should first boost our understanding of this newfound technique. I say newfound, but in reality, async communication has been around for donkey's years (relatively speaking), with email and fax, for example, but these processes were never enough alone to fully run businesses from. This is why, with the recent influx of revolutionary async communication methods and tools, such as Bubbles, and the increasing popularity of tools like Slack, we are witnessing a new asynchronous generation and phenomenon among professionals. However, not everyone is keeping up.


In 2022, Buffer's State of Remote Work report revealed that only 38% of companies had an async-first policy, despite 52% of employees desiring an async set-up. Moving and evolving with the times is something critical in my view of a successful business, and trying to always align with what our employees want is something that should go without saying. If we ignore these lighthouse signals, we are likely to witness, ironically, things like a lack of motivation in our teams. Nevertheless, I want to focus on the instances where async has been chosen and help as best as I can, starting with some soft-skills and intrapersonal skills.Related: How to Create an Asynchronous Work CultureFlexibility and employee preferencesThe allure of remote work largely stems from its flexibility. Buffer's report highlighted that 67% of remote workers valued flexibility in time management, while 62% appreciated the choice of work location. This flexibility, however, must be balanced with strategies to keep remote workers motivated and engaged.Empathy and recognition in asynchronous workEmpathy is naturally intertwined with asynchronous working. Providing our employees with vast flexibility and choice of working locations cannot be discredited in terms of a caring approach to each individual, to the extent that these two remote benefits came at the top of an importance list in the same Buffer report. I want to note here, though, that this is not just about 'being nice' to our staff, because the reality is that we will gain masses in return for this thoughtfulness, through boosts in motivation, productivity and desire to impress. This claim that I make is not plucked out of thin air, and in fact, according to Businessolver, a staggering 70% of employees and HR professionals agree that empathetic organizations lead to higher employee motivation. Moreover, 68% of HR professionals believe employee recognition and feedback positively impact retention (SHRM). In an asynchronous setting, where face-to-face interactions are limited, recognizing employees' efforts becomes even more vital to maintaining motivation.


Here are five more strategies for maintaining motivation.1. Establish clear communication channelsClear and efficient communication is imperative for your team to thrive in an asynchronous environment. I am not just referring to the technology here, as although that is the umbrella above this, it is equally important to set expectations for response times and time-based performance.Related: Open Your Digital Doors: Communication and Remote Work2. Build this culture of recognitionRecognition excites people and boosts motivation. Professionals are aware of this to some degree, with Reward Gateway proving that 60% of employees want to see managers or leaders praising their colleagues' work more often. When feedback like this arises from a group who are looking to become a more prosperous and motivated team, we can be sure that regular recognition, whether in one-on-one sessions or daily stand-up, is something to focus on.


3. Promote work-life balanceOne of remote work's main and most widely covered struggles is unplugging after work hours. Again, encouraging a healthy work-life balance and being empathetic with after-hours communication can prevent burnout and maintain motivation.Related: Having A Work-Life Balance is Nonsense. To Reach Your Goals, Follow Another Approach4. Provide opportunities for professional growthEmployees want and need growth and development opportunities even in an asynchronous environment. Keep the conversations going about career paths, and make sure to mentor wherever you can.5. Implement flexible work policiesFlexible work policies are a key motivator, and a highly valued aspect of async, as established earlier. A PR NewsWire report also indicates that 81% of employers see improving talent retention as a motivation for adopting flexible work policies, as well as boosting the pool from which they can hire. Allowing employees to choose their working hours can increase job satisfaction and motivation, meaning you get more from less.So, I hope by now you have clocked on to the importance of not neglecting key aspects of our work lives, such as motivation. This is a lesson that is aimed at helping you and your teammates, so I hope you can go away from this motivation to instill some new values in your asynchronous workplace!

37,4 Types of Toxic People That May Be Undermining Your Path to Success,"Mar 12, 2024",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-types-of-toxic-people-you-need-to-keep-out-of-your-life/469742,"
Since becoming a personal and professional coach, I've noticed with increased intensity how much the people we surround ourselves with matter. In his 2005 book, The Success Principles, Jack Canfield quoted motivational speaker Jim Rohn, saying that we're the ""average of the top five people"" we associate with. I've found this to be incredibly true. The people we spend the most time with influence nearly all our thoughts and values. Essentially, we become a reflection of them.As we identify the right people, it's equally important that we identify the wrong people. In my recent book, 6 H.A.B.I.T.S. of Powerful People, I identified four types of people that are best avoided. If you want to generate a successful and happy life, avoid associating with the following people.Related: 7 Toxic People to Avoid When Starting a Business



1. Gossips: If they gossip with you, they'll gossip about youThere's only so much airtime in conversations. When we focus on one topic, we can't focus on another. Each minute you spend discussing other people is a minute you're not spending discussing your own ideas. Often, gossips stay stuck because they're so busy talking about things they can't control (other people) that they don't make time to talk about the things they can control (themselves). When you're with them, you forego opportunities to explore your own visions of the future: things you're passionate about, what you stand for, the life you'd like to create for yourself and how you plan to make an impact in the world.Psychologist Murray Brown theorized that a two-person emotional system is unstable: under stress, it forms itself into a three-person system or triangle. Gossiping with others can be a way of building a bond with them, which serves as a substitute for bonding over something more meaningful. Sadly, when people learn to build bonds in this way (triangulating: involving a third absent party), it's hard for them to turn it off. It becomes a pattern of behavior, and this habit is hard to break.


Ask yourself how much you're gossiping with friends. Consider how you'd feel if these friends gossiped about you. If you want to feel happier in your friendships, look for new things to discuss besides other people. Talking about your recent challenges, learnings and successes usually feels good. Talking about your future dreams, goals or plans is also quite exciting.2. Liars: They'd rather save face than face a tough conversationHonesty is critically important in relationships. People who lie, especially repeatedly, break trust. Relationships built on distrust are extremely unstable. You waste valuable time wondering if what you're being told is the truth, and once again, that time is better spent building bonds of connectedness. It's possible to regain trust when it's gone, but it isn't easy and takes a lot of work.Healthy relationships are built on trust, not lies. Anyone who feels it's a good idea to deceive you instead of having a tough conversation usually lacks character. If you've lied to anyone recently, consider proactively fessing up. It might not be pleasant, especially in the moment, but telling people the truth feels good and shows your companion that you truly value them and the relationship. It also helps you get right with yourself.Related: How to Improve Your Relationships — Both Personally and Professionally


3. Dream killers: They don't support your goalsIdentifying and manifesting our dreams is hard work. Surrounding ourselves with people who don't believe in us or aren't willing to support us is a surefire way to fail. We can all do nearly anything we want in life, if we have the right level of desire, focus, determination, discipline and preparation. But associating with people who tell us our dreams are silly (especially if it's coming from someone we respect or love) makes it much harder.In 2014, I decided I wanted to become a runner. Back then, I couldn't even run a 5K. I logged hours of training and in 2015, I completed my first half-marathon. I then decided to run a full marathon. A close friend (whom I greatly admired) told me this feat would be nearly impossible for me: I didn't have the years of experience to achieve such a lofty goal. I almost listened to her. Before I did, I enlisted the advice of a few running acquaintances I'd met in the previous year. These new friends offered an incredible amount of encouragement and helped me recognize how strong and capable I'd become.I decided to listen to them instead of my close friend and ran my first marathon in early 2016. I now see I was on a slippery slope at that time. Had I listened to my longtime friend instead of my new acquaintances, I might never have run a marathon. Now, I've run 12. I found so much strength in their words. Surrounding myself with the right people at a time of major mental and physical struggle and growth helped me accomplish something remarkable (to me).Ask yourself if you have any friends who continually tell you that things are out of reach for you. Great friends will support your wildest dreams and cheer you on, not tear you down. After this experience, I decided to only keep friends who encourage my success even when it has nothing to do with their own success.

The best relationships in life are the ones where we feel safe and secure. We feel able to be ourselves. We don't feel unaligned with our core values. Any person who feels comfortable putting you in uncomfortable situations so they can advance a selfish motive isn't a friend. Think about your friends. Do you have any who routinely put you in dangerous or uncomfortable situations that don't result in your growth? Or encourage you to compromise your values? If so, it's time to reevaluate.Keep these kinds of people out of your life, and I guarantee you'll be happier and more successful. Even though it can be hard to tell a toxic friend goodbye, your life will improve because of it. The discomfort of making the decision and having the conversation is well worth the benefits that come from being choosy about the company you keep.

38,Do Children Need to Go Out of State for the Real College Experience?,"Mar 11, 2024",Mary Banks,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/do-children-need-to-go-out-of-state-for-the-real-college/470434,"
College is an unforgettable time for most of us — it's where we come into our own, begin to carve unique paths and form lasting memories and relationships. Many adults fondly reminisce about their college years, cherishing the freedom, independence, reinvention and fun.But is this experience reserved for those who attend out-of-state schools? Must it begin in a dorm room far away, or can children have the same transformative experience by attending an in-state college or even living at home? As a former admissions officer who has observed both perspectives, I can confidently say that children can enjoy this once-in-a-lifetime experience no matter how far they are from home. Let's explore this further.Related: What I Learned as a First-Generation College Student



Redefining the college experienceLet's first define the ""real college experience."" It encompasses three fundamental components: students living autonomously, forming new connections beyond childhood bonds and navigating their independence through self-directed decision-making and learning from mistakes. When we consider these elements, it becomes obvious that students can experience that special transformative college journey without putting hundreds of miles between them and their parents. In fact, sometimes students still rely on their parents even when separated by hundreds of miles, which I can personally attest to. As a college student, I would often bring my laundry home to wash all the way from Boston to Connecticut. On the other hand, even a two-mile distance can provide that necessary sense of freedom and autonomy.As I've often advised students, the campus environment is a novel experience for everyone, regardless of their college. The sense of wonder and excitement is palpable for any student taking their first steps onto campus. They are surrounded by peers from diverse backgrounds, each with their own stories, perspectives and aspirations. The campus is a hub of activity, with countless clubs, organizations and events catering to various interests. Whether it's joining a sports team, participating in a cultural festival or volunteering for a cause, the campus is always abuzz, and students have many ways to get involved.


Further, it's also a place of growth and self-discovery. Away from the familiarity of home and without their parents, students are pushed outside of their comfort zones and encouraged to take risks, try new things and challenge themselves. This process of self-exploration and personal development is an integral part of the college experience and isn't exclusive to out-of-state students.Related: 5 Reasons College Is Worth It for EntrepreneursThe advantages of staying close to homeStaying closer to home for college has several advantages. A major benefit to attending an in-state college is the cost. Tuition costs jump from a few thousand to $40,000 when attending an out-of-state school. This is especially important considering the ""freshman year flounder,"" where some students get caught up in the excitement of newfound freedom. They may not take academics as seriously and need to retake courses, prolonging their education by a year or so and, thus, increasing costs for their families. On the other hand, with in-state tuition, students can take advantage of lower costs during their first couple of years of college and then transfer to an out-of-state school to continue living the college dream for their final years.Staying closer to home also allows for a smoother transition into the responsibilities and challenges of college life. This can be particularly valuable for those who are introverted or haven't had extensive experience living independently. Encouraging your child to become independent and leave comfort behind is crucial, but pushing them to dive headfirst into living alone in a different state might be too much too soon. Attending a school closer to home will allow them to gradually step out of their comfort zone at their own pace, with the emotional support of family nearby when they feel overwhelmed. Moreover, while out-of-state Ivy League schools can offer more global degrees, students hoping to begin their careers in their home base may find it easier to network and access relevant career opportunities by attending an in-state college. To decide which option is best for your child and feasible for you financially, It's important to have these conversations seriously and first understand your child's needs and goals.Related: Should Your Entrepreneurial Child Go to College?


Setting boundaries: The key to the college experienceOn a final note, regardless of whether your child moves thousands of miles away or stays at home, the only way for them to truly have that explorative college experience is if you respect their independence and set healthy boundaries. While it can be challenging to watch them leave the nest, giving them the freedom to fully embrace this part of their lives is essential for their growth. It's important to allow them to make their own mistakes while letting them know you're there to support them from a distance, even if they're just in the next room. Create this distance by avoiding micromanaging their decisions and resisting the urge to constantly check in on them. Trust your child to navigate their college experience and discover their true potential as independent, emerging adults.

39,6 Ways I've Achieved a Healthy Work-Life Balance as a Business Owner,"Mar 11, 2024",Kartik Jobanputra,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-master-work-life-harmony-with-these-simple-steps/469893,"
Collaboration is a powerful tool that has become increasingly essential in the modern business world. Working together with others can help drive growth, innovation, and success. My journey with collaboration caused me to discover some hacks that have improved my work-life balance.This article will explore the importance of these hacks and provide some tips for re-prioritizing your work-life relationship and using it to achieve your goals.Related: Why Strong Collaborations Will Change Your Business



1. Set clear boundariesThe first step to finding balance is to set clear boundaries between your professional and personal life. When you're working, focus solely on business tasks without letting any outside influences distract you.Similarly, when you're out of the office, ensure that work doesn't infringe upon your other activities or relationships. You must understand what lines must not be crossed for both sides of your life to remain healthy and balanced.


2. Prioritize your timeWhen managing your time as an entrepreneur, it's important to prioritize the most important tasks first. This means taking some extra time during the day or week to plan what needs to be done ahead of time so that nothing is left undone or forgotten about. Doing this will help keep task-related stress at bay and give you more freedom in determining how best to divide up the rest of your day or week into a manageable schedule.Additionally, don't forget to add some non-work-related activities into your schedule, such as exercise or leisurely activities — these can help provide much-needed respite from your otherwise hectic workloads.Related: 15 of the Best Time Management and Productivity Books of All Time3. Take regular breaksIt's easy for entrepreneurs to get caught up in their work and forget about taking regular breaks throughout their day. But breaks are essential for maintaining both physical and mental health — they can help reduce stress levels while providing an opportunity for creativity, too.


Try setting reminders on your phone or computer so that you take regular breaks throughout the day – this could mean stepping away from the desk for 10 minutes every hour or even going for a walk during lunchtime, if possible! Taking regular breaks will refresh your mind and body alike, helping you stay productive yet balanced over time.Related: How to Achieve A CEO Level of Focus by Breaking Habits and Taking Breaks4. Learn to say noAs an entrepreneur, it can be easy to overextend yourself by saying yes too often when asked for favors or projects outside of work hours — but learning when (and how) to say no can ultimately save considerable amounts of unnecessary stress in the long run.Don't feel guilty if you need to turn down certain requests; just politely explain why it's not possible at this particular time, perhaps offering alternative solutions depending on what may be suitable instead. By knowing when (and how) to say no without feeling guilty, entrepreneurs can find greater peace of mind while still being able to give back where needed most.


5. Schedule regular 'me time'Making sure that there is adequate 'me time' built into each week is essential – regardless if it's reading a book in silence, going out with friends, or simply enjoying a warm bath after work hours — whatever activity works best for giving yourself some much-needed rest. Having this type of downtime allows entrepreneurs ample opportunity to recharge their batteries before returning to business mode — allowing them to manage better stress levels associated with being constantly busy with numerous tasks at hand.6. Don't neglect your health and well-beingLastly - one key area that entrepreneurs needn't forget about balancing is their health & well-being; don't neglect to eat nutritious food regularly during working hours nor avoid exercise altogether either — these are paramount needs necessary for keeping one's energy levels high while reducing any risks associated from sitting down all day — thus ensuring both physical & mental well-being remains balanced over longer periods.ConclusionManaging a successful career and a satisfying lifestyle outside of work can be difficult but achievable, no matter what stage in business development one might find themselves at now.The key lies in understanding where our limits lie and setting clear boundaries between our personal life and professional obligations accordingly—along with scheduling sufficient 'me' time each week where necessary. Following such guidelines helps ensure balance remains intact over extended periods while promoting productivity and achieving success simultaneously, too.

40,How to Advance Your Brain's Efficiency and Automate Mundane Tasks,"Mar 11, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/why-you-need-to-embrace-ai-to-maximize-your-brainpower/469725,"
Early last year, two economists and two large language models chatted on a panel about the future of cognitive automation. The non-humans, ChatGPT and Claude, held their own, contributing meaningful insight to the conversation. At one point in the discussion, Claude remarked: ""I believe continued progress in AI and automation could take over most routine and even many non-routine cognitive tasks currently performed by humans, enabling unprecedented material abundance while liberating humanity from drudgery and toil.""As I read these lines, I found myself nodding. True enough, cognitive automation — automating mental tasks like administrative work, data analysis and content creation — has the potential to take human jobs. But if adopted conscientiously, it can also complement the work that only humans can do, and free us to pursue more meaningful tasks. The onus falls on leaders to ensure that employees receive the proper education and training to adapt to an increasingly AI-fueled workplace.Related: Always Waiting for the Best Option Is Holding You Back.

41,From Stress to Success — 6 Ways to Turn Your Fears into Resilience,"Mar 8, 2024",Rachel S. Ruby,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-conquer-your-fear-to-jumpstart-success/469018,"
Fear is the biggest obstacle to healing and personal success. Many challenging emotions tend to scare us when going through a trauma like divorce, especially those related to being alone and finances. All negativity and stress can lead to fear, which can actually prevent healing.To overcome fear so healing is possible, realizing the need to take action is imperative. It is common for people going through trauma to make plans as to what they will do to start over, but so many get derailed and don't actually take the steps to make the plans a reality.Related: 4 Ways Intuitive Healing Can Save Your Life — And How to Get StartedHere are some simple ways to take action to get started with the healing work.1. RelaxRelaxing sounds so simple — and it is — but it often gets overlooked amidst the chaos of life. It's important to remember that relaxation does not have to take long, and it will make you feel good — and when we feel good, we want more of that.



Healing is not possible when we are in a victim state or scared. We need to feel all the feelings and then learn to let those that do not serve us go so we can focus on the positive ones and the joy we can create in the new life we envision.Incorporate relaxation into your day every day — even if it's just for 10 minutes. Take a bath, go on a beautiful walk, meditate or read a book. Recognize what feels good and calms you because being in this state during stressful times will help you focus on getting to a place where you feel like this more often… until you heal and feel it the majority of the time.Related: 3 Mental Rules to Help You Understand (and Finally Relax) Your Busy Brain2. Evolve""To evolve"" means becoming your highest and best version. We must consciously evolve to heal, lest we stay where we are. It involves doing things differently and seeking answers from within. In the case of a divorce, you must determine who you are outside of the former marriage and who you want to become in your new life.


Figuring this out involves diving into some deep questions about yourself to figure out what you need to work on to live your desired life. Most people need guidance to tackle some of the emotional states like low self-worth and false beliefs about oneself. Other limiting beliefs include shame, lack of confidence or the belief that we ""can't"" evolve from a caterpillar to a butterfly.3. FailFailure is necessary in order to grow. If we got what we wanted all the time, we would not feel appreciative — and gratitude is necessary not only for healing but as part of a happy life. Try new things, know you might fail, and revel in the lessons learned from that failure. It allows you to fine-tune who you want to be and what you want to create.Related: From Setback to Success — 4 Ways to Turn Your Struggles into Resilience4. RedirectWe are all made of energy; when that energy strays from the positive, we can hit a wall in our healing journey. This is normal and will happen often, so learn how to redirect that energy to set yourself back on the right path.


Depending on where the feeling manifests, there are things you can do to redirect. For example, say you are feeling down and sit on the couch binge-watching Netflix. In the process, you consume half a container of ice cream, and your stomach doesn't feel good. A redirect could be to turn off the TV, turn on some dance music, and get lost in movement. You will likely feel completely different after just a short time dancing (but keep going if it feels good!). Your action is opposite to what you were doing, allowing you to release negative energy.Related: The 5 Greatest Obstacles to Success -- and How to Crush Them5. Have funHealing shouldn't be so serious all the time. When we go through trauma like divorce, it is not uncommon to lose the connection with our inner child, as the process is usually stressful and sad. Just like redirecting energy through dancing, as in the example above, having fun helps us connect with that inner child, which can turn the perspective around.Make plans to have fun — don't just think you will do it. Go roller skating with a friend, shoot some hoops, play pickleball or whatever sounds fun. Try new things, too, and make sure to spice it up. New experiences fulfill a child's wonder and curiosity, so channel that perspective as you make plans.


6. Get helpIt's okay to ask for help; if you have the right support network of people who love and do not judge you, that can be a lifeline. Sometimes, we need professional help – like therapy, coaching, or energy work. You can learn about different ways to get help and see what suits you best. It will make healing much easier.

42,Want To Be Successful And Fulfilled? Follow This Hierarchy to Success,"Mar 8, 2024",Clate Mask,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/want-success-orient-yourself-with-this-mindset/470395,"
Through decades of working with entrepreneurs — and being one myself — I've learned success is based on a hierarchy of the goals we're trying to reach in business and life. Much like Maslow's hierarchy of needs, this model shows money alone doesn't equal success. But know this: reaching the top doesn't mean you've found complete satisfaction in life and business forever — it's not the ultimate means to business joy.Here's a look at how the hierarchy of success is structured and how you can orient yourself to it in your own business.The hierarchy of successMoney is the foundation of the hierarchy, and for good reason. There's no shame in wanting the financial gains of owning your own company. In fact, the limitless earning potential that comes with entrepreneurship is a serious motivator that can get you through the sacrifice and hard work required to see it through. Be proud of creating a product or service that people pay money for, and make no apologies for it.



At the same time, it's important to recognize that money alone doesn't make you successful. As business owners make more and more money, they often long for more time to enjoy it. So, the next level of the hierarchy is time. After a few years in business, most entrepreneurs know time is their most precious resource. As the company grows and the money is flowing more freely, many start to ""buy back"" their time by delivering on their strengths and delegating the rest.After money and time comes control, then impact and, finally, freedom. In short, ascending the hierarchy of success offers entrepreneurs a chance to live life according to their ambitions and dreams and make a great impact as they serve others. But how do you avoid stalling too long on a single level? Read on for some guidance.


Related: 4 Strategies to Increase Your SuccessGet past your sticking pointAll too often, entrepreneurs get stuck at certain levels of the hierarchy. In the beginning, it's all about survival and money. This is the biggest quicksand trap for owners because they need enough money to keep the lights on.But when you're finally making enough money to buy back your time, will you actually do it? Some entrepreneurs get caught up in the money part. They don't want to give any away, even if it's to hire more people and free up their time because they're enamored with the level of success they're achieving. So they stay stuck.If they happen to move upward and invest in resources that will give them more time, they might get mired in the control layer. You have the time, but are you really in control of the things you do? Are you making the best, most joyful use of your available hours?


The most effective way out of these sticking points is to become dissatisfied. Only when you feel the pain of the status quo will you find the motivation to move onward and upward. For example, maybe you've bought back your time, but you're still getting pulled into areas of the business others should now be handling. You're frustrated and resentful, both of which are great indicators that it's time to truly let go and take control over how you're spending your time. You'll likely stay in that place until you feel those unpleasant emotions for far too long.Check yourself consistentlyTo ensure you're orienting yourself to the hierarchy of success, you have to be fluent in it. In other words, you must have the presence of mind and self-awareness to assess which level you're currently in and what's holding you back from moving forward.To do so, ask yourself the following questions consistently:Where am I on the levels of success?Is being on that level working for me right now? For my relationships?Is it working for my team members? For my customers and partners?How much joy am I feeling?By checking in on these factors often, you can discover where you are, whether you're stuck and how to make progress.Related: 4 Launch Strategies for Startup Success and LongevityPast the pinnacleOne thing I've also realized with the hierarchy of success is that reaching the top doesn't mean you've found complete satisfaction in life and business forever. Many entrepreneurs get to the freedom level and feel hollow. They sell their business and think they have real freedom, but they don't have the same impact they had before. They also don't have the control they used to have because, although they have all the time in the world, they're not doing what they love — running the business.You have to decide what your ultimate goal is. If what you love is the day-to-day of operating the business, then you might never want to sell. Or, you might start a different company and begin the hierarchy over again. Or, you could be a different kind of person who is thrilled with your money and time, and delivers impact another way (e.g. volunteering or charity work).

43,I Attended an Ivy League University's Most Popular MBA Leadership Class and Learned How Steve Jobs Became a Better Leader in 10 Minutes,"Mar 8, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/heres-how-steve-jobs-became-a-better-leader-in-10-minutes/470841,"
Hitendra Wadhwa, professor of practice at Columbia Business School and founder of Mentora Institute, teaches the university's most popular class on personal leadership and success — two topics that most business students are eager to learn more about.That much was clear on the rainy January day when I sat in on the afternoon session of Wadhwa's course; despite the dreary weather, the energy was palpable, with every seat taken and some attendees even standing in the back.Wadhwa wrote the literal book on looking inward to find outward success. In Inner Mastery, Outer Impact: How Your Five Core Energies Hold the Key to Success, Wadhwa reveals how activating purpose, wisdom, growth, love and self-realization can help people make a real mark on the world.

During the session I attended, Wadhwa relayed a compelling story about Steve Jobs that captures those core energies in action — and shows that the best leaders are willing to pivot, even when it's difficult.""Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.""The story starts in 2001, just before Apple was set to open its first retail store. Ron Johnson, the company's senior vice president of retail from 2000 to 2011, was riding to a weekly planning meeting with Jobs when he shared his concerns about the proposed layout of the new store.Like most retail outlets, Apple planned to organize its store by product. But Johnson saw an opportunity to design it according to activity, like making movies or listening to music, and lean into the innovation that had already helped Jobs' brainchild become a category of one.


But Jobs wasn't having it: The store's opening was fast approaching, and he didn't think there was time for a complete overhaul. Johnson and Jobs sat with the tension of that disagreement as they rode the rest of the way to the meeting.Related: As Steve Jobs Once Said, 'People With Passion Can Change The World'Then, about 10 minutes later, the pair walked into the meeting, and Jobs surprised Johnson by telling the team that Johnson believed the store's design was completely misguided — and that he agreed. Jobs said he was going to step aside while they all worked together to figure out the best way forward.By telling the story about Johnson and Jobs, Wadhwa makes an invaluable point: The kind of leader someone is in one moment doesn't have to dictate the kind of leader they'll be in the next. A willingness to change your mind and think outside of the box, even when it means additional challenges in the short term, isn't a weakness — it's a strength.


And, as Jobs himself once said, ""Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.""Related: Is Your Leadership Style More Steve Jobs or Elon Musk? Here's How to Tell — And Why It Matters.

47,"This 'Clairvoyant' Thought Exercise Can Help You Make the Right Choice in Just Seconds, Says Google's Former Chief Decision Scientist","Mar 1, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-make-better-decisions-fast-from-a-former-google-exec/470478,"
We've all been there. It's time to make a decision, and you're stumped. Which choice is the right one? Whether it's a big decision or small, feeling a sense of analysis paralysis isn't uncommon, even among so-called ""experts"" in making tough calls: 57% of newly appointed executives said that decisions were more complicated and difficult than they expected, research from Harvard Business School found.Just like anything else, decision-making is a skill that can be learned and honed for better results — inside and outside of the workplace. But too often, the decision-making process isn't given due attention; instead, it's left up to the highest in a chain of command who doesn't fully understand the implications of a choice, sometimes to the detriment of the whole.""People treat decision-making as something that just happens, and there's also such a hierarchical aspect to it,"" Cassie Kozyrkov, former chief decision scientist at Google and leader in the decision intelligence space, explains. ""When it's so tied in with hierarchy as opposed to skill, you do get a little bit of overlooking the fact that there are skills that you could bring to it.""

""Decision intelligence is [about] turning information into better action at any scale, in any setting.""Kozyrkov, who holds graduate degrees in mathematical statistics, psychology and cognitive neuroscience from Duke University and North Carolina State University, helped train and build data science teams at Google. These days, she's a trusted advisor to business leaders at Fortune 100 companies; an outspoken advocate for the need to ""stand up to AI,"" an issue of negligent human decision-making at scale; and the CEO of Data Scientific, which provides expert advisory and consulting services for AI.""For me, decision intelligence is [about] turning information into better action at any scale, in any setting,"" Kozyrkov says. ""There's the stuff that happens to you that you, by definition, can't do anything about; [you] can't see it coming. And then there's what you do have control over — and that's the quality of your decisions.""Related: Let Go of These 10 Things and Start Making Better, Faster Decisions


In her Decision Intelligence LinkedIn course, Kozyrkov breaks down the science of decision-making. The first part delves into the basics of improving technique — no special tools or resources required. One of them relies on a decision science concept known as the value of clairvoyance, Kozyrkov says. ""This isn't about crystal balls or psychics,"" she adds. ""It's a thought exercise people forget to make, particularly in the data setting.""The exercise goes like this: Imagine that you have access to an all-knowing psychic who could give you all the information you need to make the best decision, then consider how much you'd pay them for those details. ""If you find yourself answering with a small number, that is a strong signal to you that you shouldn't be investing in a whole lot of data, going through a whole lot of process,"" Kozyrkov says. That's when a ""go with your gut"" approach can be more effective than a deep data dive.""If you know these three things, you know a lot about the [AI] system.""With the rapid development and adoption of AI, Kozyrkov is particularly interested in ""the decision-maker behind the curtain."" When the technology isn't used for basic organization or record keeping but instead to automate decision-making at scale, leaders have the potential to ""impose [their] will on a million decisions,"" Kozyrkov says. That's when it's crucial to analyze precisely how data is used and decisions are made.


Kozyrkov has developed a set of questions to help people gain that understanding; she calls them the ""Kozyr criteria."" ""[They're] the decisions that create an AI system,"" she explains. ""If you know these three things, you know a lot about the system. You know a lot about its risks and how it might benefit some people more than others, for example. And you know a lot about what could go wrong with it right off the bat.""The first question to ask is, What is the objective of the system? ""That is very much a subjective question that a decision-maker has to answer,"" Kozyrkov says. ""There's no one true, right answer for it.""Next up, consider the provenance and schema of the data. ""Of course, we would love to go and examine your data set,"" Kozyrkov says, ""but it's not like you're going to show it to us. So tell us please where you got it, how you got it, perhaps how you checked it. Did you have a diverse set of individuals checking it for problems? What do you know about where it came from? How much are you relying on it?""Finally, How do we know that it works? ""What were the criteria, and under what conditions was it tested? If you are told that some food is safe and you find out that it's only ever been eaten by cats, you might worry about whether it's safe for you as a human, but if no one tells you how it was tested and where and under what conditions, you have very little to go on,"" Kozyrkov explains.


Related: These Decision-Making Tactics Can Help You Formalize Your Process and Make Better Choices""It always comes from humans. There's no way to remove the human.""Kozyrkov admits that these criteria are ""deeply subjective"" and dependent on what the decision-makers in question are trying to achieve. However, allowing AI to be ""faceless"" and ignoring the fact that people are sitting in a room and influencing the technology's behavior opens up the potential to harm billions of people.""It always comes from humans,"" Kozyrkov says. ""There's no way to remove the human, but sometimes you just scale up a human so much that it boggles the mind that people can be scaled up that much — [and] we forget that there are humans behind it. [That's why] I would love to have a decision-intelligence-first approach.""

      Key Takeaways    



        In 2006, El Ghatit was working in IT when he got the idea for a sentimental telephone-based business. 
      


        A few months later, he was laid off and decided to focus on growing his side hustle. 
      


        As a side hustle, the venture earned $100,000 per year; now a full-time business, it's on track to see more than $700,000 in 2024.
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Alaa El Ghatit, founder of LifeOnRecord. LifeOnRecord is a service that lets people phone in stories, memories and well wishes for someone celebrating a birthday, retirement, wedding or other special occasion. The recordings are put onto a keepsake speaker or a vinyl album.Image Credit: Courtesy of Alaa El GhatitWhen did you start LifeOnRecord as a side hustle, and what inspired it?



Back in 2006, I was working in an IT department of a large employee benefits consulting firm, managing 60 people, and I wasn't feeling fulfilled at my job. I didn't like being in meetings all day, and I wanted to get more hands-on again and work on something more meaningful, but I couldn't see a viable path to doing that where I was.I had been playing around with a telephone system in my spare time and wondered if I could create a business by having people call in and record their favorite stories and memories about a person as a way to celebrate their birthday, retirement, wedding, etc.


Related: He Started a Side Hustle in His Parents' Basement and Won Big on Richard Branson's TV Show. The Business Saw Over $650 Million in Annual Revenue Last Year.What were some of the first steps you took to get the side hustle off the ground? My mother-in-law's 65th birthday was coming up, and I thought she'd enjoy hearing from all her kids, grandkids, friends, husband, etc.So, as a trial, I set up a phone number that everyone could call and gave her the resulting recordings on a CD (remember — this was 2006). We all listened to it together on her birthday in her living room. She loved it, there were tears, and it sparked a lot of stories (18 years later, she still loves it).


I thought the idea had some traction, so I worked on it in my spare time to make it a service.A few months later, I got laid off, and I decided to take some time to try and grow the business. People started ordering, but not in the volume that allowed me to support my wife and four young kids, so after nine months, I took a job as a director of IT for a mid-size company where I could be hands-on and manage a small team.Were there any challenges that came with running the side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those? Navigating the side hustle of LifeOnRecord presented three significant challenges. First, I got used to the security of a corporate salary with the entrepreneurial aspect of LifeOnRecord. I enjoyed both, which kept me from fully committing to LifeOnRecord. Despite the automation and minimal time LifeOnRecord required, the camaraderie of my corporate role left me hesitant to leave until 2022.


Additionally, keeping LifeOnRecord a secret from colleagues fostered an emotional barrier, making me more reserved and unable to share valuable insights across both my worlds. This secrecy persisted until the pivotal moment I decided to quit my corporate job. Surprisingly, upon revealing LifeOnRecord to the CEO, I found unexpected support rather than resistance. The company facilitated a smooth transition, allowing me to gradually shift my focus to LifeOnRecord, with the CEO even providing guidance along the way.Lastly, an early challenge involved defending LifeOnRecord's intellectual property against infringement from a multi-national corporation. Through perseverance and direct negotiation, which took over a year, I secured an agreement from them without legal intervention, and I licensed my intellectual property to them for a fair but significant licensing fee.Related: Access our best side hustle stories and make more money. Subscribe to Entrepreneur+ now.How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue? On average, how much revenue did it bring in? 


Growth was gradual, but people who used the service talked about it with others and developed into repeat buyers. Before I focused on it full-time, it brought in a little over $100,000 a year as a side hustle. With my corporate salary, it allowed us to live comfortably, fund college for my kids and go on trips.How much annual revenue is LifeOnRecord projected to see this year? For me, it is not really about the money and growth but more about me being able to provide a personal, customer-focused experience that I can be directly involved in. Having said that, last year was the first year it was a full-time venture, and it brought in about $350,000, and this year we will more than double that amount. We're always super responsive to customer questions and requests, and I don't want it to get so big that stellar customer service is no longer a priority.How have you approached scaling the company? What has really been key in helping it grow? 


Right from the start, my strategy was all about leveraging technology to scale and enhance the customer experience. Recognizing that customers wanted more control over their contributions, I developed a ""My Recordings"" portal for them to edit, organize or delete their messages. I streamlined the audio enhancement process by partnering with Dolby Labs for top-notch voice clarity and noise reduction, and I expanded contribution options beyond traditional phone calls to include six alternative methods.[While] balancing this growth with my corporate responsibilities, I was mindful not to expand too quickly, aiming to maintain a healthy equilibrium between my day job and LifeOnRecord. This balance allowed me to enjoy the perks of both my professional career and my entrepreneurial venture without overwhelming myself or the business.A key innovation was introducing vintage rotary phone rentals for wedding receptions for guests to leave messages for the wedding couple. Unlike competitors that simply rent out the phones, we integrated these pieces into our broader service ecosystem. Guests love the charm of leaving messages on these classic devices, which are then enhanced and preserved through our platform.Related: This Fun, Flexible Side Hustle Pays $35 an Hour and Gets You Into Exclusive CEO Summits, Music Festivals, and Sports EventsAs you look back over your journey with LifeOnRecord, is there anything you wish you would have done differently? There's a lingering thought that maybe I should have stepped away from the corporate world sooner to fully embrace the entrepreneurial path with LifeOnRecord. The allure of stability and a predictable income often held me back, anchoring me to a role that, while comfortable, perhaps limited the potential growth of my passion project. Yet, with every decision comes a silver lining.Staying in my corporate job perhaps longer than I should have afforded me invaluable lessons and experiences. It was in this professional setting that I honed skills that later became crucial in navigating the entrepreneurial landscape: the discipline of managing projects, the art of negotiation and the ability to lead a team.This period also served as a vital incubation phase for LifeOnRecord. It allowed me to slowly but surely build the foundation of the business, testing ideas and refining the model without the immediate pressure of having it be my sole source of income. In a way, it granted me the freedom to experiment and innovate with less risk, laying the groundwork for what LifeOnRecord would eventually become.


What are you most excited about when it comes to LifeOnRecord's future? Customers have used LifeOnRecord in innovative ways. People have used LifeOnRecord to send out audio thank yous, and brides have recorded their feelings of ""saying yes to the dress"" using LifeOnRecord, then played that recording as they walk down the aisle. I think there are many more ways to market LifeOnRecord that we can explore in the future.What's your favorite part about running your own business today? I love the impact the business has on customers. When I had a corporate job, I felt like a cog in a wheel, but with LifeOnRecord, I created a way for people to make a connection with others. I'm especially grateful when people buy it and record messages for someone with a terminal illness. They say it's one of the few things they can do to show how loved the person is.Beyond that, I like the lifestyle flexibility and not needing to be accountable to anyone other than our customers. I love being identified with it and the excitement that other people have when I share what I do.

52,SMART Goals May Be Holding You Back — Try This Effective Goal-Setting Technique Instead,"Feb 21, 2024",Sabrina Chevannes,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/smart-goals-may-be-holding-you-back-try-this-method/469569,"
Everyone can set goals, right? Just think about what you want to achieve, give yourself a timeframe, and make that your goal. What's so difficult about it?!Well, let's look at the stats for a moment. I'm writing this article in February, and according to the research, only 36% will have made it this far with their New Year's resolutions. Twenty-three percent will have given up in the first week!And those who actually keep their New Year's resolutions? Just 9%. So, do you think these people are actually good at setting goals?Related: 5 Goal-Setting Guidelines That Drive SuccessWhat is wrong with traditional goal setting?If you were to Google how to set goals, it will most likely tell you to create SMART goals.For those who don't know, SMART means:S – SpecificM – MeasurableA – AchievableR – RelevantT – Time-boundWhile this is a great framework to start with, it has some limitations.First of all, the T (time-bound) is the one I have the biggest issue with. It's definitely necessary to set deadlines sometimes so that you stay on track and keep momentum. However, this added pressure can cause some people to cut corners or slack on the quality. Therefore, things are not done properly and the goal is not really achieved.



The problem is that this deadline is often arbitrary. Where did you come up with this date from? Is it actually relevant?This is the same with A (achievable). What counts as achievable? And if you set your bar too low, you're not really pushing yourself, so then what's the point?The problem with a lot of goal setting is that you're not basing your goals on the right things.Find your WHYThe reason why many people fail in their goals is because they haven't chosen them for the right reasons. Usually, they've based it on something they've seen on social media or something their friends are talking about.


As an entrepreneur, you take a look at what other business owners are doing in your industry, and you can't help but think that you need to be doing something similar. Your biggest competitor has announced that they're writing a book — you MUST write one too! Let's add that to your goals. It MUST be done this year too.But for some reason, you just cannot motivate yourself to get the writing done. You prioritize everything else ahead of it. This is because the motivation for this goal is not intrinsic.If you've not yet seen Dan Pink's TED talk on motivation, then now is probably a good time to do so!Your motivation to achieve your goal has to come from within — it's your passion, your true desire. If you're extrinsically motivated by money, fame or social validation, this will be very short-lived motivation.


Simon Sinek has always told us to ""start with why,"" and this also applies here. Understand why you want to achieve this goal, and why now? If you get to the root of what's driving you, you can tap into that and make sure it's for the right reasons. You are more likely to achieve your goals if you are motivated by the right things.Related: The Art of Setting the Right Goals and Achieving ThemThe right way to set goalsWhen speaking to successful entrepreneurs who regularly achieve their goals, it's clear that they don't just pick lofty things that they want to achieve and try to achieve them. Instead, they see their goals as an identity change and change their habits and lifestyles to match those of someone who would smash those goals.For example, if you want to lose weight, instead of telling yourself that you're on a diet and cannot eat certain things or that you must go to the gym, you tell yourself that you're already a healthy person.


Healthy people don't eat lots of cake. Healthy people regularly go to the gym, even if for a short while. Healthy people don't drink lots of alcohol.If you ""become"" a healthy person, you create healthier habits that essentially change who you are as a person. The goal of losing weight will be a natural by-product of the behavioral change.My goal-setting systemSince acronyms seem to go down well, I created my own acronym for setting goals that work on creating a more lasting effect. My goal-setting technique is called SHAPING:Start small:


Don't try to do too much at once. If you want to write a book, don't say you're going to write for two hours per day. Start with 100 words per day and build it up.Habit formation:Following on from starting small, you need to create habits to help you achieve your goals. So, those 100 words a day will be written every single day. Show up on days even when you don't feel like it. This is how habits form.Accountability:


Tell someone your goals. By creating accountability for yourself, you're more likely to achieve them. Use this accountability partner to also help encourage you to stick to your habits.Personalize:Don't copy trends of what others are doing. Just because it works for them does not mean it will work for you. Personalize your methods to suit your lifestyle.Intrinsic motivation:


Find out what really fuels you. If you understand your true ""why"" — what comes from within — then you can pick goals accordingly and you will be motivated by the right things.No:Learning to say this simple word can be extremely difficult, but it's the most powerful thing you can do. Say NO to anything that doesn't help you achieve your goal.Gamification:


Adding a bit of competitive edge to your goal setting can help wonders. Track calories, expenses, or keep a habit tracker. Give yourself rewards at milestones. If you can see the progress, it will keep you going!Try SHAPING your goals instead of making them SMART, and see if it makes a difference to your results.Related: The 10 Things You Must Do to Achieve Your Goals

53,How Taking Up Boxing Transformed My Outlook on Entrepreneurship,"Feb 20, 2024",Sam Saideman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/3-lessons-i-learned-about-entrepreneurship-from-boxing/469096,"
If you pursue anything hard in life, you've likely dealt with sacrifice, whether that's a sacrifice of personal health, mental health, relationships, time or finances. Likely while chasing that goal, one or more of those things have suffered. When asked what surprised him most about humanity, the Dalai Lama said, ""Man. Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health."" He goes on to get far more philosophical and far more depressing, but the above quote is a great testament to the power of chasing dreams without being mindful of what you need to not just survive, but thrive.Now, that's not to say making sacrifices in pursuit of goals isn't a good thing — it's usually necessary. But being intentional about what you're giving up for what you're trying to get is how one lives a life without regrets. This is something that has remained relevant in my daily work to become a better leader, and while I've grown over the years of running businesses and learned along the way, nothing has made me grow and learn more than getting in the ring.A little over a year ago, I was reconnecting with an old friend from college, and he mentioned his new fascination with boxing. I had been around it as a teenager with friends pursuing it, but it had never been something I actively took part in. He convinced me to go with him and retry it in my adulthood. New Year's resolution and all, I went, and the rest was history. That one day in Nashville's Fighters Boxing Gym hitting heavy bags sparked an obsession which has resulted in boxing becoming a large line item on my expenses, more than half my laundry and most of my personality.



Here are the three most important lessons I've learned so far from the squared circle.Related: Knockout Personal Branding Strategies From Mayweather and Pacquiao


1. Resiliency is mandatory for successWorking in a startup environment where every deal matters and sparring in boxing are more alike than you think. For one: You have to have thick skin. No matter how much we try to ""cut off the ring"" with better services and have the client ""on the ropes"" with making a purchase decision, sometimes the potential client changes their direction and hires someone else. Those punches, while they may not hurt as much if you focus on each individual hit, but over several rounds, they start to add up. Learning to keep fighting and not accept defeat is how you force the fight to a decision without getting KO'd. In other words, if you're not resilient and you didn't stumble on hidden treasure, you likely won't last long in business.As an entrepreneur of a startup that never took on investment, my back has been against the ropes more times than I can count. This key lesson of staying resilient and not taking ""no"" for an answer has allowed me to stay determined and motivate my team to develop new verticals without having to close shop or lay people off. I attribute my ability to pivot my company to offering influencer marketing campaigns to brands and musicians/labels in a large way to boxing. Staying adaptable and being unwilling to throw in the towel. Boxing took me there.2. Focused time spent learningFocusing on learning is necessary for all great battles. There are no cutting corners on this one. If you don't put the hours in, you won't prevail. That goes for the time in the ring or in the boardroom. You need to work on the basics of being a good leader as much as you need to work on the fundamentals in the gym. Muhammad Ali said, ""The fight is won or lost far away from witnesses — behind the lines, in the gym and out there on the road, long before I dance under those lights."" Muhammad Ali would've been great in any profession. If you don't carve out uninterrupted time to improve, you won't improve.In my years as an entrepreneur, I've struggled to find uninterrupted time for growth. Digging into redlines, a client calls me. Working on a proposal, an employee asks me a question. Learning the importance of unavoidable ""offline"" time has made me more demanding of that in the workplace. I am now able to whiteboard, learn about new lanes or do whatever else I need to without compromising or being half distracted. If you're distracted while boxing, you'll feel it (literally). If you're distracted at work, you'll feel it differently — but both are equally detrimental to winning.


Related: 7 Lessons From the Boxing Ring3. Your corner can make or break youA boxer is usually only as good as his corner. To be truly great, you need a great trainer and cut man, just like an entrepreneur needs great leaders within their business and advisors outside of their business. The people you surround yourself with in either realm must be people who can be supportive and are also not afraid to speak their minds when things need improving. I'm far deeper into my entrepreneurial journey than my boxing journey; however, the coaches I've spent my time learning from, hitting mitts with, and sparring at The Punch Club in Los Angeles and Fighters in Nashville, have been the same type of people I try to surround myself with in business. Don't be afraid to make changes if those people aren't the right fit.It's easy in the workplace to be okay with keeping things the way they are. Justifying actions that shouldn't be justified because of busyness. Boxing has taught me that every voice in the room can make or break winning or losing. It's helped me to be more proactive with making changes when things aren't working.So the next time you're exhausted, worried about staying on your feet and the bell rings — or the Google Calendar alarm dings — be ready to fight with everything you've got left. I know I will be.

Americans over 70 hold 30% of the country's wealth, per Bloomberg — but younger generations are also building fortunes of their own.The total wealth of Americans under 40 increased by 80% to $9.5 trillion between the first quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2023, according to a study by the New York Federal Reserve reported by CNBC.Related: This Indulgent Retirement Trend Is Popular Among Young Professionals — But Financial Planners Are Providing a Dose of Reality



And the most significant driver? That would be the stock market.

It might be the traditional model, but these days, it doesn't work for everyone — for several reasons.More than half (56%) of American workers believe they're behind on their retirement savings, according to a recent Bankrate survey.

      Key Takeaways    



        Omosowon learned about the lucrative TV-mounting side hustle through a friend. 
      


        Within six months, he was seeing consistent monthly revenue, then opted to take the business full-time. 
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Sina Omosowon, founder of the TV-mounting business Shine.Image Credit: Courtesy of Shine. Sina Omosowon. When did you start your side hustle, and what inspired it?



I started my TV-mounting business, Shine, in 2019. I originally started the business as a side hustle to help put myself through school and support my family. At the time, I was earning my Ph.D. in plant evolution, focusing on food crop production and crop improvement. A friend of mine introduced me to TV mounting and showed me there was a growing demand in this space, particularly as more people chose to mount TVs on their walls versus using a stand to help create more space in their homes. I saw an opportunity to make extra money through TV mounting, so I got trained on the basics and started to build out a business from there. My business ultimately helped me pay for school and finish my Ph.D. with no debt.Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a MonthWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?After being introduced to TV mounting, I got trained on the basics and shadowed a friend on a few of his jobs. From there, I tried to consume as much information as I could to learn and grow a base of knowledge, watching a lot of YouTube videos and asking questions. As I continued to complete more and more jobs, my confidence grew.When I first started out, it was important to grow awareness of my business and build trust with customers. Without reviews or much experience, I often got customers by giving discounts on jobs. I also learned the importance of being responsive and getting back to customers quickly. I always had my phone on me so that when a request came in, I was able to quickly answer any questions and schedule an appointment.In addition to word-of-mouth, I registered as a pro on Thumbtack, which helped me find customers in my area who needed my services. It was a great place to build out a profile with reviews and photos from completed jobs so potential customers could learn more about me and my business. As I completed more jobs and built up a bank of positive reviews, it became easier to get more clients. Especially as a young entrepreneur, positive reviews help people trust you and give them confidence that you'll do a good job. I now have nearly 1,000 five-star reviews.


I started out doing around two to three jobs a day, and these jobs took more time as I learned different nuances and built up my confidence. Steadily, I started getting more and more customers and became even more efficient at TV mounting, which allowed me to serve more people in a day. Today I can mount a TV in 15 minutes.Related: The 'Easy' Side Hustle He Started in College Hit More Than $1 Million in Revenue — and Taught Him 3 Business Lessons He Still Uses TodayWere there any challenges that came with running your side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those?One of my biggest challenges initially was having to spend money upfront to get my business off the ground, whether that's purchasing all the tools or giving customers discounts on jobs to build up a client roster. This initial investment was important, particularly because it's crucial to have the right equipment for jobs requiring construction. Luckily, I was able to recoup the money I spent upfront after a few months of work.


How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue? I started seeing consistent monthly revenue about six months after I started. After getting my Ph.D., I received job offers in the plant science space, but my business was also taking off, so I had to weigh my options. It's always been my dream to be my own boss, so I decided to invest in my TV mounting business and take the entrepreneurial path.How much average monthly revenue do you earn now? I earn about $30,000 per month through my TV-mounting business.You've since turned your side hustle into a full-time business. What do you enjoy most about it?Owning my own business lets me control how I spend my time. I can schedule jobs around family commitments and decide when to work and when not to work. I also really enjoy interacting with people on a daily basis and putting a smile on their faces with a job well done. There's a lot of satisfaction in owning your own business.Related: 3 Secrets to Starting a High-Income Side Hustle in 2024, According to People Whose Gigs Make More Than $20,000 a MonthDo you have any advice for others interested in this gig? What should they know before they get started?


My biggest piece of advice for anyone interested in being an entrepreneur is to make customer satisfaction a priority. When you're just starting out, money should not be the priority. It's more important to satisfy the customer, get good reviews and build up a strong client base who can refer you to friends and family. With consistency and steadfastness, the money will come. Prioritize customer satisfaction, and everything will fall into place.

      Key Takeaways    



        A Georgia-based millennial is earning over $250,000 a year secretly working two remote jobs.
      


        He said his childhood made him want financial security and that overemployment provides him job security.
      


        The IT professional shared his four pieces of advice for overemployed workers.
      



















Oliver Eltinger / Getty Images via Business Insider
A Georgia millennial says a desire for financial security motivated him to work multiple jobs in secret. Worker in the story not pictured.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Tomas, a Georgia-based IT worker in his 30s, said his journey to an ""overemployed"" lifestyle began at a very young age.He grew up ""very poor,"" he told Business Insider, and after his mother left his father, he, his mother, and four siblings shared a one-room apartment for two years.



""As I got older I was like, 'I don't want to live like that,"" he said.In 2016, when Tomas had roughly $40,000 in credit card debt and was struggling to pay child support, he decided to look for a second remote job he could work on the sly. Two years later, job juggling had helped him pay off his debt, but he wasn't ready to give it up.


""I kind of felt invincible, and it made me feel like that will be one less thing I have to worry about in life,"" said Tomas, whose identity is known to BI but has been withheld due to his fear of professional repercussions.To this day, Tomas is secretly working two full-time remote jobs that pay over $250,000 a year in combined salaries, according to documents viewed by BI. Doing so has helped him grow his net worth to over $500,000, pay off two new cars, travel more, and find ""financial stability and freedom,"" he said. Tomas added that he'd love to have a third job if he can find the right fit.Tomas is among a small group of U.S. workers — many in the tech and IT industries — secretly holding multiple remote jobs. Working more than one job at once may not violate federal or state laws, but it could breach some employment contracts and be a fireable offense if a worker is ever found out.As layoffs have spread across the tech industry, Tomas said the extra job security that comes with overemployment has become even more important. He's even encouraged some colleagues to look for second jobs and provided advice on pulling it off.


""Companies will terminate you or lay you off without any notice at all,"" he said. ""I now have the belief that everyone should always keep two jobs.""Finding the right job for over-employment isn't easyTomas has had several different stints as an overemployed worker.Roughly a year after he began his overemployment, he decided to take a break. He said one of his jobs became much more demanding and that he wanted to adjust to the workload before he took on a second job again.Additionally, throughout this career, Tomas has worked a mix of full-time and contract jobs, and the latter have typically had an expiration date.


As pandemic fears have eased in recent years, Tomas said he's also worked for companies that required employees to return to the office. Given working remotely was key to his overemployment, he decided to part ways with those employers.These job separations are the main reason Tomas has had roughly seven different jobs since 2017. While he's generally had no more than two jobs at once, he said there were three to four months when he had three jobs — and one month when he had four. All but one of his jobs were remote — he said flexible working hours enabled him to juggle a hybrid and remote role for a while.At his peak, Tomas said he earned close to $400,000 across his jobs in a single year.Four pieces of advice for over-employed workersTomas has four suggestions for people interested in the over-employed lifestyle.


First: Know your job well so you can complete tasks quickly and dedicate time to your other jobs. Second: Figure out which job has more flexibility so you can reschedule those meetings if need be. Third: To appear constantly online for a job, don't rely on mouse jigglers — he said he thinks some IT departments can figure out when workers are using the latter. Fourth: If you think your boss is suspicious of you, it's probably time to leave that job.Tomas said job juggling has been fairly easy in his two current roles. Both jobs have flexible hours, and his shifts start at different times of the day — with only three hours of overlap between them. He said he's only had one or two overlapping meetings that have required him to come up with an excuse for missing one of them.But during a prior overemployment stint, Tomas said he had a boss who seemed to suspect he was job juggling — asking questions like why he was online well past working hours. When these questions didn't go away, Tomas decided to leave the job.Unless he finds one job that pays him over $250,000 a year, roughly his current combined salaries, Tomas said he has no plans to give up his overemployment.""I'm going to keep going as long as I can,"" he said, adding, ""The rewards definitely outweigh the labor.""

62,"3 Hacks That Can Help You Get High-Quality Matches on Dating Apps, According to the Lead Engineer Behind a Very Exclusive One","Feb 9, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/the-league-founders-3-hacks-for-better-dating-app-matches/469490,"
Amanda Bradford, founder, CEO and lead engineer of selective dating app and social networking community The League, was straight out of a five-and-half-year relationship when she realized she ""had never actually dated in the wild."" At the time, swiping in search of love was increasingly en vogue, so Bradford decided to give it a shot herself — and discovered that many of the apps lacked features that were important to her.""I remember writing a support ticket to one of the dating apps, being like, 'You should really integrate with the LinkedIn profile,' and as I'm writing this, I'm like, 'Maybe I should look up who runs these apps,'"" Bradford tells Entrepreneur. ""Then I found that many of them were run by people with even less technical background than me.""Image Credit: Courtesy of The League. Amanda Bradford. 



So in 2014, at 29, Bradford opted to build and launch a dating app of her own: The League, which aims to unite users looking for love who have ""ambition and a drive to succeed."" Where other dating apps permitted people to reveal as little information about themselves as they chose, Bradford's would make certain details, like education and career, compulsory to help its ""vetted community"" find long-term partners without wasting time.Related: I Used a Dating App to Meet Millionaires. I Got to Travel the World, Get Fancy Gifts, and Learn A Lot from My Relationships.


The League also presented its users with just three matches a day to reduce the ""transactional"" nature associated with many other apps, particularly those that are swipe-based. Bradford's app sold to Match Group for $29.9 million in 2022. Today, it also offers monetized features, including the option to pay to see all of your matches at once, starting at $99.99 per week. It might be a nice-to-have perk, but it's not necessary for users to get high-quality matches, Bradford says — because you can ""trust the algorithm.""What does that mean, exactly?As much as dating app users have control over their profiles and the parameters they set for potential matches, at the end of the day, it's the invisible algorithm behind every app that determines which people will be shown to each other. And many popular apps aren't forthcoming about how that happens. A spokesperson for Bumble told The Verge that its algorithm learns from user histories to produce matches; the former design and product vice president of Hinge informed the outlet that it uses a variation of the Gale-Shapley algorithm to pair compatible users.""One of the things I didn't like about the other apps is that...they would just give you everyone that fit your preference.""Fortunately, Bradford, who's continued to serve as The League's lead engineer since its sale to Match Group, was willing to shed more light on what goes on behind the scenes and share how users can better position themselves for success — in terms of high-quality matches that just might lead to great first dates and long-term partnerships.It's important to note that, unlike a number of other apps, The League relies on ""double preference matching,"" where a user only sees a profile if their preferences match the other user's and vice versa. It might seem like a no-brainer, but research suggests that men are more likely than women to be using dating apps, and the uneven gender ratio might cause some algorithms to be less discerning.""One of the things I didn't like about the other apps is that partially because they're giving you so many people, and they just need to be able to give you more profiles, they would just give you everyone that fits your preference,"" Bradford says. ""So let's say I only wanted to see men 35 to 40. That doesn't mean they're not showing me to men 18 to 60.""Related: From Machine Learning to Unfiltered Videos, These Online Dating Trends Are Set to Improve the Tricky World of Dating


Double preference matching ""narrows down the pool significantly,"" Bradford admits, but she stresses that they're called ""preferences"" and not just ""filters"" because they're precisely that: a user's desires. The League isn't ""inventing"" people, so if there aren't enough profiles that meet all of someone's preferences within a given radius, things ""get a little more complicated"" — and the algorithm has to prioritize the user's desires.Nowadays, users can choose which preference is most important to them in the app, Bradford says, but naturally, there's still a lot more that goes into pairing people up.""In general, women are just more picky than men. So I guess it is easier for a woman to get scored higher than a man on average.""One of the most significant factors is the ""like rate,"" or overall ""desirability,"" of a profile. ""So if three people see me and only one likes me, then I'm [at] a 33% like rate at that point,"" Bradford explains. ""And so if there's another person that three out of three like them, that's a 100% like rate. So that person will probably be shown more than the person who isn't liked as much because we'll get more matches.""


The idea is to ""put people close to people that are performing at the same level,"" grouping them into so-called ""cohorts"" or ""quintiles,"" Bradford adds — though that doesn't necessarily mean physical attractiveness. More than anything, the overall quality of a user's profile is key.So that's the first hack for people searching for better results: Make your profile the best it can be. You should have high-quality photos with a mix of close-up and full-body shots and fill out all fields completely.Related: Your Next Career Connection Might Come From a Dating App""In general, women are just more picky than men,"" Bradford notes. ""So I guess it is easier for a woman to get scored higher than a man on average. I also believe that this is because men do put less time into their profiles or maybe are not as good at marketing themselves. There's never a man that's a 100% acceptance rate, whereas there are women that might move up into that range."" That's why the algorithm also normalizes for gender.


Additionally, the app rewards users who send the first message, always respond and are active every day.""If you're a little bit more open-minded, open to men that maybe are a little bit shorter, those people actually will help your score.""Although the app does its best to take into account a user's ""explicit preferences"" — or what they say they want in a match — it's also capturing ""shadow preferences"" — or the way someone actually behaves when presented with a profile that doesn't check all the boxes. For instance, a user might say they want someone within a one-mile radius, then proceed to like profiles for people 15 to 20 miles away.That leads to Bradford's second major tip for people hoping for high-quality matches: Keep an open mind and consider how restrictive your settings are. She uses the example of a theoretical woman who opts only to see men ages 35 to 37 who are at least 6'2"" and live in New York City's West Village.


""So you're basically saying, I only want a very competitive and very small cross-section of these men to see me,"" Bradford explains. ""You're asking yourself to be scored or ranked by a high-caliber group, a high-demand group. So you're actually kind of doing yourself a disservice because if you're a little bit more open-minded, open to men who maybe are a little bit shorter, those people actually will help your score because they might be more open to your profile.""Related: This Matchmaker Won't Apologize for Her $50,000 Minimum — Here's the Secret Weapon She Uses to Play CupidAnd if users relax their settings and see someone they're on the fence about, Bradford encourages them to give them a ""like."" Because although The League's mantra is ""never settle,"" taking that chance can pay off in a couple of ways. Not only could that match ""sweep you off your feet with a really charming first date invitation,"" Bradford says, but it will also boost your own profile.""People would rather have that [person] meet all their other preferences and be in another city than not meet their preferences but be next door.""And a final secret to success? Consider broadening your settings to include people in other cities — it's an increasingly popular move.""We are seeing more openness to distance, which used to be one that people would be like, 'Oh hard no, they're in a different city,'"" Bradford says. ""Now we're seeing that's not as big of a deal. People would rather have that [person] meet all their other preferences and be in another city than not meet their preferences but be next door to them.""According to Bradford, if you're open to multiple cities, ""you can pretty much double your matches"" — upping your chances of finding The One for this Valentine's Day and beyond.

64,This Former Statistics Professor Has Made Over $1 Million 'Investing' in Sports. These Are the 2 Tactics He's Using to Bet on the Super Bowl.,"Feb 7, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/2-tactics-a-retired-professor-uses-to-bet-on-the-super-bowl/469357,"
Former statistics professor David Beaudoin has always had a knack for numbers, and as a sports fan since age five, it wasn't long before he opted to merge the two interests: He placed his first sports bets as a teenager, though he admits ""he was not very good at it.""That changed when Beaudoin started to take mathematics classes at the university level and realized he could use what he'd learned to make a profit on sports. In 1999, Beaudoin found it ""quite easy"" to apply some of those strategies to arbitrage betting, which involves placing wagers on different sides of the same sporting event ""to guarantee a profit regardless of the outcome.""""If Team A plays Team B [and] the lines are very different between a couple of sportsbooks on that game, it is possible to bet Team A with sportsbook No.1, and you could bet Team B with sportsbook No. 2, and of course, you're going to win one bet and lose another, but by adjusting the amount, you are guaranteed to make a net profit at the end,"" Beaudoin explains.



Related: As the Sports-Betting Industry Transforms, Entrepreneurs May Find It Hard to Get in on Gambling Profits — but Related Businesses Will ThriveAfter several years of success with that tactic, it became ""more and more difficult to find good arbitrage opportunities,"" Beaudoin says. That's when he began using mathematical models to help him beat sportsbooks. It turned out to be a highly lucrative pivot; Beaudoin retired at age 43 from his 14-year run teaching statistics at Laval University — and says he has earned more than $1 million sports betting to date.


""The right mindset is very important. You really need to be disciplined with your bets.""Although Beaudoin ""would bet on any sport"" during his arbitrage stint, these days, he prefers to focus on sports he knows well, including the NFL, NHL, NBA, WNBA, MLB, college football and college basketball, because ""only using numbers without knowing the players or coaches [is] not going to be enough to be a winner.""Beaudoin is transparent about his track record on his website — over seven NFL seasons, he says his pick accuracy has never dropped below 50%, ranging from 50% to 75% each season — and acknowledges the fact that the level of success he's seen isn't accessible to everyone. Still, there are a couple of things that anyone can do to better position themselves and mitigate harmful outcomes.Related: The Moment This Online Sports Betting CEO Knew It Was Time to Take a Big RiskFirst, ""the right mindset is very important,"" Beaudoin says.""Some people just can't tolerate losing,"" he explains. ""Now, even if you make money every year, sometimes there will be a week, or sometimes maybe a full month, where you're going to keep losing. And that's inevitable. It's going to happen to everyone. But some people just go crazy when that happens and they start betting big amounts, trying to make up for prior losses. So you really need to be disciplined with your bets.""""You need to bet money that you view it as disposable income.""Second, Beaudoin cautions people against betting money they can't afford to lose.


""I never want to hear people saying, 'I just lost my rent money,'"" Beaudoin says. ""That makes zero sense to me. You need to bet money that you view it as disposable income — if you lose it, it's not going to affect the quality of your life.""In fact, Beaudoin doesn't consider himself a sports ""gambler"" or ""better"" at all. Rather, he calls himself a sports ""investor"" who doesn't feel the need to make bets every day. ""I only like betting when I have the strong conviction that I have an edge over sportsbooks or over casinos,"" he notes.Related: The NFL Will Not Allow Players to Place Bets During Super Bowl LVII Weekend in Las VegasAnd his pick for this year's Super Bowl champion? He's ""leaning towards the Chiefs."" ""I know the 49ers have maybe more firepower around Brock Purdy,"" Beaudoin says, ""but Purdy is inexperienced. He's been up and down in the playoffs, whereas [Patrick] Mahomes, he's been there, done that.""


But it's the ""hundreds and hundreds of"" proposition bets, where people put money on specific events — like if Mahomes will throw an interception — that have the greatest earning potential. And ""there is no way that sportsbooks can have accurate lines on each,"" Beaudoin says.""So there are always some great bargains,"" Beaudoin explains. ""Every year, I spend between 50 and 100 hours analyzing those Super Bowl prop bets, and to me, this is like Christmas. This is the most lucrative day of the year.""Since the Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in 2018, nearly 40 U.S. states have passed legislation to legalize sports betting. The five states that currently have no legislation to legalize sports betting are California, Alaska, Alabama, Utah and Idaho.If you or someone you know is struggling with problem gambling, call the National Problem Gambling Helpline at 1-800-GAMBLER (426-2537).

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Julie Berninger, Etsy shop owner and co-founder of Gold City Ventures with Cody Berman. What was your 9-5 job and/or primary source of income when you started your Etsy shop?I worked as a project manager for large tech companies. I have my masters in computer information systems and planned to work in the tech field forever.When did you start your Etsy side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?I listened to personal finance podcasts on my lunch break and commute to and from work. I was inspired by people who started Etsy and Amazon shops as side hustles. I was also inspired by the ""financial independence, early retirement"" (FIRE) movement, where people traded in office jobs for jobs with more lifestyle freedom. I loved my job, but I also loved to travel and wanted a bit more flexibility with how and where I worked.



Related: His Side Hustle Solved a Common Problem for Homeowners. Now the Business Brings in $3 Million a Month During Peak Season.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I picked a niche on Etsy that I knew very well: the bachelorette party niche because I was going to a bunch of bachelorette parties. I noticed how people were willing to pay for throwaway items for those events, and order quantities were high because so many people attended the event (usually groups of 15-20 women, with one person making the large purchase for the group). It seemed like a great niche for my shop. I started with temporary tattoos because I knew they would be easy to store in my tiny apartment in Silicon Valley. I didn't have room to sell larger pieces. I didn't have a budget for photography, but I put the tattoos on, went for neighborhood walks and took pictures in front of my neighbors' beautiful rose bushes. There are some gorgeously landscaped lawns in Silicon Valley!What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?


I was averaging around $15-$20 per order with the temporary tattoos, but I was stressed for time. I was squeezing in trips to the post office before and after work. I was also podcasting and interviewing eight guests per week about how they achieved financial independence. I met someone at a conference who sold printables on Etsy, and I was hooked. I switched my product line to selling bachelorette party scavenger hunts and was convinced digital products were the way to go going forward because they required less time. There is very little to no work done after the sale.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill. It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue, and at what point did the side hustle's income surpass that of your full-time job (if it did)?I made around $10,000 per year selling digital products as a side hustle on Etsy. My plan wasn't to leave my day job, though, since I loved working in tech. I didn't have a plan or the space in my life for selling on Etsy to become a full-time thing. Full-time entrepreneurship happened slowly over time. I was also a well-paid tech employee with a master's degree, so it felt very scary to take a leap — and it would have taken a while to replace my income. But I did make six figures total over a few years between Etsy and blogging about my personal finance journey. I eventually left my full-time job in 2021; by then, the money from my ventures replaced my full-time job.


When and how did that side hustle lead to Gold City Ventures? How does Gold City Ventures help aspiring side hustlers?The episodes on my podcast about my side hustles were always the favorite episodes with listeners. I recorded how I created and sold digital products on Etsy in YouTube videos first.I had my first kid in 2019, and I launched Gold City Ventures, my online course business, soon after with a business partner using those videos as the main curriculum. We've improved our curriculum over the years and now have the step-by-step course to start an Etsy shop for digital products.Over 15,000 students have bought the course, and some have achieved some amazing results. We've had students who make this their full-time job and have earned over $70,000 in one year on Etsy. It's been a lot of fun to help people start small businesses.


What I love about Etsy is that it brings the customers (90 million per year) to you, and digital products are a low-risk small business since it doesn't cost much to start, and you don't have to buy inventory; you are just spending your time. It's also good if someone only has a few hours extra per week and just wants a side hustle.Related: This Former Teacher Started a Side Hustle That Made More Than $22,000 in One Month: 'I Have Never Been More Fulfilled'How much average monthly revenue does Gold City Ventures bring in now?Gold City Ventures makes over $100,000 per month, and we've expanded to offer many additional services such as live coaching, a community and done-for-you templates.


What's your best advice for other side hustlers who hope to find success selling online?Don't start a business by yourself! Pick a business partner and scale faster! Also, don't waste time trying to piece information together on YouTube. Pay for a step-by-step program or a business consultant because your time is valuable.

66,A Japanese Wellness Technique Could Be the CEO's Secret to Health and Productivity,"Jan 31, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/the-science-behind-forest-bathings-productivity-benefits/466427,"
In Walden, Henry David Thoreau observed that ""We can never have enough of nature,"" and one of the things I love about working at Jotform's San Francisco headquarters is how accessible nature is. I can take a quick bike ride to a handful of beaches, as well as a pier crowded with sea lions. If I feel like hiking, tall peaks beckon in just about every direction. If I drive about a half-hour north, I can reach Muir Woods National Park, which is more than 550 acres of dense forest. That last spot, in particular, is perfect for what's termed ""forest bathing,"" which, along with morning sweat sessions and power napping, helps me play a longer, happier, more productive and healthier game as an entrepreneur.First term-conceptualized in Japan in the 1980s, forest bathing (shinrin-yoku) was the product of a government campaign to encourage people to find respite from then-rampant tech-boom burnout by taking advantage of the country's extensive protected forests. The idea was, and is, to immerse oneself in the woods and absorb its surroundings using all five senses — to see the trees and take in their colossal magnitude, as well as smell the leaves, listen to the natural sounds, feel the fresh air and taste foraged goods (with an appropriate eye on safety).Related: 7 Reasons the CEO Should Get Outside to Exercise

Sabeena Ladha, founder and CEO of the ""good-for-you"" snack brand DEUX, has a ""pretty deep relationship with junk food."" That's ""kind of a funny thing to say,"" she admits, but her childhood in the small town of Euless, Texas, where her father ran a gas station and convenience store, kicked off the passion for snacks that would help shape her professional endeavors.""My parents worked 24/7,"" Ladha recalls. ""They're immigrants, so they had that hard work ethic built in them. So he was working 12-, 14-hour days, six, seven days a week, and on the weekends, my sisters and I would go to the gas station, and we would get to pick a snack. I always picked one salty and one sweet snack."" They weren't necessarily the most healthful choices, but at the time, those products weren't quite as ""villainized"" as they are today, she says.Image Credit: Courtesy of DEUX. Sabeena Ladha. 



Although Ladha ""looked healthy"" as a high school athlete who played basketball and ran track, she quips that her ""insides were made of partially hydrogenated oil and trans fats."" It wasn't until college that she dove into health and wellness, even starting a blog ""before it was cool"" to unpack juice cleanses and cryotherapy.Related: After Being Diagnosed With Cancer, She Created a Cookie That Would Help Her Eat Cleanly and Satisfy Her Sweet Tooth. Now, Her Products Are Sold in 25,000 Stores.


""Not everyone wants to eat a salad for every meal of the day, so how do you help people make slightly better decisions?""""[I was] trying to make the scary world of wellness a little bit more approachable for Sabeena in Texas,"" Ladha explains. ""Not everyone lives in Los Angeles and has access to 18 farmers markets on a Saturday. That's just not realistic. And not everyone wants to eat a salad for every meal of the day, so how do you help people make slightly better decisions?""Answering that question ultimately led Ladha to the ""healthy indulgences"" concept of DEUX. The hot-pink brand offers cookie doughs, dessert spreads and donut holes that are vegan, gluten- and preservative-free and contain ""functional ingredients"" like vitamin B12 to support sustained energy and L-Theanine to help with cognitive function and mental focus.Image Credit: Courtesy of DEUX


Ladha was ready to ""break the rules"" and innovate in the snack space, but she credits much of her success with the fact that she learned those rules before she broke them. Her previous experiences working on Frito-Lay at PepsiCo, managing a P&L at Diamond Foods, consulting at McKinsey & Company and launching brands in venture capital helped build a strong foundation for her entrepreneurial journey.Related: The Founders of This Paleo, Gluten-Free and Vegan Brand Say It Succeeded Because of Its Restrictions""[Experimenting with scale] required some capital because there's a lot of waste that comes with that.""Ladha started experimenting with chocolate chip cookie dough in her kitchen in June 2020, when the pandemic was well underway, and many people wanted to graduate from the ""sourdough and wine phase"" and indulge in healthier ways, she says. Today, all of DEUX's cookie doughs have a similar base, incorporating oats, nut butter, flaxseed and coconut sugar.


But one of the biggest challenges in those early days was figuring out how to scale DEUX's perfect recipe with a manufacturer. ""You would think it's [just] math, right?"" Ladha says. ""Like, you just scale up the recipe into making 3,000 pounds instead of one pound. And it really did not work like that. It got drier; it got a little bit more dense. It wasn't as sweet. So you have to then go through iterations, and that required some capital because there's a lot of waste that comes with that too.""Related: This Entrepreneur Believes Courage Is the Key Ingredient for SuccessInitially, Ladha didn't want to raise capital; she put $20,000 of her own money into the business and resolved to test the product first. Ladha was more than willing to pivot if the idea didn't gain traction, noting that she ""wanted an idea that would work"" rather than one that had to be ""force fit"" into the market. But DEUX was ""profitable on first ship,"" and once Ladha realized the serious potential there, she decided to raise.Image Credit: Courtesy of DEUX


To date, DEUX has raised about $6 million. The company's first fundraising round kicked off in January 2021, and Ladha says that capital — and the ability it gave DEUX to produce at a significantly higher volume — made it possible for her to appear on Shark Tank after its producers reached out. Ladha didn't land a deal on the show, but DEUX has continued to see tremendous growth in the years since.""[If you] take that kind of tech mentality and bring it to food, it will just help you understand if there's actually product-market fit.""DEUX has transitioned from an exclusively direct-to-consumer (DTC) brand to one with a significant retail presence in Target, Whole Foods, Sprouts Farmers Markets and more. DEUX hit 1,000,000 units sold last year and more than doubled its store count to 2,600 in 2023. And in the first half of 2024, DEUX will see that figure skyrocket again with the launch of donuts at major retailers nationwide, totaling more than 4,000 stores across its three product lines.Ladha says that retail will make up the ""lion's share"" of DEUX's revenue this year but stresses that DTC remains important for the brand for two reasons: data collection and marketing opportunities. The former helps the business understand who its customers are and which flavors resonate with them, and the latter has allowed it to explore brand collaborations, like its recent Buttercream Sugar Cookie with The Skinny Confidential.

It Failed, But He Pivoted to Build a $1.5 Billion Business.Now, Ladha is focused on making DEUX a household name — ""full stop."" She envisions it as a ""better-for-you Nestlé"" with a modern twist and says a not-so-""sexy"" ""tech mindset"" is helping it get there.""It sounds much cooler to be like, 'You know, I was just making this cookie dough for my friends and family, and then I went to a farmer's market, and Whole Foods discovered me, and now I'm at Whole Foods now nationally,'"" Ladha says. ""That's a cooler story, right? But if you can collect data and test and learn and take that kind of tech mentality and bring it to food, it will just help you understand if there's actually product-market fit. That's why I joke, 'Don't do it — but see if you should do it.'""

Retirement should be a time of relaxation and enjoyment, but for many Americans, it's a source of financial anxiety.More than half (56%) of American workers believe they're behind on saving for retirement — and 37% feel they're ""significantly behind,"" according to a recent Bankrate survey.But where people choose to live out their golden years can make or break their retirement. A new study from WalletHub reveals the best states for retirees, evaluating crucial factors like tax rates, cost of living, access to quality healthcare and fun activities.

Our habits impact how we live, our health and shape and determine our daily and long-term outcomes. Positive habits can supercharge your output, propel you miles forward and set you up for your best success.

Below are nine habits to help you level up in 2024.1. Read more, scroll lessAs Dr. Seuss wrote, ""The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go."" Nowadays, we spend too much time on our screens and mindlessly scrolling. Put this time into action by reading more books. Our minds are continuously being wired to have shorter attention spans, and if you add AI to that, we will continue to lose memory and remember fewer things.

73,Rejection Doesn't Have to Be a Bad Thing. Here's How You Can Use It as a Tool for Success.,"Dec 25, 2023",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-use-rejection-as-a-tool-for-success/465549,"
When I was 22, I had a boss who taught me to crave rejection. At that time, I was in a sales role and had shared with her that I felt all I ever heard was the word ""no.""The following month, she ran a competition to see who could hear ""no"" the most. And yes indeed, I was the victor. So much good came from that experience. I realized that rejection is a part of sales, and it's also a part of life. I learned that highly successful people know this and aren't miffed when they're told no. In fact, they embrace rejection and even learn from it.Successful people use rejection to get stronger. However, many people don't feel this way about rejection. If you're struggling to feel good about being rejected, here are four steps you can take to completely rewire your brain.



Related: 5 Ways to Turn Rejection Into Resilience1. Don't take it personallyOften, we struggle with rejection because we feel it's personal. But rejection usually isn't personal.


When rejected, it's easy to wonder what the rejection says about us. But often, rejection doesn't say anything about us. Instead, it says something about the other person. Frequently, we ignore or discount the reasons we're given for the rejection. Instead, we look for another reason (the real reason). Usually, another reason doesn't exist.If someone says they don't want the product or service we're selling because they can't afford it at that time, they usually mean it. If someone says they can't attend the event we invited them to because they're too busy, they usually mean it. Spending time beating ourselves up and wondering what the rejection really says about us and how likable we are is often a tremendous waste of time. When we trust the reasons we're given for the rejection, we can move on and strike out again much faster.2. Get excited about being rejectedRejection usually doesn't feel good. For many, that's why it's hard to imagine what (if any) good can (and will) come from it.Remember: Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional. Recognize that you have a choice in how you feel about rejection. Whatever story you tell yourself about rejection comes from you. It's up to you to interpret the information that exists in your world. You have the power to flip the script, change the narrative and tell yourself a different story.


You can choose to view rejection as a good thing — it means you put yourself out there, asked a tough question and exuded courage. It means you got out of your comfort zone, which always helps us grow and evolve. It means you got to practice a skill (the skill of asking, influencing or selling). That practice will help you grow thicker skin and hone your craft, making you stronger and tougher. With that in mind, you can choose to view rejection as a good thing.Related: How to Overcome Rejection and Move Forward With Your Big Goals3. Ask why — and learn from itMost people feel pain when rejected. When we experience any kind of pain, our first reaction is often flight or fight. We either walk away, as quickly as we can, or we double down and argue. When it comes to rejection, neither approach works well.Here's what does: Engaging the person who rejected you from a place of true curiosity. Questions such as: ""What was the biggest factor in your decision?"" or ""What, if anything, would've made you say yes?"" or ""What could I offer or do next time that would excite or interest you more?""


These questions are great tools to help you learn from rejection. Perhaps you can give feedback to your boss that your product's price point isn't appealing or the benefits aren't meeting market demand. You might learn that a slightly altered product or service would've garnered a yes, and perhaps you can negotiate an exception from your company that allows you to go back and offer the client what they really want.Every so often, there is something you could've done or said differently that would've been persuasive. Getting information about how to proceed more effectively next time is a win. With that mindset in mind, rejection is actually a good thing — it helps you improve.4. Know that things can changeRemember that most things in life aren't permanent and people's situations can change dramatically from one year to the next (or even one month to the next). Just because someone turned you down once doesn't mean they'll turn you down every time.Ask permission to reconnect or touch base again later. Maybe your friend can't make time to see you this month, but they'll be able to next month. Perhaps the client you've been trying to sign all year will be in a different financial situation next year. Recognize now simply might not be the right time for whatever you're proposing, and while that's okay, it may not always be the case.

Adjust your strategyAfter you get enough information to learn following a rejection, you get to employ what I call PDCA — plan, do, check and adjust.Once you've been rejected and know why, you can adjust your strategy. You might learn that making calls at lunch time isn't effective because no one answers the phone. You might learn you've been targeting the wrong demographic and need to pick different prospects. You might learn prospecting on the weekdays isn't as effective as prospecting on weekends.Rejection, if used correctly, can be an excellent teacher because it can guide us to make changes to what we do and how we do it. You might decide to start frequenting community events or join a networking group to be more successful. In the end, if being rejected causes you to do something new and different, that's another win.


Having a healthy, strong relationship with rejection is a true game changer. If you adopt these five philosophies on rejection, you'll find rejection isn't nearly as painful as it once was. You might even begin to look forward to rejection.

74,Silent Retreats Are Expensive — But Effective. Here's How to Recreate the Benefits of One From Anywhere.,"Dec 13, 2023",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/discover-the-cognitive-benefits-a-silent-retreat/464705,"
Each summer, I take a few weeks off as CEO of Jotform, travel to my family's farm in Turkey, and do my best to truly check out. Instead of tending to my inbox, I tend to our olive groves and go for long nature walks with my kids. As this time off unfolds, I inevitably begin to feel refreshed and re-energized. Upon returning to the office, this form of life hack produces thinking that's reliably sharper, and I'm increasingly convinced that much of this has to do with the absence of noise, both internal and external.Their grounding in the principle that ""…natural quiet has become an endangered species and needs to be protected"" (as Condé Nast Traveler writer Sarah Allard phrases it in a 2023 article on vacation trends), ""silent retreats"" are on the rise. And though many of these literally encourage no talking, it seems that their effectiveness stems from a lack of informational/digital noise. A fascinating El Pais story by Silvia López Rivas includes a 2011 observation by then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who pointed out that until 2003, humans had produced an amount of information equivalent to five exabytes — the same quantity generated every two days in 2011. It has been estimated that by 2025, we'll be creating 463 exabytes of information every single day. In short, the sound of information, already deafening, is poised to get much louder.Related: Did You Mess Up? Use This Astronaut's ""30-Second Rule"" to Feel Better and Refocus



The benefits of quietMeditation retreats, even when they're not totally silent, have been shown to deliver multifold benefits. One comprehensive study published in a 2016 edition of the Journal of Psychosomatic Research found that meditation retreats reliably reduced symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression, in part because of their ability to foster mindfulness — being fully present and engaged in the moment. It is, after all, virtually impossible to focus on creative work when your mind is racing. Mindfulness, meanwhile, leads to clearer and more innovative thinking.Many retreat participants additionally report that an extended experience of silence helped produce a better night's sleep, and it's no secret to anyone reading this that rest is fundamental to sharp cognition. A telling 2004 study from the University of Lübeck involved asking subjects to complete math problems that relied on algorithms, with shortcuts hidden deep within formulas. About 25% of the subjects discovered them at the outset, but given the chance to get eight hours of sleep, that figure rose to 59%.


Related: You'll Never Achieve Work-Life Balance — and You Shouldn't, Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian SaysGo easy at firstIt's challenging to quit noise cold turkey. That's why silent retreat organizers approach the process gradually. For example, they recommend that participants, especially first-timers, ease into the practice by refraining from checking phones for a few hours before arriving.Even if you're not jetting off to retreat in a 16th-century castle in France, there are ways to proceed gradually into encouraging quiet, say by carving out just 15 daily minutes away from devices, emails, meetings, social media and news notifications.It's tricky for me to commit to anything that isn't scheduled, so I make regular appointments to have silent time. For me, mornings work best before the day has a chance to catch up. When the appointment pops up, I'm not deciding whether or not I'm in the mood to be silent; I just switch off devices and begin.


Objectively observe your internal dialogueMaking time for yourself in this way is, on its own, an achievement that will deliver myriad benefits, but applying some actionable advice can help take the practice one step further.During silent time at the office, I use some of the practices from Vipassana meditation — scanning my body from head to toe and paying attention to sensations. If my shoulders ache from a morning training session or my stomach grumbles after a skipped breakfast, I take note while tuning into what's happening in my mind.The key is to not react, just observe, as many have found that engaging in this discipline helps both body and mind better tolerate painful and unpleasant situations.Related: How to Stop Information Overload in its Tracks


Get comfortable with discomfortIn our incredibly noisy world, sitting in silence can be jarring, and it's not unusual to experience a knee-jerk need to escape from it. In a 2016 Guardian article, one journalist attending a silent retreat in New Zealand admitted to having the urge to run through the hall screaming. It's perfectly natural to want to give up when you're first engaging in this process, and that's okay. The trick is to stop expecting perfection and learn to be with things as they are, which can reduce stress and anxiety and boost creativity and the need for productive connections with others.Related: A Simple Practice to Overcome the Fear of Uncertainty and Daily Stress

75,'Turn Left at the TSA Line' and 8 Other Travel Hacks That Will Save You Time and Money,"Dec 11, 2023",Jonathan Small,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/9-travel-hacks-that-will-save-you-time-and-money/466716,"
For even the most frequent traveler, tackling busy air travel can be an exercise in extreme patience and frustration. Having an arsenal of airport and airline flight hacks can be the difference between a smooth and turbulent journey.So we spoke to Megan Gougeon, founder of the Portable Professional, a popular YouTube travel vlog with 102,000 subscribers. Gougeon has taken more than 300 flights and worked remotely from 50 countries, so she knows her way around airports and an airplane.""My videos are all about helping travelers feel confident and capable so they can turn every aspect of their trip, from packing to airport navigation to the flight itself, into an enjoyable and stress-free experience,"" she says.



Here are nine travel hacks to make your next trip cheaper and hassle-free.Related: 6 Secret Tools for Flying First Class (Without Paying Full Price)


1. Turn left at the TSA lineWaiting in long lines to clear security can be a hassle. Some services allow for expedited airport security, such as TSA PreCheck or CLEAR, but they cost money and require you to complete a lengthy application beforehand. Savvy travelers know that another solution to avoid longer lines is to always turn left at the security checkpoint. Why?""Most people are right-handed and tend to veer to the right naturally. This means the left line might be shorter and faster,"" Gougeon explains.2. Don't buy water at the airportAfter clearing security, many thirsty travelers feel compelled to buy bottled water at the airport to manage the dry cabin air — a big mistake. Thanks to a monopoly by certain water companies at airports, the cost of a 20-ounce water bottle can be anywhere from $2.50 to $5.Gougeon suggests bringing a collapsable water bottle and filling it up for free at water fountains after passing through security. Another trick: You can ask the staff at Starbucks or one of the coffee shops to refill your water bottle.


3. Wear layersWhat do you do if your carry-on luggage is too large or heavy to take on the flight? Gougeon recommends wearing heavier items on the flight and then stashing them away in an overhead compartment if you're too warm. Another hack is to pack an extra shopping back in your luggage. Use it to carry additional items you must remove from your bag. Most airlines will let you board with a carry-on, backpack and shopping bag.4. Mark your luggage as ""fragile"" Putting a ""Fragile"" sticker on your luggage encourages baggage handlers to treat it more carefully. ""This might also lead to your bag being placed on top of others, potentially resulting in it being among the first to come out at baggage claim,"" Bougeon says.Related: Boomer Women Are Leaving Their Husbands Behind to Travel Solo — Here's What's Behind the Unprecedented Trend5. No power? No problem.We've all been there. We get to the airport, and our phones or computers cling to 8% battery power. Most airport waiting areas have charging stations with USB charging ports. But what if you forgot to pack a charging cord, or it's in the bag you already checked? Gougeon recommends you head to the airport's lost and found. ""Travelers leave their chargest behind all the time, and they probably have one you can borrow,"" Gougeon says.


6. Don't book an Uber or Lyft from the airport""It's often more expensive to book an Uber or Lyft directly from the airport due to additional airport service charges. Walking a short distance from the airport before booking your ride can help you avoid these fees,"" Gougeon says.7. Check these sites before you travelAccording to Gougeon, you should check several sites before traveling to get the most bang for your buck.SeatGuru offers detailed airplane seating advice specific to the exact plane you are flying on.Sleeping in Airports is excellent for finding airport amenities, gates and the best sleeping spots.Expert Flyer provides real-time notifications on seat availability, which is especially useful for those looking to snag a more comfortable seat or wanting to monitor the availability of flights for potential changes or upgrades.8. The best seats for working and sleepingIf you want to sleep, try a window seat at the back of the plane, Gougeon says. ""It's usually quieter and less crowded there, so you might get more space or even a whole row to yourself. Plus, the window gives you something to lean on."" She recommends picking the side of the plane that matches where you usually rest your head to sleep.If you plan on working during the flight, Gougeon suggests an aisle seat in the middle of the plane. It's smoother flying over the wings, and you can stretch your arms into the aisle to make working on your laptop easier.


9. Get access to airport lounges for cheapMost major airline hubs in the U.S. have airline lounges that offer ample seating, plenty of desk space and free food, coffee and WiFi. Some even had showers and napping spots. However, access to these lounges can cost anywhere from $99 to $499 a year. Some credit cards offer complimentary or discounted lounge access, so double-check yours. Gougeon also suggests ""looking for discounted lounge passes on online marketplaces like Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist.""Related: I Tried the Semi-Private Air Carrier That Lets You Arrive 20 Minutes Before Your Flight.

76,Reach New Levels of Productivity By Treating Your Personal Life Like a Work Project,"Dec 11, 2023",Nickie Rowley,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-project-manage-your-personal-life/465179,"
If you audit time in terms of what you said you'd accomplish versus what you actually did, it's not uncommon to see deltas like, ""I only completed to my satisfaction 20% of what was needed: 70% got pushed to the next week, and 10% wasn't done well."" Normally at a corporate job, this level of productivity is a recipe for unemployment, but when it comes to personal lives, we tend to extend ourselves so much grace that it can border on self-sabotage.Why? Well, because we can. There's simply less accountability within a personal space not governed by a passion to be more effective and efficient with time (efficacy here essentially means ""I'm getting it done,"" while efficiency translates to ""I'm getting things done faster and better""). And the only way someone can ever truly embrace both is by leveraging the tools and systems connected to how we operate on a granular level. This is what good project management does.Define objectives and create deliverablesThe first step in applying better management to your personal life is to clearly define objectives. This includes breaking them down into smaller deliverables and defining the time needed to achieve each one. Say you need to clean out the garage: Instead of saying, ""This is a goal, and I'll do it this Saturday,"" a better mechanism might be detailing that ""Garage section 1 will take 40 minutes, and section 2 will take 50 minutes."" You've broken tasks down, assigned a duration to each, and can now monitor whether it took less or more time than anticipated.



Related: Why Inner-Mastery is the Key to Self-GrowthI've found that the two most important things about setting objectives are:


Ensuring what needs to be done is detailed, as lack of information leaves room for ambiguity. In other words, make sure goals have a defined scope.Emphasize measurement: that dates, durations and progress can be attached to the objective.PrioritizationAmong the most challenging parts of project management is beating the ""I know what to do, there's just not enough time to do it all"" syndrome. Such a phrase is a common indicator of an overwhelmed calendar and a lack of prioritization. Suppose deliverables are schedule-arranged according to the level of importance. In that case, there will be a strategy for choosing immediacy or delay and a schema to dictate later calendar development.One organizing method I apply is the ""P1 to P5"" scale:P1 (Critical): Anything that needs to be addressed immediatelyP2 (High priority): Important but not time-sensitiveP3 (Neutral): No immediate deadline, but it still needs to be addressedP4 (Low priority): Should be completed when there's timeP5 (Unknown): No estimated or outlined deadlineRelated: How Entrepreneurs Can Learn From Project ManagersSchedule curationCreating a comprehensive timetable can be tedious, partly because of shifting priorities attached to deliverables, taking longer than expected, forgetting pre-requisites (what needs to be completed first) and the inevitable fact that people won't always adhere to what we forecasted for their time. Investing in a project management scheduling tool for personal matters is great, as it introduces automation to help recalibrate these many variables. This is not to say that manual intervention will not be required on occasion; it is just that more detail will be captured and better managed over time.


A few tools to consider are Wrike, Asana, Trello, Monday.com and Smartsheet — their principal assets include:Ease of schedule updating, as it lives in the cloud and can be categorized by master or sub-schedules, allowing for both high- and low-level granularity.Quantitative assessments can be made to show, for example, how many tasks were planned versus accomplished, along with time overruns and scheduling delays.Resource tracking can help hold people accountable for completed tasks.Incorporating the often overlooked, such as potential risks, will make it easier to create contingency plans.Connectivity to existing schedules on Google or Outlook Calendars to provide additional visibility.Related: 5 Best Project Management Tools of 2023The payoffsAny capable project manager makes it a point to document rigorously, including lessons learned, and the same should apply to ways personal lives are organized. This may seem at first like a needless expenditure of effort, but consider the business corollary: If you were late on deliverables 25% of the time or if high-priority items were not being handled well, the effects would be dramatic. Putting better systems in place requires consistency, discipline and focus. Still, you'll find that practice quickly becomes a habit — that what once seemed fussy translates into real-life improvement and better results in all of its aspects.

77,How Growth Hacking Will Lead to Rapid Business Expansion,"Dec 1, 2023",Ross Kernez,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-growth-hacking-will-lead-to-rapid-business-expansion/465619,"
Growth hacking has emerged as a buzzword in the world of startups and digital marketing, but it is much more than just a trendy phrase. It represents a fundamental shift in how companies, especially startups, approach growth. In an age where the digital landscape is incredibly competitive and ever-evolving, traditional marketing strategies often fall short of delivering rapid growth. This is where growth hacking comes in, offering a blend of creativity, analytics, and an unorthodox approach to skyrocketing a company's user base and market presence.At its core, growth hacking is about pushing the boundaries of typical marketing strategies to drive growth. It combines elements from marketing, technology, and data analytics to achieve this goal. Unlike traditional marketing, which often relies on established channels and methods, growth hacking is about finding new, scalable ways to attract and retain customers. It's about understanding the user journey in the digital age and leveraging every tool available – from social media platforms to big data analysis – to catalyze rapid growth.Growth hackers, the individuals who practice this art, are not just marketers. They are part strategist, part coder, part data scientist, and entirely focused on growth. They look at the product and the market through a unique lens, asking not just ""How can we market this product?"" but ""How can we make this product market itself?""



Related: Work-Life Balance is Possible — And It's Not as Hard to Achieve as You ThinkUnderstanding growth hacking is crucial not just for startup enthusiasts but for anyone interested in the dynamic ways modern businesses are scaling and thriving in digital spaces. Growth hacking is a marketing strategy focused on the rapid growth of a company, particularly startups, using cost-effective and innovative tactics. It differs from traditional marketing in that growth hackers are singularly focused on growth, often using technology, analytics, and social metrics to achieve their goals.


Definition and originsThe term ""growth hacking"" was coined by Sean Ellis in 2010. Ellis, who helped several internet companies achieve incredible growth, realized that traditional marketing techniques weren't always applicable to startups with limited budgets and resources. He defined a growth hacker as ""a person whose true north is growth.""Here are some of its core principles.Data-Driven Approach: Growth hackers rely heavily on data to guide their decisions. They analyze user data to understand behavior and preferences, which helps in tailoring strategies.Product-Market Fit: Essential to growth hacking, this involves modifying the product until it resonates with the target market. The idea is to create a product that markets itself.Rapid Experimentation: Growth hacking involves constant testing and experimentation. Strategies are tested, measured, and either abandoned or scaled based on their performance.Leveraging Technology: Automation and technology play a significant role. Growth hackers use tools for tasks like email marketing, social media management, and analytics.Creative and Innovative Tactics: Out-of-the-box thinking is a hallmark of growth hacking. This could involve unconventional PR campaigns, viral marketing techniques, or leveraging social media in unique ways.Related: Seven Growth Hacking Tools For Startup SuccessTechniques and strategiesViral Acquisition: Encouraging current users to refer new users, often seen in ""invite a friend"" campaigns.Content Marketing: Creating valuable content to attract and engage an audience, often with the goal of turning them into customers.Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Optimizing website content to rank higher in search engine results, thereby increasing visibility and traffic.Email Marketing: Using personalized email campaigns to nurture leads and convert them into customers.Product Tweaks for Growth: Adjusting the product based on user feedback and data to improve retention and attract more users.Balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainabilityA critical aspect of growth hacking is finding the right balance between rapid growth and sustainable business practices. While growth hacking techniques can provide quick wins, they need to be integrated into a broader strategy that considers long-term brand health, customer relationships, and ethical marketing practices. This balance is crucial for businesses looking to grow rapidly and maintain and build upon that growth in the long term.


Growth hacking has become an integral part of the startup ecosystem, offering a lean, data-driven approach to marketing. It's about finding intelligent, low-cost strategies to acquire and retain customers. While it's often associated with startups, its principles can be applied to any business looking for rapid growth. However, balancing growth hacking tactics with long-term brand and customer relationship strategies is essential.As growth hacking becomes more mainstream, there's a growing need to educate the next generation of marketers and entrepreneurs in these techniques. This education goes beyond mere tactics; it's about cultivating a growth mindset, teaching the importance of data-driven decision-making, ethical considerations, and the agility to adapt to new challenges and opportunities.

78,5 Ways to Sidestep Discouragement and Stay on Track,"Nov 22, 2023",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/5-secrets-to-overcoming-challenges-and-achieving-success/464899,"
When we set out to accomplish monumental things or make big changes in our lives, the road to success isn't always easy. Perhaps you're starting a business, writing a book, training for your first marathon or wanting to exceed your annual sales quotes. Maybe you're in a brand new role at work and looking to establish a brand for yourself.Regardless of the specific goal you're pursuing, you're likely to encounter challenging days where you wish you'd stayed in bed. However, before you consider throwing in the towel on your wildest dreams, make sure you've done (or are doing) the following five things. If you do, you'll be less likely to view quitting as an option, and you may even realize you're doing better than you think.Related: 12 Lessons You Learn or Regret Forever



1. Remember why you startedWhen we stay laser-focused and emotionally connected to the reasons we started down the path initially, it's harder to get discouraged. Remembering our purpose or vision for the end game is a surefire way to boost your morale when you're feeling down. Ask yourself, ""What was it that made me want to do this in the first place? What's at stake here?""Perhaps you'll remember that your goal was to impact the lives of others or make a meaningful difference in the world. When you remember that, it's harder to let a bad day, week or month stand in your way. Instead of thinking about why you can't, you'll remember why you must.


2. Force yourself to stay in motionSometimes, when we get momentarily stuck, there's a tendency to stay stuck. Make sure you don't allow this to happen. Being successful isn't about avoiding failure — it's about turning failures into learning opportunities so we can start again with greater wisdom and new insights. How many times you get knocked down doesn't matter nearly as much as how quickly you can get back up. It's not important that you blew off your goals for a day or a week. What's important is that you get back on track as soon as you can.To ensure maximum productivity and keep yourself focused, I suggest weekly planning. At the start of each week, renew your excitement by making a list of the most important actions you'll take in the coming week — then commit to them by giving them a space to live and breathe on your calendar. Later, if something unexpected comes up and you can't complete one of your actions, no worries. But you have to assign that action item a new spot on your calendar.Regardless of what setbacks you've had, it's hard to fail (in the long run) if you're continually getting back into action. Don't spend time focusing on what unfortunate things happen to you. Instead, always focus on what you can do about them. This will always allow you to be in place of control and power over your time, yourself and ultimately, your life.Related: 5 Acts of Mental Discipline to Maintain the Positive Mindset Success Requires


3. Be choosy about what content you consumeWhen we're pursuing big goals, it's easy to become discouraged. This is why managing our mindset and our mood is mission-critical. It's important we surround ourselves with messages and reminders that we can absolutely accomplish our goals and struggle is to be expected (and normal). Carefully pick podcasts, videos and books that uplift and encourage you; not ones that do the reverse.Do not associate with others who complain, whine, gossip or create drama; this will not help you. Spending time with others who have done what you are trying to do will be especially helpful. Finding a mentor, coach or therapist who can normalize your challenges can be wildly reassuring. Knowing that our experiences are not unique helps give us the courage to forge ahead, even when the road is hard and long.4. Take care of yourself along the waySometimes, when we desperately want to achieve results, we focus on nothing else — then we become drained. If all you're doing with your time is focusing on a singular goal, it's likely you'll eventually burn out and lose motivation to keep going. This will sabotage your success. When we're pursuing greatness, it's critically important to take care of our mental, emotional and physical health. Taking breaks to pursue our favorite hobbies (especially those that allow us to access our creative outlets) is essential to our success. Getting enough rest, drinking plenty of water and exercising daily are helpful tools in making sure we're ready to execute our big goals. Invest some time each week doing the things you love, and/or seeing the people you love, because these are the activities that will replenish your energy.Related: 6 Game-Changing Mindset Shifts I Wish I'd Known About Sooner


5. Find the wins and celebrate your accomplishmentsRegardless of what isn't going well as you approach your goals, it's likely there are some things that are going well. Don't stay so focused on the end result that you forget to acknowledge the small wins along the way, regardless of how minor they might seem. Okay, so you didn't sign that big contract you thought you would. What about the deals did you close this month? Maybe you're experiencing writer's block this week and can't think of a good ending to the novel you're writing. What about all the writing you did get done last week? When all we do is focus on what isn't coming together, we rarely find the motivation to stay in the game long enough to emerge victorious. Be sure to acknowledge your progress, even if its not as rapid as you hoped. Writing these things down can be especially encouraging.Regardless of whatever you want to accomplish, remember this: If it were easy, everyone would do it. Bad days will come. Setbacks are inevitable. But, by following these practices, you're far more likely to have the inspiration and urge to buckle back down and keep your head in the game, even after a tough week. Do that repeatedly, for long enough, and success is inevitable.

79,5 Lessons Learned From a Female Entrepreneur,"Nov 21, 2023",Kelly Hyman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-lessons-learned-from-a-female-entrepreneur/465111,"
Being an entrepreneur has its perks, but there are also many challenges as well. For females, in particular, there's also the need to juggle family, friendships and solo downtime. There is societal pressure to do it all, which can be overwhelming.Entrepreneurship doesn't often follow a linear path, and there is no surefire road to success. However, every challenge can become a lesson, which helps to lighten the load and make the road easier over time. Here are a few key lessons I've learned along the way and how they've shaped my journey.Lesson #1: Overcoming imposter syndromeThere are unique problems women face that don't often affect men in the same way. Self-doubt is all too common among women entrepreneurs, as it's historically been more challenging for us to be taken as seriously or given the same types of opportunities as men.



Consequently, research shows women experience imposter syndrome at a higher rate than men. And consequently, women often feel like they don't have the knowledge or skills to start their own business. Though overcoming these feelings takes time, one way is to celebrate wins, big and small.In addition to not feeling capable enough, women often downplay their successes. Rather than focusing on feelings of not being good enough, list accomplishments and use them to illustrate your ability to take on new challenges. Also, let go of feelings of perfectionism, as being an entrepreneur takes a lot of trial and error. With all the factors that could be holding you back, don't let yourself be one of them.


Related: 5 Lessons for the Fearless Female EntrepreneurLesson #2: Finding professional supportIt's easy to get edged out of a male-dominated business world, which makes it important to find a collaborative group of female support when building your brand. Females bring a unique perspective, and sharing challenges and solutions about respective endeavors creates a feeling of connectedness and growth.Also, as an entrepreneur, the solo aspect can feel isolating as well, so finding resources to help provide that support is important. Start locally by looking into female networking groups and opportunities. HeraHub and other co-working spaces are good places to start since there is already a built-in community. Also, look to your library and social media for people to connect with and opportunities for engagement. Some of the best peer-to-peer relationships start online, so take advantage of technology and schedule virtual and in-person meetups to share experiences and ideas.Related: 5 Priceless Lessons For First-Time Entrepreneurs


Lesson #3: Always be learningEntrepreneurship is a marathon, not a sprint. You must have a willingness to learn. Step outside of your comfort zone and learn from others through webinars, classes, and speaking events. The more knowledge you can absorb and apply to your work, can help you improve your approach.There will never be a time when you ""know it all."" There are endless ways to expand your business and position yourself in a better way for your future. Invest in your continuing education and prioritize what new trends that may be relevant to shape and evolve your business continually.This may include learning the latest social media platform, creating a new income stream, or evaluating your current business plan to see what is and isn't working. As an entrepreneur, a lot of research and development goes into business before ""getting it right,"" and broadening your network and education can only help you in the long run.Lesson #4: Prioritize self-careMany women originally entered entrepreneurism to free themselves from the traditional 9-5 workday model. However, they work even longer days because they don't have boundaries set in place. Alternatively, it can be hard to feel motivated when it's just you in charge. So, how do you prevent burnout while also maintaining motivation?


The answer is self-care. In our quest to be successful, we often forget to plan time for ourselves. We don't take breaks, let alone vacations, and end up working more than we would a traditional in-office job. Regardless of how much you enjoy the work you do, you must take care of your physical and mental health.Stay active with a gym membership and time exercising outside. Eat healthfully and stay hydrated. And get plenty of sleep. Get a facial. These fundamental habits are often overlooked. While indulgences are also beneficial, solid habits are essential to keep you in a healthy space.Related: 5 Lessons You Can Learn From Some of the World's Best BusinesswomenLesson #5: Take more risksHere's a secret: the first risk you take is the hardest. After that, you realize you are more capable than what you thought you could achieve. Taking a leap into the unknown is scary but necessary for growth. Foture favors the brave. You've also taken the first step as an entrepreneur, but it's likely the first of many.


To make the risk seem less scary, map out your plan. Ask yourself, what are your goals? What is my passion? How will you achieve them? But the most important question is: how much will you suffer if you stay exactly where you are? There's no guaranteeing what the future will hold, but if you are unhappy or unsatisfied with your current situation, the only solution is to try something different.When you honor yourself and follow your true purpose and passion, the reward outweighs the risk. Even the best-laid plans have their detours, so follow a path that will ultimately put you where you want to be.

80,3 Brain Hacks For When You Can't Focus at Work,"Nov 15, 2023",Leah Borski,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/3-brain-hacks-for-when-you-cant-focus-at-work/465034,"
Curt Steinhorst, author of Can I Have Your Attention?, wrote, ""Distraction is actually just confusion about what matters."" So what does matter when we can't focus at work? Is it productivity at any cost? For decades, the answer has been a collectively mandated yes.We, as a society, know a lot more about the brain now than we did even 10 years ago. A lot of what we thought makes us more focused and productive, it turns out actually doesn't.The following brain hacks might feel counterintuitive. But rest assured, that's exactly why they work.



Brain hack #1: UnfocusI know it goes against all traditional thought. We're taught that ""idle time is wasted time."" But the worst thing we can do when struggling to focus at work is try harder. This only wastes precious mental energy. That brain drain triggers our stress response, and stress causes our logical brain to shut down.No logic means no focus. It's a vicious cycle.


Instead, take a short five-minute break from thinking. A recent study from the University of Sydney shows that's all we need to get our concentration back. The study author, Associate Professor Paul Ginns, notes that ""scrolling social media for five minutes doesn't count.""One study backs this up, noting the tendency for people to do ""media multitasking."" An example is when you're scrolling socials, click over to check email and then click back.This divided attention further compromises our focus and attention. Research published in the 2021 Workgeist report, in collaboration with Cornell University, showed it takes 9.5 minutes to recover from switching between apps and return to the original focused task. So a ""quick"" social media break costs almost twice as much time out of our day.Alternative actions to try: Step outside or next to a window. Look at the sky. Do some gentle stretches. Sit back and close your eyes. Make some tea. Clean the sink. Walk down the hallway. Any of these unplugged activities can reset your focus in five minutes.


Related: Why Multitasking is Blocking Your Path to SuccessBrain hack #2: Go with the (neurochemical) flowYou know that groggy feeling you fight every day around 2-3 p.m. (a.k.a. the afternoon slump)? Turns out it isn't just the result of staying up too late binge-watching Shark Tank.My mind was blown during one of my NeuroHealth Coach Certification courses when I learned that this phenomenon is actually a normal function of our brains.I bet you've heard of melatonin as the supplement that helps people sleep — but it's also a hormone that's produced naturally in the brain's pineal gland. It's pivotal in regulating our sleep-wake cycles (also called our circadian rhythm). If you struggle to focus at work, it's critical to understand the circadian rhythm.


Melatonin levels spike two times during this cycle. One is at night when we start to feel sleepy for bedtime. The other is at midday, causing that sluggish feeling in the afternoon.It's common to push ourselves to overcome this natural low-energy period. Hustle culture and our inner critics demand it. We think needing breaks means we're lazy or weak. We ignore what our bodies are telling us, for the sake of productivity. But this mindset has tricked us for too long. Our brains need rest to function at their best. In fact, science shows us that focus and productivity are actually increased after a brief period of rest (like closing our eyes without falling asleep).Related: The 5-Minute Habit (Based on Neuroscience) That Will Change Your LifeBrain hack #3: Borrow my neurodivergent strategyI'm not diagnosed with ADHD, but my brain doesn't always function in a neurotypical way. I recently read a LinkedIn post from a mental health therapist. He's diagnosed with ADHD and helps others with this condition. He shared things he wished he'd known earlier about ADHD.


One was ""random energy,"" described as volleying between intense energy and feeling like a sloth. Another was ""zero motivation."" This is different because we can feel motivated to do things but still not have the energy to tackle them, or we have massive energy but no motivation to use it for anything constructive.If you can relate, you know how hard it is to focus with our energy scattered like this. I've experienced these struggles throughout my life. It made the first several years of my entrepreneurial journey especially difficult. I tried following advice for high-performance habits. It only left me feeling frustrated and inadequate. I just couldn't manage to stay consistent with a lot of them.Then I discovered a simple strategy: Task buckets.First, I brain-dumped all my tasks onto a sheet of paper. Then, I highlighted the tasks that felt easy to me. These are tasks that don't require much planning, thought or energy. I put these into the ""easy"" bucket. Setting it up as a Trello board works great for this. You could also keep it listed on paper. Then the tasks that I knew needed more focused attention and mental/physical energy went into the ""challenging"" bucket.


On the days when I'm struggling to focus or muster any motivation, I pull one task at a time from the ""easy bucket."" It allows me to feel accomplished despite my scattered energy. Getting things done helps me hack my tendency to feel I need to ""earn"" a self-care break (something we all desperately need for our mental health on days like these).Usually, this is all it takes to shift my mind into a more focused, productive state. Then I'm able to switch over to complete some ""challenging"" tasks too.Related: The 5 Superpowers People With ADHD Can Use to Be Better EntrepreneursOur brains are amazing machinesOur brains are amazing machines. Use these brain hacks to our advantage, we improve productivity without acting on beliefs that sacrifice our well-being.

81,Is it Possible to Heal Yourself When the World Is Falling Apart? These 4 Life Habits Can Help,"Nov 14, 2023",Rachel S. Ruby,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/4-habits-to-help-with-healing-even-when-the-world-is/464824,"
You may be trying to heal and move on from trauma right now and might feel as if your own world has been crashing down. For example, daily life can seem especially difficult if you are going through a divorce. Add on events happening in the world, including in our own backyards, and it is easy to slip into the negativity and become a victim.You may never have been one to suffer from anxiety, paralyzing fear or the inability to function in the world. You may be positive and have immense hope for humanity. You may be kind and accepting, may have always felt that we are all one and that the only way we will live together on this planet is to accept differences and make peace.Yet lately, events have escalated to intense divisiveness and fear. The human ability to rationalize and process these incidents is beyond challenging for many of us, having never lived through such a crisis. How does one continue to progress in the healing journey during such exigent times? Here are some things you can do to make it a little easier.



Related: 9 Business Habits to Avoid at All Costs1. Turn off the news and electronic devicesThe concept ""out of sight, out of mind"" has advantages. While it is important to keep up with what is happening in the world, it is better to make a specific time each day to review headline news, check social media…and then turn it off. The more we subject ourselves to listening to negativity (like despair, horrific event synopses, frustration, anger), the harder it is to focus on the positive and the harder it is to heal ourselves from our own challenges.


Related: Are You an E-Hoarder? How to Know if Your Digital Habits Are Hurting Your Productivity.2. Express gratitude despite hatred and fearI know this sounds impossible to do when outside events dominate our senses, but it is possible. Start your day with an expression of gratitude and by acknowledging all the things for which you are grateful. Here are a few in case you're finding it difficult: breath, life, love of family/loved ones/friends, nature, people who act from love, choice and the beauty that surrounds us.Even in war, there is beauty in a sunrise or sunset, in the way the ocean crashes onto the shore and gently rolls back out again, the glimmer off a lake as the sun sparkles upon it, birds taking flight…the list goes on. If you cannot physically see such things, you can close your eyes and picture them. But make gratitude a habit.3. Make changes within to love more each dayFear tends to make us feel helpless, which can turn us into victims. When we become victims, we are afraid to go out into the world and shine our own light, and we get pulled down into a well of negativity. We stop trying to make changes within and figure we cannot do anything to make them outside ourselves. But we can always make changes — both within and without.


Changes within come from a trifecta of desire, belief and expectation. You must desire the change, believe you can accomplish it, and expect it to happen. The first one is easy – wanting peace and joy within your life is something almost all want. Believing it will happen can be a challenge, especially when terrible things are happening outside your little bubble, and many of us need to work on this prong of the trifecta. The last one – expectation – means that you expect this thing you desire and believe WILL happen, period. This is another challenge for many humans, especially those who have fallen into victimhood. You may need help with this trifecta, and healing will not be possible until you accomplish all three.Start a journal and write about what changes you wish to see within, then work toward them. Catch yourself each time you go down the victim rabbit hole and replace your thoughts with statements of love. Be easy on yourself – Rome wasn't built in a day, nor will you heal in a day or a week, maybe not for months or more. But every step up the ladder brings you closer to it – thus the reason it is called a journey. Celebrate each one.Related: 4 Ways to Harness a Growth Mindset to Set Yourself Up for Success4. Take your self-love and spread itOnce you have made changes within to call in your best and highest self and work toward your healing, you need to focus on what actions you can take to spread the love you have discovered within yourself. This must be done and will create a domino effect – however small – that will take root and spread. It can be as simple as recognizing a store clerk who looks unhappy and asking if all is ok…this goes a long way in making a change for the positive, as the clerk will likely feel heard and validated when you tell them you hope things get better and not to give up. Try this and see what happens.


Every time you tweak your perspective and respond instead of reacting, you can make a change in the world. It may be microscopic but celebrate the change nonetheless. This is how love is spread. Imagine the store clerk above who then goes home and feels slightly better because you took a moment to care - what might that person do to spread the good feeling?Once you feel up to increasing your ability to make change, you can do more – volunteer to help those less fortunate, champion positive changes in your community, listen better, visualize and manifest peace and love. You can spread this feeling in many ways when you realize your actions' power. A beautiful tree starts as a tiny seed. If we all do small things to change the narrative, what we can accomplish is unbelievable.

Not all hobbies are created equal. Over the last decade, I've obsessively studied success (and what successful people do) by reading a book/month on the topic, researching it (so I could write my own books on it) and being mentored by both CEOs and executive coaches. I've found nearly all successful people are intentional and deliberate about how they spend their time. When it comes to their hobbies, watching television or reading tabloids doesn't rank high. Here's what does.More from the author: 6 Habits of Powerful People1. Creation, not consumption

Fifty-five percent of communication is nonverbal, and when there are inconsistencies between attitudes communicated verbally and posturally, the latter will leave a more significant impression, according to body language researcher Albert Mehrabian.Despite knowing how much our bodies can and do communicate, many of us are unaware of how others receive our nonverbal cues, and it's an issue that extends into the workplace — especially when it comes to meetings, whether in-person or on video.Virtual Sapien's body language expert and TEDx speaker Rachel Cossar teamed up with video meetings platform Jugo to create a guide on the gestures and expressions that are silently sabotaging your meetings.

84,Too Many Responsibilities? This Simple Life Hack Will Help You Reclaim Your Life,"Oct 12, 2023",Kirill Perevozchikov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/too-many-responsibilities-this-simple-life-hack-will-help/462998,"
Once in a while, everyone experiences a moment when they realize the need to reconsider something about their life to make it more enjoyable and productive. Re-contracting is a strategy that allows an individual to single out tasks, patterns and people that are draining energy and holding them back.Originally rooted in the teachings of the Roman philosopher Seneca, the concept of re-contracting has withstood the test of time. Seneca once wrote to his student Lucilius, ""A good man will not waste himself upon mean and discreditable work or be busy merely for the sake of being busy.""Today, this idea is a foundational pillar in executive coaching. Programs advocate for regular re-contracting with clients. The power of this technique is in its simplicity and minimal time investment. For all that, it's powerful enough to help you declutter your time, escape from energy-draining obligations and distance yourself from toxic relationships.



Related: How to Spring Clean Your Life in Just 15 MinutesIdentifying hidden contractsTo apply re-contracting to your life, find weak spots in the three main areas. Here's what you need to do:


Self-evaluation: Make a list of tasks you routinely do but despise. Reflect on their necessity and value. Tip: Unsure where to start? Maintain a time diary. Documenting your daily activities can help pinpoint time-consuming tasks.Business evaluation: List out all business and operational tasks. Consider if they can be eliminated or delegated. Tip: Review your calendar and task management apps for recurring events and responsibilities.Relationship audit: Identify professional and personal relationships that aren't benefiting you. This encompasses work colleagues, family, clients, associates and acquaintances like gym partners. Tip: Recollect when you feel exhausted after a conversation or meeting with somebody. Think if it was caused by the person or by other circumstances.The three pillars of re-contractingNow, let's move on to eliminating the obligations that don't work. There are three primary ways to re-contract:Give it up: This encompasses outright elimination. For instance, if a hobby drains you, consider quitting. End the contract if a demanding client is more trouble than they're worth.Renegotiate: Consider a trade-off for tasks you loathe, but others might enjoy. The aim is to swap an undesirable task for a more pleasant one.Buy or delegate: If purchasing a service or tool can save you time, invest in it. Delegation, though sometimes requiring hiring assistance, can be invaluable in freeing up mental and temporal bandwidth.I've already applied those strategies to a few things in my life and can share some examples to illustrate how it works. Attending trade conferences affected my health, so I shifted to alternative client acquisition methods. A client was taking too much of my headspace, so I found a subcontractor to take care of his account. I had been taking voice lessons, and while they provided some benefits, the commute wasn't worth the effort.Sometimes, we hold on to duties, people or ways of doing things out of habit or because we feel obliged and consider any discomfort a normal part of life. Letting go is not easy for some of us, but it's a good skill that may take you to the next level in life.Related: 7 Rules for Entrepreneurs to Delegate Effectively


An important note on habitsOn the one hand, acquiring good habits and quitting bad ones is all the rage, and there are multiple books and science behind it. They can truly be a savior of your time, happiness and vitality. On the other hand, it's also easy to become a habit maniac and get burned out.Write down habits you're trying to adopt or break into your re-contracting list. Reflect on their effectiveness, long-term value and the energy they consume. Also, sometimes, we want to adopt a habit out of pure desire to follow our role models or to feel better about ourselves. However, habits that serve others right and sound good in theory may not work for you. One size doesn't fit all; what makes Mark Zuckerberg productive and happy may wear you out.What's next?Upon freeing up time, you might wonder how to reallocate it. Consider listing activities and individuals that energize you.For those looking for unconventional advice, Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, suggests a unique approach in his book, Rewire Your Brain: Think Your Way to a Better Life. Adams champions the idea of embracing embarrassment as an antidote to monotony, suggesting, ""If I'm bored, this means I'm not embarrassing myself enough."" Or you may consider occupying yourself with nothing. Rick Rubin, a famous music producer, writes in his book The Creative Act: A Way of Being that we all need time to do nothing to come up with creative ideas. Boredom may be a booster for new ideas and inventiveness.


Re-contracting isn't just about reclaiming time but refocusing on what truly matters in life. Doing this simple audit quarterly can have a profound effect on the quality of your life and the quality of your relationships.

85,3 Common Mistakes That Are Destroying Your Productivity,"Oct 11, 2023","Portia Asli, P.Eng., MBA",https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/3-common-mistakes-that-destroy-your-productivity/463150,"
Do you feel like you've put in all those hours but don't have the expected results to show for it? Do you simply wish you could be more productive? As a founder and mental performance coach, I have helped busy entrepreneurs increase their productivity with simple, sustainable, evidence-based actions.Here are three common mistakes I see busy entrepreneurs make that reduce their productivity and waste time. And how you can avoid these mistakes.Related: 9 Productivity Mistakes You're Making in the First 10 Minutes of Your Day



Mistake 1: Working long hoursIs your workload so high that you get overwhelmed by thinking about it? Entrepreneurs come to me for help because a neverending mountain of work exasperates them. And they want to work more efficiently and effectively so that they can reach their targets faster.One of the common mistakes I see entrepreneurs make is working 50 to 80 hours per week to get through their high workload. If you have done that, you have likely realized this method of getting work done isn't sustainable. In fact, research by Stanford University supported that your productivity declines after 50 hours of work in a given week. Another research showed that working anything beyond 40 hours per week has contributed to burnout.


I have helped my clients optimize their mental performance to get more done in less time without working long hours. One of the processes I take my clients through is conducting a data-driven assessment of their workload to remove unnecessary mental burdens. This process is so effective because it helps to sharpen your focus, create the cognitive space for value-driven work and gain back time for strategic activities to grow your business faster.Review your workload to identify what is necessary to achieve your target; otherwise, you cannot succeed without it. Through this assessment, you have three realizations. A small portion of your work that only you can do and is the best use of your time, effort and abilities. A good portion of your work can be eliminated, as they are time wasters and non-value driven. Another portion of work you can do but is not the best use of your time and instead can be delegated or outsourced. This data-driven assessment is one of the key contributors to helping my clients go from working 10-14 hours per day to 8-hour days.Related: The No-Excuse Approach to Sleep and Work Performance for EntrepreneursMistake 2: Poor eating patternsHave you experienced this: a few minutes into a task requiring deep thinking, and your mind gets distracted? You have probably noticed these little distractions steal your precious time. The day ends, and you wonder where the time went. An article by Global News highlighted that you lose 2 hours of work per day due to these distractions. This is another reason entrepreneurs optimize their mental performance: to be more productive by improving their mental concentration on brain-intensive tasks.


The brain's prefrontal cortex is responsible for holding concentration and filtering out these distractions. One of the common mistakes I see entrepreneurs make is having eating patterns and behaviors that prevent their brains from filtering out distractions. An eating habit that constantly gives them a glucose crash. Poor eating habits make you have difficulty focusing, paying attention and poorly managing time.As a mental performance coach, I have helped my clients see over 400% increase in extended sustained concentration on a single task, which enabled them to multiply their productivity. One of the methods that I use to help my clients is to balance their glucose levels through nutrition intervention. A balanced glucose level lets you concentrate on a task longer and produce results-driven outputs in less time. One of the ways to keep your glucose levels balanced is by eating plenty of fiber with every meal. Nutrition intervention is one of the key contributors that has helped my clients improve from an average concentration of 10 minutes to more than 60 minutes.Related: 12 Ways to Eat Healthy No Matter How Busy You AreMistake 3: Being indoors all the timeDo you try to sleep, but you cannot fall asleep? Do you wake up in the middle of the night unable to fall asleep? If so, you have probably noticed how challenging it was to do mentally intensive work after a night of poor sleep. Even research has shown that just a loss of 1.5 hours of sleep results in a 32% reduction in alertness at work, such as slower recall in client meetings and costly errors. Another reason entrepreneurs come to Optimyzed Brain is to help them improve their sleep for performance and productivity.


One of the common mistakes that entrepreneurs make that prevents them from falling asleep and staying asleep is being indoors for nearly 20-24 hours of the day. Their lifestyle keeps them indoors, which hinders their sleep and mental performance.I have helped busy entrepreneurs who were getting 4-5 hours of sleep to get consistent 7-8 hours of restorative sleep — even if they have struggled with sleep for a long time. A small change I've helped my clients implement is getting sunlight first thing in the morning. Sunlight helps the brain produce serotonin, a precursor to the sleep hormone melatonin. Daily sunlight is a crucial contributor to falling asleep and staying asleep.In summary, you can get more out of your work hours by increasing your productivity. Assess your workload periodically to prevent working long hours, balance your glucose levels for extended concentration, and ensure you get sunlight first thing in the morning for better sleep. As a mental performance coach at Optimyzed Brain, I have seen how simple small changes to workstyle, nutrition and lifestyle can help entrepreneurs optimize their mental performance for productivity. When you improve your productivity the right way - by avoiding these mistakes - you also improve your overall health and well-being.

86,From Side Hustle to Full-Time Success — 6 Ways to Turn Niche Interests into Profitable Ventures,"Oct 5, 2023",Bidhan Baruah,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/from-side-hustle-to-full-time-6-ways-to-turn-a-niche-into/462299,"
A few years ago, my friend Sabah turned her passion for cooking into a chef-on-demand business. She started off serving her local Cleveland area, quickly growing to cover other major Ohio cities and plans to expand even further. She is just one of the many people I know who have turned their passion project into a successful business.We all have our passion projects. We do them because they're fun, or we like the challenge, or they're our way of doing some good in the world. From time to time, though, our niche interests and hobbies lead us to marketable ideas. For many, that's as far as it goes; they don't know how to take the next step.Sabah had a shortcut — she's married to my friend and business partner, who knew not only the next step to take but all the steps after that. If you're not lucky enough to have a spouse or friend who can help, here's how to turn your passion project into a successful business.



Related: Ten Tips To Turn Your Passion Project Into A Business1. Run it by friendsWhen we have that eureka moment, it sometimes blinds us to flaws in our logic. Get a quick check. Run your idea by a few trusted friends. They may be able to point out roadblocks you didn't think of. Or they may know a way to help bring your idea to life.


2. Analyze the marketChances are, others have had your idea. Sabah wasn't the first to think of a chef-on-demand service, but when she analyzed the market, she realized her idea could still work. Market analysis requires thoroughly researching consumer trends and expectations, market size and the demand for your offering.To truly excel, you must conduct a thorough analysis of your rivals. While they may offer a comparable product, you must surpass them. By pinpointing what they lack, you can capitalize on it. Keep in mind their customer feedback is crucial in identifying gaps.When you look hard at similar businesses, you might find opportunities to fill the gaps they're leaving.3. NetworkNetworking with others who have launched their business or product can be invaluable. They're ahead of you on the journey and can help you avoid costly missteps.


If you're lucky, you may find someone with similar experience and a willingness to mentor you. A good mentor can help you find the path forward when you hit a roadblock.Keep the lines of communication open with your network and your mentor. They know the twists and turns and can save you a lot of headaches and expenses.4. Build an MVPIn the software development world, a minimum viable product (MVP) is a way to test your idea with a small group of early adopters. It's essentially an early product version with just a few core features.For Sabah, the MVP was a limited menu with a select set of chefs — and she was one of them. Once she proved her idea would work, she hired more chefs and added more meals to the menu based on the feedback she got from her customers.


The early and genuine feedback is the goal of an MVP. The lessons you learn fuel product improvements at the beginning of the development cycle when it's easier and less expensive to make changes.It also gives you evidence that either supports or exposes the flaws in your assumptions about the idea.Related: 5 Tips for Solidifying MVP, and Why It's the Most Important Aspect of Building a Startup5. Get helpSabah didn't build her business alone. She knew she needed help to build the web applications her fledgling company needed and outsourced that work. Trying to do everything leads to stress, burnout and costly mistakes. It also takes you longer to get to market, allowing competitors to beat you to the finish line.


Don't try to go it alone. Engage freelance help or outsource product development to a team with the knowledge and bandwidth to quickly build a high-quality product.Knowing when to get help involves recognizing your strengths and weaknesses. Maybe you can build the product but need help with market analysis. Or building a brand identity and marketing the product.Outsourcing some of the work also frees you up to focus on what you're good at and can take a lot of stress off your shoulders.Related: Asking For Help Is Good For You and Your Business


6. Keep your finger on the pulseMarkets and trends can shift rapidly. Ensure you're monitoring customer needs and what your competitors are doing. Otherwise, your product may be outdated by the time you get launched.It's been a joy to watch the growth of my friend's business. She's met challenges with grace and never let setbacks slow her down. And that, too, is key to turning your passion project into a successful business: believing in your vision enough to stick with it, no matter what.

87,Introverts Who Use This Secret Weapon Can Be More Powerful Than Extroverts in the Workplace,"Oct 4, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/introverts-who-use-this-secret-weapon-are-unstoppable-at/459647,"
It's estimated that introverts make up 25% to 50% of the population, yet misconceptions about them and their capability within the workplace abound.All too often, people assume introverts don't like being around others or that they're shy and uncreative, Karen Eber, CEO and chief storyteller at Eber Leadership Group, says — all of which contribute to underestimations of their potential to speak and lead effectively.Entrepreneur sat down with Eber, whose book The Perfect Story: How to Tell Stories that Inform, Influence, and Inspire is forthcoming from HarperCollins in October, to learn more about why introverts are an asset in the corporate world and how they can avoid being overlooked.

88,3 Critical Pieces of Advice for Entrepreneurs Looking to Jumpstart Their Future,"Aug 28, 2023",Cheri Beranek,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/3-critical-pieces-of-advice-for-building-a-future/457191,"
Until my first job out of grad school, I assumed the phrase, ""Don't bring me a problem, bring me the solution,"" was universally applicable in business. My professors and other role models had always championed that the more initiative I took, the better. So, when my boss tasked me to write a document and I couldn't find the answers within my sphere of influence, my first instinct was to go around my department for a solution. I went, not to someone else in my position — nor my boss — but to my boss's boss for help.That did not go over well.In all my years of university study, we had never covered topics like ""chain of command."" I thought I was doing a great job when I was learning a hard lesson. I didn't even learn it right away.



For young people today, the old notion that their choice of college, major or even fields of experience will determine their path for the rest of their life seems less true than ever. There have always been many choices in the ways we get from point A to point B and more than one path to success.Related: Jefferies CEO Shares 15 Pieces of Advice He Wishes He Knew as a Summer Intern on Wall Street


1. Don't surprise your boss in publicNever attempt to spring a surprise — positive or negative — on your boss. Or, at least, do it first in private. By going around my superiors at my first job, I surprised them — negatively — a mistake I repeated about five years later. By then, I was a marketing manager at another company, anticipating a promotion. Again, I started to take the initiative, buying a pocket guide to get more information about operating in my new role. Instead, I was fired.The sales vice president claimed they could not manage their budget because I was making unexpected purchases. The pocket guide was inexpensive, and there were likely other factors impacting their work, but it was at least a surprise on top of those struggles. So, they used that claim to validate why I should no longer be part of the company.Even good surprises can be bad surprises unless we fully understand our boss's intentions. If a boss announced that a project should take 40 hours to complete and someone delivers it in 10, that may seem like a positive surprise. Announce that surprise at the next all-hands meeting, however, and it may undermine the boss's credibility and judgment. If you know something surprising is coming, prepare your boss with that expectation in private and allow them to support you.Related: 11 Successful Entrepreneurs Reveal What They Learned From Their First Jobs


2. The best job skills are learned on the jobWhen my kids graduated high school, I told them college would teach them how to think, but not necessarily what to think. One of my sons learned this lesson after completing his undergraduate degree in chemistry. After five years, he was done with school and unable to commit to another five years away from his family to pursue an advanced degree.So, he took a different route and was unhappy for the first couple of years. Unable to find a real job doing chemistry work in a lab, he took contract and temp jobs, got paid little, was given excessive and unsatisfying work, and was largely taken advantage of.So, I challenged him: ""For the next job you take, consider looking outside of chemistry.""He took my advice and redirected his career, staying in the lab but moving to quality control. College taught my son the industry language, but only after earning a pittance and learning the hard knocks of bad managers and poor communication did he develop a passion for a career. Now, he's a well-paid, well-respected quality engineer in a heavily chemistry-centric environment, but not necessarily a traditional chemistry lab.


College teaches us how to learn and process data, but we only learn what we love to do through trying, failing and exploring new experiences. When one path doesn't work out, keep an open mind. By exploring adjacent opportunities, we may find new positions more compatible with our skills and passions.Related: Mark Cuban Says ""Follow Your Passion"" Is the Worst Career Advice You Can Get. Here's Why.3. Remember who's writing the checkThat first year out of college can be challenging, both for first-time employees and their employers. In my experience as the leader of a small company, it can be difficult to hire those young professionals right out of the gate: They have yet to learn so many lessons — particularly who is writing their checks.When we attend college, we write the checks and, as a result, are generally in charge of our college experience. Of course, our professors and deans make certain rules, but we can break them — show up ten minutes late, skip class on Monday or not complete an assignment — and accept the consequences of a slightly lower grade. Short of severe misbehavior, we pretty much call the shots.


That changes the day we collect a paycheck from someone else. Instead of asking, ""What will you do for me?"" we now have to ask ourselves, ""What can I contribute to ensure my employer gets a positive return on their investment?"" This is not to say anyone needs to work 60 hours a week and lose their work-life balance, but it does mean that how we view ourselves as students is not the right lens for us to view ourselves as professionals. Starting from the perspective of how to bring in a return on that paycheck from day one will help jumpstart your career.Work, like college, can be fun in the right environment and with a good leader — like a good professor — who challenges you and gives you clear and transparent directions. This relationship will be critical. Your boss can either promote and champion you or get in your way — building that relationship from day one can help secure your long-term success at a company. Aim to get at least an hour of visibility weekly and create and set mutual expectations. With initiative and the right approach, even right out of college, most of our success is within our grasp.

90,I Use This Surprising Method to Clarify My Ideas — Here's How You Can Try It,"Aug 21, 2023",Sam Saideman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/you-only-need-these-3-things-to-come-up-with-your-best-ideas/456781,"
It's easier than ever to feel lost — lost in the workplace, lost in your personal life, even lost in your overall purpose and mission as a human being. I personally blame a lot of this on social media. It's the perfect concoction for depression, anxiety and the feeling of not knowing what path is right for you.A couple of hours on the Zuckerberg Express (a.k.a. Facebook) and you'll be fed other people's successes so much you'll start to doubt your own. A video of a fix-and-flip specialist will quickly make you think you need to stop what you're working on, buy houses and renovate them yourself. You've never held a hammer and you don't know what HVAC stands for, but if this 30-second video on Instagram taught you anything, it's that the time is now...Excuse my sarcasm, but even as I'm writing, I'm reminded of the ridiculous paths I've gone down thanks to social media. That's a story for another time though. Through exploring and failing on many of these voyages, I've learned a tried and true method to keep me goal-oriented and combat as much of the social media facade as I can: whiteboarding.



Yes, you read that right. Structured and creative time away from all other work and life needs, with just a whiteboard, a marker and your thoughts. In my nine years as a business owner, I've found whiteboarding to be the single strongest tool for fine-tuning my ideas, innovating and niching down. Below are the three biggest rules I use for effective whiteboarding.Related: The Whiteboard Method: 5 Easy Steps to Discover Your Niche and Turn Your Passion Into a Career


1. No erasingBefore you start, remove the eraser from the room. It's so easy to get hyper-critical of what you're writing when you know you can erase it. By operating under the ""no idea is a bad idea"" philosophy, I've been able to discover new revenue streams for my business, fine-tune my goals and more. Not erasing anything is a great way to leave thoughts up on the board for further development. Sometimes an idea I quickly jotted down — that I would've erased in real time — just needed some further tweaking. That idea later became a huge component of my business moving forward.2. Time your whiteboarding sessionsI like to do 20-minute sprints, but find an amount of time that feels comfortable for you. Remember, this exercise is for you. If 20 minutes is too long, do 10. If 20 minutes is too short, do 30. This is your time.Turn a timer on and turn everything else off for whatever amount of time you decide. I like to stand up in front of the board (sometimes even pace) and write as much as my brain and hand will let me. After the allotted 20 minutes, I sit down and spend time reading and digging into each thought. Oftentimes, this is where I'm able to expand a simple thought into something much more developed and fleshed out. If I feel like I hit an ""aha"" moment, I take a photo of the board, then erase and flesh that idea out further. If I didn't, I spend some more time reading and digesting, then I take a photo and get back to my work. Not every time will be one of those euphoric highs we all love about entrepreneurship and finding new ideas, but the simple act of doing this frequently creates clarity.Related: How Journaling Can Make You a Better Entrepreneur and Leader


3. FrequencyI personally do these whiteboard sessions once a week. I've found that to be frequent enough to work through things, but not so frequent to the point of wasting time or energy on the same thoughts over and over. If I'm feeling extra lost that week, rather than adding an extra session, I prefer to jot it down to work on at my next whiteboarding session. Routines are everything.A lot of people talk about the power of whiteboarding in groups for creative brainstorming. I find that to also be an effective way to pull ideas out of a group, but the sessions need to be structured enough to not be a time suck for everyone and the groups need to be small pods before opening them up to bigger teams.When my business partner Ian Rodriguez and I launched Innovo, we'd spend hours behind a whiteboard taking turns workshopping every little detail and idea. Those days were extremely effective for clarifying who we were and what we wanted to accomplish.Once your business is moving you obviously can't spend hours weekly doing those sessions though. In my opinion, the best go-forward strategy I've found here is to whiteboard solo, develop some thoughts and opinions, then bring your partner(s) and team in to take it to the next level. This allows for personal clarity as well as tapping into others' skill sets and ideas.


Ideas are good, but clarity is great. Don't be afraid to challenge yourself through whiteboarding — it's become my secret weapon in entrepreneurship.

91,I'm Very Busy — Yet I Still Have Lots of Free Time. Here are 10 Hacks I Use To Actually Enjoy My Life,"Aug 11, 2023",Ramon Ray,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/10-simple-ways-to-escape-busyness-and-enjoy-free-time/456848,"
I'm a very busy person. Running a startup, being a motivational speaker, leading a 200,000-person community, a father and a husband. I'm also very active in my church. In fact, I did three weeks of volunteer work in July. Your life, I'm guessing, is just as busy.All business owners have very busy lives. However, I've learned a few things that give me unlimited time and space to do what I want and enjoy my life — Enjoy life today, not when I'm ""rich and famous,"" as some people think.I do have seasons of being very, very busy. However, these tips will help you have more freedom in your schedule. Here are a few things that I've mastered and that, if you master them, will help you feel less pressure and more freedom.



1. DelegateIt can be tempting to do everything yourself, but as your business grows, it becomes impossible to handle every task. Learn to delegate tasks to others who are capable of handling them. This frees up your time, empowers your team and allows them to develop new skills. I find that often, when I'm overwhelmed, it's because I'm not giving enough to my time and putting too much on myself.Related: 5 Reasons Why Delegation is a Must for Entrepreneurs


2. Say no!Learn to say no to tasks or projects that don't align with your goals or values. Saying yes to everything can lead to an overcommitted schedule and decreased productivity. Prioritize the tasks that will most significantly impact your business and leave the lower-priority tasks for later.Saying no doesn't have to be rude. You can decline requests with kindness and respect. You can let people know it's not a great time for you now. Saying no is not mean!Related: Learn to Say No to These 3 Things to Take Your Business to New Heights3. Time blockingCreating a schedule and sticking to it can help increase productivity and structure your day. Time blocking is a technique where you divide your day into blocks. Each block is dedicated to a specific task or activity. This method helps you stay focused and prevents distractions from derailing your progress.


4. Don't let emails build-upChecking and responding to emails can take up a significant amount of time. Set aside specific times to read and respond to messages to prevent emails from taking over your day. Try not to let emails pile up, or it can feel overwhelming to catch up.I use filters in email. For example, every email with the word ""unsubscribe"" is automatically sent to my ""read later"" folder. This reduces my in-box email list.Related: The Do's and Don'ts of Email Etiquette5. Schedule free timeAs you schedule work tasks, schedule time to relax and recharge. This could be anything from reading a book to going for a walk. When you schedule time for yourself, it makes it easier to prioritize self-care and prevent burnout.


Related: 10 Incredible TED Talks About Time Management You Should Watch Right Now6. Schedule family and personal timeJust as you prioritize work tasks, prioritize time with your family and loved ones. This could be anything from a scheduled weekly dinner to an annual vacation. Setting aside time for your relationships helps maintain a healthy work-life balance.Wednesday is my ""free time."" It's not always 100% free, but it is when my day is more open, giving me time to think, sleep or simply get more work done!Related: I Took 2 Weeks Off, and My Business Grew. Here's How You Can Also Take a Successful Break


7. PrioritizeMake a list of tasks that need to be completed and prioritize them by importance. Focus on completing the most important tasks before moving on to lower-priority tasks.Once you have your priorities in place, it's time to plan ahead. Create a list of tasks that need to be completed before you leave and establish deadlines for each team member. Make sure to schedule a team meeting if you have any questions or concerns and clarify any expectations.8. Disconnect Turn off your phone and computer when you're not working. Allowing yourself to disconnect from work can help reduce stress and give you more time for leisure activities. Setting boundaries between your professional and personal life helps maintain a healthy balance.9. Take breaksRegular breaks throughout the day help to increase productivity, reduce stress and clear your mind. Taking a few minutes to rest or do something enjoyable can make a difference in your productivity. Just be sure not to get too comfortable and lose track of time during your break.


It sounds counterproductive, but when I'm swamped, I pause and go for a quick walk or sit on the balcony. Mental recharge is important.10. Plan aheadPlan your day, week, month and quarter ahead of time. This helps prevent last-minute emergencies and ensures you allocate enough time for each task. When you plan ahead, you also don't miss important things that need to be done.Being very busy and having a lot of free time does not have to be mutually exclusive.We, busy business owners, can find balance by delegating tasks, saying no, time-blocking, not letting emails pile up, scheduling free time and family time, prioritizing tasks, planning ahead, taking breaks and outsourcing tasks.


Incorporating these disciplines into your daily routine can increase productivity, prevent burnout and enjoy more free time without sacrificing quality work. Remember always to keep yourself and your relationships a priority.

92,I Turned $583 into $10 Million. Here's How I Did It and 5 Lessons I Learned Along the Way,"Aug 4, 2023",Ross Cameron,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-i-turned-583-into-10-million-by-day-trading/456246,"
I won't keep you in suspense: I made $10 million by day trading.That profession is the lightning rod of the investment world. It seems to generate strong opinions from everyone, even if many people have never done it. Hollywood and social media have popularized an inaccurate image of day trading, at least in my experience. They show caffeine-fueled 20-somethings betting the farm on meme stocks — sometimes using their mobile phones to place trades while stopped at red lights.The reality of professional day trading is much different, but first, a bit of backstory. I got into day trading by accident. When I was 22, my father died. A few years later, I received an unexpected inheritance from him for $100,000.



I was an intern at an architectural firm in New York City and had someone manage the inheritance while I got on with my career. Long story short, the Great Recession hit, and I moved back home to Vermont. As I struggled to find meaningful work, I began to wonder if I could generate better investment returns than the pitiful job my ""professional advisor"" was doing.If I was going to make ends meet through investment returns, I realized it would not be from bond income, dividends or a ""buy and hold"" strategy. I needed to invest in stocks that were going places soon.


Suffice it to say that I earned a graduate degree in day trading from the School of Hard Knocks. I had a bit of beginner's luck, followed by giving those profits back and then some. I went through most of my inheritance and was down to the minimum amount necessary to keep a day-trading account open.I was now divorced, and it was me and my dog in a farmhouse. When I wasn't selling my furniture on Craigslist to stay afloat, I searched for patterns in my trades: What did my winning trades have in common, and when did I place losing ones?I identified a few patterns, and the stark financial reality forced me to become highly disciplined at the computer. My trading emotions might sway up and down, but my trading actions had to stay within very narrow guardrails.Related: How Cognitive Biases Can Impact Your Trading and Investment Decisions — and How to Reduce Their Effects


It began to work. I recouped my losses, then built a cushion. Over time I refined my trading principles, but one thing never changed: my losses happened when my emotions took over. The more disciplined I became, the better I did.Professional day traders are a small community, and after a while, I developed a following on social media. I began to hear things like, ""It's cool that you became successful at day trading, but you started with an inheritance. Bet you couldn't do it from scratch.""Related: Day Trading: How To Get StartedI decided to see about that. On January 1, 2017, I opened an offshore account and had $583.15 to trade with after the first month of fees. I went offshore because a day trading account requires a minimum of $25,000 in the US. I decided to report my results — red or green — daily on YouTube.


In 44 days, I broke the $100,000 mark. In a little over two years, I crossed $1 million, and in January 2022, my account surpassed $10 million. I'll be the first to say that my results are not typical. But even if you are not a day trader, you may benefit from several lessons I can derive from this experience.1. It's not for everyoneIt's important to know what not to conclude: that I did fairly well at the challenge does not mean that ""anybody can do it."" Far from it. Day trading is risky. That risk can never be removed; it can only be minimized. I had been trading — winning and losing — for years before I created the challenge. I didn't turn $583 into $10 million by getting lucky. It resulted from following a specific strategy over the course of over 20,000 trades.2. The level of effort to become successful is far from evenYou must put a disproportionate amount of effort into the system at the outset — and be prepared to handle a lot of disappointment, stress and loss — before you can hope to see consistent positive results. You can reduce but not eliminate that learning period by studying and applying what others learned before you.Related: Learn How to Earn Passive Income Through Day Trading and Investments


3. Base hits are underrated in a home-run-focused worldThere's a Home Run Derby in Major League Baseball, but no Base-Hit Derby. Yet I made those millions from sticking to a base-hit strategy. In day-trading terms, a base hit is when you look to make ten or fifteen cents per share on a small-cap trade. That sounds trivially easy, right? Try it. Doing so is much harder than it seems because your emotions often beg you to go big or go home.4. The first results are the hardestThe most difficult part of this challenge was making the first $25,000. Starting with $583, I had so little room for error, and even winning trades would add only a few hundred to that balance. No wonder many people first wash out of this business when the risk-reward ratio seems stacked against you, and you must stay highly disciplined.Related: A Peek Into the World of Trading5. Don't take early profits off the tableBecause those profits are the hardest to come by, resist the temptation to reward yourself. Delay your gratification and let those profits work for you. When your account is high five or six figures, you can reward yourself without hampering your progress. I split my profits into a Roth IRA and other accounts and later moved some money into accounts focused on long-term gains.


Of course, I'm biased, but day trading has taught me to be more disciplined in all aspects of my life. Every day the score resets to zero, and nothing but your actions will determine your results.

93,Why I Ran 48 Miles in 48 Hours to Improve My Business,"Aug 3, 2023",Nicole Bernard,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-i-ran-48-miles-in-48-hours-to-improve-my-business/456111,"
I rolled my eyes so hard that I swear I could hear my mom say, ""They're going to get stuck like that,"" the first time a friend suggested running the 4x4x48 Goggins Challenge back in March of 2022. Why on Earth would I want to run 4 miles every 4 hours for almost 48 hours, equaling a total of 48 miles?""Yes, I'm a runner, but I'm not that kind of runner,"" I thought.But I couldn't shake the feeling deep down. Something in my soul stirred, and as the start date drew closer, I knew I was going to do it (kind of reminds me of the feeling I had when I started my business all those years ago). There would be multiple runs at midnight and 4 a.m. and a boatload of other runs for almost two days straight. It seemed impossible and wild (again, entrepreneurship vibes).



If you're not familiar with David Goggins, you should be. He is a testament to what a human being can truly endure and overcome. His military career is beyond impressive (he is the only person to date who has gone through the Navy Seals' infamous Hell Week three times), as is his daily fight to start from zero and crush his goals.You might not think there are similarities between running a 48-hour running challenge and being an entrepreneur, but there are many!Here are a few that stuck out to me:MindsetSuch an overused term, I know, but in this case, it was true. Like entrepreneurship, it was fun, exciting and kind of easy initially… but things got real fast. When you have to wake up and go run 4 miles at midnight and 4 AM two days in a row, you start to wonder why you started this ridiculous journey.Sound familiar? When business dips, or clients ghost you on your invoices, you start to wonder why you're doing this. Can I go on? Should I go on? Is it worth it? A job with a consistent paycheck (not to mention benefits) sounds just as nice as my warm bed in the middle of the night.But then, you get through it (the runs and the hard times) and realize you're on this journey for a reason!Related: How Spending Time Alone Has Transformed My LifePlanningGood gravy, this challenge had way more planning than I anticipated, much like running a small business!For the challenge, I had to plan out my food (which was honestly one of my favorite parts because I love to eat), find a gym membership in my small town with 24/7 access (I didn't want to run outside in the middle of the night), multiple changes of clothes, a playlist of music and podcasts, schedule around family activities (because it was two days and we still had stuff to do) and the hardest one: how to sleep after running in the middle of the night (you have to figure out to run fast enough to get the torture over with, but also not get your heart rate so high that you would be up all night)!In business, we plan for everything. What is our marketing strategy? How do we balance (another annoying buzzword that I hate but can't find another equivalent) family and business? What are our financial systems? What is our onboarding process? How and when do we bring on an employee, and what does that look like?


This challenge helped me break up planning into compartments, and I could take this same approach to planning in my business. I am a pen-and-paper, write-out-a-to-do list kind of girl, but I realized I could use this experience and create a flowchart in business as I did with the challenge.Related: 10 Growth Strategies Every Business Owner Should KnowGratitudeWhen I finished my last run, I broke down and ugly cried. I don't cry, ask anyone that knows me well, but there were so many emotions. One of the biggest emotions was how grateful I was to finish and that I was even able to do something like this. Sure, the exhaustion might have contributed, but the feeling in my gut was life-changing, and I haven't been the same person or business owner since.We can do hard things, and I was so grateful that I could experience something incredibly hard and realize that I can do so much more than I thought I could. We all can!


I have since learned how to look at hard times, hard clients, hard people, hard anything with gratitude (trust me, not every time) and realize that it will help me somehow. I don't always know how during that time, but usually, I can look back and be grateful for the experience. Gaining that perspective (even most of the time) has helped enormously in both business and life.I would like to encourage (challenge) you to try something hard, whatever that looks like for you.By the way, I have run this challenge two more times since the first time and have a goal to do it multiple times a year because it really brings me back to a mental state that I love and crave now!

94,"So, You've Been Hacked. These are the Best Practices for Business Leaders Post-Hack","Jul 31, 2023",Apu Pavithran,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/been-hacked-these-are-your-next-steps/456066,"
Data is the most valuable asset in today's interconnected world, where ones and zeroes reign supreme. However, securing every last byte of the predicted 181 zettabytes of data that will be consumed by 2025 is a dystopia in and of itself. So, as a business leader, it's not a matter of if but when your organization will face a cyber incident.Immediate financial losses aren't the worst part of a data breach. In fact, the lasting effects are the more troublesome ones. Long-term implications of a data breach spread across a company and impact its reputation, customers, workforce, databases and even its network architecture.How you react following an attack has an enormous influence on the effectiveness of your recuperation efforts and the long-term viability of your organization. In this article, we will explore the essential steps business leaders should take and the pitfalls to avoid in the challenging journey after a hack.



Related: How to Protect Your Customers (and Your Brand) From Data BreachesEssential steps in the wake of a data breachMuch like death and taxes, cyberattacks are now a part of everyday life. By following a prepared strategy, the actions you take can maintain data security, significantly reduce risk and help mitigate some of the fallout.


The first hours and days following a cyberattack are crucial. Unfortunately, in many cases, weeks and months can pass before companies realize they are breached. The sooner you respond, the better your chances of minimizing its impact on your organization. Quickly finding breached endpoints and servers and rapidly segregating them should be prioritized. This strategy prevents lateral movement within the corporate network and hinders dangerous code from infecting further systems.Successful containment brings us to the next phase — assessing the scope of the hack. A major part of efficient recovery depends on knowing how large the breach is. Conduct a thorough investigation to determine what data has been compromised and how it could affect your company's operations. Before restarting operations, do a comprehensive analysis, uncover any vulnerabilities, fix them and ensure all affected systems are secure. Depending on the scope and resources of your in-house IT team, you can either employ vulnerability management tools or engage the expertise of a seasoned cybersecurity firm.Related: Cybercrime Will Cost The World $8 Trillion This Year — Your Money is in Danger. Here's Why Prioritizing Cybersecurity is Crucial to Mitigate RiskPerform a thorough evaluation of your current security protocols, policies and technologies when there is even a slight indication of a breach. Identify any vulnerabilities or loopholes that were exploited during the assault and put strong measures in place to stop similar attacks in the future.


The primary actions to consider here include implementing a Secure Access Service Edge solution (SASE), an Identity Access Management solution (IAM), Endpoint Threat Detection and Response (EDR) cloud security solutions and a combination of Unified Endpoint Management (UEMs) and endpoint security solutions. Regardless of the blend of tools and solutions you choose, the end goal should always be to promote a culture of zero trust in the digital landscape.Employees tend to be the most vulnerable branch of a company's security architecture. Cybercriminals exploit these human vulnerabilities through social engineering and phishing attacks. Reports show that 74% of all attacks last year were instigated due to human error. So, routinely instruct your employees on cybersecurity best practices, highlighting the need to use strong passwords, spot phishing scams and adhere to safe protocols. When executed successfully, employee education is a strong deterrent against future assaults.Like a seasoned gladiator ready for battle, merely arming yourself for the hack is insufficient; you must also be prepared to defend yourself from attacks. Frequently put your crisis response plans to the test and refine them via simulated exercises. Through such drills, you can identify any shortcomings or deficits in your response capabilities and fine-tune the process. A well-trained team can react swiftly and efficiently to reduce the damage brought on by a breach.Critical mistakes to avoid post-hackRecovering from a hack is a strenuous and exhausting endeavor, and there are certain obstacles or pitfalls to avoid that could turn a fiery blaze into a roaring inferno.


The most important thing is that there is no room for denial. Hiding a breach under the rug or downplaying its severity only worsens the situation and builds distrust among stakeholders. Transparency is crucial after a cyberattack. Inform your staff, clients, business partners and the proper authorities as soon as possible about the incident and its severity. It's also important to control your reputation and communicate effectively. Ignoring public relations can have a long-lasting negative effect on your brand and customer loyalty.Another mistake is overlooking the importance of cybersecurity insurance. Cyber insurance is a critical part of any company's risk management strategy. Even companies with robust security systems are susceptible to hacking, and cyber insurance may help shield them from the resulting financial fallout. The global average cost of a single data breach was $4.25 million last year. Compared to that, the cost of a comprehensive insurance policy is only a fraction of that amount.Related: The Top 3 Mistakes Businesses Make After a HackBottom lineA cyberattack is likely to happen to any organization that functions digitally, but how an organization responds to such an incident matters. Successfully navigating the path to recovery helps organizations emerge stronger, more resilient and better prepared to turn victimhood into vigilance. Life following a hack presents an opportunity to grow and fortify your organization against new threats looming over the horizon.

95,"I Started My Business In My Mom's Basement at the Age of 17. Here are 5 Rules I Wish I Had Known, But Had to Learn the Hard Way","Jul 28, 2023",Jon B. Becker,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-hard-lessons-i-learned-as-a-budding-entrepreneur/456191,"
Just before my 18th birthday, I decided to start a business selling mail-order rock-climbing gear. I can still clearly remember the first day I drove to my Post Office Box (yes, this was before the internet) and found orders with checks attached (yes, people used to mail checks). Wait, I thought, I just got out of bed, and there is money waiting for me? I was hooked.Little did I know that this tiny business I started in my mom's den would grow into one of the tactical equipment industry's leaders and provide me with a lifelong passion that would feed my family and hundreds of others. While the business has evolved in many ways over the past almost four decades, one thing has remained constant. Every year I run a larger and more complicated enterprise and — in the process — stretch my leadership skillset to its limits.Over the years, perhaps the most frequent question I receive from strangers is a variant of ""What do you know now that you wish you knew when you started AARDVARK?"" Although there is not a single lesson learned, five lessons (learned through errors and pain) would have been very valuable when I was a budding entrepreneur.



Related: Want Excellence? Embrace Strong PersonalitiesRule 1 — It is not about you!As a new business owner or a new leader, it is very easy to fancy yourself important. Moving up the chain in an organization or supervising others tends to make us prideful, and we begin to value ourselves a little bit too much.


There is no easy way to break this to you, you are the least important person in your business! The order of importance is very simple: Your people, your clients, then you. The people who work for you are the most important people to your business and require the most attention. Take care of them before anyone else. While it is easy to believe the customer is always right, without your people, there won't be a customer.Never let your people be mistreated; focus on keeping them happy and safe first. Your clients or customers are the next most important. They are why you have a business and need to be treated that way. Focus on their happiness and care about them. If you don't, they will leave. If you do, they will be loyal to you for your career. There is a great book called Leaders Eat Last by Simon Sinek. Read it, learn it, and live it. It's not just a metaphor. It's a way of life. You should always be the last person to eat, both literally and figuratively.Related: How Leaders Can Create a Company Culture that Prioritizes Mental Health


Rule 2 – You must have a higher purpose than making moneyMaking money is the reason we all start a business. We see someone doing something poorly or we see an unmet need and think, ""I will be rich!"" This impulse drives us to take the risks needed to create a business or take on a new job. While this is a necessary step on the road to success, it is not sufficient to create success. Money is not as strong a motivator as you would think. Sure, you are driven towards it when you don't have it.But money is a very short-term and very fickle purpose. Money does not motivate the passion and dedication needed to create a successful team. It turns out that for almost all people, doing something to help other people is what they really care about and what will really motivate them.It took me many years to figure this out. For years I chased money and wondered why it was so difficult to catch. Somewhere along the route, I accidentally discovered passion and purpose in what I do. By passion, I mean a true desire to help other people. In my case, military and law enforcement tactical operators.Rather than being driven by trying to sell things and make money, I began to see myself as driven to ensure the safety of other people. Now, almost 40 years later, long after money stopped being a driver, my fire still burns bright. More importantly, the fire that burns inside me engulfs others to help the mission. It makes my teammates work hard, it makes them care about what they do, and it makes them spend their own time thinking about how we can protect our clients.


Ironically, it is also the best marketing tool we have. Caring about your clients resonates with them emotionally. It is literally the thing that attracts clients to the business and keeps them there. So, if you cannot articulate your team's purpose in a single sentence, it is time for a reassessment. In the words of Einstein, ""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.""Related: Why Making Money Shouldn't Be Your Only Goal in LifeRule 3 — Hire people, not qualificationsEarly on in my career, I had the opportunity to hire a ""superstar"" sales guy away from a competitor. He was demanding more money than I wanted to pay, but the idea of not only growing my business but also hurting my competitor was too attractive.The problem was, I didn't like him. He was condescending and, quite frankly, kind of a jerk. I was very concerned that he would hurt the business, but in the end, he was highly qualified, and the sirens song of harming a competitor was too strong, so I hired him. Bad decision!


Related: 6 Steps for Hiring the Right People to Build Effective TeamsTrading company culture for qualifications is a terrible deal. It wasn't long before we knew I had made a terrible decision. While he certainly was good at sales, everyone hated him. He was a morale cancer, and it was clear I screwed up chasing qualifications rather than culture. As a result, when I caught him standing over a female coworker seated at her desk, with his finger in her face yelling at her, it was clear his days with us were ending.But, the damage was done; I had violated Rule #1, traded my people's happiness for sales and traded a great deal of my credibility with my people in the process. Remember that you are building a team and not a resume. Culture trumps everything! Do not hire people based on their qualifications; hope it will work out. Hire people who fit your culture and also happen to be qualified. If you have to choose between culture and skills, pick culture every time! You can train people to do a job. You cannot train them to be good people.Related: Why I Don't Hire People Who Do Their Job


Rule 4 - Fix the problem, not the blameAs a young leader, I was very focused on ensuring the people who worked for me did exactly what I wanted them to do. I micromanaged everything, and I made sure I knew who was at fault when an error occurred. I viewed mistakes as the result of individual inattention that had to be fixed with blaming and atonement. I looked at shame as a tool that leads to better behavior.This was partly because I was inexperienced and partly because I did not understand how business processes and systems work. No matter what the industry is, preventing errors is done through a system. A system that trains people not to make errors, checks to ensure they are not making errors and finally uses errors or near misses as opportunities for improvement. To accomplish this, everyone must be comfortable sharing their mistakes and preventing future errors must be a group effort.Error prevention is not an individual thing, it is a group effort. As a leader, when errors in the system occur, they are your responsibility and not your team's. Don't get caught up in trying to decide who made the mistake. When a mistake is made (assuming it is not an intentional act or an act of carelessness), it is the result of your failing to train adequately or a system that failed to mitigate the risk of error properly.Stop worrying about who did it and prevent it from happening again! Bad employees will still stick out, and your team usually identifies them before you can. Create an environment that allows for truthful recognition of issues, not where people go into hiding every time an error occurs.


Related: Leaders: Stop Micromanaging and Do This InsteadRule 5 — Your job is to get the right answer, not supply it!Perhaps the greatest mistake I made as a young leader was the belief that I had to be the source of answers for every question. I think I probably felt like the fact that I was in charge meant I had to be the smartest guy in the room. As a result, I often failed to harness all of the amazing brain power available to me through employees, clients and friends.After all, when you are the leader and appoint yourself the source of all answers, no one will question that authority, and in turn, you will silence your available resources. Steve Jobs once reportedly said, ""It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to do. We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.""Truer words were never spoken. Your job as a leader is to harness all your resources to find the best solution to any problem. The feeling that you are the smartest person in the room is rooted either in ego/arrogance or insecurity and fear of being found out to be an imposter.


In either of these cases, you are not helping the team you lead. I now see my role as a curator of information and resources. If I am good at my job, I have a lot of resources available to me and am more likely to get to the right place. If we succeed, it is because my team found the right answer. If we fail, it is because I failed to uncover the right solution. If this feels awkward, please see Rule 1 above, ""it's not about you!""ConclusionIt has been nearly four decades since I proudly told my mom I'd be starting a business in her house. Through that time and hundreds of millions of dollars in business, I can honestly say I learned some painful lessons. Some of these were financially painful, some just embarrassing and others both. But, the five discussed above were by far the most lasting. As the old saying goes, ""If I had I known then what I know now,"" it would have genuinely made a difference in how I ran my business and conducted my life.

96,"How to Harness the Remarkable Power of a ""To Don't"" List","Jul 21, 2023",Jason Zickerman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-you-need-a-to-dont-list-to-be-a-great-leader/455394,"
Are you one of those business owners who tend to create a never-ending stream of to-do lists? Maybe you even draw those little squares next to each task and feel a bit of a dopamine rush each time you check off another box.To-do lists are such simple but effective task tools for busy entrepreneurs. Of course, in today's digital world, you might not be putting pen to yellow pad, opting instead for a scheduling or time management application. Whether high-tech or old-school, to-do lists serve a very important purpose in the life of an active business owner. They keep us on track, on task and on time.Many of the more organized folks among us carve out time each evening to plot the coming day and prepare their to-do lists accordingly. However, that level of systematic mapping is not for everyone. Many successful people I know maintain a remarkable to-do list in their heads and tackle these tasks as they have the time. The reality is, in one form or another, all business owners have a running to-do list. And those lists can be overwhelming at times.



That is the dirty little secret about to-do lists. While they might feel comforting in that they allow us to gauge our progress related to our pending tasks, they mask the fact that many of those activities have no business being on that list in the first place. And when I say many, I really mean most.So perhaps it is time for a different kind of list.Related: 3 Traits Every Successful Entrepreneur Should HaveYou're not supposed to do it allI had a wonderful associate at The Alternative Board, the late great Steve Davies. He was in the office one day and noticed that I was drowning in an endless sea of tasks; my exhausting to-do list was truly unrelenting. I will never forget how Steve looked me straight in the eye, pointed at my list and said, ""As the CEO of a global organization, you shouldn't be doing half of those things."" I knew he was right, but nobody had ever mentioned it before.Steve helped me to get things under control by insisting I put together what he called a To Don't List. He made it really simple. And it was a pivotal moment in my leadership journey.Creating a To Don't listSteve explained that I should keep a piece of paper or notepad in the top drawer of my desk. Then came the self-awareness part. He said that whenever I caught myself doing a task that I probably should not be doing, or that could be done more efficiently by someone else, I needed to pull out that sheet of paper and write the task down.


I want to be clear here. The items added to my To Don't List were not there because they were below my pay grade. They were not beneath me. They were simply tasks to which I didn't add any particular value and prevented me from executing higher-level strategic objectives for the organization. So they were prime candidates for delegation.Then it was time for some reflection. Once a week or so, I was to review that list and pick one or two items just to stop doing. It was scarier and felt a little more daring than it sounds. I asked myself, who could do this better? Someone internally? Should it be outsourced? Or perhaps the task held such little value that it should be eliminated.This was a big step in the right direction. Slowly but surely, my To Don't List allowed me to spend less time on the things that weren't really important and more time on the things that required my attention. Throughout the years, it has helped me increase my productivity tremendously.Related: You Don't Have to Go It Alone. It's Time to Let Go and Let Others Help.


Tasks for your To Don't listEvery business owner is different, as is what is required of them to run a thriving company. But here are some common items you might consider as prime candidates for your own To Don't List.Administrative Tasks: Particularly if you have a secretary or executive assistant, consider delegating the preponderance of scheduling and routine paperwork to someone else.Daily Ops: Unless yours is a small business that lacks the staff to conduct day-to-day operations, like inventory or order processing, leave those tasks to your team – and refrain from micromanaging them while you are at it.Technology Troubleshooting & Maintenance: If you have an IT team, consider them your resident experts. They likely don't need substantial input at a technical level, although you are likely still required strategically.


Routine Decision-Making: Your organization needs your vision. They need your leadership. What they don't need is for you to oversee every minor decision — delegate decision-making authority to trusted managers.Employee Supervision: It is not your responsibility to babysit your team. They are professionals who are capable of performing their jobs without you breathing down their necks, so let them.I sometimes wonder if my colleague Steve realized how positively and profoundly his simple advice on creating a To Don't List affected me as a business leader.I hope it works for you too.

97,3 Productivity Tips That Turned Me Into a Multimillionaire,"Jul 18, 2023",Samuel Leeds,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/3-productivity-tips-that-turned-me-into-a-multimillionaire/455236,"
Whether you are a business owner or an entrepreneurially-minded employee, staying motivated and productive is the key to success. If you can keep going when everyone else gives up, you will automatically have an advantage. But it can be hard to stay productive, especially when you are not seeing results yet. That's why it is important to cultivate the right mindset. If you have the correct mindset, everything quickly falls into place from there.As a self-made millionaire, I have mastered remaining productive and expanding my business. This has helped me to grow my company and my property portfolio massively. In this article, I will give you three productivity lessons that have helped me grow my wealth. Hopefully, these lessons will also help you increase your net worth!Related: 10 Things I've Learned In 10 Years of Running My Own Business



1. Overcome a fear of failureA lot of procrastination is really just a fear of failure. If you don't try, it isn't as psychologically damaging when you don't succeed. That's why many people don't get very far in business or even get their projects off the ground. Therefore, you need to find a way to overcome this fear. If you can overcome a fear of failure, you will become hundreds of times more productive.There are two parts to overcoming this fear. The first is mindset, and the second is becoming more competent. You need to fix how you feel about failing, but you also need to make failure less likely. If you are able to do both of these things, the business world becomes a whole lot easier and more comprehensible.


To fix your mindset, you need to view your attempts as practical lessons. If you try something that doesn't work, you learn something. The more times you try, the more you learn. If you learn from each attempt, you get closer to succeeding each time. View each attempt as a lesson, not a failure.That said, if you don't know what you are doing, your attempts may not get closer to success very fast. You need a model to follow. Most things have been done by others before you, there is no reason to reinvent the wheel. Engage in continual education and training to have the best chance of winning.Related: The Real Reason You Procrastinate and Expert Strategies to Overcoming It2. Do what actually mattersThere is a lot of 'busy work' that people engage in, particularly when they are just starting out in business. They get business cards printed, commission a logo and try to have the most flashy website possible. But when you are just starting, you should be all about getting some customers! The details can be worked out later, get some cash flow first.


As your business grows, you will find that some tasks grow the business while others produce little in the way of return. Don't be afraid to ruthlessly cut out the tasks that aren't working for you and your company. Focus your energy on the things that are showing the best returns, and avoid doing things simply because everyone else in your industry is.Once you know what works and what doesn't, choose the jobs you like to do and outsource the rest, it is a lot easier to be productive if you are doing the things you enjoy. Hire people that enjoy doing the things you hate doing. Importantly, as you started out doing these jobs yourself, you will have a good idea of what is possible. This means that you will be able to tell if staff and contractors are doing a good job or underperforming.Related: 7 Ways to Boost Your Weekly Productivity3. Be around other productive peopleProcrastination becomes second nature if you are in a room with people who are all happy with their lot in life and have no ambition. If you are around go-getters, you won't want to be the only one going nowhere. Choose the right people to be around to keep yourself motivated. Find your tribe of people heading to the same place as you.


You need people that are way ahead of you to aspire to. You need people that are a little ahead of you to guide you. But you also need people at your level with the same level of drive as you. The latter group are your friends and peers that will keep you going day-to-day. Make them a part of your life in a big way.People that hold you back must be let go. If your friends want you to waste time with them rather than focus on your business, you have to let them go. If your friends want to keep you at their level, you have to let them go. This is the hard part, but it is necessary if you want to achieve great things in life.

Prior to the hack in May 2015, Biderman told the BBC that he started the website to normalize infidelity. At the time, he was on a mission to take his company public (which didn't end up happening) after allegedly generating $150 million in revenue from subscriptions to the site the year prior.RELATED: Marriott Just Got Hit By Another Data Breach—For At Least the 7th Time Since 2010Prior to generating millions in revenue, Ashley Madison rose in recognition for its aggressive marketing efforts, according to Vox. In 2009, the website caused a stir for trying to buy a Super Bowl ad. Although it was rejected, the ad went viral on YouTube.At the time of the hack, Ashleymadison.com was owned by Canada-based parent company Avid Life Media, which acquired Ashley Madison in 2007. That year, Biderman was appointed president and CEO of Avid Life. The parent company also owned several other websites that allowed people to indulge in fantasies. 


What Happened When Ashley Madison Was Hacked?On July 19, 2015, a hacking group called the ""Impact Team"" released a statement explaining they had hacked Ashley Madison and retrieved millions of pieces of confidential information. The group threatened to publish the data if the website was not deleted in 30 days.The news was first reported by technology journalist Brian Krebs on his website Krebsonsecurity.com. According to the statement, which Krebs obtained, the hackers said that Ashley Madison ""profits on the pain of others"" and shared alleged company secrets, including that the ""Full Delete"" feature, which was supposed to scrub a users history on the website for a fee, was not doing what it promised.""Full Delete netted ALM $1.7mm in revenue in 2014. It's also a complete lie,"" the hacking group said. ""Users almost always pay with credit card; their purchase details are not removed as promised, and include real name and address, which is, of course, the most important information the users want removed.""RELATED: I'm a Business News Editor, and Even I Fell Victim to an Online Scam That Cost Me $300


If Ashley Madison didn't comply with the hacker's demands, they threatened to release ""all customer records, including profiles with all the customers' secret sexual fantasies and matching credit card transactions, real names and addresses, and employee documents and emails.""After no movement from Ashley Madison, the hackers went ahead and published 9.7 gigabytes of data from 36 million users on the dark web on August 18, 2015.The hack released personal information and credit card history, including 15,000 government email addresses, Wired reported at the time. Additionally, the hackers alleged that the connections made on the website were fake and the work of bots.""We have explained the fraud, deceit, and stupidity of ALM and their members,"" the hackers said, per Wired. ""Now everyone gets to see their data.... Keep in mind the site is a scam with thousands of fake female profiles. See Ashley Madison fake profile lawsuit; 90-95% of actual users are male. Chances are your man signed up on the world's biggest affair site, but never had one. He just tried to. If that distinction matters.""


Avid Life Media denounced the hackers in a statement after the attack and proceeded to cooperate with police. Despite offering a $500,000 reward in Canadian currency (equal to $380,000 U.S. at the time), no one has been charged in connection to the hack to this day.RELATED: A Retired Teacher and Her Daughter Were Scammed Out of $200,000 Over Email: 'I'm 69 Years Old and Now I'm Broke and Homeless'Who Was on the Ashley Madison List and What Celebrities Were Called Out? When people's names were revealed, news outlets struggled with the ethics of reporting who exactly was on the list. However, The Guardian reported that politicians, priests, military members, civil servants, and celebrities were among the hundreds of public figures named for having Ashley Madison members.The aftermath of the hack cost lives.


Two people died by suicide after being outed for their participation on the platform, Reuters reported at the time. Additionally, CNN reported that a pastor and professor at New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, John Gibson, took his life after he was exposed on the website. He was 56 years old.Josh Duggar, whose greatly religious family was known for their hit TLC show ""19 Kids and Counting,"" was called out for paying nearly $1,000 for two Ashley Madison accounts from 2013 to 2015. He married his wife Anna in 2008.""I have been the biggest hypocrite ever. While espousing faith and family values, I have secretly over the last several years been viewing pornography on the internet and this became a secret addiction and I became unfaithful to my wife,"" he said in a statement at the time, according to the International Business Times.Despite his infidelity and later his child pornography prison sentence, he and Anna are still married.RELATED: Avoid Falling Victim to a Remote Job Scam With These Expert TipsOther notable names exposed in the hack were Christian blogger Sam Rader, Casey Anthony prosecutor and Florida state attorney Jeff Ashton, and Josh Taekman, husband to former Real Housewives of New York star Kristen Taekman.""I signed up for the site foolishly and ignorantly with a group of friends and I deeply apologize for any embarrassment of pain I have brought to my wife and family,"" Taekman said in a statement at the time. ""We both look forward to moving past this and getting on with our lives."" The Taekmans are still married.Founder Noel Biderman wasn't safe from the hack, either. The leak included three years of stolen emails from Biderman exposing his extramarital affairs. He had previously denied participating in his own website, Krebs on Security reported.He resigned from his position as CEO in August 2015.


Where Is Ashley Madison Now? In the months and years following the attack, many of those exposed have been the target of extortion emails. In some cases, the emails revealed personal information and demanded $1,000 in Bitcoin as ransom, according to Forbes.After Biderman resigned as CEO, he was replaced by Rob Segal as CEO and James Millership as president in April 2016, per The New York Times. They later changed the name of the parent company Avid Life Media to Ruby Corp.Together they ramped up damage control, including highering outside help to secure their website from future attacks and publicly stating their no-bot policy.Additionally, they were investigated by the FTC and hit with a slew of lawsuits. In December 2016, the FTC found that Ashley Madison deceived its customers and failed to protect its users, a press release stated at the time. They were ordered to pay a $1.6 million settlement.

In 2016 the website had 45 million subscribers and brought in $80 million in revenue, per NYT.In 2017, Paul Keable stepped up as Ruby Corp CEO, which he still holds today. He said that the website reached 65 million subscribers in 2019 during a March 2020 interview with Venture Beat. Additionally, he said the website received 17,000 new subscribers a day during the throws of the COVID-19 pandemic.

99,Is the Law of Attraction Really the Secret to Business Success?,"May 9, 2023",Murali Nethi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-successful-people-use-the-law-of-attraction/450670,"
At some point in your life, you may have heard someone say, ""If you think you can do it, then you can do it."" While these platitudes are well-intended and meant to help, their simple, positive message can help us overcome fears and self-doubt that can be limiting.This idea is a form of manifestation, which is based on the notion that by having a clear vision and focusing on it through various manifestation methods, you can attract your dreams into your life. However, is it really possible to achieve our dreams just by thinking positively and chanting about them? Well, let's find out.Related: If You're Working Hard Without Seeing Results, This Common Misconception Might Be Holding You Back



Breakdown of the law of attractionThe law of attraction is one of the 12 universal laws of hermetic philosophy and was popularized by Rhonda Byrne's self-help book ""The Secret."" The general idea is that what you think about and contribute to the world is what you get back. The thoughts and energy you emit from your mind act as a magnet, attracting similar vibrations and returning them to you.This idea is not new, as many religions and belief systems have long adopted the idea that our thoughts and actions have consequences. The law of attraction is a modern twist on this, but it is based on similar ideas.


The power of positive thinkingThe power of positive thinking should never be underestimated. Our mindset determines how we see the world and take advantage of opportunities. In general, people spend more time around others who bring out positive emotions in them. And research shows that people with a positive mindset are more productive, creative, and better at problem-solving than their peers.However, being optimistic and upbeat all the time is not easy. Changing the way you think and feel requires hard work to modify both your conscious and subconscious mind. The more you train yourself to think positively, the more natural it will become. Achieving your dreams is possible, but first, you have to believe.Related: Harnessing the Power of Positive Thinking to Grow Your BusinessHow to start manifestingSometimes it's hard to look ahead, especially when we're constantly dealing with work, bills, family, and our thoughts. But planning for the future, and getting excited about it, is good for our mental health. When the world seems unpredictable, it is important to maintain a flexible perspective and remain adaptable to change.


Fortunately, many effective manifestation techniques help you focus on where you want to be in the future. Here are some ways to get started:Remove the blocks on the wayBefore diving into manifesting your business, you must first remove any limiting beliefs, fears, doubts, or self-sabotaging behaviors that may hold you back. These blocks prevent you from seeing any results, even if you feel like you're hustling 24/7. You must overcome these challenges to create an abundant, profitable and successful business.A money mindset is a key factor in this stage. Your attitude towards money, the language you use, and your feelings towards it can significantly impact your business's profitability. You need to tackle your mindset issues, such as your fear of success, self-doubt and comparison to others, so you can focus on taking inspired action toward your business goals.Related: Why Is My Manifesting Not Working? 3 Crucial Misconceptions About Manifesting and ""The Law of Attraction""


Create your bold visionOnce you have cleared the blocks on your way, you can move on to creating your bold vision. This step involves being honest about the kind of business you want, how it will contribute to your lifestyle, and how you can help others. You need to understand why you want these things and imagine your daily life when you have achieved them.Your vision needs to be as real for you right now as the goals you've already achieved. To achieve this, you need to get into the vibrational frequency that will attract that reality and keep it. If you want to stay focused on your goals for your business, you can make a vision board. This board can have pictures, quotes, and numbers representing what you want to achieve. It's like a visual reminder of your aspirations and helps you stay motivated. You can also place affirmations in visible places at home, journal on living the life you'll have once your business is profitable, and practice guided meditation, hypnosis, or EFT tapping.Choose only what feels alignedIn creating your vision, it's essential to note that there will be opportunities that may come your way that are not aligned with your vision. You need to rely on your intuition to make the right decisions for your business. Saying no to most of these opportunities is crucial to show the universe that you have high standards and will only accept what aligns with your new vision.It's easy to get distracted by shiny objects, such as quick ways to make money or get new clients, collaborations, new business ideas, and people or strategies that promise wild results in no time. Remember that you don't get your highest desires; you get your minimum standards. Focus your energy on activities that will lead to living the best life you can imagine.


Don't chase, attractAs an entrepreneur, it's easy to fall into the trap of chasing clients or customers to grow your business. However, the power of manifestation lies in attracting what you want instead of chasing it. You need to release your offer and trust that the right people will come to you. This involves aligning your energy and intention with your vision, so the universe can bring opportunities to you.You can practice gratitude and visualization to align your energy with your vision. Visualize already achieving your business goals, and feel grateful for it. You can also release resistance and negative energy by practicing meditation or EFT tapping.To attract the right opportunities, you must learn how to attract rather than chase. With patience and perseverance, you can manifest your dream business and live the life you've always wanted.

100,Why Embracing Change is the Best Catalyst for Growth,"May 2, 2023",Nancy Solari,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-embracing-change-is-the-best-catalyst-for-growth/450192,"
It's the human condition to find comfort. I like to pour a cup of tea, pull a blanket around my shoulders and relax on my comfortable couch. But the truth is that change is always on the horizon, and learning to sense the shift is an important part of growing up. If we can discern the changes coming our way, we can prepare and respond rather than react to the shock of a sudden new reality. There are three ways that change enters our lives; understanding how to embrace it can help us prepare for the road ahead.Understanding the seasonsWe are not set up to love change. I can remember several times when I was snuggled up on the couch with my guide dog, enjoying the fireplace, and there was a knock at my door. Something in me rebelled against getting up from my comfortable spot to meet someone else's immediate needs. I've learned that change doesn't have to come as a shock; if we take the time to read the patterns, we can sense that something new is on the way. Understanding the seasons is the key to responding rather than reacting.I have learned to see relationships through every season, wins and losses, peace and conflict, following the threads to the end of the rope if need be. I don't judge a person on who they are in a rough patch. I've had several relationships that spanned years. At the first-year point, I always evaluate the person, who we are together, where they are in life, and what they're dealing with. I look at what I'm going through and whether we resonate.



The real person never changes: their ""stuff,"" their self-sabotage or self-centeredness, will come out. In life, so many connections are not permanent bonds, but they are lasting, in spirit, if not in fact. So much of who we are is the part of ourselves we invested in the relationship. But when there's no more rope to hold onto, we can let go.Related: 4 Ways Leaders Can Navigate Change and Find the Hidden Opportunities


Finding our placeWhen I first moved to Los Angeles, I didn't know much about the difference between the valley experience and beach life. It took a leap of faith to get there, but that move was only the beginning. I lived in thirteen different cities in Los Angeles. Like most newcomers, I initially moved to the more affordable Valley: I tried Cold Water Canyon, Valley Village and Rosita. I was trying to find my place, my neighborhood. Nothing felt right.One day I decided I wanted to live near the beach, which was expensive, but I found a roommate. It wasn't the greatest neighborhood. I lived in Venice, Marina Del Ray, then Redondo Beach. It took some time to find the right spot. It turned out that Huntington Beach was for me. As I moved, I discovered more of who I was and where I fit into California life: Venice was too hippy; Santa Monica was lovely but not quite right. Some beaches were congested, others a concrete jungle. I settled on Huntington Beach because it had a hometown feel. There were parades, fireworks and fun. All ages were welcome. I kept evolving through several pivots, and that's okay. I kept going until I found my way home.Related: Embracing Change and Failure to Succeed in BusinessEmbracing our timeI graduated with a degree in broadcasting and psychology from the University of Oregon in 1998. I had worked production on shows such as Good Morning, America and Entertainment Tonight, but I had never had my own show. When Living Full Out, Inc. was created in 2008, we started with coaching and speaking. I had just received my life coach certificate when a program director from KFWB in Los Angeles called me. The station was looking to change the format from sports to motivation. They had Les Brown doing a show for the weekday slot, and they wanted me to do a weekend show. The program director had heard about me through the Life-Coaching school - iPEC -- the Institute for Professional Excellence in Coaching. The radio executives sensed the winds had shifted, and they needed to make a change. Their decision altered the course of my career, but I had to recognize the shift in my own atmosphere and seize the moment.


It was the first incarnation of what is now the national Living Full Out Radio Show. It didn't come without cost -- a thousand dollars to be on the air. I found two sponsors to pay the bill, leaning on the companies whose services and products I had used for my visual impairment. I'll never forget sitting in the executive chair with the boom mic in front of me, hearing the well-produced intro with music leading up to the show and the announcer's voice saying, ""Here's Nancy.""It's our human nature to resist change, but it's important to have ""pivoting"" in our toolkit as a way of embracing the shifts that come with life. If we can understand the need for exploration and discovery through change, discern the seasons, and seize the day, we can live a fulfilling life in which we can be wholly ourselves. The hardest part of embracing change is overcoming our fears. When we silence the ""What-ifs"" and fine-tune our decision-making process, who knows what opportunities lie around the corner?

101,You Have to Lead Yourself Before You Can Lead Others — How to Master the Art of Self-Leadership,"Apr 27, 2023",Roland Polzin,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-master-the-art-of-leading-yourself/449857,"
Self-leadership is about more than just being able to lead yourself. It involves taking care of yourself to optimize your personal and professional life, recognizing personal values and aligning them with business goals, organizing yourself, and being your best self.Entrepreneurs are constantly on the go. Since we work long hours, we can get lost in the demands of the business and need to remember to take care of ourselves. However, self-care is crucial in self-leadership. When business leaders don't practice self-care, they become overwhelmed and burnt out, which means a decrease in productivity, creativity, and overall happiness.Related: Why Self-Leadership is Essential to Your Success



Know yourself and your purposeBecoming aware of your thoughts and emotions can be challenging, but with practice, it becomes easier. Meditation and journaling are tried and tested ways of becoming self-aware. By practicing meditation and writing down your thoughts, you can learn to observe your thoughts and emotions without judgment, leading to greater self-awareness and insights into your behavior.Once you have identified your values and purpose, you can align them with your business goals. This alignment leads to greater fulfillment and success in personal and professional life.


Related: 6 Ways Self-Leadership Can Help You Take Control of Your Life and BusinessTake care of yourselfLeaders and entrepreneurs prioritizing their physical and mental health can perform at their best and lead more effectively. Self-care is not a luxury. Leaders and entrepreneurs who prioritize self-care set an example for their team and create a culture of well-being. Moreover, taking care of yourself leads to greater productivity, creativity, and resilience, allowing you to perform at your best.When you ride a plane, one of the safety instructions is always ""put your mask on first before helping others."" The same is true in business. Leaders and entrepreneurs prioritizing their physical and mental health can better serve their teams and customers. Physical fitness means higher energy levels, reduced risk of illness, and better stress regulation. Regular exercise, healthy eating, and adequate rest are the foundations of being physically fit.Mental well-being is just as important as physical health. Leaders and entrepreneurs prioritizing mental health can better manage stress, think more clearly, and make better decisions.


There are many strategies for self-care, and it is essential to find what works best for you. For one, there are plenty of ways to keep fit — you can participate in team sports, lift weights at the gym or walk for a few miles during the day.Healthy eating — planning meals and eating whole foods — is equally essential in keeping yourself healthy. Finally, getting enough sleep and scheduled downtime can help your stress management.Stress is a part of life, and chronic stress can lead to burnout. Fortunately, business leaders prioritizing stress management can prevent burnout and maintain well-being.Related: How Self-Leadership Can Help Move The Needle Forward On Your Vision And Goals


Organize yourselfOrganized leaders manage their time effectively, prioritize tasks and make better decisions. By being organized, we set an example for our teams and create a culture of efficiency and effectiveness.Setting goals can help you stay focused and motivated. Goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound. Once you have goals, you can create a schedule that helps you accomplish all your weekly tasks.Prioritization is crucial for managing time effectively. You can prioritize tasks by assessing the urgency and importance of each task, delegating tasks when possible, and breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable ones. Creating a schedule can help you manage your time effectively and avoid procrastination. You can create a schedule by blocking time for specific tasks, breaks, and even your leisure time.Avoiding distractions is also vital. Distractions can derail productivity and waste time. You can prevent distractions by turning off notifications, setting aside time for specific tasks, and utilizing productivity tools like the Pomodoro technique.


Be your best selfBeing your best self is a critical aspect of self-leadership. Leaders and entrepreneurs who strive to be their best selves can create a positive work environment, build strong relationships with their teams, and achieve their goals. Effective self-leaders possess certain qualities, like punctuality, honesty, openness, and consistency. These qualities are essential for developing a high-trust relationship with teams since they make you predictable as a leader: Being punctual demonstrates respect for others' time and shows a commitment to professionalism. Meanwhile, honesty and openness will prove that you have no hidden agenda and everyone is on the same page. Finally, consistency in behavior and decision-making builds a stable work environment without negative surprises.Finally, supporting team members can create a culture of positivity and productivity. Leaders and entrepreneurs should provide resources, guidance, and feedback to team members when necessary. This goes both ways, though—building a support system of mentors, peers, and friends provides a positive feedback loop of guidance, motivation, and continuous learning.Self-leadership is a habitSelf-leadership is not a one-off activity but a habit needing consistent practice. It is also crucial for optimizing your personal and professional life. Practicing self-care, knowing yourself and your purpose, organizing yourself, and being your best self are all essential components of self-leadership. By making self-leadership a habit, leaders and entrepreneurs can increase their productivity, creativity, and overall happiness, leading to more success in their personal and professional lives.

102,6 Time Management Hacks to Regain Your Energy,"Apr 24, 2023",Tugba Yanaz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/6-hacks-to-manage-your-time-and-regain-your-energy/449677,"
The way we work has changed forever. According to recent research by Zippia, 74% of U.S. companies are using or planning to implement a permanent hybrid work model. This trend is forcing leaders to enhance their time-management skills to survive the new ways of working.While flexibility and the comfort of working from home can be exciting, leaders increasingly suffer from unintended challenges, on the edge of burnout. Before the pandemic, physically separate workspaces and commuting to and from the office helped many employees separate work-life and home life.Unfortunately, after two years of telework, many leaders have filled their commute time with additional to-do's and responsibilities, increasing mental exhaustion. When work and life blend into each other without physical structures, the discipline of building healthy boundaries falls back to a leader's will and resilience. Establishing and sticking to healthy boundaries is vital for everyone's mental, physical and emotional well-being.



In my coaching and consulting practice, I work with leaders to create healthy routines to optimize their performance and well-being.One fundamental behavior to help create healthy boundaries for leaders is their ability to control their calendars. Here are six strategies you can apply to detox your calendar and regain your energy.


Related: 18 Proven Ways to Stay Focused That Increase Productivity1. Protecting your calendar is protecting your energy.In an article for the Harvard Business Review, Tony Schwartz and Catherine McCarthy talk about the importance of paying attention to your energy levels and needs and scheduling your life around those. They write, ""Defined in physics as the capacity to work, energy comes from four main wellsprings in human beings: the body, emotions, mind, and spirit. In each, energy can be systematically expanded and regularly renewed by establishing specific rituals—behaviors that are intentionally practiced and precisely scheduled, with the goal of making them unconscious and automatic as quickly as possible.""They explain that people ""need to recognize the costs of energy-depleting behaviors and then take responsibility for changing them, regardless of the circumstances they're facing.""So what does this look like in practice? Say you have a long, somewhat taxing meeting scheduled for the afternoon. That means that, in the morning before, you commit to going out for a refreshing walk in nature, eating a healthy lunch and attending the meeting prepared and attentive.


Consider the habits and rituals that recharge you. It could be yoga. It could be cooking a meal with your significant other or as simple as getting a good night's sleep. Make sure you integrate these recharging rituals into your life to keep your energy reserves full for when you need them most.Related: 5 Proven Habits to Create Success in Business and in Life2. Understand your body's rhythm and adjust your calendar to your mental, emotional and physical needsThis consideration goes along with the first point. Part of preserving your energy levels entails getting to know your personal habits. Are you a morning person or a night owl? How many hours of sleep do you typically require each night to feel rested and ready for the day? During which hours of the day are you most productive?Once you have created a personal profile of needs and habits, you can create a calendar based on your peak performance times. Not the most energized first thing in the morning? Consider using that time to complete less mentally taxing tasks like responding to simple emails.


Related: 10 Time Management Tips That Work3. Prioritize your to-do listWe all have a million things to tackle at any point, which can lead to serious overwhelm. To get a handle on your To-Do's, use the Eisenhower Matrix, i.e., the Urgent-Important Matrix. This is a way of breaking down your task list into four categories based on urgency and importance and offers an essential strategy for getting things done. See below:Urgent & Important; do first — Start by focusing on critical tasks that need to be done today.Not urgent & important; schedule — You will want to schedule tasks that are important but less urgent for a later date.Urgent & not important; delegate — Assign urgent but less important tasks to others on your team.Not urgent & not important; don't do — Is something on your To-Do list not all that important or urgent? Cross it off the list.Utilizing the Eisenhower Matrix is a simple way to help you determine the most important on your weekly or monthly To-Do list and what can be left undone or delegated.Related: 4 Simple Ways to Manage Your Overwhelming To-Do List


4. Categorize your calendar, and block out time for specific tasksWe can generally break our calendars into various distinct categories. For example, we can label specific tasks as administrative and others as managerial or personal/family. Our digital calendars, Google or Apple, offer easy ways to color code or label tasks and events, and this is a simple way to visually.Your calendar should be a reflection of your To-Do-List. Each critical task and work deliverable needs a dedicated time block to empower yourself to accomplish it. Are you expected to review and edit your Board-Presentation? Block dedicated time.Anticipating an emotionally challenging conversation with a report? Schedule it on your Google calendar with 15 minutes of preparation and debriefing time. If you are struggling to follow your exercise routine or missing out on family dinners, block your calendar. Want to spend a few hours with your significant other on Saturday morning before the day's chaos begins? Block out the time on your calendar. Not following this principle will leave you disappointed week after week for not working on your priorities but being directed by external demands.5. Ditch the idea of work-life balance and aim for Work-Life-IntegrationWe often talk about the notion of work-life balance, but there are better ways to conceptualize the balance between work and personal duties. Instead, reframe your time understanding: prioritize establishing a Work/Life-Integration. Stephen Kohler, the CEO and founder of Audira Labs, describes Work-Life integration as such: ""Work-life balance is focused on keeping your work life and your personal life separate, but equal, whereas work-life integration is centered on the belief that there is no distinction between the two and that both must coexist in harmony.""


So what does this look like? You may be scheduled to be on a two-hour conference call that doesn't require your full and undivided attention. You could take this call on a walk in nature or cook while listening.Or, if you work from home, you can break up your day into various segments. Maybe you spend the first two hours of the day preparing your children for school. Then you spend two hours holding virtual meetings and answering emails. Then you take an hour to get in some exercise. In the evening, you may want to spend 30 minutes learning your long-desired new language.All your priorities must be reflected in your calendar, personal and professional. It's all about establishing a healthy relationship between your work and personal life and valuing both aspects.Related: Why Most Entrepreneurs Are Terrible at Time Management (and What to Do Instead)


6. Carve out space for meeting-free ""creative days""While we may feel compelled to fill our schedules with tasks, we must designate spaces in our calendars. Recent studies have shown that a little free time, a space for boredom in your day, is essential. According to Andreas Elpidorou of the University of Louisville, boredom is a ""regulatory state that keeps one in line with one's projects. Without boredom, one would remain trapped in unfulfilling situations and miss out on many emotionally, cognitively, and socially rewarding experiences. Boredom is both a warning that we are not doing what we want to be doing and a 'push' that motivates us to switch goals and projects.""At least once a month, designate a free day to release your mind from all of your to-do's. Allow your mind to wander onto new ideas, projects, and solutions. Give yourself the space to be creative.

103,3 Things I Wish I Knew as a First-Time Airbnb Host,"Apr 21, 2023",Jorge Contreras,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/3-things-i-wish-i-knew-as-a-first-time-airbnb-host/449581,"
In 2017, I purchased a single-family home and listed it on Airbnb as a short-term rental. Several years and additional units later, the venture grew into a full-time business that now gives me around $150,000 per month. I could say I had a good ride.But the journey to this success wasn't smooth. There were many things that I wish I had done differently, especially when I was just starting. And while some might say they're part of the whole experience, I still won't recommend them to anybody.And that is why I want to share the things I wish I had done when I was new to the Airbnb industry. These lessons impacted how I did my business, and if you're starting on your own, these will be helpful for you too. The following are the three things I wish I knew as a first-time Airbnb host:



Related: 10 Pieces of Financial Advice I Wish I Knew in My 20s1. An ""employee mindset"" won't get you far in the businessNow, I don't have anything against employees. They're awesome because they are the foundation of our labor force. I started as an employee myself, and I have a staff who helps me with my business too.


However, if you want to create a flourishing Airbnb business, you don't need the kind of mindset that most employees have. Allow me to explain.When I started my Airbnb business in 2017, my wife and I operated our unit, and we had no trouble doing so. Our profits were more than enough to cover our mortgage for the first three years.However, the struggle started when we decided to do all the cleaning ourselves. At that time, we didn't think it was necessary to hire help because we could always do the cleaning on our own. Plus, we thought it was better not to pay anyone and keep the profits to ourselves. But we couldn't have been more wrong.As days and months went on, we realized that we should have done things differently. We spent so much time cleaning our Airbnb that it was draining. Sometimes we'd be tired from appointments, and we still couldn't rest because we had to clean our unit.


It was then that we knew the business became another 9-to-5 job for us, and we were operating with an employee mindset. We wanted the job done right and to make more money, so we thought we had to do everything ourselves.But this employee mindset didn't get us far, and neither would it be for you. The Airbnb business requires effort, and if you're not careful, it could drain your time away from the most important things you should be focusing on. Instead, I recommend you get people who can make the work easier for you.Don't hesitate to use some of your profits to hire help because, in the long run, you'll benefit more from it. It'll free up your time, and when you have more time, you'll get the chance to focus on growing the business. You can even launch a new Airbnb if you want to!Related: How to Start an Airbnb Business Without Owning Property


2. Delegation is the key to time freedomThis is in the same context as the first lesson I mentioned, but it's so important that it bears repeating.You see, there are three primary operations in the Airbnb business: cleaning, maintenance and communication. Now for your business to thrive, you have to take care of these three areas equally. But this would be extremely difficult, especially if you have more than one unit and you're doing all the operations alone.People will check in and out of your Airbnb, so cleaning and maintenance need to be taken care of regularly. The problem when you're doing those things yourself is that you are trading time for money. This is why you need to delegate those tasks and automate them for your work to be easier.You can hire people to do the cleaning and maintenance for you, create an automated cleaning and maintenance calendar that they will follow, and you're good to go. You can even get a virtual assistant to help you on the communications side.


This is how million-dollar entrepreneurs operate their businesses: by building a team and a system, hiring, delegating, and automating all the operations. And I wish I had known this sooner.3. Collecting a 1099 Form will reduce your taxesThe IRS 1099 Form is a collection of tax forms that you have your subcontractor sign so you can take what you pay them as a tax deduction. This applies to the people you hire to clean, do the maintenance, and do your communications. As long as you pay them $600 or more within the same calendar year, you must collect a 1099 Form from them.This is something that I wish I had known when I was getting started. I didn't know that I needed to collect a 1099 Form, so I ended up paying for money I didn't keep.Now to be fair, no one told me about it then, so I didn't know. But now that you have an idea make sure to implement it to protect your profits so that you won't lose out in the end.

However, no rule says you must make blunders for the sake of experience.Instead, you can learn from those who have already been through the same struggles and learn from their backgrounds. After all, success leaves clues. By learning from the experience of others who have overcome similar struggles, you gain valuable insights and avoid unnecessary pitfalls.So take advantage of the wealth of knowledge available to you, and start building the business of your dreams today.

104,How to Spring Clean Your Life in Just 15 Minutes,"Apr 21, 2023",Kelly Hyman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-spring-clean-your-life-in-just-15-minutes/449598,"
Springtime offers a sense of renewal similar to the start of the new year. However, many use the first three months to figure out what is and isn't working and edit accordingly. It's only after the first quarter that people begin to spring into action and tidy up areas of their life.As you decide how you want your year to go, remember an optimal work-life balance doesn't have to look good for everyone, it just has to look good for you. Rather than wait for the mess of life to spin out of control, here are a few 15-minute tips for spring-cleaning your life and maintaining it throughout the rest of the year.Related: 7 Ways to Make Your Life More Organized and Efficient



Schedule prep on SundayA too-busy schedule can easily lead to burnout and make you less productive and effective overall. Reviewing your calendar before embarking on the work week can save you a lot of time and frustration come Monday. While no one necessarily wants to work over the weekend, think of this as a simple tidying-up task.Set an alarm for 15 minutes to look at your week ahead and make adjustments. This time restriction will prevent you from getting lost down a rabbit hole of emails and calendar invites. Clear out any meetings that can be shortened, rescheduled or eliminated. Add time for a proper meal, daily breaks and transition time between tasks and meetings.


Having an idea of what to expect and prioritizing at least a few minutes for yourself every day will help you feel in control of your schedule and not the other way around.Empty everything unusedIf Sunday is your jumpstart to the week, consider Friday a time to declutter before the weekend. Again, take 15 minutes to declutter your space. This will prevent things from piling up to an overwhelming amount. First, dust your workspace and empty the trash. Take dishes to the sink and wipe down your screens. Then, take a look at your emails and delete or organize them as needed.An overflowing inbox instantly feels overwhelming to tackle, so if yours is out of control, start with 10. Choose ten emails to delete or file away. Doing this more frequently will give you a better idea of what's important to read and save and what's junk. Then, once you've done a quick clean of your desktop, do the same with your fridge.Trash leftovers from the week and expired foods. It's all too easy to shove everything to the back of the refrigerator, where it'll eventually turn rotten and make cleanup a longer, a messier chore. Tidying up your desk space, inbox and refrigerator often feels more ominous than it is. It can be cleaned up quickly, and you'll feel like working from a clean slate come Monday.


Put your to-do list into actionA to-do list can easily become a place for procrastination if not edited and acted upon regularly. Write down all the upcoming appointments and errands you need to do and break them down by week. Tackle one or two at a time rather than trying to handle everything all at once. Prolonging the to-do only makes it much harder to be motivated to take action.Prioritize your list from most to least important tasks. Also, take advantage of time-saving technology to ease your responsibilities. For example, scheduling a telehealth appointment versus planning an in-person doctor's visit. Set up a grocery delivery rather than battling lines at the store. Then, the time saved on your to-dos can be redistributed for ""fun "" tasks, like meeting a friend for coffee, taking a walk around the park or reading a few chapters of a book.To clean up your to-do list, create tasks in the way you'll get them done. Meaning for some, this is adding to a digital calendar. For others, it's physically writing them down and crossing them off as they're completed. Wherever you create and manage your list, make it a place you'll check often and work into your day-to-day rather than think of whenever you have a ""spare moment.""Related: 7 Productivity Tips to Help You Accomplish Your Biggest Goals


Plan for the futureWhile there may be times it feels like keeping your head above water is the most you can manage, it's important also to carve out time to plan for your future. Whether financially, physically or for enjoyment, make an appointment with yourself to go over your goals and interests.It's easy to become solely driven by what others need or expect from us. However, it's not a sustainable way to live a happy life. Planning your future might entail reprioritizing how you spend your time. For instance, if you sit down and spend an hour on social media every evening, maybe reduce it to a half hour to start. Fill in the remaining time by focusing on what matters to you.In our hyper-productive world, taking a few minutes for yourself may feel indulgent and even take some time to get used to. But you might be surprised to find how many small pockets of time there are when spring cleaning your life. A 15-minute effort regularly can make a big lifestyle difference.

105,Work-Life Balance is Possible — And It's Not as Hard to Achieve as You Think,"Apr 17, 2023",Clate Mask,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/work-life-balance-is-easier-to-achieve-than-you-think/449103,"
If you're an entrepreneur, you might see a headline like this and immediately think, ""Good joke."" But I promise this isn't one. I've been a business owner for more than two decades and have learned through much trial and error that the seemingly mythical concept of work-life balance is within closer reach than you might think. Here's how I recommend striking such a balance in your own life.1. Build your emotional capitalEmotional capital is all the skills and abilities that allow you to understand your own emotions and recognize them in others, and function with other people in a sensitive and rewarding manner. It was no mistake that building emotional capital was the first of six steps that my co-founder and I outlined in our book ""Conquer the Chaos"" to help entrepreneurs get out of the chaos of running their businesses. All too often, though, business owners try to suppress or ignore their mental and emotional states. But just as often, this backfires.Think of building your emotional capital like you would actual capital for your business. You can't just will it into existence; you have to plan and execute the plan. There are many ways to do this, and most of us will need to invest in several to reap the benefits. Some examples include hiring a business coach, starting a meditation practice (this doesn't have to be fancy; just browse YouTube for ""guided meditations""), seeing a therapist, working through a conflict with your spouse, and practicing gratitude and self-reflection. The point is to actually plan how you will build your emotional capital and put accountability measures in place to see it through.



Related: Work-Life Balance Is Simple. To Succeed at Work, Get a Life.2. Practice small habits for your healthWhat is nearly every entrepreneur's biggest complaint? Lack of time. So when I suggest you start adding more things into your day (like I just did above) and then tell you that you also need to prioritize your health, you're likely thinking I've never run a business. But I have, for many, many years - which is why I'm qualified to insist that you will run yourself and your business into the ground if you do not put these two priorities first on your list.


The good news is that improving your health doesn't have to be difficult or expensive. You can commit to walking the dog three times a week, and even that will improve your health. Add an apple to your lunch, and you'll get extra nutrients. Take the stairs, not the elevator. Work, even part of the day, at a stand-up desk. How much time do any of these suggestions really take? Not much, if any at all. They just require making new small habits that, over time, reap the rewards for your physical health.3. Be presentOnce you're emotionally and physically in a better place, we can now discuss relationships. Other books and experts may tell you differently, but I believe that presence is one of the keys to every strong marriage, parent/child bond, friendship, coworking relationship, etc. If you give someone your attention, you communicate that they matter.This is why I have learned to leave my cell phone in my car from 6 to 9 p.m. every night. Simply putting it away or telling myself I won't check it doesn't work; I have to physically remove it from my location to ensure I won't become distracted by it. When I do this, I devote my full attention (which includes eye contact and active listening) to my wife and kids. When I don't, I'm only halfway in.The same is true at work. Build mechanisms into your day to ensure you are fully present wherever you are. Being ""all there"" at home gives you the freedom to be ""all there"" at work, and vice versa, because you can be confident you're not shortchanging anyone.


Related: 10 Myths About Work-Life Balance and What to Do Instead4. Automate & DelegateI love entrepreneurs and their hard work and grit. But one thing that frustrates me endlessly is their stubbornness. I write this with love because I've been there too. You crave control and think you need to handle everything in your business, or it won't get done properly. Or, even if you're among the few skilled at delegation, maybe you don't have the budget to hire help.My advice? Invest in technology. There are so many cost-effective solutions out there that can take numerous tasks off your plate. By automating pieces of your sales and marketing, for example, you're gaining time to spend elsewhere (whether in a different area of the business, with your loved ones or in a hobby you've neglected since starting your business). Also, if you can hire someone or even work with a contractor, do it! Removing some responsibilities- and gaining time - are two of the biggest secrets to a healthy work-life balance.Related: Automation Is Becoming a Business Imperative: Don't Wait Until It's Too Late


5. Plan aheadFinally, none of this works if you don't plan ahead. Write down exactly how you intend to tackle each of these areas. Make your intentions small, practical and impactful, and either use technology, visual reminders or the help of a friend to ensure you remain accountable.When you prioritize your work-life balance, you're really prioritizing yourself and your business. Even if it seems like a pipe dream, achieving the balance between your work and your personal life is truly possible if you treat it as a goal, not a wish.

106,5 Ways to Start Healing After a Divorce,"Apr 12, 2023",Rachel S. Ruby,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/the-true-costs-of-divorce-5-ways-to-start-healing-now/448670,"
Divorce can certainly be expensive financially, but no matter how successful the person is, the highest costs are usually emotional and psychological. It is essential to begin the healing process to avoid snowball effects upon physical and mental health, business decisions and the genuine ability to show up and proficiently run your life and business.Getting through a divorce involves rewiring the body, mind and spirit; the deep work is personal and requires effort before differences can be felt and seen. There is no set time frame for the work, and it often involves guidance, but it usually gets easier with time and commitment.Here are five ways to begin the healing journey and create a new life after divorce.



1. Put yourself firstWhether you are good at putting yourself first or not, this tool may feel different when related to divorce. Since divorce is a trauma, it can come with many feelings, like sadness, regret, anger, frustration and even anxiety or depression. When lawyers are involved, these feelings can be magnified if the split becomes contentious.During this time, it is imperative to make time for yourself, away from work and responsibilities. This can be as simple as waking up 20 minutes early to meditate, go on a run, take a walk in nature or whatever makes you feel grounded. Learn to spend this ""me"" time alone, without a phone or electronic devices, to establish and deepen feelings of self-love.


Do not fear being alone, as it genuinely allows tuning into feelings and sensations to get to know yourself and create your new life. By making an effort to take time for yourself to grow and heal, the personal costs stirred by emotions and your mental state will be minimized.Related: 4 Tips for Entrepreneurial Survival During the Grieving Process2. Let goLetting go is diving deep into whether negativity is blocking one's ability to live the best life. By surrendering the connection with people, beliefs, ideals and behaviors that do not elevate personal happiness, we can focus our choices on creating a more fulfilling life.This involves tweaking the mindset to understand that culture, religion and society often negatively portray divorce and that we do not have to subscribe to these beliefs. It is important to recognize that many of these false ""truths"" have been ingrained into our own belief systems since we were children.


True happiness means not focusing on how others or the ""rules"" dictate how life should be lived but instead learning to trust what comes from the heart. Once we learn to be governed by our own intuition and desires, we lessen the costs of divorce in multiple ways.Related: The Pandemic Induced Higher Divorce Rates. Here's What it Can Do to Your Finances3. Support networksAlthough many of us feel we can figure everything out by ourselves, the fact is that support systems are a basic necessity to existence, especially during divorce. Finding the right people on which to rely is paramount to happiness, allows for successful healing and lessens the non-financial costs of divorce by helping to boost the inner strength and focus on the self. However, often humans have the wrong people in their support networks, so a big part of the journey is discovering which people will lift you and celebrate your decisions instead of telling you how they believe your life should be lived.Granted, there are always people who want to offer support but may not see things in a positive light, and some who are incapable of letting others make their own decisions (such as family members who come from older generational mindsets), but it IS possible to keep these people in the support network as long as boundaries are set. The key is finding like-minded people to form the backbone of your support team.


4. ForgivenessWhen most people think of forgiveness in divorce, it involves forgiving an ex- or soon-to-be ex-spouse, which is necessary to prevent falling into a victim state, full of blame and shame. The victim mindset brings our energy and self-worth down and thus is a high cost of divorce. It cannot promote healing because thoughts are controlled by negative perceptions and emotions instead of positive ones.The other aspect of forgiveness comes from forgiving the self, which tends to be more difficult. Part of this work involves letting go, as discussed above; it is important to understand that we are not bad, wrong or immoral for getting divorced. Not only is forgiving oneself an act of self-love, but it helps prevent undesirable emotional and psychological tolls and leads instead to personal growth.Related: Why Forgiveness Plays a Huge Role in Stress Reduction5. Take care of your bodyOur bodies are our temples, and although we've all heard and understand this concept, it is especially true when it comes to getting through divorce. Many studies show trauma can affect bodies physically and mentally/emotionally. These problems can exacerbate disease, pain and other health complications, so staying healthy and exercising during the difficult times, even when it feels impossible to motivate, is a necessary part of healing. Staying healthy also prevents the non-financial costs of divorce from piling up, enabling the discovery of a blissful new life.


Addiction is also heightened when dealing with divorce, making it necessary to curb habits like drinking, binge eating or taking drugs to alleviate emotions that may be difficult to control. Finding time to ground oneself and make healthy choices not only keeps our bodies clean but also affects our mental state and the spirit — our inner compass. These steps to good health can provide clarity toward creating a new life post-divorce; what we imagine is easier to achieve.The ideas mentioned in this article encompass only part of the divorce healing process, and there are many other tools to utilize. The most important concept is to understand that finding a new life and happiness after divorce IS possible by committing to healing, thereby preventing the personal costs of divorce from escalating. With a little guidance, there is no limit to what can be achieved.

107,6 Ways to Build Unshakeable Business Confidence,"Apr 10, 2023",Jason Hennessey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/6-ways-to-build-unshakeable-business-confidence/448568,"
Strangely enough, turns out that an improv class made me a better leader, and I don't mean in terms of kicking off a new acting career (even though I do live in Los Angeles). No, the class actually made me a better leader in business. While on the surface this may seem like an unorthodox approach to building executive skills, it has proven to be one of the best investments I've ever made in self-confidence.Much leadership training refers to improving confidence, but little addresses what it takes to truly build the unshakeable variety — the type that isn't afraid to be wrong, to be silly and to go against the grain.Here are a few steps on my journey to finding it.



1. Yes, take that improv classThis instructional setting has a way of putting one on the spot — a nerve-wracking proposition for a lot of people. But, as a business owner, there are going to be times when you need to think on your feet, apply instant creativity and step outside your comfort zone.That's what makes these exercises perfect. I've been taking them for years now and can attest that they truly put confidence to the test. Being put on the spot in this way pushes you to think faster and become wittier, not only in terms of humor but also in business acumen. You're encouraged to share bold ideas and lean into potentially embarrassing situations.

Team sportsMulti-player competitions like softball, basketball, volleyball and soccer force you to be an active participant in a group, striving toward a common goal (pun intended). And with many, you're presented with opportunities to exercise confidence as well, including learning new skills, trying new positions and stepping into leadership roles. In the process, you become versed in trying new things and pushing yourself beyond your usual capabilities. Plus, there are benefits of physical activity.Related: 4 Scientific Reasons Exercising Is an Entrepreneur's Biggest Competitive Advantage3. Start a networking groupMany of us are seasoned attendees of networking events, but few of us have hosted them ourselves. The logistics and dynamics of bringing strangers together can be challenging, but that's exactly what makes it a great confidence-building activity.


Not only does hosting a networking event teach you the fundamentals of associated planning, recruitment, marketing and communication, but it also pushes you to facilitate conversations with others. You're no longer a passive attendee, but the ringleader in helping people find common ground, connecting them and forming partnerships.Starting such an event can be as simple as bringing like-minded entrepreneurs together for happy hour, to as complex as hosting a full-bore professional conference. Regardless, the accomplishment and confidence you'll feel after pulling it together will be well worth the effort.Related: 5 Proven Tools for Developing Strong Relationships as an Entrepreneur4. VolunteerUnshakeable confidence requires putting ego aside to make the best decisions for a company, and volunteering is a great way to transcend ego to benefit a cause. Whether it's serving meals at an adult shelter, playing games at a senior living facility or picking up trash on the side of the road, volunteering challenges us to put our superficial interests aside and strive toward a higher purpose.


So, consider reaching out to local or online organizations to find out how you might be able to contribute. The returns will be immeasurable: You will be helping to support both the immediate (and by extension, perhaps global) community, but also learn valuable skills (not least compassion, dedication and grit) that apply equally to business.Related: Volunteer to Help Those in Need -- and Become a Better Entrepreneur5. Regard failure as an opportunityMany of us strive for perfection, but of course, this is not usually an achievable goal and runs the risk of burnout and/or simply being bummed out. Some degree of failure is inevitable, so practice repurposing the resulting energy into something positive. ""Failing forward"" helps reposition your mindset to see the positive aspects of not achieving what you initially wanted, and is frequently required to pivot from a goal that doesn't serve you.All this takes practice. So fail forward, fall and nurse your bruises, but get back up. And while you're doing that, look around: What is this situation trying to tell you and what opportunities might be right around the corner?


6. Invest in personal coachingProper coaching can help exercise that confidence muscle — make it easier to stand firm in decision-making and become an all-around better communicator. A good coach will look at things objectively, give you direct and constructive feedback and help you work through insecurities.Approach people who inspire you (I found my first coach after watching his TED Talk). Put together a list, meet with them and determine who's a good fit. And if you are short on cash, reading books by business heroes can be of immeasurable value.Related: 4 Ways to Send Your Perfectionism PackingThere is no single key to unshakeable confidence. Rather, it's a continuous practice of being uncomfortable, pushing past ego and overcoming failure. This is the philosophy that empowers you to rise above the rest and become the best leader possible. And it's a skill to be practiced, not perfected. Setting the intention to build such confidence is the most important step. To achieve anything takes commitment, determination and perseverance. It's up to you!

108,5 Ways ChatGPT Is Empowering People with Disabilities,"Apr 7, 2023",Devan Leos,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/5-ways-chatgpt-is-empowering-people-with-disabilities/448551,"
Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming our world in myriad ways, and one of its most significant impacts is on the lives of people with disabilities. AI-driven programs like ChatGPT are helping to bridge communication gaps, facilitate access to information and foster independence for individuals with various impairments.While AI has many applications, today we will explore five ways AI is capable of helping people who disabilities may hinder work more efficiently and comfortably.Related: What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? Here Are Its Benefits, Uses and More



1. Cognitive enhancementAs someone who was diagnosed with ADD as a child, I have found AI to be a great tool for staying organized. For individuals with cognitive impairments, memory loss or conditions like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), staying organized and remembering essential tasks can be a daily struggle. In these instances, artificial intelligence, particularly AI programs like ChatGPT, can serve as a valuable and personalized assistant. Some of the ways I have personally used ChatGPT that have personally helped me are:Customizable reminders: ChatGPT can be programmed to deliver personalized reminders for a wide range of essential tasks, such as taking medication, attending appointments, or completing daily chores. By tailoring these reminders to each user's specific needs and preferences, AI-driven chatbots can help users better manage their schedules and responsibilities.Motivation and encouragement: In addition to providing practical organizational support, ChatGPT can be set up also to offer motivational messages and encouragement to users as they work towards their goals. This emotional support can be invaluable in helping individuals overcome challenges and stay committed to their personal growth and development.Routine establishment: Establishing routines can be critical for individuals with cognitive impairments, as routines can provide structure and stability. ChatGPT can assist users in developing and maintaining daily, weekly or monthly routines, offering guidance and support to help them adapt to new habits and stay on track.Related: What Does ChatGPT Mean for the Future of Business?2. Enhancing communicationCommunication is essential for everyone, and AI chatbots like ChatGPT can significantly improve it for people with hearing or speech impairments. By converting speech to text and vice versa, these chatbots enable seamless communication, allowing users to engage in conversations with ease and participate in social interactions they might have otherwise found challenging.Various disabilities may hinder one's ability to communicate how they want to. However, GPT 4 is now available to the public and streamlining effective communication just got easier for everyone. People across multiple categories may have difficulty speaking, communicating effectively or expressing themselves properly.


However, with the assistance of AI, disabled people can utilize GPT4 to help them communicate more effectively, provide clarity and offer communicative insights that help disabled people efficiently express themselves and their ideas with ease.3. Reading and writing assistanceAI chatbots can make reading and writing more accessible for individuals with visual impairments, dyslexia or fine motor skill difficulties. By reading aloud text-based content or providing writing suggestions, ChatGPT can help users compose emails, essays and other documents with greater ease and efficiency.It is well known that AI is also a great writing tool and thus can help disabled people write easier. While some argue that AI is taking jobs away, some might see it as an opportunity to create more job opportunities for disadvantaged and marginalized people. As a business owner diagnosed with ADD, I can say that using AI has helped me with proofreading, spelling and writing.Related: Employers Need Workers. Now They're Realizing The Untapped Talent of These People.


4. Personal reminders and organizational supportAI can be a valuable assistant for those with cognitive impairments or memory loss. ChatGPT can be programmed to remind users of essential tasks, such as taking medication, attending appointments or completing daily chores.This support can be instrumental in helping users maintain their daily routines and stay organized. Isolation and loneliness can be significant issues for people with disabilities, especially those with mobility or communication challenges.GPT-based AI technology can provide companionship through conversation, offering a listening ear and comforting responses. This interaction can be a source of solace and help alleviate feelings of isolation.Related: Unlock the Powerful Gifts Your Disability Taught You About Being a Better Leader


5. Supporting education and learningAI-driven programs can play a vital role in helping students with disabilities access education. By answering questions, providing explanations and offering alternative learning materials, ChatGPT can serve as an invaluable resource for learners who may require additional support or accommodations. Everybody learns differently, and as someone who has personally faced the challenges of a learning disability, I can affirm that the way I process information is different.AI can assist as a resource of information, and GPT4 can break down information in different ways, depending on what is asked of it. For instance, you could ask chat GPT to help explain an idea or curriculum to somebody who has a learning disability in a specific way, or educators could use a guy to come up with creative ways to help people with learning disabilities excel.Artificial intelligence programs like ChatGPT can make a remarkable difference in the lives of individuals with disabilities (Myself included). By empowering people with enhanced communication, greater independence, and increased access to essential information and resources, AI is breaking down barriers and opening up new possibilities for those who may have previously faced significant challenges.As we embrace AI technology and continue to explore its vast potential, we must remain committed to developing inclusive and accessible solutions that can help all members of our society thrive. By doing so, we can work together to create a more equitable and connected world where everyone has the opportunity to succeed, regardless of their abilities.


One great way to think about the current capabilities of AI is instead of comparing it to a search engine, think about something like ChatGPT as a thinking engine, where instead of it merely being a means to discover and search for data, it is also a technology that allows users to search for ways to think. AI isn't perfect, but it certainly has positive use cases that have the potential to help those in need greatly.

109,A Former FBI Kidnapping Negotiator Shares His Best Tips for Leveling Up Your Negotiation Game,"Apr 4, 2023",Randy Garn,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/a-hostage-negotiators-best-tips-for-winning/447384,"
How are your negotiation skills? I'd expect most of us, if answering truthfully, would say either ""subpar"" or ""seriously lacking."" And this is completely understandable: Negotiation is tough and often uncomfortable, but (almost) always pivotal. It bleeds into seemingly every element of our lives — and is an imperative life hack if we want to improve the outcome of… just about anything.Most people are poor negotiators simply because that skill has not been modeled for them well, if at all. The good news is that it's both an art and skill that can be learned, just like public speaking, creative thinking or even a pretty golf swing…especially if you have a good teacher.Fortunately, I have the best in the business.



Recently, I sat down with a good friend, Chris Voss. As the former lead international kidnapping negotiator for the FBI and its hostage negotiation representative for the National Security Council's Hostage Working Group, he has honed this ability to a fine edge. Perhaps you've seen his MasterClass, ""The Art of Negotiating,"" or heard of his business The Black Swan Group, which teaches the art of negotiation in business. You might have even seen the recently released film, Tactical Empathy, a documentary biopic on Voss that highlights the importance of understanding any individuals you're negotiating with.Harnessing this wealth of experience, we discussed key concepts that will help anyone improve in this vital capability.Related: 4 Things to Do When You're in a NegotiationWhy do most negotiations fail?We've all been a part of failed negotiations. These can be of minor importance or high-stakes and high-pressure. I asked Voss why so many seem to fall through. He offered three main reasons.""First, we fail to gather information,"" he says. ""We go in firing, ready to talk, convince and present, [when] we really should go in and ask questions, gather important information and set proper expectations.""Voss also mentioned the importance of ""high anchoring."" The term refers to ""…drawing our attention to the positive qualities of the item or individual being discussed, as in the case of a salary negotiation,"" he says, adding that we tend to provide high anchors before understanding terms or conditions. This can be detrimental to the shape of a negotiation moving forward.


The final reason Voss gave for why negotiations fail had to do with basic misunderstanding — the tendency for both parties to fail to fully appreciate one another.""Most of the time, we think we failed as communicators and explainers,"" he says, ""but that's rarely the issue. You need to ensure that both parties are being understood and can do this through summarizing and asking clarifying questions.""Related: 3 Mindsets That Will Ensure the Upper Hand in Any NegotiationThe three types of negotiatorsVoss and I also talked about how to become a better negotiator on the back end, and in exploring that he outlined three major personality categories: ""Aggressive,"" ""Analyst"" and ""Ambassador,"" and why it's critical to identify which type you are.


""The aggressive types don't ask questions,"" he says. ""They typically talk first. They're great at establishing where they stand but typically fail to create understanding, strategize or create good relationships. The analyst never wants to be surprised. They do their research: Some may take weeks to research and plan to be 10 steps ahead, and that's about seven steps too many. The problem with that approach is that we're dealing with human beings who get scared, change their minds and act emotionally.""""The ambassador, meanwhile, is great with relationships,"" Voss continues. ""They're hopeful and optimistic but are bad with details. They get a 'Yes' and think the paperwork has already been signed.""I followed up by asking which of the three types was preferred, as well as how to remedy their respective weaknesses. Voss's response surprised me.""It's not about remedying anything,"" he says. ""It's about adding on to what you already are. Each type has characteristics that are both essential and inadequate.
